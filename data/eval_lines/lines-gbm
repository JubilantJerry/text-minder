They have their way.
Forgive me.
You're a stranger here.
Would you be from Nazareth?
Why do you ask?
I thought you might be the one...
The one that I have come back from my country to find.
He would be about your age.
Who?
When I find Him I shall know Him.
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.
Sack of flesh without brains!
No!
No!
Not the whip!
That is my host.
Gently!
Gently!
Fool!
Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood.
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run!
Go on!
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!
Beautiful horses.
Now!
Now!
They are ready!
Let them go!
Watch.
They'll never hold the turn.
No!
No!
Abadon, stop him!
Stop that whip!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill...!
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!
You think you can treat my horses like animals?
!
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!
Get off, idiot!
Drive goats, not horses!
I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.
Not a team?
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.
- Antares.
- The slow one?
He should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?
In the circus in Rome.
You have driven in the great circus?
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.
No other animal has descended so in scale from the first innocent falling of the world.
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.
Yes.
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.
Your coming here was so fit, so right.
We might have achieved wonders!
You have to go.
I make a journey which will not wait.
Ah, well, then perhaps you will come back.
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.
I have no wives.
No wives at all?
I have six, no, seven.
I've counted eight.
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.
- Someday, I hope to have one.
- One wife!
One God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.
It is not generous.
- Was the food not to your liking?
- Indeed.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.
And now I must say good night to my beauties.
When ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.
- I'll make my farewells then.
- No, no, no, stay.
Stay and see them.
Come, my children.
Come.
Strangers make them shy.
Come.
Come, do not be afraid.
Come.
There, my children.
They are descended from the Arabians of the Pharaohs and I have named them for the stars.
Come, Antares.
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.
What?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.
Come, Rigel.
We've both supped well, and the world is good.
There's my good Rigel.
Yes, you are ready for sleep.
The day's work done for you, eh?
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.
Good night.
Good night, my treasure.
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.
No.
You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.
You should see their mother, Mira.
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.
All right, all right.
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.
You must be strong and swift.
Go, my children.
Go.
At Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams and the champion of the East, Messala, with his black devils.
He stops at nothing to win.
- Messala?
In the circus?
- Yes.
You knew him?
I know him.
Perhaps without much liking.
My people are praying for a man to drive their team to victory over Messala.
You could be that man, the one to stamp his arrogance into the sand.
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.
It's not possible.
That is a pity.
Think of it.
To break his pride to humble this tribune before the very people he has degraded.
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!
I know it is not possible.
Does it not delight your imagination?
Does it not answer your purpose?
I must deal with Messala in my own way.
And your way is to kill him.
I see this terrible thing in your eyes.
But no matter what this man has done, you have no right to kill him.
He will be punished inevitably.
I don't believe in miracles.
But all life is a miracle.
Why will you not accept God's judgment?
You do not believe in miracles.
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness and a star led me to a village called Bethlehem where I found a newborn child in a manger.
And God lived in this child.
By now, He is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.
That is why I have returned here so that I may be at hand when He comes among us.
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.
Perhaps He's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.
Perhaps He is a shepherd a merchant, a fisherman.
But He lives and all our lives from now on will carry His mark.
There are many paths to God, my son.
I hope yours will not be too difficult.
I'm ready for sleep.
Balthasar is a good man but until all men are like him, we must keep our swords bright.
And our intention true.
So I must leave you.
One last thought.
There is no law in the arena.
Many are killed.
I hope to see you again.
Fine Damascus silk.
Fine Damascus silk.
Esther?
It's Judah.
You are alive.
You are alive.
What are you doing here?
What has happened?
I'm here.
I'm with you.
Where's your father?
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.
They tortured him.
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.
You never went back to Antioch?
No.
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.
Where are my mother and sister?
Let me tell him first.
Father.
Father, something wonderful has happened.
Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
He has come home.
He is here.
Judah.
Judah Ben-Hur.
My dear old friend.
Let me look at you.
Let me see you.
Yes, yes.
It is true.
Praise God for His mercy.
Where are they?
Since that terrible day there has been no word of them.
You should have been less loyal.
Do not pity me, Master Judah.
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.
We were released on the same day.
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.
Since then, I have been his tongue and he has been my legs.
Together, we make a considerable man.
Old friend.
She always said you would return.
She never gave up hope.
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.
I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.
But suppose that isn't possible.
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.
They could not make me tell them where it is.
It is there still to put power into our hands and buy death for the Romans.
That's not why I came back.
Judah, they are dead.
Four years.
No one could live so long in the dungeons.
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?
Yes, it is true.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You have come back to us like a returning faith.
Judah, I should like to laugh again.
- Let us laugh.
- We will.
There will be joy again in this house.
We will celebrate among the dust.
I will take him.
We stood here before.
A long while ago.
Four years.
But now it seems as if only yesterday...
I was saying:
"If you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye."
"If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said."
I am not a bride.
Why did you never marry?
My father needed me.
And also...
It's still on my finger.
I said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.
It's become a part of my hand.
If Messala once knew you were here...
As he must.
He will know where they are.
And if you should find...?
- If he says they're dead...
- Messala will wish they were living.
I've seen too much of what hate can do.
My father is burned up with it.
But I've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater and love more powerful than hatred.
I believe it.
- Esther.
- Judah.
Stay alive.
Keep away from Messala.
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.
That time isn't yet come.
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.
This time you will be destroyed.
You'll die.
Tribune, compliments of Quintus Arrius.
He awaits your pleasure.
- Consul here?
- Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.
Thank him.
Bring him to me.
- I didn't know the consul had a son.
- He's a champion of the great circus.
Why is he presenting me with gifts?
- Perhaps he'll race against you.
- Look.
It's magnificent.
And from a man I've never met.
You're wrong, Messala.
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?
You were the magician, Messala.
You condemned me to the galleys.
When my ship was sunk, I saved the consul's life.
You know his seal?
Now I have come back as I swore I would.
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.
You suggest I use it on myself?
What has become of my mother and my sister?
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.
Find them, Messala.
Restore them to me, and I'll forget what I vowed with every stroke of that oar you chained me to.
I am not the governor.
I can do nothing without approval.
Then get it.
I will come back tomorrow.
Don't disappoint me, Messala.
What became of them?
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?
Go to the citadel, Drusus.
Find out.
- And if they're dead?
- They're dead!
"Miriam, wife.
Tirzah, daughter."
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?
E section lower level.
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.
Water.
Water.
Let me out!
- How long since you've seen them?
- Never.
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.
The food disappears.
Lepers.
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.
Then we'll burn out the cell.
Is someone there?
There is someone there.
Who are you?
Don't come any closer.
Who are you?
Esther.
It's Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam?
Stay where you are.
You have come home.
Stand back, Esther.
We are lepers.
Oh, Esther.
Tirzah.
Esther is Judah living?
Yes, he is alive.
He is here.
Where?
He is searching for you now.
I must find him and tell him.
- No!
- Tell my father.
No.
Tell no one.
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.
We won't return.
Judah has to be told.
No.
Please.
I couldn't see his face.
Is it changed?
No, he is not changed.
He's not changed.
You love him, Esther.
Promise me on your love for him you will never tell him you've seen us.
Is he never to know?
Let him remember us as we were.
Promise me.
There's nothing else I can hope for.
Only this.
I promise.
I am content.
Wait.
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.
I pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.
He'll free them.
He wants to survive.
He cannot free them, Judah.
What do you mean?
I saw them.
You saw them?
Where?
When did you see them?
They were dead.
They were dead.
When?
When?
When?
!
In the prison.
When I was waiting for news of my father.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't tell you.
Nor even you, Father.
I was afraid that if you saw Messala...
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.
It's over now.
Over?
- Judah.
- Over?
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.
Gentlemen.
Officers.
Defenders of great Rome's imperium may I enter?
Certainly, sheik.
You do us an unexpected honor.
The noble tribune is most gracious.
And now the question you're asking:
Why am I here?
As you know, I am a gambling man.
The games approach.
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.
I will back my own poor horses.
No limits?
- Mark me first!
- And me!
- What odds?
- A moment, please my lords, protectors of the far flung marshes.
May I first sit down?
Sit.
How much will you wager?
- Yes, let's call his game.
- Give the Arab a seat.
A bench, quickly.
Thank you.
- Now.
- 1000 denarii.
- 2000!
- Mark me!
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient.
There is time.
First gentlemen, the odds.
The tribune has won many times.
The odds should be in the same measure.
What is your pleasure, gentlemen?
Two to one.
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth where is the courage that made Rome master of the world?
I can get better odds on any street market.
Three to one.
Let us not haggle.
Let us be fair.
In four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.
- In all truth...
- Just a moment.
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.
The Prince of Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur.
Prince of Hur?
- He was sent to the galleys years ago.
- He has returned.
Returned?
Lmpossible.
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.
Well?
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.
You, tribune will you give me four to one?
Four to one.
Good.
Four to one, sheik.
The difference between a Roman and a Jew.
Or an Arab.
Bravely spoken.
Now we will settle the amount of our wager.
I will venture...
A thousand talents?
- A thousand talents?
- Yes, a thousand talents.
Of course, if it is too much...
A thousand talents it will be.
Agreed.
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.
You're good fellows.
If only men were this good.
Remember, Altair nine times around the circus.
Aldebaran.
Rigel, did you hear?
Nine lives to live.
My swift fellow.
You must not win the race the first time around.
You win the last time around.
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.
Steady Antares.
Like a rock.
You will be our anchor.
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.
They have taken me into their family.
Rest well, my stars.
Tomorrow we go up to the city.
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it the news will scorch the streets of the Roman world.
Pontius Pilate here?
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.
You will make him see what men are born in this land.
I only know that I race against Messala.
Look for the yoke.
Ease that strap.
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.
Into Your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as You will.
The Star of David.
To shine out for your people and my people together and blind the eyes of Rome.
They are ready.
Easy, girl, easy.
Number five.
Where is number five?
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.
Yes, this is the day.
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.
Hail, Jupiter.
Give me victory.
Watch your line!
Keep your places!
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.
Citizens I welcome you to these games in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.
We dedicate them to his glory and to the glory of Rome of which you are all part.
Let us honor those who race for us today.
They come here from Alexandria Messina Carthage Cyprus Rome Corinth Athens Phrygia and Judea.
To the best of these, a crown of victory.
The race begins.
Hail, Caesar!
Come, my children, come!
The Roman pig!
Salute.
A great victory.
You are the people's one true god for the time being.
Permit us to worship.
I crown their god.
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.
A long life, young Arrius and the good sense to live it.
We cannot wait, tribune.
He will come.
He will...
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.
He will come!
He will come.
I've sent for him, and he will come.
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.
Do you understand?
To hack the legs off me?
Not yet.
Not till I've seen him.
I don't receive him with half a body.
No!
I told you, Drusus.
I told you.
Here he is.
Triumph complete, Judah.
The race won.
The enemy destroyed.
I see no enemy.
What do you think you see?
The smashed body of a wretched animal?
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.
Let me help you.
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.
Dead.
And the race over.
It isn't over, Judah.
They're not dead.
Where are they?
Where are they?
Look for them in the Valley of the Lepers if you can recognize them.
It goes on.
It goes on, Judah.
The race...
The race is not over.
Is there a way down here?
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.
Man.
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.
There are many women.
Of the family of Hur.
We have no names here.
For them?
- Why did you say they were dead?
- It was what they wanted.
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?
Not to see them?
They are coming.
Love them in the way they must need to be loved.
Not to look at them.
Let them be as if you had never come here.
Please!
Is Judah well?
Is he happy?
Yes, he is well.
Your mind can be at rest for him.
He is well, Miriam.
God be with you.
They have gone.
We can go back.
Go back to what?
Judah, they have one blessing left.
To think you remember them as they were and live your own life.
Forget what is here.
Forget?
It's as though they're alive in a grave.
- But what can you do?
- Undo what you've done.
How could you have suffered them to come here?
I must see them.
No, Judah, please!
Judah!
Think, Judah, think.
It would tear them apart if they see you.
He is here.
I have found Him.
The child has become a man.
And the man, I know it now, is the Son of God.
The promise is true.
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.
Life has been answered.
God has answered it.
Come.
Come with me.
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys thirst had nearly killed me.
A man gave me water to drink.
I went on living.
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.
No.
I am thirsty still.
Come and listen.
I have business with Rome.
You insist on death.
Goodbye, Judah.
You sent for me?
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.
- I honor him.
- As you may honor yourself.
You have been made a citizen of Rome.
Do you say nothing to this?
I have just come from the Valley of Stone where my mother and sister live what's left of their lives.
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.
I have heard this.
There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.
Where there is greatness, great government or power even great feeling or compassion error also is great.
We progress and mature by fault.
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.
There are other voices.
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place not to crucify yourself on a shadow such as old resentment or impossible loyalties.
Perfect freedom has no existence.
A grown man knows the world he lives in.
And for the present, the world is Rome.
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.
I am Judah Ben-Hur.
I cross this floor in spoken friendship as I would speak to Arrius.
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar ready to crush those who challenge his authority.
There are too many men of envy and ambition who try to disrupt the government of Rome.
You have become the victor and hero to those people.
They look to you, their one true god, as I call you.
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.
I am already part of this tragedy.
Return this to Arrius.
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you from personal disaster if you stay here.
You are too great a danger.
Leave Judea.
You have my word.
I was afraid you would never come back afraid of what would happen to you.
But I see you again.
Your father's waiting for me.
Where is he?
What do you mean to do?
Rest, sleep.
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.
Peace?
Love and peace.
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?
Where do you see them?
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.
Balthasar's word.
He is more than Balthasar's word.
His voiced traveled with such a still purpose.
It was more than a voice.
A man more than a man.
He said, "Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God."
Children of God?
In that dead valley where we left them?
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean until we have scoured off our bodies the crust and filth of being at the mercy of tyranny.
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.
- In blood?
- Yes, in blood!
I know there is a law in life.
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.
Death generates death as the vulture breeds the vulture.
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:
"Love your enemy.
Do good to those who despitefully use you."
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.
As you make us do now.
Are we to bear nothing together?
Even love?
I can hardly draw breath without feeling you in my heart.
But I know that everything I do from this moment bears greater pain than you have ever suffered.
It is better not to love me.
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy giving evil for evil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.
It's as though you had become Messala.
I've lost you, Judah.
No further.
What are you doing here?
I was here last evening waiting for you.
I have waited all night.
What has happened?
Where is Tirzah?
Leave the food.
I am coming closer.
Don't be afraid.
- What are you doing?
- Don't be afraid.
I've heard Him again, the man from Nazareth.
If ever words were from God, they are in everything He says.
I cannot bear that you should have never known this hand of quiet reaching towards us.
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find Him there.
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find Him.
Tirzah is dying.
Leave the food and go.
It's Judah.
Why did you tell him?
Yes, Judah, yes.
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.
Mother.
Wait, Mother, wait.
Let me talk with you.
Please.
No, no further.
Please.
No, Judah.
Son, no.
Mother, let me see Tirzah.
Tirzah is dying.
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know that life is everlasting and death is nothing to fear if you have faith.
I will take them to Him.
No!
God, no!
No, no, dear son.
Mother where is Tirzah?
Judah, no.
Judah, no.
You must not go to her, dear son.
Please.
Dear son.
I am afraid.
No cause.
The world is more than we know.
Tirzah, it's Judah.
No, Judah.
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
- Why are the streets deserted?
- They have gone to the trial.
Trial?
Whose trial?
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.
- This cannot be true.
- Alms?
What has he done?
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.
Help for the blind.
- Look, lepers!
- Lepers!
Get away!
Stay away!
Go away!
Lepers!
Lepers!
How can this be?
I know this man.
Will someone help Him?
Take pity on Him.
Have mercy.
In His pain this look of peace.
Watch over them, Esther.
We must go back.
I brought you here to this when I hoped...
You haven't failed, Esther.
Hail King of the Jews!
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.
He gave me water and a heart to live.
What has He done to merit this?
He has taken the world of our sins onto Himself.
To this end He said He was born in that stable where I first saw Him.
For this cause, He came into the world.
For this death?
This beginning.
I have lived too long.
As though He were carrying in that cross the pain of the world.
So fearful, and yet why is it I'm not afraid anymore?
The shadow of a storm.
A strange darkness but still day.
His life is over.
What is it?
This tearing.
I am in pain.
I feel it too.
Do you see your hand?
Almost at the moment He died i heard Him say, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do."
Even then.
Even then.
And i felt His voice take the sword out of my hand.
In the year of our Lord Judea, for nearly a century, had lain under the mastery of Rome.
In the seventh year of the reign of Augustus Caesar an imperial decree ordered every Judean each to return to his place of birth to be counted and taxed.
Converging ways of many of them led to their capital city, Jerusalem the troubled heart of their land.
The old city was dominated by the fortress of Antonia the seat of Roman power and by the great golden temple the outward sign of an inward and imperishable faith.
Even while they obeyed the will of Caesar the people clung proudly to their ancient heritage always remembering the promise of their prophets that one day there would be born among them a redeemer to bring them salvation and perfect freedom.
You'll be counted at Hebron.
- Name?
- Samuel.
- What city?
- Joppa.
- What family?
- Michael.
- Move on.
Move on.
- Yes.
- Name?
- Joseph.
- What city?
- Nazareth.
- What family?
- David of Bethlehem.
And the woman?
My wife.
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.
Come on, come on.
What village is this?
Nazareth.
We should arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow night.
You're not watching the soldiers, Joseph?
We've seen Romans before.
Yes and we will see them again.
My table is not finished.
Where is your son?
He's walking in the hills.
He neglects his work, Joseph.
No.
Once, I reproached him with forgetting his work.
He said to me:
"l must be about my father's business."
Then why isn't he here, working?
He's working.
Trumpeters of the legion!
Welcome, Messala.
The command is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for relieving me.
Drusus when I was a boy, I dreamed of commanding this garrison.
Now the wheel has turned.
I am in command.
Attention!
Aisle one, face right!
Forward!
I'd forgotten the heat.
If it were only the heat.
I lived here until I was 14.
Jerusalem was my home.
- My father was head of...
- Yes, I know.
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.
If there can be such a thing in this forsaken land.
If you want to rise, Sextus, do the difficult.
I asked to be sent here.
You'll find the people changed since you were a boy.
In what way?
Oh, won't pay their taxes, an irrational resentment of Rome...
There's nothing new in all that.
And then there's religion. I tell you, they're drunk with religion.
They smash the statues of our gods, even those of the emperor.
Punish them.
We do.
When we can find them.
Find the leaders.
You don't know.
There's nothing you can put your finger on.
There are strange forces at work here.
This "messiah" business... I know.
There was one predicted when I was a boy.
A king of the Jews, who will lead them into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.
Makes your head spin.
There's a wild man in the desert named John who drowns people in water.
And a carpenter's son who does magic tricks. "Miracles" they call them.
There's always a rabble-rouser stirring up trouble.
No, no, no.
This man is different.
He teaches that God is near, in every man.
It's actually quite profound, some of it.
You've been too long away from Rome.
Go back, Sextus.
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea and forget that God is in every man.
- There is divinity in only one man.
- Yes, I know.
The emperor is displeased.
He wishes Judea made into a more obedient and disciplined province.
He's ordered me to restore order.
I shall carry out his wishes.
How?
You can break a man's skull, arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.
But how do you control this?
How do you fight an idea?
Especially a new idea.
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.
I assume he has a name.
- He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
- Then treat him like one!
Tell him I will join him.
Yes, tribune.
Centurion!
This was his country before it was ours.
Don't forget that.
Yes, tribune.
Very wise.
This Ben-Hur is the richest man in Jerusalem.
And the head of one of the greatest families in Judea.
We were friends as boys.
We were like brothers.
Sextus you ask how to fight an idea.
Well, I'll tell you how.
With another idea.
I said I'd come back.
I never thought you would.
I'm so glad.
- Look at you.
- Look at you!
You've come back a tribune.
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.
We'll drink another now.
- Your sister and mother?
- They're fine.
They've talked of you ever since we knew you were coming.
- ls Tirzah married?
- No.
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.
She's been in love with you since she was 5.
I can't wait to see them.
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?
Or have you become too dignified?
- Down Eros, up Mars!
- Down Eros, up Mars!
Where the beams cross?
Good.
After all these years!
Still close.
In every way.
I hope so.
I know.
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew whose life you once saved.
The best thing I ever did.
Judah it will be very difficult to govern here.
I'm going to need help.
Your help.
Your advice.
- You want my advice?
- Yes, I do.
Withdraw your legions.
Give us our freedom.
Unfortunately, the emperor is devoted to his empire.
He's particularly fond of Judea.
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.
My quarters.
A bit grim.
Not grim.
Austere.
Virtuous.
Roman.
I'm going to be second-in-command to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.
He's coming in a few days with more legions.
Then the rumors are true.
The emperor does not approve of your countrymen.
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.
But you and your family need have no concern.
I'm next in authority to the governor, and you're my friend.
- l'm a Jew.
- Ah, you are like a Roman!
What have you in common with the troublemaking rabble?
- They're my people. I'm one of them.
- Be wise, Judah.
It's a Roman world. lf you want to live in it, you must become part of it.
You've changed.
I've grown up. I've seen the world since I left Jerusalem.
I've seen Rome. lt's no accident that one small village on the Tiber was chosen to rule the world.
Your legions.
It wasn't just our legions.
Other countries have armies, fine armies. I know, I fought them.
Oh, no.
No, it was fate that chose us to civilize the world.
And we have.
Our roads and ships connect every corner of the earth.
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.
I believe in the future of my people.
Of course you do.
And you can help them.
How?
You're an aristocrat.
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince to your people.
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.
They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.
Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.
It is worse than stupid, futile!
For it can end in only one way, extinction for your people!
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.
Then we're agreed!
Now, when can I come to see your family?
- We had hoped tomorrow.
- Good.
And now for our toast.
It's dreadful wine, by the way.
It's especially fermented for the Roman army.
You're very cruel to your conquerors.
It's an insane world.
But in it there is one sanity:
The loyalty of old friends.
Judah, we must believe in one another.
Will you drink to that?
With all my heart.
Here it is, the place I've remembered.
The court where we played at changing the guard.
The roof where we'd throw pebbles at people in the street and then hide.
- We were rascals, weren't we?
- No, you were good boys.
I would have that time again.
And here it is.
Nothing has changed.
Except for the fountain.
- The old well would go dry, remember?
- Promptly, every summer.
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.
- He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
- No?
Of course he has.
He was a boy when he left us, now he's a man.
With great responsibilities.
Come.
The emperor builds and builds, turning brick to marble.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.
I've never seen anything like this before. lt's beautiful!
- ls it Roman?
- lt's Libyan. I was there last year.
A tremendous campaign.
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.
Or was, till we destroyed it.
Now it's nothing but ashes.
I'm boring you with soldier stories.
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.
Thank you for this.
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.
What do you think of it?
Magnificent.
It's Arabic.
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.
Let me try him sometime.
Whenever you like.
He's yours.
Do you mean you'll give me this?
Oh, Judah.
You are good. lt's going to be like old times, I know it.
Judah, tell me, did you think about what I said?
Yes.
Talked to a number of people already.
Spoken against violence, against incidents.
Most of the men agree with me.
Most?
Not all?
No, not all.
Who does not agree?
Well, the resenttul, the impatient.
Who are they?
Yes, Judah.
Who are they?
Would I retain your friendship if I became an informer?
Telling the names of criminals is not informing.
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.
Patriots?
!
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.
This is my great opportunity, and yours too.
If I bring order here, I can have any post I want.
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?
Rome!
Yes, perhaps at the side of Caesar himself.
I mean it. lt can happen and this is the moment.
I swear, this is the time.
The emperor is watching us, judging us.
All I need do is serve him.
And all you need do is help me serve him.
- You speak as if he were God.
- He is God.
The only God.
He is power, real power on earth, not...
Not that.
Help me, Judah.
I would do anything for you, Messala except betray my own people.
In the name of all the gods, what do the lives of a few Jews mean to you?
If I cannot persuade them, that does not mean I would help you murder them.
Besides, you must understand this, Messala.
I believe in the past and future of my people.
Future?
You are a conquered people.
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?
Joshua will not rise again to save you nor David.
There is only one reality in the world today.
Look to the West.
Don't be a fool!
Look to Rome!
Better a fool than a traitor or a killer.
- l am a soldier.
- Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.
- l warn you...
- No!
I warn you.
Rome is an affront to God.
Rome is strangling my people and my country, the whole earth!
But not forever.
And I tell you, the day Rome falls there will be a shout of freedom such as the world has never heard before.
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.
You're either for me or against me.
If that is the choice then I am against you.
There they are.
Where's Messala?
- Where's...?
- He's gone.
Gone?
- But why?
- He couldn't stay.
- What happened?
- A new tribune must have many duties.
Come.
Let us have dinner.
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, lKing of the world who bringeth to us bread from the earth.
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.
He wanted to use me to betray our people.
- Master, the caravan from Antioch.
- Yes, Amrah, I saw.
Simonides.
Welcome.
- Oh, welcome homecoming.
- Master.
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.
And for the master, Iberian wine.
Not to mention the best gift of all, your presence.
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.
- Caravans from Petra.
- Have all arrived.
- Good.
- Here is the accounting.
And what of Numidia?
The trade route is ours, guaranteed by treaty with the king.
Once a year, you bring your accounting.
And once a year, I find myself wealthier.
Yeah, but my greatest treasure is my steward.
My life belongs to the House of Hur.
Nothing else exists for me, except my daughter.
- She must be a young woman by now.
- Yes, and your property.
She was born the daughter of your slave.
When I inherited you, I inherited a friend, not a slave.
Still, Esther has come with me from Antioch for your permission to marry.
It's granted. I wish you the joy of many grandchildren.
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.
With your permission, Esther wishes to speak to her master.
You're eager to marry, Esther?
It is my father's wish.
Your husband will be fortunate.
What is his name?
David, son of Mathias.
Of what house?
- His own, master.
- He is a freeman.
Tell me more about him.
I have seen him only once.
He is a merchant, well-thought-of in Antioch.
He will pay for Esther's freedom.
Her freedom will be my wedding gift to Esther.
You are generous, master.
Do you love this man?
I will learn to love him.
You have my permission to marry.
We'll drink to your happiness.
And a safe return to Antioch.
I disturbed you.
No.
What were you thinking?
I was saying goodbye to this city and this house.
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?
My father sometimes brought me here when I was little.
It was a house where l was always happy.
Except once.
When you and your friend, the Roman boy...
- Messala.
- Yes.
You had been out hunting and they brought you home injured.
I touched your face as you lay there and prayed to God, "Don't let this boy die."
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.
Yes, master.
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.
It's strange. I hardly felt a slave.
And now I hardly feel free.
You know, in the old, wise days of Solomon if there was among his slaves some girl who filled his eyes he could choose her out from the rest and take her to him.
Wise days of Solomon.
Different days.
And long ago.
If you were not a bride I should kiss you goodbye.
If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said.
Your slave ring.
Fair exchange.
Freedom to you.
The ring to me.
You will wear it?
Until you meet the woman you will marry?
Yes.
Until then.
The gods favor my lord Gratus.
If it is the governor's pleasure, the wreath of office.
Thank you, tribune.
I see no delegation from the city.
- There will not be one, sir.
- No?
Jerusalem's welcome will not be a warm one.
But I pledge, my lord, it will be a quiet one.
Let us proceed.
There's Messala.
He saw you, Judah.
The new governor.
Stand back!
- Stand back.
- You, come!
Had to be the Jews!
Open up in the name of the divine emperor!
Judah!
Tirzah!
What is it?
What's happened?
Open up in the name of the law!
- l was watching the...
- A tile fell and struck the governor.
- lt wasn't my fault.
- They won't believe her.
She won't have to say anything.
You hear?
Tirzah, say nothing.
Open the gates!
I'll speak to them.
- Arrest him!
- Let me tell you what happened.
- Hold those women.
- Stop them!
It was an accident.
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.
- This is the man, sir.
We saw him.
- lt was an accident.
- Accident?
- l swear it.
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose. it gave way.
Take him.
Take all of them.
- He's telling the truth!
- lt was me!
Let them go!
Attention!
Messala.
In the name of God, tell them it's a mistake.
I leaned on the tile, and it broke loose.
It was an accident.
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!
Let the servants go.
Let them go.
Return to your ranks.
Come.
Where?
Tirus.
Tirus?
I've had no trial.
I'm to die in the galleys without even a trial?
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!
Wait.
My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?
Tie his hands.
- At least tell me if they're safe.
- l can tell you nothing.
Get along. lKeep moving.
Jailer!
Guard, in there!
Up the stairs!
Jailer!
Jailer!
To the right.
- Wait!
- Send them out.
Send them out.
Go!
The door.
Where are my mother and sister?
Where are they?
Here, within these walls.
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.
Of course, they will be sentenced.
is it possible?
is it possible you could do this to us?
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?
You will let them go.
You will gladly let them go!
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not a murderer!
I know you're not.
You know?
You are evil.
No, Judah, I am not evil.
I wanted your help.
Now you've given it to me.
By making this example of you, I discourage treason.
By condemning without hesitation an old friend, I shall be feared.
But not my family.
Let them go.
Please.
- Messala, I beg you.
- Beg?
!
Didn't I beg you?
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.
lKill me, and your mother and sister will die nailed to crosses in front of you!
Go on, Judah.
lKill me!
May God grant me vengeance.
I will pray that you live till I return.
Return?
Take him.
Sentries, salute.
The tribune will see you now.
Tribune, I'm steward of the House of Hur.
I remember you.
We were on our way to Antioch when we heard what had happened.
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done this thing.
You knew him, tribune.
Better than you.
Then there must be no doubt in your mind, the charge is groundless.
The prisoners have been sentenced.
- Sentenced?
- But there's no truth in it.
There was never a threat against the governor in Judah's mind.
Surely you must know he would never have done this.
In your heart, you must know it.
Drusus.
This man had better be kept here until we can question him.
Hold!
Water for the soldiers.
Soldiers first!
Get away from that well.
No water for them!
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!
Come on, you!
Water for the horses!
- Water.
Water.
- Soldiers first!
Here.
Wait.
No water for him.
God help me.
You!
I said no water for him!
All right, on your feet, all of you!
Get them on their feet!
Back in line, you dog!
On your feet!
Get them going!
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!
Forward, you dogs!
Soon, the counselor's barge will be coming alongside.
Be ready to raise oars.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.
- How many rowers?
- Two hundred, consul.
- And reliefs?
- Of 30, every hour.
This man is ill.
Replace him.
- Change him.
- Right, sir.
- This man's been giving you trouble?
- He's insubordinate, consul.
That will stop.
What service have you seen?
Forty-one.
A month's less a day in this ship.
You keep an exact account.
And before?
Three years in other ships.
Three years.
You have the spirit to fight back but the good sense to control it.
Your eyes are full of hate, 4 1 .
That's good.
Hate keeps a man alive.
It gives him strength.
Now, listen to me, all of you.
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
So row well and live.
- Ship ready, consul.
- Strike oars.
Strike oars!
You know a fleet of Macedonian galleys has been raiding Roman commerce.
The emperor has honored us with the task of seeking out and destroying them.
Battle speed, hortator.
Battle speed!
Attack speed.
Attack speed!
Ramming speed.
Ramming speed!
Rest.
Halt!
Rest!
Why are you here?
I was ordered to report to you during my relief.
Oh, yes.
I'd forgotten.
You could have killed me as I lay there.
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?
I'm not ready to die.
What do you think will save you?
The God of my fathers.
Your God has forsaken you.
He has no more power than the images I pray to.
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.
I might.
Does that interest you, 4 1?
I can see that it does.
I'm a fighting man by profession, and in my leisure moments it amuses me to train fighting men.
I own some of the best gladiators and charioteers in Rome.
Would you like to become one of them?
To die as your slave?
Better than to live in chains below these decks.
I will not be here forever.
No?
What would you do if you escaped?
Two people were condemned with me, my mother and sister though they were innocent.
I won't rest...
Do not say that you were innocent.
- Would it do any good to say it again?
- No.
Consider my offer carefully.
You will never escape while we are victorious.
If we are not, you will sink with this ship, chained to your oar.
I cannot believe that God has let me live these years to die chained to an oar.
It's a strange, stubborn faith you keep to believe that existence has a purpose.
A sane man would have learned to lose it long before this.
As you have.
What drove it out of you?
Go back to your oar, 4 1 .
Consul, enemy sighted.
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.
All the watch to battle posts.
- Stand by to load.
- Make ready to fire.
Hurry, quick!
Hurry up with that resin.
Get some more ammunition.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
Chain rowers!
Guard.
Unlock 4 1 .
No!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
4 1 , why did he do that?
I don't know.
Once before, a man helped me.
I didn't know why then.
Normal speed!
Number 1 , flame.
Fire.
Fire!
Fire!
Hold withdrawal on command.
Lift oars!
Raise!
Withdraw!
Steersman, right.
Extend oars!
Fire!
- Watch out!
- Fire!
Steersman, ram course!
Order below!
Ramming speed!
Consul, barge on ramming course.
We're going to be rammed!
We're going to be rammed!
Why did you save me?
Why did you have me unchained?
What is your name, 4 1?
Judah Ben-Hur. ...let me die.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
Row well and live.
is the sail square?
I can't tell.
Better for us both if it's the enemy.
My death.
Your freedom.
It's a Roman sail.
Face rear!
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.
Water.
The fleet, all lost?
Five galleys.
- And the battle?
- The battle was won.
You have a victory.
- lt was a victory?
- Complete.
In His eagerness to save you your God has also saved the Roman fleet.
Hail Arrius!
Right oars!
You have cleared the seaways of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.
This baton of victory has been nobly won.
This man riding beside you, who is he?
The man who saved me, divine emperor, to return and serve you.
is that all you know about him?
No.
He was accused of an attack on the governor of Judea.
But he was innocent.
If not, there's a strange inconsistency in this man who tries to kill my governor, yet saves the life of my consul.
Come tomorrow.
We'll talk of it.
We have all the information on this man a man of some influence in his own country.
His attack upon our governor is one upon the senate and the people of Rome.
I am convinced that no such attack was intended.
Consul, allow us to continue.
Allow us to be generous.
As a reward to you for your great victory we shall not send him back to the galleys.
We give him to you as your slave.
Such is the will of the senate and the people of Rome.
Not long ago, I returned to Rome with a young man who had saved my life.
You all know him as the finest charioteer in Rome.
Five times, he's driven my horses to victory.
I know him as one who stands in the place of the son I lost.
I have the love and pride in a son's achievements which I thought I should never have again.
Nothing could make stronger our bond but tonight I wish to share it with you all.
The formalities of adoption have been completed.
Young Arrius is now the legal bearer of my name and the heir to my property.
This ring of my ancestors would have gone to my son.
So now it is yours.
It's a strange destiny that brought me to a new life a new home a new father.
It brought me here.
It may take me away.
But wherever I may be I shall always try to wear this ring as a son of Arrius should.
With gratitude and affection and with honor.
My old friend Pontius Pilate, young Arrius.
Before you came to this city, my horses always won.
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.
Yes, but not swift enough to defeat you.
- Tell me, you come from Judea?
- Yes, sir.
I hear that the climate is difficult to live in.
Not for Judeans.
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.
- Of Judea?
- Yes.
I asked for Alexandria.
But it seems the wilderness needs my particular talents.
The scorpions and holy prophets can't get on without me.
Lay the dust of Judea, at least for this evening.
Goats and Jehovah.
You're leaving.
I must.
It's a journey I can't keep you from.
Your eyes have never left it all these months. I can recognize pain.
But still, my counsel is to wait.
Gratus is to be replaced.
The governorship goes to Pontius Pilate.
When?
Very soon.
It's very much to our purpose.
Nothing is to the purpose if, when I come back to Judea, I come too late.
That is the thought which has punished me every moment I've spent here.
Will Rome see you again?
Here is a part of my life which you have made for me.
I shall remember it.
Whoever the gods are, they take small interest in an old man's hopes.
They have their way.
Forgive me.
You're a stranger here.
Would you be from Nazareth?
Why do you ask?
I thought you might be the one...
The one that I have come back from my country to find.
He would be about your age.
Who?
When I find Him I shall know Him.
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.
Sack of flesh without brains!
No!
No!
Not the whip!
That is my host.
Gently!
Gently!
Fool!
Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood.
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run!
Go on!
Ikeep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!
Beautiful horses.
Now!
Now!
They are ready!
Let them go!
Watch.
They'll never hold the turn.
No!
No!
Abadon, stop him!
Stop that whip!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill...!
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!
You think you can treat my horses like animals?
!
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!
Get off, idiot!
Drive goats, not horses!
I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.
Not a team?
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.
- Antares.
- The slow one?
He should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?
In the circus in Rome.
You have driven in the great circus?
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.
No other animal has descended so in scale from the first innocent falling of the world.
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.
Yes.
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.
Your coming here was so fit, so right.
We might have achieved wonders!
You have to go.
I make a journey which will not wait.
Ah, well, then perhaps you will come back.
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.
I have no wives.
No wives at all?
I have six, no, seven.
I've counted eight.
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.
- Someday, I hope to have one.
- One wife!
One God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.
It is not generous.
- Was the food not to your liking?
- indeed.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.
And now I must say good night to my beauties.
When ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.
- l'll make my farewells then.
- No, no, no, stay.
Stay and see them.
Come, my children.
Come.
Strangers make them shy.
Come.
Come, do not be afraid.
Come.
There, my children.
They are descended from the Arabians of the Pharaohs and I have named them for the stars.
Come, Antares.
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.
What?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.
Come, Rigel.
We've both supped well, and the world is good.
There's my good Rigel.
Yes, you are ready for sleep.
The day's work done for you, eh?
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.
Good night.
Good night, my treasure.
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.
No.
You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.
You should see their mother, Mira.
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.
All right, all right.
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.
You must be strong and swift.
Go, my children.
Go.
At Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams and the champion of the East, Messala, with his black devils.
He stops at nothing to win.
- Messala?
In the circus?
- Yes.
You knew him?
I know him.
Perhaps without much liking.
My people are praying for a man to drive their team to victory over Messala.
You could be that man, the one to stamp his arrogance into the sand.
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.
It's not possible.
That is a pity.
Think of it.
To break his pride to humble this tribune before the very people he has degraded.
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!
I know it is not possible.
Does it not delight your imagination?
Does it not answer your purpose?
I must deal with Messala in my own way.
And your way is to kill him.
I see this terrible thing in your eyes.
But no matter what this man has done, you have no right to kill him.
He will be punished inevitably.
I don't believe in miracles.
But all life is a miracle.
Why will you not accept God's judgment?
You do not believe in miracles.
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness and a star led me to a village called Bethlehem where l found a newborn child in a manger.
And God lived in this child.
By now, He is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.
That is why I have returned here so that I may be at hand when He comes among us.
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.
Perhaps He's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.
Perhaps He is a shepherd a merchant, a fisherman.
But He lives and all our lives from now on will carry His mark.
There are many paths to God, my son.
I hope yours will not be too difficult.
I'm ready for sleep.
Balthasar is a good man but until all men are like him, we must keep our swords bright.
And our intention true.
So I must leave you.
One last thought.
There is no law in the arena.
Many are killed.
I hope to see you again.
Fine Damascus silk.
Fine Damascus silk.
Esther?
It's Judah.
You are alive.
You are alive.
What are you doing here?
What has happened?
I'm here.
I'm with you.
Where's your father?
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.
They tortured him.
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.
You never went back to Antioch?
No.
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.
Where are my mother and sister?
Let me tell him first.
Father.
Father, something wonderful has happened.
Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
He has come home.
He is here.
Judah.
Judah Ben-Hur.
My dear old friend.
Let me look at you.
Let me see you.
Yes, yes. lt is true.
Praise God for His mercy.
Where are they?
Since that terrible day there has been no word of them.
You should have been less loyal.
Do not pity me, Master Judah.
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.
We were released on the same day.
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.
Since then, I have been his tongue and he has been my legs.
Together, we make a considerable man.
Old friend.
She always said you would return.
She never gave up hope.
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.
I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.
But suppose that isn't possible.
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.
They could not make me tell them where it is.
It is there still to put power into our hands and buy death for the Romans.
That's not why I came back.
Judah, they are dead.
Four years.
No one could live so long in the dungeons.
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?
Yes, it is true.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You have come back to us like a returning faith.
Judah, I should like to laugh again.
- Let us laugh.
- We will.
There will be joy again in this house.
We will celebrate among the dust.
I will take him.
We stood here before.
A long while ago.
Four years.
But now it seems as if only yesterday... I was saying:
"lf you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye."
"lf l were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said."
I am not a bride.
Why did you never marry?
My father needed me.
And also... lt's still on my finger.
I said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.
It's become a part of my hand.
If Messala once knew you were here...
As he must.
He will know where they are.
And if you should find...?
- Lf he says they're dead...
- Messala will wish they were living.
I've seen too much of what hate can do.
My father is burned up with it.
But I've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater and love more powerful than hatred.
I believe it.
- Esther.
- Judah.
Stay alive.
Ikeep away from Messala.
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.
That time isn't yet come.
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.
This time you will be destroyed.
You'll die.
Tribune, compliments of Quintus Arrius.
He awaits your pleasure.
- Consul here?
- Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.
Thank him.
Bring him to me.
- l didn't know the consul had a son.
- He's a champion of the great circus.
- Why is he presenting me with gifts?
- Perhaps he'll race against you.
Look.
It's magnificent.
And from a man I've never met.
You're wrong, Messala.
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?
You were the magician, Messala.
You condemned me to the galleys.
When my ship was sunk, I saved the consul's life.
You know his seal?
Now I have come back as I swore I would.
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.
You suggest I use it on myself?
What has become of my mother and my sister?
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.
Find them, Messala.
Restore them to me, and I'll forget what I vowed with every stroke of that oar you chained me to.
I am not the governor.
I can do nothing without approval.
Then get it.
I will come back tomorrow.
Don't disappoint me, Messala.
What became of them?
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?
Go to the citadel, Drusus.
Find out.
- And if they're dead?
- They're dead!
"Miriam, wife.
Tirzah, daughter."
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?
E section lower level.
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.
Water.
Water.
Let me out!
- How long since you've seen them?
- Never.
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.
The food disappears.
Lepers.
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.
Then we'll burn out the cell.
is someone there?
There is someone there.
Who are you?
Don't come any closer.
Who are you?
Esther.
It's Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam?
Stay where you are.
You have come home.
Stand back, Esther.
We are lepers.
Oh, Esther.
Tirzah.
Esther is Judah living?
Yes, he is alive.
He is here.
Where?
He is searching for you now.
I must find him and tell him.
- No!
- Tell my father.
No.
Tell no one.
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.
We won't return.
Judah has to be told.
No.
Please.
I couldn't see his face.
is it changed?
No, he is not changed.
He's not changed.
You love him, Esther.
Promise me on your love for him you will never tell him you've seen us.
is he never to know?
Let him remember us as we were.
Promise me.
There's nothing else I can hope for.
Only this.
I promise.
I am content.
Wait.
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.
I pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.
He'll free them.
He wants to survive.
He cannot free them, Judah.
What do you mean?
I saw them.
You saw them?
Where?
When did you see them?
They were dead.
They were dead.
When?
When?
When?
!
In the prison.
When I was waiting for news of my father.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't tell you.
Nor even you, Father.
I was afraid that if you saw Messala...
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.
It's over now.
Over?
- Judah.
- Over?
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.
Gentlemen.
Officers.
Defenders of great Rome's imperium may I enter?
Certainly, sheik.
You do us an unexpected honor.
The noble tribune is most gracious.
And now the question you're asking:
Why am I here?
As you know, I am a gambling man.
The games approach.
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.
I will back my own poor horses.
No limits?
- Mark me first!
- And me!
- What odds?
- A moment, please my lords, protectors of the far flung marshes.
May I first sit down?
Sit.
How much will you wager?
- Yes, let's call his game.
- Give the Arab a seat.
A bench, quickly.
Thank you.
- Now.
- 1000 denarii.
- 2000!
- Mark me!
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient.
There is time.
First gentlemen, the odds.
The tribune has won many times.
The odds should be in the same measure.
What is your pleasure, gentlemen?
Two to one.
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth where is the courage that made Rome master of the world?
I can get better odds on any street market.
Three to one.
Let us not haggle.
Let us be fair.
In four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.
- ln all truth...
- Just a moment.
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.
The Prince of Hur.
Judah Ben Hur.
Prince of Hur?
- He was sent to the galleys years ago.
- He has returned.
Returned?
Lmpossible.
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.
Well?
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.
You, tribune will you give me four to one?
Four to one.
Good.
Four to one, sheik.
The difference between a Roman and a Jew.
Or an Arab.
Bravely spoken.
Now we will settle the amount of our wager. I will venture...
A thousand talents?
- A thousand talents?
- Yes, a thousand talents.
Of course, if it is too much...
A thousand talents it will be.
Agreed.
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.
You're good fellows.
If only men were this good.
Remember, Altair nine times around the circus.
Aldebaran.
Rigel, did you hear?
Nine lives to live.
My swift fellow.
You must not win the race the first time around.
You win the last time around.
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.
Steady Antares.
Like a rock.
You will be our anchor.
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.
They have taken me into their family.
Rest well, my stars.
Tomorrow we go up to the city.
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it the news will scorch the streets of the Roman world.
Pontius Pilate here?
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.
You will make him see what men are born in this land.
I only know that I race against Messala.
Look for the yoke.
Ease that strap.
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.
into Your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as You will.
The Star of David.
To shine out for your people and my people together and blind the eyes of Rome.
They are ready.
Easy, girl, easy.
Number five.
Where is number five?
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.
Yes, this is the day.
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.
Hail, Jupiter.
Give me victory.
Watch your line!
Ikeep your places!
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.
Citizens I welcome you to these games in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.
We dedicate them to his glory and to the glory of Rome of which you are all part.
Let us honor those who race for us today.
They come here from Alexandria Messina Carthage Cyprus Rome Corinth Athens Phrygia and Judea.
To the best of these, a crown of victory.
The race begins.
Hail, Caesar!
Come, my children, come!
The Roman pig!
Salute.
A great victory.
You are the people's one true god for the time being.
Permit us to worship.
I crown their god.
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.
A long life, young Arrius and the good sense to live it.
We cannot wait, tribune.
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.
He will come!
He will come.
I've sent for him, and he will come.
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.
Do you understand?
To hack the legs off me?
Not yet.
Not till I've seen him.
I don't receive him with half a body.
No!
I told you, Drusus. I told you.
Here he is.
Triumph complete, Judah.
The race won.
The enemy destroyed.
I see no enemy.
What do you think you see?
The smashed body of a wretched animal?
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.
Let me help you.
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.
Dead.
And the race over.
It isn't over, Judah.
They're not dead.
Where are they?
Where are they?
Look for them in the Valley of the Lepers if you can recognize them.
It goes on.
It goes on, Judah.
The race...
The race is not over.
is there a way down here?
Are you a madman?
Ikeep well out of this place.
Man.
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.
There are many women.
Of the family of Hur.
We have no names here.
For them?
- Why did you say they were dead?
- lt was what they wanted.
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?
Not to see them?
They are coming.
Love them in the way they must need to be loved.
Not to look at them.
Let them be as if you had never come here.
Please!
is Judah well?
is he happy?
Yes, he is well.
Your mind can be at rest for him.
He is well, Miriam.
God be with you.
They have gone.
We can go back.
Go back to what?
Judah, they have one blessing left.
To think you remember them as they were and live your own life.
Forget what is here.
Forget?
It's as though they're alive in a grave.
- But what can you do?
- Undo what you've done.
How could you have suffered them to come here?
I must see them.
No, Judah, please!
Judah!
Think, Judah, think. lt would tear them apart if they see you.
He is here. I have found Him.
The child has become a man.
And the man, I know it now, is the Son of God.
The promise is true.
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.
Life has been answered.
God has answered it.
Come.
Come with me.
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys thirst had nearly killed me.
A man gave me water to drink.
I went on living.
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.
No.
I am thirsty still.
Come and listen.
I have business with Rome.
You insist on death.
Goodbye, Judah.
You sent for me?
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.
- l honor him.
- As you may honor yourself.
You have been made a citizen of Rome.
Do you say nothing to this?
I have just come from the Valley of Stone where my mother and sister live what's left of their lives.
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.
I have heard this.
There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.
Where there is greatness, great government or power even great feeling or compassion error also is great.
We progress and mature by fault.
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.
There are other voices.
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place not to crucify yourself on a shadow such as old resentment or impossible loyalties.
Perfect freedom has no existence.
A grown man knows the world he lives in.
And for the present, the world is Rome.
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.
I am Judah Ben-Hur.
I cross this floor in spoken friendship as I would speak to Arrius.
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar ready to crush those who challenge his authority.
There are too many men of envy and ambition who try to disrupt the government of Rome.
You have become the victor and hero to those people.
They look to you, their one true god, as I call you.
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.
I am already part of this tragedy.
Return this to Arrius.
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you from personal disaster if you stay here.
You are too great a danger.
Leave Judea.
You have my word.
I was afraid you would never come back afraid of what would happen to you.
But I see you again.
Your father's waiting for me.
Where is he?
What do you mean to do?
Rest, sleep.
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.
Peace?
Love and peace.
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?
Where do you see them?
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.
Balthasar's word.
He is more than Balthasar's word.
His voiced traveled with such a still purpose.
It was more than a voice.
A man more than a man.
He said, 'Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God.'
Children of God?
In that dead valley where we left them?
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean until we have scoured off our bodies the crust and filth of being at the mercy of tyranny.
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.
- ln blood?
- Yes, in blood!
I know there is a law in life.
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.
Death generates death as the vulture breeds the vulture.
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:
'Love your enemy.
Do good to those who despitefully use you.'
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.
As you make us do now.
Are we to bear nothing together?
Even love?
I can hardly draw breath without feeling you in my heart.
But I know that everything I do from this moment bears greater pain than you have ever suffered.
It is better not to love me.
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy giving evil for evil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.
It's as though you had become Messala.
I've lost you, Judah.
No further.
What are you doing here?
I was here last evening waiting for you.
I have waited all night.
What has happened?
Where is Tirzah?
Leave the food.
I am coming closer.
Don't be afraid.
- What are you doing?
- Don't be afraid.
I've heard Him again, the man from Nazareth.
If ever words were from God, they are in everything He says.
I cannot bear that you should have never known this hand of quiet reaching towards us.
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find Him there.
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find Him.
Tirzah is dying.
Leave the food and go.
It's Judah.
Why did you tell him?
Yes, Judah, yes.
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.
Mother.
Wait, Mother, wait.
Let me talk with you.
Please.
No, no further.
Please.
No, Judah.
Son, no.
Mother, let me see Tirzah.
Tirzah is dying.
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know that life is everlasting and death is nothing to fear if you have faith.
I will take them to Him.
No!
God, no!
No, no, dear son.
Mother where is Tirzah?
Judah, no.
Judah, no.
You must not go to her, dear son.
Please.
Dear son.
I am afraid.
No cause.
The world is more than we know.
Tirzah, it's Judah.
No, Judah.
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
- Why are the streets deserted?
- They have gone to the trial.
Trial?
Whose trial?
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.
- This cannot be true.
- Alms?
What has he done?
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.
Help for the blind.
- Look, lepers!
- Lepers!
Get away!
Stay away!
Go away!
Lepers!
Lepers!
How can this be?
I know this man.
Will someone help Him?
Take pity on Him.
Have mercy.
In His pain this look of peace.
Watch over them, Esther.
We must go back.
I brought you here to this when I hoped...
You haven't failed, Esther.
Hail King of the Jews!
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.
He gave me water and a heart to live.
What has He done to merit this?
He has taken the world of our sins onto Himself.
To this end He said He was born in that stable where l first saw Him.
For this cause, He came into the world.
For this death?
This beginning.
I have lived too long.
As though He were carrying in that cross the pain of the world.
So fearful, and yet why is it I'm not afraid anymore?
The shadow of a storm.
A strange darkness but still day.
His life is over.
What is it?
This tearing.
I am in pain.
I feel it too.
Do you see your hand?
Almost at the moment He died I heard Him say, 'Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.'
Even then.
Even then.
And I felt His voice take the sword out of my hand.
BALTHASAR:
In the year of our Lord Judea, for nearly a century, had lain under the mastery of Rome.
In the seventh year of the reign of Augustus Caesar an imperial decree ordered every Judean each to return to his place of birth to be counted and taxed.
The converging ways of many of them led to their capital city, Jerusalem the troubled heart of their land.
The old city was dominated by the fortress of Antonia the seat of Roman power and by the great golden temple the outward sign of an inward and imperishable faith.
Even while they obeyed the will of Caesar the people clung proudly to their ancient heritage always remembering the promise of their prophets that one day there would be born among them a redeemer to bring them salvation and perfect freedom.
[MURMURING]
You'll be counted at Hebron.
- Name?
- Samuel.
- What city?
- Joppa.
- What family?
- Michael.
- Move on.
Move on.
- Yes.
- Name?
- Joseph.
- What city?
- Nazareth.
- What family?
- David of Bethlehem.
- And the woman?
- My wife.
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.
Come on, come on.
[OXEN BELLOWING]
[BABY CRYING]
[SHEEP BAAING]
[TRUMPETS]
What village is this?
Nazareth.
We should arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow night.
You're not watching the soldiers, Joseph?
We've seen Romans before.
Yes and we will see them again.
My table is not finished.
Where is your son?
- He's walking in the hills.
- Mm-hm.
He neglects his work, Joseph.
No.
Once, I reproached him with forgetting his work.
He said to me:
"I must be about my father's business."
Then why isn't he here, working?
He's working.
SEXTUS:
Trumpeters of the legion!
[TRUMPETING]
Welcome, Messala.
The command is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for relieving me.
Drusus when I was a boy, I dreamed of commanding this garrison.
Now the wheel has turned.
I am in command.
OFFICER:
Attention!
Aisle one, face right!
Forward!
I'd forgotten the heat.
If it were only the heat.
I lived here until I was 14.
Jerusalem was my home.
- My father was head of...
- Yes, I know.
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.
If there can be such a thing in this forsaken land.
If you want to rise, Sextus, do the difficult.
I asked to be sent here.
I think you'll find the people changed since you were a boy.
In what way?
Oh, won't pay their taxes, an irrational resentment of Rome...
There's nothing new in all that.
And then there's religion.
I tell you, they're drunk with religion.
They smash the statues of our gods, even those of the emperor.
Punish them.
We do.
When we can find them.
Find the leaders.
Oh, you don't know.
There's nothing you can put your finger on.
I tell you, there are strange forces at work here.
For instance, this "messiah" business...
I know.
There was one predicted when I was a boy.
A king of the Jews, who will lead them into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.
Makes your head spin.
There's a wild man in the desert named John who drowns people in water.
And a carpenter's son who does magic tricks. "Miracles" they call them.
There's always a rabble-rouser stirring up trouble.
No, no, no.
This man is different.
He teaches that God is near, in every man.
[MESSALA SCOFFS]
It's actually quite profound, some of it.
You've been too long away from Rome.
Go back, Sextus.
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea and forget that God is in every man.
- There is divinity in only one man.
- Yes, I know.
The emperor is displeased.
He wishes Judea made into a more obedient and disciplined province.
He has ordered me to restore order.
I intend to carry out his wishes.
But how?
You can break a man's skull, arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.
But how do you control what's up here?
How do you fight an idea?
Especially a new idea.
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.
I assume he has a name.
- He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
- Then treat him like one!
Tell him I will join him.
Yes, tribune.
Centurion!
This was his country before it was ours.
Don't forget that.
Yes, tribune.
Very wise.
This Ben-Hur is the richest man in Jerusalem.
And the head of one of the greatest families in Judea.
We were friends as boys.
We were like brothers.
Sextus you ask how to fight an idea.
Well, I'll tell you how.
With another idea.
I said I'd come back.
I never thought you would.
I'm so glad.
[BOTH LAUGH]
- Look at you.
- Look at you!
You've come back a tribune.
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.
We'll drink another now.
- Your sister and mother?
How're they?
- They're fine.
They've talked of you ever since we knew you were coming.
- Is Tirzah married?
- No.
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.
She's been in love with you since she was 5.
I can't wait to see them.
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?
Or have you become too dignified?
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
- Down Eros, up Mars!
- Down Eros, up Mars!
MESSALA:
Where the beams cross?
BEN-HUR:
Good.
[BOTH LAUGH]
After all these years!
Still close.
In every way.
I hope so.
I know.
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew whose life you once saved.
The best thing I ever did.
Judah it will be very difficult to govern here.
I'm going to need help.
Your help.
Your advice.
- You want my advice?
- Yes, I do.
Withdraw your legions.
Give us our freedom.
Unfortunately, the emperor is devoted to his empire.
He's particularly fond of Judea.
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.
Is there anything so sad as unrequited love?
[MESSALA CHUCKLES]
My quarters.
Hmm.
A bit grim.
Not grim.
Austere.
Virtuous.
Roman.
I'm going to be second-in-command to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.
He's arriving in a few days with two more legions.
Then the rumors are true.
The emperor does not approve of your countrymen.
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.
But you and your family need have no concern.
I'm next in authority to the governor, and you're my friend.
- I'm a Jew.
- Ah, you are like a Roman!
What have you in common with the troublemaking rabble?
Rabble?
They're my people.
I'm one of them.
Be wise, Judah.
It's a Roman world.
If you want to live in it, you must become part of it.
You've changed.
I've grown up.
I've seen the world since I left Jerusalem.
I've seen Rome.
It's no accident that one small village on the Tiber was chosen to rule the world.
Your legions.
It wasn't just our legions.
Other countries have armies, fine armies.
I know, I fought them.
Oh, no.
No, it was fate that chose us to civilize the world.
And we have.
Our roads and ships connect every corner of the earth.
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.
I believe in the future of my people.
Of course you do.
And you can help them.
How?
You're an aristocrat.
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince among your people.
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.
They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.
Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.
It is worse than stupid, futile!
For it can end in only one way, extinction for your people!
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.
Then we're agreed!
Now, when can I come to see your family?
- We had hoped tomorrow.
- Good.
And now for our toast.
It's dreadful wine, by the way.
It's especially fermented for the Roman army.
[MESSALA CHUCKLES]
You're very cruel to your conquerors.
It's an insane world.
But in it there is one sanity:
The loyalty of old friends.
Judah, we must believe in one another.
Will you drink to that?
With all my heart.
Here it is, the place I've remembered.
The court where we played at changing the guard.
The roof where we'd throw pebbles at people in the street and then hide.
- We were rascals, weren't we?
- No, you were good boys.
I would have that time again.
And here it is.
Nothing has changed.
Except for the fountain.
- The old well would go dry, remember?
- Promptly, every summer.
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.
- He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
- No?
Of course he has.
He was a boy when he left us, now he's a man.
With great responsibilities.
Come.
The emperor builds and builds, turning brick to marble.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.
I've never seen anything like this before.
It's beautiful!
- Is it Roman?
- It's Libyan.
I was there last year.
A tremendous campaign.
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.
Or was, till we destroyed it.
Now it's nothing but ashes.
I'm boring you with soldier stories.
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.
Thank you for this.
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.
BEN-HUR:
What do you think of it?
MESSALA:
Magnificent.
It's Arabic.
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.
Let me try him sometime.
Whenever you like.
He's yours.
Do you mean you'll give me this?
Oh, Judah.
You are good.
It's going to be like old times, I know it.
Judah, tell me, did you think about what I said?
Yes.
Talked to a number of people already.
Spoken against violence, against incidents.
Most of the men agree with me.
Most?
Not all?
- No, not all.
- Who does not agree?
Well, the resentful, the impatient.
Who are they?
Yes, Judah.
Who are they?
Would I retain your friendship if I became an informer?
Telling the names of criminals is not informing.
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.
Patriots?
!
Judah.
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.
This is my great opportunity, and yours too.
If I bring order here, I can have any post I want.
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?
Rome!
Yes, perhaps at the side of Caesar himself.
I mean it.
It can happen and this is the moment.
I swear, this is the time.
The emperor is watching us, judging us.
All I need do is serve him.
And all you need do is help me serve him.
- You speak as if he were God.
- He is God.
The only God.
He is power, real power on earth, not...
Not that.
Help me, Judah.
I would do anything for you, Messala except betray my own people.
In the name of all the gods, what do the lives of a few Jews mean to you?
If I cannot persuade them, that does not mean I would help you murder them.
Besides, you must understand this, Messala.
I believe in the past and future of my people.
Future?
You are a conquered people.
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?
Joshua will not rise again to save you nor David.
There is only one reality in the world today.
Look to the West.
Don't be a fool!
Look to Rome!
Better a fool than a traitor or a killer.
- I am a soldier.
- Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.
- I warn you...
- No!
I warn you.
Rome is an affront to God.
Rome is strangling my people and my country, the whole earth!
But not forever.
And I tell you, the day Rome falls there will be a shout of freedom such as the world has never heard before.
Judah.
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.
You're either for me or against me.
If that is the choice then I am against you.
There they are.
Where's Messala?
- Where's?
- He's gone.
Gone?
- But why?
- He couldn't stay.
- What happened?
- A new tribune must have many duties.
Come.
Let us have dinner.
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the world who bringeth to us bread from the earth.
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.
He wanted to use me to betray our people.
Judah.
[MURMURING]
[CAMEL BAYING]
- Master, the caravan from Antioch.
- Yes, Amrah, I saw.
Simonides.
- Welcome.
- Judah.
- Oh, welcome homecoming.
- Master.
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.
And for the master, lberian wine.
Not to mention the best gift of all, your presence.
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.
- Caravans from Petra.
- Have all arrived.
- Good.
- Here is the accounting.
And what of Numidia?
The trade route is ours, guaranteed by treaty with the king.
Once a year, you bring your accounting.
And once a year, I find myself wealthier.
Yeah, but my greatest treasure is my steward.
SIMONIDES:
My life belongs to the House of Hur.
Nothing else exists for me, except my daughter.
- She must be a young woman by now.
- Yes, and your property.
She was born the daughter of your slave.
When I inherited you, I inherited a friend, not a slave.
Still, Esther has come with me from Antioch for your permission to marry.
It's granted.
I wish you the joy of many grandchildren.
SIMONIDES:
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.
With your permission, Esther wishes to speak to her master.
You're eager to marry, Esther?
It is my father's wish.
Your husband will be fortunate.
What is his name?
David, son of Mathias.
BEN-HUR:
Of what house?
- His own, master.
- He is a freeman.
Tell me more about him.
I have seen him only once.
He is a merchant, well-thought-of in Antioch.
He will pay for Esther's freedom.
Her freedom will be my wedding gift to Esther.
You are generous, master.
Do you love this man?
I will learn to love him.
You have my permission to marry.
We'll drink to your happiness.
And a safe return to Antioch.
BEN-HUR:
I disturbed you.
No.
What were you thinking?
I was saying goodbye to this city and this house.
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?
My father sometimes brought me here when I was little.
It was a house where I was always happy.
Except once.
When you and your friend, the Roman boy...
- Messala.
- Yes.
You had been out hunting and they brought you home injured.
I touched your face as you lay there and prayed to God, "Don't let this boy die."
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.
Yes, master.
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.
It's strange.
I hardly felt a slave.
And now I hardly feel free.
You know, in the old, wise days of Solomon if there was among his slaves some girl who filled his eyes he could choose her out from the rest and take her to him.
Wise days of Solomon.
Different days.
And long ago.
If you were not a bride I should kiss you goodbye.
If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said.
Your slave ring.
Fair exchange.
Freedom to you.
The ring to me.
You will wear it?
Until you meet the woman you will marry?
Until then.
[DRUMMING]
[TRUMPETING]
The gods favor my lord Gratus.
If it is the governor's pleasure, the wreath of office.
Thank you, tribune.
I see no delegation from the city.
- There will not be one, sir.
- No?
Jerusalem's welcome will not be a warm one.
But I pledge, my lord, it will be a quiet one.
Let us proceed.
[CHILDREN SHOUTING]
There's Messala.
He saw you, Judah.
The new governor.

OFFICER 3:
Open up in the name of the divine emperor!
Judah!
Tirzah!
What is it?
What's happened?
OFFICER 4:
Open up in the name of Rome!
- I was watching the Romans...
- A tile fell and struck the governor.
- It wasn't my fault.
- They won't believe her.
She won't have to say anything.
You hear?
Tirzah, say nothing.
MAN:
Open the gates!
I'll speak to them.
OFFICER 1:
Arrest him!
- Wait.
Let me tell you what happened.
OFFICER 2:
Hold those women.
BEN-HUR:
Not them!
- Judah!
BEN-HUR:
It was an accident.
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.
- This is the man, sir.
We saw him.
- It was an accident.
- Accident?
- I swear it.
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose.
It gave way.
Take him.
Take all of them.
MIRIAM:
He's telling the truth!
- It was me!
Let them go!
MIRIAM:
Judah!
CENTURION:
Attention!
BEN-HUR:
Messala.
In the name of God, tell them it's a mistake.
I leaned on the tile, and it broke loose.
It was an accident.
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!
MIRIAM:
Messala!
TIRZAH:
Messala.
Let the servants go.
Let them go.
Return to your ranks.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
- Come.
- Where?
Tirus.
Tirus?
I've had no trial.
I'm to die in the galleys without even a trial?
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!
Wait.
My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?
Tie his hands.
- At least tell me if they're safe.
- I can tell you nothing.

You can go.
Go!
The door.
Where are my mother and sister?
Where are they?
Here, within these walls.
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.
Of course, they will be sentenced.
Is it possible, Messala?
Is it possible you could do this to us?
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?
You'll let them go.
You must.
You will gladly let them go!
Messala!
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not mad.
I'm not a murderer!
I know you're not.
You know?
You are evil.
No, Judah, I am not evil.
I wanted your help.
Now you've given it to me.
By making this example of you, I discourage treason.
By condemning without hesitation an old friend, I shall be feared.
But not my family.
Let them go.
Please.
- Messala, I beg you.
- Beg?
!
Didn't I beg you?
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.
Kill me, and your mother and sister will die today nailed to crosses in front of you!
Go on, Judah.
Kill me!
[GRUNTS]
May God grant me vengeance.
I will pray that you live till I return.
Return?
Take him.
OFFICER:
Sentries, salute.
The tribune will see you now.
Tribune, I'm steward of the House of Hur.
I remember you.
We were on our way to Antioch when we heard what had happened.
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done this thing.
You knew him, tribune.
Better than you.
Then there must be no doubt in your mind, the charge is groundless.
The prisoners have been sentenced.
- Sentenced?
- But there's no truth in it.
There was never a threat against the governor in Judah's mind.
Surely you must know he would never have done this.
In your heart, you must know it.
Drusus.
This man had better be kept here until we have time to question him.
DECURION:

On your feet!
Get them going!
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!
Forward, you dogs!
In a few minutes, the consul's barge will be coming alongside.
Be ready to raise oars.
HORTATOR:
Raise oars!

[TRUMPETING]
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.
- How many rowers?
- Two hundred, consul.
- And reliefs?
- Of 30, every hour.
[MAN COUGHING]
This man is ill.
Replace him.
- Change him.
- Right, sir.
- This man has been giving you trouble?
- He's insubordinate, consul.
That will stop.
What service have you seen?
Forty-one.
A month's less a day in this ship.
You keep an exact account.
And before?
Three years in other ships.
Three years.
[BEN-HUR YELLS]
You have the spirit to fight back but the good sense to control it.
Your eyes are full of hate, 41.
That's good.
Hate keeps a man alive.
It gives him strength.
Now, listen to me, all of you.
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
So row well and live.
- Ship ready, consul.
- Strike oars.
HORTATOR:
Strike oars!
You know that a fleet of Macedonian galleys has been raiding Roman commerce.
The emperor has honored us with the task of seeking out and destroying them.

Why are you here?
I was ordered to report to you during my relief.
Oh, yes.
I'd forgotten.
You could have killed me as I lay there.
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?
I'm not ready to die.
What do you think will save you?
The God of my fathers.
Hmm.
Your God has forsaken you.
He has no more power than the images I pray to.
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.
I might.
Does that interest you, 41?
I can see that it does.
I'm a fighting man by profession, and in my leisure moments it amuses me to train fighting men.
I own some of the best gladiators and charioteers in Rome.
Would you like to become one of them?
To die as your slave?
Better than to live in chains below these decks.
I will not be here forever.
No?
What would you do if you escaped?
Two people were condemned with me, my mother and sister though they were innocent.
I won't rest...
Do not say that you were innocent.
- Would it do any good to say it again?
- No.
Consider my offer carefully.
You will never escape while we are victorious.
If we are not, you will sink with this ship, chained to your oar.
I cannot believe that God has let me live these three years to die chained to an oar.
It's a strange, stubborn faith you keep to believe that existence has a purpose.
A sane man would have learned to lose it long before this.
As you have.
What drove it out of you?
Go back to your oar, 41.
Consul, enemy sighted.
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.

You have cleared the seaways of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.
This baton of victory has been nobly won.
[CROWD CHEERS]
This man riding beside you, who is he?
The man who saved me, divine emperor, to return and serve you.
Is that all you know about him?
No.
He was accused of an attack on the governor of Judea.
But he was innocent.
If not, there's a strange inconsistency in this man who tries to kill my governor, yet saves the life of my consul.
Come tomorrow.
We'll talk of it.
[CROWD CHEERS]
[BAND PLAYING TRIUMPHANT MUSIC]
We have all the information on this man a man of some influence in his own country.
His attack upon our governor is one upon the senate and the people of Rome.
I am convinced that no such attack was intended.
Consul, allow us to continue.
Allow us to be generous.
As a reward to you for your great victory we shall not send him back to the galleys.
We give him to you as your slave to do with him as you like.
Such is the will of the senate and the people of Rome.
[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]
[WOMEN YELLING]
[BAND PLAYING SOFT MUSIC]
Not long ago, I returned to Rome with a young man who had saved my life.
You all know him as the finest charioteer in Rome.
Five times, he's driven my horses to victory.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I know him as one who stands in the place of the son I lost.
I have the love and pride in a son's achievements which I thought I should never have again.
[MURMURING]
Nothing could make stronger the bond between us but tonight I wish to share it with you all.
The formalities of adoption have been completed.
Young Arrius is now the legal bearer of my name and the heir to my property.
[CROWD MURMURS]
This ring of my ancestors would have gone to my son.
So now it is yours.
It's a strange destiny that brought me to a new life a new home a new father.
It brought me here.
It may take me away.
But wherever I may be I shall always try to wear this ring as a son of Arrius should.
With gratitude and affection and with honor.
[CROWD CHEERING]
[SOFT MUSIC RESUMES]
I present my son to you.
My old friend Pontius Pilate, young Arrius.
Before you came to this city, my horses always won.
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.
Yes, but not swift enough to defeat you.
- Tell me, you come from Judea?
- Yes, sir.
I hear that the climate is difficult to live in.
Not for Judeans.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.
- Of Judea?
- Yes.
I asked for Alexandria.
But it seems the wilderness needs my particular talents.
The scorpions and holy prophets can't get on without me.
Lay the dust of Judea, at least for this evening.
Goats and Jehovah.
[ARRIUS CHUCKLES]
You're leaving.
I must.
It's a journey I can't keep you from.
Your eyes have never left it all these months.
I can recognize pain.
But still, my counsel is to wait.
Gratus is to be replaced.
The governorship goes to Pontius Pilate.
When?
Very soon.
It's very much to our purpose.
Nothing is to the purpose if, when I come back to Judea, I come too late.
That is the thought which has punished me every moment I've spent here.
Will Rome see you again?
Here is a part of my life which you have made for me.
I shall remember it.
Whoever the gods are, they take small interest in an old man's hopes.
They have their way.
Forgive me.
You're a stranger here.
Would you be from Nazareth?
Why do you ask?
I thought you might be the one...
The one that I have come back from my country to find.
He would be about your age.
Who?
When I find him I shall know him.
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.
SHEIK:
Hyah!
Hyah!
Sack of flesh without brains!
No!
No!
Not the whip!
That is my host.
SHEIK:
Gently!
Gently!
Fool!
Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood!
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run!
Go on!
SHEIK:
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!
Beautiful horses.
Now!
Now!
They are ready!
Let them go!
Watch.
They'll never hold the turn.
SHEIK:
No!
No!
Abadon, stop him!
Stop that whip!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill!
SHEIK:
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!
You think you can treat my horses like animals?
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!
Get off, idiot!
SHEIK:
Drive goats, not horses!
Now I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.
Hmm?
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.
Not a team?
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.
- Antares.
- The slow one?
SHEIK:
Uh-huh.
I think he should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?
In the circus in Rome.
You have driven in the great circus?
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.
No other animal has descended so in scale from the first innocent falling of the world.
[SHEIK CHUCKLES]
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.
Yes.
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.
Your coming here was so fit, so right.
We might have achieved wonders.
You have to go.
I make a journey which will not wait.
Well, then perhaps you will come back.
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.
I have no wives.
No wives at all?
I have six, no, seven.
BALTHASAR:
Ha, ha.
I've counted eight.
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.
- Someday, I hope to have one.
- One wife!
Ha, ha, one God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.
It is not generous.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
[BURPS]
- Was the food not to your liking?
- Indeed.
[BURPS]
Thank you.
Thank you.
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.
And now I must say good night to my beauties.
When they're ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.
- I'll make my farewells then.
- No, no, no, stay.
Stay and see them.
Come, my children.
Come.
Strangers make them shy.
Come.
Come, do not be afraid.
Come.
There, my children.
They are descended from the Arabians of the first Pharaohs and I have named them for the stars.
Come, Antares.
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.
[ANTARES WHINNIES]
What?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.
Come, Rigel.
We've both supped well, and the world is good.
[CHUCKLES]
There's my good Rigel.
Ah.
Yes, you are ready for sleep.
The day's work done for you, eh?
Ah.
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.
Good night.
Good night, my treasure.
Ah!
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.
No.
You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.
[CHUCKLES]
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.
You should see their mother, Mira.
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.
All right, all right.
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.
You must be strong and swift.
Go, my children.
Go.
When they reach Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams not to mention the champion of the East, Messala, with his black devils.
He stops at nothing to win.
- Messala?
In the circus?
- Yes.
You knew him?
I know him.
Perhaps without much liking.
Judah Ben-Hur, my people are praying for a man to drive their team to victory over Messala.
You could be that man, the one to stamp his arrogance into the sand.
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.
It's not possible.
That is a pity.
Think of it.
To break his pride to humble this tribune before the very people he has degraded.
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!
I know it is not possible.
Does it not delight your imagination?
Does it not answer your purpose?
I must deal with Messala in my own way.
And your way is to kill him.
I see this terrible thing in your eyes, Judah Ben-Hur.
But no matter what this man has done, you have no right to take his life.
He will be punished inevitably.
I don't believe in miracles.
But all life is a miracle.
Why will you not accept God's judgment?
You do not believe in miracles.
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness and a star led me to a village called Bethlehem where I found a newborn child in a manger.
And God lived in this child.
By now, he is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.
That is why I have returned here so that I may be at hand when he comes among us.
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.
Perhaps he's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.
Perhaps he is a shepherd a merchant, a fisherman.
But he lives and all our lives from now on will carry his mark.
There are many paths to God, my son.
I hope yours will not be too difficult.
I'm ready for sleep.
Balthasar is a good man but until all men are like him, we must keep our swords bright.
And our intention true.
So I must leave you.
One last thought.
There is no law in the arena.
Many are killed.
I hope to see you again.
MERCHANT:
Fine Damascus silk.
Fine Damascus silk.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Esther?
[ESTHER GASPS]
It's Judah.
[GASPS]
Judah.
- You are alive.
- Esther.
You are alive.
What are you doing here?
What has happened?
[ESTHER SOBBING]
Shh.
I'm here.
I'm with you.
Esther.
Where's your father?
Hmm?
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.
They tortured him.
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.
You never went back to Antioch?
No.
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.
Esther.
Where are my mother and sister?
SIMONIDES:
Esther.
Let me tell him first.
Father.
Father, something wonderful has happened.
- Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
- Judah.
He has come home.
He is here.
Judah.
Judah Ben-Hur.
My dear old friend.
Let me look at you.
Let me see you.
Yes, yes.
It is true.
Praise God for his mercy.
Where are they?
Since that terrible day there has been no word of them.
You should have been less loyal.
Do not pity me, Master Judah.
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.
We were released on the same day.
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.
Since then, I have been his tongue and he has been my legs.
Together, we make a considerable man.
Old friend.
She always said you would return.
She never gave up hope.
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.
I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.
But suppose that isn't possible.
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.
They could not make me tell them where it is.
It is there still to put power into our hands and buy death for the Romans.
That's not why I came back.
Judah, they are dead.
Four years.
No one could live so long in the dungeons.
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?
SIMONIDES:
Yes, it is true.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You have come back to us like a returning faith.
Judah, I should like to laugh again.
- Let us laugh.
- We will.
There will be joy again in this house.
We will celebrate among the dust.
[SOBBING]
I will take him.
We stood here before.
A long while ago.
Four years.
But now it seems as if only yesterday...
I was saying:
"If you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye."
"If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said."
I am not a bride.
Why did you never marry?
My father needed me.
And also...
It's still on my finger.
I said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.
It's become a part of my hand.
If Messala once knew you were here...
As he must.
He will know where they are.
And if you should find?
- If he should tell you they're dead...
- Then Messala will wish they were living.
I've seen too much of what hate can do.
My father is burned up with it.
But I've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater and love more powerful than hatred.
I believe it.
- Esther.
- Judah.
Stay alive.
Keep away from Messala.
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.
That time isn't yet come.
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.
This time you will be destroyed.
You'll die.
Tribune, compliments of Quintus Arrius.
He awaits your pleasure.
- Consul here?
- Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.
Thank him.
Bring him to me.
- I didn't know the consul had a son.
- He's a champion of the great circus.
Why is he here presenting me with gifts?
- Perhaps he'll race against you.
- Look.
It's magnificent.
And from a man I've never met.
You're wrong, Messala.
Judah.
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?
You were the magician, Messala.
You condemned me to the galleys.
When my ship was sunk, I saved the consul's life.
You know his seal?
Now I have come back as I swore I would.
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.
You suggest I use it on myself?
What has become of my mother and my sister?
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.
Find them, Messala.
Restore them to me, and I'll forget what I vowed with every stroke of that oar you chained me to.
I am not the governor of Judea.
I can do nothing without approval.
Then get it.
I will come back tomorrow.
Don't disappoint me, Messala.
What became of them?
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?
Go to the citadel, Drusus.
Find out.
- And if they're dead?
- They're dead!
"Miriam, wife.
Tirzah, daughter."
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?
East section lower level.
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.
PRISONER 1:
Water.
Water.
PRISONER 2:
Let me out!
PRISONER 3:
Hear us!
Hear us!
[POUNDING]
- How long since you've seen them?
- Never.
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.
The food disappears.
Lepers.
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.
Then we'll burn out the cell.
[COUGHING]
ESTHER:
Is someone there?
[RUSTLING]
There is someone there.
Who are you?
MIRIAM:
Don't come any closer.
Who are you?
Esther.
It's Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam?
MIRIAM:
Stay where you are.
You have come home.
MIRIAM:
Stand back, Esther.
We are lepers.
[GASPS]
Oh, Esther.
Tirzah.
Esther is Judah living?
Yes, he is alive.
He is here.
Where?
He is searching for you now.
I must find him and tell him.
MIRIAM:
No!
- Tell my father.
MIRIAM:
No.
Tell no one.
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.
We won't return.
But Judah has to be told.
MIRIAM:
No.
Please.
I couldn't see his face.
Is it changed?
No, he is not changed.
He...
He's not changed.
You love him, Esther.
Promise me on your love for him you will never tell him you've seen us.
Is he never to know?
Let him remember us as we were.
Promise me.
There's nothing else I can hope for.
Only this.
I promise you.
I am content.
Wait.
[CRIES]
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.
I pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.
He'll free them.
He wants to survive.
He cannot free them, Judah.
What do you mean?
- I saw them.
- You saw them?
Where?
When did you see them?
They were dead.
When?
When?
When?
In the prison.
When I was waiting for news of my father.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't tell you.
Nor even you, Father.
I was afraid that if you saw Messala...
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.
It's over now.
Over?
- Judah.
- Over?
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.
[SOBBING]
[MURMURING]
[MEN CHUCKLING]
SHEIK:
Gentlemen.
Officers.
Defenders of great Rome's imperium may I enter?
Certainly, sheik.
You do us an unexpected honor.
The noble tribune is most gracious.
And now, the question you're all asking yourselves:
Why am I here?
As you know, I am a gambling man.
The games approach.
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.
But I will back my own poor horses.
No limits?
MARIUS:
Mark me first!
- And me!
MATELLUS:
What odds?
- A moment, please my lords, protectors of the far flung marshes.
May I first, uh, sit down?
MARIUS:
Sit down.
Lie down.
How much will you wager?
- Yes, let's call his game.
SPINTHO:
Give the Arab a seat.
A bench, quickly.
Thank you.
- Now.
- One thousand denarii.
- Two thousand!
- Mark me!
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient.
There is time and money enough for all.
First, gentlemen, the odds.
The tribune has won many times.
The odds should be in the same measure.
Now, what is your pleasure, gentlemen?
MARIUS:
Two to one.
[SHEIK CHUCKLES]
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth where is the courage that made Rome master of the world?
I can get better odds on any street market.
MARIUS:
Three to one.
Let us not haggle.
Let us be fair.
In four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.
- In all truth...
- Just a moment.
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?
Oh.
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.
The Prince of Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur.
Prince of Hur?
[CHUCKLES]
- He was sent to the galleys years ago.
- He has returned.
Returned?
Impossible.
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.
Well?
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.
You, tribune will you give me four to one?
Four to one.
- Good.
- Bravo, Messala.
Four to one, sheik.
The difference between a Roman and a Jew.
Or an Arab.
[ROMANS LAUGH]
[CHUCKLES]
Bravely spoken.
Now we will settle the amount of our wager.
I will venture...
A thousand talents?
- A thousand talents?
- Yes, a thousand talents.
Of course, if it is too much...
A thousand talents it will be.
Agreed.
[MURMURING]
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.
You're good fellows.
If only men were this good.
Hey!
Remember, Altair nine times around the circus, huh?
Aldebaran.
Hey, ha, ha.
Rigel, did you hear?
Nine lives to live.
My swift fellow.
You must not win the race the first time around.
You win the last time around.
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.
Steady Antares.
Like a rock.
You will be our anchor.
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.
They have taken me into their family.
Rest well, my stars.
Tomorrow we go up to the city.
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it the news will scorch the streets of the whole Roman world.
Pontius Pilate here?
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.
You will make him see what men are born in this land.
I only know that I race against Messala.
ATTENDANT:
Look for the yoke.
Ease that strap.
BEN-HUR:
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.
Into your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as you will.
The Star of David.
To shine out for your people and my people together and blind the eyes of Rome.
[TRUMPETS PLAYING]
They are ready.
ATTENDANT:
Ready, off!
MAN:
Easy, girl, easy.
STARTER:
Number five.
Where is number five?
Whoa.
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.
Yes, this is the day.
SHEIK:
Judah!
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.
[TRUMPETS PLAYING]
Hail, Jupiter.
Give me victory.
[BRASS BAND PLAYING]
[CROWD CHEERING]
ATTENDANT:
Watch your line!
Keep your places!
MAN:
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.
Citizens I welcome you to these games in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.
We dedicate them to his glory and to the glory of Rome of which you are all part.
Let us honor those who race for us today.
They come here from Alexandria Messina Carthage Cyprus Rome Corinth Athens Phrygia and Judea.
[CROWD ROARS]
To the best of these, a crown of victory.
The race begins.
Hail, Caesar!
CROWD:
Hail, Caesar!
Oh, you dog!
Come, my children, come!
The Roman pig!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Steady!
Now, now!
[BAND PLAYING TRIUMPHANT MUSIC]
OFFICER:
Salute.
A great victory.
You are the people's one true god for the time being.
Permit us to worship.
I crown their god.
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.
A long life, young Arrius, and the good sense to live it.
[HEAVY BREATHING]
We cannot wait, tribune.
MESSALA:
He will come.
He will...
[COUGHS AND GASPS]
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.
He will come!
He will come.
I've sent for him, and he will come.
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.
Do you understand?
To hack the legs off me?
Not yet.
Not till I've seen him.
I don't receive him with half a body.
No.
No!
[MESSALA GRUNTING]
I told you, Drusus.
I told you.
Here he is.
Triumph c...
Triumph complete, Judah.
The race won.
The enemy destroyed.
I see no enemy.
What do you think you see?
The smashed body of a wretched animal?
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.
Let me help you.
[GROANS]
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.
Dead.
And the race over.
It isn't over, Judah.
They're not dead.
Where are they?
Look for them in the Valley of the Lepers if you can recognize them.
[BEN-HUR YELLS]
It goes on.
It goes on, Judah.
The race...
The race is not over.
Is there a way down here?
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.
Man.
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.
MAN:
There...
There are many women.
Of the family of Hur.
We have no names here.
For them?
- Why did you tell me they were dead?
- It was what they wanted.
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?
Not to see them?
They are coming.
Love them in the way they must need to be loved.
Not to look at them.
Let them be as if you had never come here.
Please!
Judah!
Is Judah well?
Is he happy?
ESTHER:
Yes, he is well.
Your mind can be at rest for him.
He is well, Miriam.
MIRIAM:
God be with you.
They have gone.
We can go back.
Go back to what?
Judah, they have one blessing left.
To think you remember them as they were and live your own life.
Forget what is here.
Forget?
It's as though they were alive in a grave.
- But what can you do?
- Undo what you've done.
How could you have suffered them to come here?
I must see them.
No, Judah, please!
Judah!
Think, Judah, think.
It would tear them apart if they see you.
Judah!
Judah.
He is here.
I have found him.
The child has become a man.
And the man, I know it now, is the son of God.
The promise is true.
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.
Life has been answered.
God has answered it.
Come.
Come with me.
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys thirst had nearly killed me.
A man gave me water to drink.
I went on living.
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.
No.
I am thirsty still.
Come and listen.
I have business with Rome.
You insist on death.
Goodbye, Judah.
You sent for me?
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.
- I honor him.
- As you may honor yourself.
You have been made a citizen of Rome.
Do you say nothing to this?
I have just come from the Valley of Stone where my mother and sister live what's left of their lives.
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.
I have heard this.
There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.
Where there is greatness, great government or power even great feeling or compassion error also is great.
We progress and mature by fault.
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.
There are other voices.
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place not to crucify yourself on a shadow such as old resentment or impossible loyalties.
Perfect freedom has no existence.
A grown man knows the world he lives in.
And for the present, the world is Rome.
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.
I am Judah Ben-Hur.
I cross this floor in spoken friendship as I would speak to Arrius.
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar ready to crush all those who challenge his authority.
There are too many small men of envy and ambition who try to disrupt the government of Rome.
You have become the victor and hero to those people.
They look to you, their one true god, as I called you.
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.
I am already part of this tragedy.
Return this to Arrius.
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you from personal disaster if you stay here.
You are too great a danger.
Leave Judea.
You have my word.
Judah!
Oh, Judah!
I was afraid you would never come back afraid of what would happen to you.
But I see you again.
Your father's waiting for me.
Where is he?
What do you mean to do?
Oh, Judah.
Rest, sleep.
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.
Peace?
Love and peace.
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?
Where do you see them?
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.
Balthasar's word.
He is more than Balthasar's word.
His voice traveled with such a still purpose.
It was more than a voice.
A man more than a man.
He said, "Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God."
Children of God?
In that dead valley where we left them?
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean until we have scoured off our bodies the crust and filth of being at the mercy of tyranny.
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.
- In blood?
- Yes, in blood!
I know there is a law in life.
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.
Death generates death as the vulture breeds the vulture.
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:
"Love your enemy.
Do good to those who despitefully use you."
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.
As you make us do now.
Are we to bear nothing together?
Even love?
I can hardly draw breath without feeling you in my heart.
But I know that everything I do from this moment will be as great a pain to you as you have ever suffered.
It is better not to love me.
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy giving evil for evil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.
It's as though you had become Messala.
I've lost you, Judah.
MIRIAM:
No further.
What are you doing here?
I was here last evening waiting for you.
I have waited all night.
What has happened?
Where is Tirzah?
Leave the food.
I am coming closer.
Don't be afraid.
- What are you doing?
- Don't be afraid.
I've heard him again, the man from Nazareth.
If ever words were from God, they are in everything he says.
I cannot bear that you should have never known this hand of quiet reaching towards us.
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find him there.
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find him.
[MIRIAM WHIMPERS]
Tirzah is dying.
Leave the food and go.
It's Judah.
Why did you tell him?
Yes, Judah, yes.
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.
Mother.
Wait, Mother, wait.
Let me talk with you.
MIRIAM:
Please.
No, no further.
Please.
No, Judah.
Son, no.
Mother, let me see Tirzah.
Tirzah is dying.
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know that life is everlasting and death is nothing to fear if you have faith.
I will take them to him.
[MIRIAM SHRIEKS]
No!
God, no!
[MIRIAM SOBBING]
No, no, dear son.
Mother where is Tirzah?
Judah, no.
You must not go to her, dear son.
Please.
Dear son.
I am afraid.
ESTHER:
No cause.
The world is more than we know.
[TIRZAH WHIMPERING]
Tirzah, it's Judah.
No.
No, Judah.
No, Judah.
No.
[TIRZAH SOBBING]
BEGGAR:
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
BEN-HUR:
Why are the streets deserted?
- They have gone to the trial.
- Alms for the blind?
- Trial?
Whose trial?
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.
- This cannot be true.
- Alms?
What has he done?
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.
Help for the blind.
WOMAN:
Look, lepers!
GIRL:
Lepers!
MAN 1:
Go away!
MAN 2:
Get away!
Stay away!
Go away!
[MURMURING]
Lepers!
Lepers!
How can this be?
I know this man.
Will someone help him?
TIRZAH:
Take pity on him.
WOMAN:
Have mercy.
Have mercy.
MIRIAM:
In his pain this look of peace.
Watch over them, Esther.
We must go back.
I brought you here to this when I hoped...
You haven't failed, Esther.
MAN:
Hail King of the Jews!
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.
He gave me water and a heart to live.
What has he done to merit this?
He has taken the world of our sins onto himself.
To this end he said he was born in that stable where I first saw him.
For this cause, he came into the world.
For this death?
This beginning.
I have lived too long.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
As though he were carrying in that cross the pain of the world.
So fearful, and yet why is it I'm not afraid anymore?
[THUNDER RUMBLES]
The shadow of a storm.
A strange darkness but still day.
[RUMBLING INTENSIFIES]
His life is over.
[WIND HOWLING]
[THUNDER CRASHING]
TIRZAH:
What is it?
This tearing.
I am in pain.
I feel it too.
Miriam.
I thought I...
Miriam.
Do you see your hand?
Tirzah.
Miriam.
Tirzah.
Almost at the moment he died I heard him say, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do."
- Even then.
- Even then.
And I felt his voice take the sword out of my hand.
In the year of our Lord Judea, for nearly a century, had lain under the mastery of Rome.
In the seventh year of the reign of Augustus Caesar an imperial decree ordered every Judean each to return to his place of birth to be counted and taxed.
The converging ways of many of them led to their capital city, Jerusalem the troubled heart of their land.
The old city was dominated by the fortress of Antonia the seat of Roman power and by the great golden temple the outward sign of an inward and imperishable faith.
Even while they obeyed the will of Caesar the people clung proudly to their ancient heritage always remembering the promise of their prophets that one day there would be born among them a redeemer to bring them salvation and perfect freedom.
You'll be counted at Hebron.
- Name?
- Samuel.
- What city?
- Joppa.
- What family?
- Michael.
- Move on.
Move on.
- Yes.
- Name?
- Joseph.
- What city?
- Nazareth.
- What family?
- David of Bethlehem.
- And the woman?
- My wife.
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.
Come on, come on.
What village is this?
Nazareth.
We should arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow night.
You're not watching the soldiers, Joseph?
We've seen Romans before.
Yes and we will see them again.
My table is not finished.
Where is your son?
- He's walking in the hills.
- Mm-hm.
He neglects his work, Joseph.
No.
Once, I reproached him with forgetting his work.
He said to me:
"I must be about my father's business."
Then why isn't he here, working?
He's working.
Trumpeters of the legion!
Welcome, Messala.
The command is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for relieving me.
Drusus when I was a boy, I dreamed of commanding this garrison.
Now the wheel has turned.
I am in command.
Attention!
Aisle one, face right!
Forward!
I'd forgotten the heat.
If it were only the heat.
I lived here until I was 14.
Jerusalem was my home.
- My father was head of...
- Yes, I know.
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.
If there can be such a thing in this forsaken land.
If you want to rise, Sextus, do the difficult.
I asked to be sent here.
I think you'll find the people changed since you were a boy.
In what way?
Oh, won't pay their taxes, an irrational resentment of Rome....
There's nothing new in all that.
And then there's religion.
I tell you, they're drunk with religion.
They smash the statues of our gods, even those of the emperor.
Punish them.
We do.
When we can find them.
Find the leaders.
Oh, you don't know.
There's nothing you can put your finger on.
I tell you, there are strange forces at work here.
For instance, this "messiah" business...
I know.
There was one predicted when I was a boy.
A king of the Jews, who will lead them into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.
Makes your head spin.
There's a wild man in the desert named John who drowns people in water.
And a carpenter's son who does magic tricks. "Miracles" they call them.
There's always a rabble-rouser stirring up trouble.
No, no, no.
This man is different.
He teaches that God is near, in every man.
It's actually quite profound, some of it.
You've been too long away from Rome.
Go back, Sextus.
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea and forget that God is in every man.
- There is divinity in only one man.
- Yes, I know.
The emperor is displeased.
He wishes Judea made into a more obedient and disciplined province.
He has ordered me to restore order.
I intend to carry out his wishes.
But how?
You can break a man's skull, arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.
But how do you control what's up here?
How do you fight an idea?
Especially a new idea.
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.
I assume he has a name.
- He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
- Then treat him like one!
Tell him I will join him.
Yes, tribune.
Centurion!
This was his country before it was ours.
Don't forget that.
Yes, tribune.
Very wise.
This Ben-Hur is the richest man in Jerusalem.
And the head of one of the greatest families in Judea.
We were friends as boys.
We were like brothers.
Sextus you ask how to fight an idea.
Well, I'll tell you how.
With another idea.
I said I'd come back.
I never thought you would.
I'm so glad.
- Look at you.
- Look at you!
You've come back a tribune.
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.
We'll drink another now.
- Your sister and mother?
- They're fine.
They've talked of you ever since we knew you were coming.
- ls Tirzah married?
- No.
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.
She's been in love with you since she was 5.
I can't wait to see them.
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?
Or have you become too dignified?
- Down Eros, up Mars!
- Down Eros, up Mars!
Where the beams cross?
Good.
After all these years!
Still close.
In every way.
I hope so.
I know.
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew whose life you once saved.
The best thing I ever did.
Judah it will be very difficult to govern here.
I'm going to need help.
Your help.
Your advice.
- You want my advice?
- Yes, I do.
Withdraw your legions.
Give us our freedom.
Unfortunately, the emperor is devoted to his empire.
He's particularly fond of Judea.
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.
Is there anything so sad as unrequited love?
My quarters.
Hmm.
A bit grim.
Not grim.
Austere.
Virtuous.
Roman.
I'm going to be second-in-command to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.
He's arriving in a few days with two more legions.
Then the rumors are true.
The emperor does not approve of your countrymen.
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.
But you and your family need have no concern.
I'm next in authority to the governor, and you're my friend.
- I'm a Jew.
- Ah, you are like a Roman!
What have you in common with the troublemaking rabble?
Rabble?
They're my people.
I'm one of them.
Be wise, Judah.
It's a Roman world. if you want to live in it, you must become part of it.
You've changed.
I've grown up.
I've seen the world since I left Jerusalem.
I've seen Rome.
It's no accident that one small village on the Tiber was chosen to rule the world.
Your legions.
It wasn't just our legions.
Other countries have armies, fine armies.
I know, I fought them.
Oh, no.
No, it was fate that chose us to civilize the world.
And we have.
Our roads and ships connect every corner of the earth.
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.
I believe in the future of my people.
Of course you do.
And you can help them.
How?
You're an aristocrat.
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince among your people.
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.
They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.
Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.
It is worse than stupid, futile!
For it can end in only one way, extinction for your people!
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.
Then we're agreed!
Now, when can I come to see your family?
- We had hoped tomorrow.
- Good.
And now for our toast.
It's dreadful wine, by the way.
It's especially fermented for the Roman army.
You're very cruel to your conquerors.
It's an insane world.
But in it there is one sanity:
The loyalty of old friends.
Judah, we must believe in one another.
Will you drink to that?
With all my heart.
Here it is, the place I've remembered.
The court where we played at changing the guard.
The roof where we'd throw pebbles at people in the street and then hide.
- We were rascals, weren't we?
- No, you were good boys.
I would have that time again.
And here it is.
Nothing has changed.
Except for the fountain.
- The old well would go dry, remember?
- Promptly, every summer.
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.
- He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
- No?
Of course he has.
He was a boy when he left us, now he's a man.
With great responsibilities.
Come.
The emperor builds and builds, turning brick to marble.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.
I've never seen anything like this before.
It's beautiful!
- ls it Roman?
- It's Libyan.
I was there last year.
A tremendous campaign.
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.
Or was, till we destroyed it.
Now it's nothing but ashes.
I'm boring you with soldier stories.
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.
Thank you for this.
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.
What do you think of it?
Magnificent.
It's Arabic.
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.
Let me try him sometime.
Whenever you like.
He's yours.
Do you mean you'll give me this?
Oh, Judah.
You are good.
It's going to be like old times, I know it.
Judah, tell me, did you think about what I said?
Yes.
Talked to a number of people already.
Spoken against violence, against incidents.
Most of the men agree with me.
Most?
Not all?
- No, not all.
- Who does not agree?
Well, the resentful, the impatient.
Who are they?
Yes, Judah.
Who are they?
Would I retain your friendship if I became an informer?
Telling the names of criminals is not informing.
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.
Patriots?
!
Judah.
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.
This is my great opportunity, and yours too.
If I bring order here, I can have any post I want.
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?
Rome!
Yes, perhaps at the side of Caesar himself.
I mean it.
It can happen and this is the moment.
I swear, this is the time.
The emperor is watching us, judging us.
All I need do is serve him.
And all you need do is help me serve him.
- You speak as if he were God.
- He is God.
The only God.
He is power, real power on earth, not...
Not that.
Help me, Judah.
I would do anything for you, Messala except betray my own people.
In the name of all the gods, what do the lives of a few Jews mean to you?
If I cannot persuade them, that does not mean I would help you murder them.
Besides, you must understand this, Messala.
I believe in the past and future of my people.
Future?
You are a conquered people.
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?
Joshua will not rise again to save you nor David.
There is only one reality in the world today.
Look to the West.
Don't be a fool!
Look to Rome!
Better a fool than a traitor or a killer.
- I am a soldier.
- Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.
- I warn you...
- No!
I warn you.
Rome is an affront to God.
Rome is strangling my people and my country, the whole earth!
But not forever.
And I tell you, the day Rome falls there will be a shout of freedom such as the world has never heard before.
Judah.
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.
You're either for me or against me.
If that is the choice then I am against you.
There they are.
Where's Messala?
- Where's...?
- He's gone.
Gone?
- But why?
- He couldn't stay.
- What happened?
- A new tribune must have many duties.
Come.
Let us have dinner.
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the world who bringeth to us bread from the earth.
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.
He wanted to use me to betray our people.
Judah.
- Master, the caravan from Antioch.
- Yes, Amrah, I saw.
Simonides.
- Welcome.
- Judah.
- Oh, welcome homecoming.
- Master.
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.
And for the master, lberian wine.
Not to mention the best gift of all, your presence.
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.
- Caravans from Petra.
- Have all arrived.
- Good.
- Here is the accounting.
And what of Numidia?
The trade route is ours, guaranteed by treaty with the king.
Once a year, you bring your accounting.
And once a year, I find myself wealthier.
Yeah, but my greatest treasure is my steward.
My life belongs to the House of Hur.
Nothing else exists for me, except my daughter.
- She must be a young woman by now.
- Yes, and your property.
She was born the daughter of your slave.
When I inherited you, I inherited a friend, not a slave.
Still, Esther has come with me from Antioch for your permission to marry.
It's granted.
I wish you the joy of many grandchildren.
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.
With your permission, Esther wishes to speak to her master.
You're eager to marry, Esther?
It is my father's wish.
Your husband will be fortunate.
What is his name?
David, son of Mathias.
Of what house?
- His own, master.
- He is a freeman.
Tell me more about him.
I have seen him only once.
He is a merchant, well-thought-of in Antioch.
He will pay for Esther's freedom.
Her freedom will be my wedding gift to Esther.
You are generous, master.
Do you love this man?
I will learn to love him.
You have my permission to marry.
We'll drink to your happiness.
And a safe return to Antioch.
I disturbed you.
No.
What were you thinking?
I was saying goodbye to this city and this house.
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?
My father sometimes brought me here when I was little.
It was a house where I was always happy.
Except once.
When you and your friend, the Roman boy...
- Messala.
- Yes.
You had been out hunting and they brought you home injured.
I touched your face as you lay there and prayed to God, "Don't let this boy die."
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.
Yes, master.
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.
It's strange.
I hardly felt a slave.
And now I hardly feel free.
You know, in the old, wise days of Solomon if there was among his slaves some girl who filled his eyes he could choose her out from the rest and take her to him.
Wise days of Solomon.
Different days.
And long ago.
If you were not a bride I should kiss you goodbye.
If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said.
Your slave ring.
Fair exchange.
Freedom to you.
The ring to me.
You will wear it?
Until you meet the woman you will marry?
Until then.
The gods favor my lord Gratus.
If it is the governor's pleasure, the wreath of office.
Thank you, tribune.
I see no delegation from the city.
- There will not be one, sir.
- No?
Jerusalem's welcome will not be a warm one.
But I pledge, my lord, it will be a quiet one.
Let us proceed.
There's Messala.
He saw you, Judah.
The new governor.
Stand back!
- Stand back.
- Up there.
You, come!
Had to be the Jews!
Open up in the name of the divine emperor!
Judah!
Tirzah!
What is it?
What's happened?
Open up in the name of Rome!
- I was watching the Romans...
- A tile fell and struck the governor.
- It wasn't my fault.
- They won't believe her.
She won't have to say anything.
You hear?
Tirzah, say nothing.
Open the gates!
I'll speak to them.
- Arrest him!
- Wait.
Let me tell you what happened.
- Hold those women.
- Not them!
- Judah!
- İt was an accident.
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.
- This is the man, sir.
We saw him.
- Lt was an accident.
- Accident?
- L swear it.
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose.
It gave way.
Take him.
Take all of them.
- He's telling the truth!
- Lt was me!
Let them go!
Judah!
Attention!
Messala.
In the name of God, tell them it's a mistake.
I leaned on the tile, and it broke loose.
It was an accident.
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!
- Messala!
- Messala.
Let the servants go.
Let them go.
Return to your ranks.
- Come.
- Where?
Tirus.
Tirus?
I've had no trial.
I'm to die in the galleys without even a trial?
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!
Wait.
My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?
Tie his hands.
- At least tell me if they're safe.
- L can tell you nothing.
Get along.
Keep moving.
Jailer!
Guard, in there!
Up the stairs!
Jailer!
To the right.
- Wait!
- Send them out.
Send them out.
You can go.
Go!
The door.
Where are my mother and sister?
Where are they?
Here, within these walls.
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.
Of course, they will be sentenced.
Is it possible, Messala?
Is it possible you could do this to us?
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?
You'll let them go.
You must.
You will gladly let them go!
Messala!
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not mad.
I'm not a murderer!
I know you're not.
You know?
You are evil.
No, Judah, I am not evil.
I wanted your help.
Now you've given it to me.
By making this example of you, I discourage treason.
By condemning without hesitation an old friend, I shall be feared.
But not my family.
Let them go.
Please.
- Messala, I beg you.
- Beg?
!
Didn't I beg you?
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.
Kill me, and your mother and sister will die today nailed to crosses in front of you!
Go on, Judah.
Kill me!
May God grant me vengeance.
I will pray that you live till I return.
Return?
Take him.
Sentries, salute.
The tribune will see you now.
Tribune, I'm steward of the House of Hur.
I remember you.
We were on our way to Antioch when we heard what had happened.
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done this thing.
You knew him, tribune.
Better than you.
Then there must be no doubt in your mind, the charge is groundless.
The prisoners have been sentenced.
- Sentenced?
- But there's no truth in it.
There was never a threat against the governor in Judah's mind.
Surely you must know he would never have done this.
In your heart, you must know it.
Drusus.
This man had better be kept here until we have time to question him.
Hold!
Water for the soldiers.
Soldiers first!
Get away from that well!
No water for them!
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!
Come on, you!
Water for the horses!
- Water.
Water.
- Soldiers first!
Here.
Wait.
No water for him.
God help me.
You!
I said no water for him!
All right, on your feet, all of you!
Get them on their feet!
Back in line, you dog!
On your feet!
Get them going!
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!
Forward, you dogs!
In a few minutes, the consul's barge will be coming alongside.
Be ready to raise oars.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.
- How many rowers?
- Two hundred, consul.
- And reliefs?
- Of 30, every hour.
This man is ill.
Replace him.
- Change him.
- Right, sir.
- This man has been giving you trouble?
- He's insubordinate, consul.
That will stop.
What service have you seen?
Forty-one.
A month's less a day in this ship.
You keep an exact account.
And before?
Three years in other ships.
Three years.
You have the spirit to fight back but the good sense to control it.
Your eyes are full of hate, 41.
That's good.
Hate keeps a man alive.
It gives him strength.
Now, listen to me, all of you.
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
So row well and live.
- Ship ready, consul.
- Strike oars.
Strike oars!
You know that a fleet of Macedonian galleys has been raiding Roman commerce.
The emperor has honored us with the task of seeking out and destroying them.
Battle speed, hortator.
Battle speed!
Attack speed.
Attack speed!
Ramming speed.
Ramming speed!
Rest.
Halt!
Rest!
Why are you here?
I was ordered to report to you during my relief.
Oh, yes.
I'd forgotten.
You could have killed me as I lay there.
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?
I'm not ready to die.
What do you think will save you?
The God of my fathers.
Hmm.
Your God has forsaken you.
He has no more power than the images I pray to.
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.
I might.
Does that interest you, 41?
I can see that it does.
I'm a fighting man by profession, and in my leisure moments it amuses me to train fighting men.
I own some of the best gladiators and charioteers in Rome.
Would you like to become one of them?
To die as your slave?
Better than to live in chains below these decks.
I will not be here forever.
No?
What would you do if you escaped?
Two people were condemned with me, my mother and sister though they were innocent.
I won't rest...
Do not say that you were innocent.
- Would it do any good to say it again?
- No.
Consider my offer carefully.
You will never escape while we are victorious.
If we are not, you will sink with this ship, chained to your oar.
I cannot believe that God has let me live these three years to die chained to an oar.
It's a strange, stubborn faith you keep to believe that existence has a purpose.
A sane man would have learned to lose it long before this.
As you have.
What drove it out of you?
Go back to your oar, 41.
Consul, enemy sighted.
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.
All the watch to battle posts.
- Stand by to load.
- Make ready to fire.
Hurry, quick!
Hurry up with that resin.
Get some more ammunition.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
Chain rowers!
Guard.
Unlock 41.
No!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
41, why did he do that?
I don't know.
Once before, a man helped me.
I didn't know why then.
Normal speed!
Number 1, flame.
- Fire.
- Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Hold withdrawal on command.
Lift oars!
Raise!
Withdraw!
Steersman, right.
Extend oars!
- Fire!
- Fire!
Fire!
- Watch out!
- Fire!
Fire!
Steersman, ram course!
Order below!
Ramming speed!
Ramming speed!
Consul, barge on ramming course.
We're going to be rammed!
We're going to be rammed!
Why did you save me?
Why did you have me unchained?
What is your name, 41?
Judah Ben-Hur. ...let me die.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
Row well and live.
Is the sail square?
I can't tell.
Better for us both if it's the enemy.
My death.
Your freedom.
It's a Roman sail.
Face rear!
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.
Water.
The fleet, all lost?
Five galleys.
- And the battle?
- The battle was won.
You have a victory.
- it was a victory?
- Complete.
In his eagerness to save you your God has also saved the Roman fleet.
Hail Arrius!
Hail Arrius!
Right oars!
You have cleared the seaways of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.
This baton of victory has been nobly won.
This man riding beside you, who is he?
The man who saved me, divine emperor, to return and serve you.
Is that all you know about him?
No.
He was accused of an attack on the governor of Judea.
But he was innocent.
If not, there's a strange inconsistency in this man who tries to kill my governor, yet saves the life of my consul.
Come tomorrow.
We'll talk of it.
We have all the information on this man a man of some influence in his own country.
His attack upon our governor is one upon the senate and the people of Rome.
I am convinced that no such attack was intended.
Consul, allow us to continue.
Allow us to be generous.
As a reward to you for your great victory we shall not send him back to the galleys.
We give him to you as your slave to do with him as you like.
Such is the will of the senate and the people of Rome.
Not long ago, I returned to Rome with a young man who had saved my life.
You all know him as the finest charioteer in Rome.
Five times, he's driven my horses to victory.
I know him as one who stands in the place of the son I lost.
I have the love and pride in a son's achievements which I thought I should never have again.
Nothing could make stronger the bond between us but tonight I wish to share it with you all.
The formalities of adoption have been completed.
Young Arrius is now the legal bearer of my name and the heir to my property.
This ring of my ancestors would have gone to my son.
So now it is yours.
It's a strange destiny that brought me to a new life a new home a new father.
It brought me here.
It may take me away.
But wherever I may be I shall always try to wear this ring as a son of Arrius should.
With gratitude and affection and with honor.
I present my son to you.
My old friend Pontius Pilate, young Arrius.
Before you came to this city, my horses always won.
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.
Yes, but not swift enough to defeat you.
- Tell me, you come from Judea?
- Yes, sir.
I hear that the climate is difficult to live in.
Not for Judeans.
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.
- Of Judea?
- Yes.
I asked for Alexandria.
But it seems the wilderness needs my particular talents.
The scorpions and holy prophets can't get on without me.
Lay the dust of Judea, at least for this evening.
Goats and Jehovah.
You're leaving.
I must.
It's a journey I can't keep you from.
Your eyes have never left it all these months.
I can recognize pain.
But still, my counsel is to wait.
Gratus is to be replaced.
The governorship goes to Pontius Pilate.
When?
Very soon.
It's very much to our purpose.
Nothing is to the purpose if, when I come back to Judea, I come too late.
That is the thought which has punished me every moment I've spent here.
Will Rome see you again?
Here is a part of my life which you have made for me.
I shall remember it.
Whoever the gods are, they take small interest in an old man's hopes.
They have their way.
Forgive me.
You're a stranger here.
Would you be from Nazareth?
Why do you ask?
I thought you might be the one....
The one that I have come back from my country to find.
He would be about your age.
Who?
When I find him I shall know him.
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.
Hyah!
Hyah!
Sack of flesh without brains!
No!
No!
Not the whip!
That is my host.
Gently!
Gently!
Fool!
Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood!
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run!
Go on!
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!
Beautiful horses.
Now!
Now!
They are ready!
Let them go!
Watch.
They'll never hold the turn.
No!
No!
Abadon, stop him!
Stop that whip!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill...!
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!
You think you can treat my horses like animals?
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!
Get off, idiot!
Drive goats, not horses!
Now I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.
Hmm?
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.
Not a team?
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.
- Antares.
- The slow one?
Uh-huh.
I think he should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?
In the circus in Rome.
You have driven in the great circus?
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.
No other animal has descended so in scale from the first innocent falling of the world.
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.
Yes.
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.
Your coming here was so fit, so right.
We might have achieved wonders.
You have to go.
I make a journey which will not wait.
Well, then perhaps you will come back.
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.
I have no wives.
No wives at all?
I have six, no, seven.
Ha, ha.
I've counted eight.
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.
- Someday, I hope to have one.
- One wife!
Ha, ha, one God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.
It is not generous.
- Was the food not to your liking?
- Indeed.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.
And now I must say good night to my beauties.
When they're ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.
- I'll make my farewells then.
- No, no, no, stay.
Stay and see them.
Come, my children.
Come.
Strangers make them shy.
Come.
Come, do not be afraid.
Come.
There, my children.
They are descended from the Arabians of the first Pharaohs and I have named them for the stars.
Come, Antares.
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.
What?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.
Come, Rigel.
We've both supped well, and the world is good.
There's my good Rigel.
Ah.
Yes, you are ready for sleep.
The day's work done for you, eh?
Ah.
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.
Good night.
Good night, my treasure.
Ah!
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.
No.
You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.
You should see their mother, Mira.
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.
All right, all right.
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.
You must be strong and swift.
Go, my children.
Go.
When they reach Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams not to mention the champion of the East, Messala, with his black devils.
He stops at nothing to win.
- Messala?
In the circus?
- Yes.
You knew him?
I know him.
Perhaps without much liking.
Judah Ben-Hur, my people are praying for a man to drive their team to victory over Messala.
You could be that man, the one to stamp his arrogance into the sand.
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.
It's not possible.
That is a pity.
Think of it.
To break his pride to humble this tribune before the very people he has degraded.
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!
I know it is not possible.
Does it not delight your imagination?
Does it not answer your purpose?
I must deal with Messala in my own way.
And your way is to kill him.
I see this terrible thing in your eyes, Judah Ben-Hur.
But no matter what this man has done, you have no right to take his life.
He will be punished inevitably.
I don't believe in miracles.
But all life is a miracle.
Why will you not accept God's judgment?
You do not believe in miracles.
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness and a star led me to a village called Bethlehem where I found a newborn child in a manger.
And God lived in this child.
By now, he is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.
That is why I have returned here so that I may be at hand when he comes among us.
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.
Perhaps he's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.
Perhaps he is a shepherd a merchant, a fisherman.
But he lives and all our lives from now on will carry his mark.
There are many paths to God, my son.
I hope yours will not be too difficult.
I'm ready for sleep.
Balthasar is a good man but until all men are like him, we must keep our swords bright.
And our intention true.
So I must leave you.
One last thought.
There is no law in the arena.
Many are killed.
I hope to see you again.
Fine Damascus silk.
Fine Damascus silk.
Esther?
It's Judah.
Judah.
- You are alive.
- Esther.
You are alive.
What are you doing here?
What has happened?
Shh.
I'm here.
I'm with you.
Esther.
Where's your father?
Hmm?
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.
They tortured him.
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.
You never went back to Antioch?
No.
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.
Esther.
Where are my mother and sister?
Esther.
Let me tell him first.
Father.
Father, something wonderful has happened.
- Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
- Judah.
He has come home.
He is here.
Judah.
Judah Ben-Hur.
My dear old friend.
Let me look at you.
Let me see you.
Yes, yes.
It is true.
Praise God for his mercy.
Where are they?
Since that terrible day there has been no word of them.
You should have been less loyal.
Do not pity me, Master Judah.
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.
We were released on the same day.
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.
Since then, I have been his tongue and he has been my legs.
Together, we make a considerable man.
Old friend.
She always said you would return.
She never gave up hope.
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.
I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.
But suppose that isn't possible.
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.
They could not make me tell them where it is.
It is there still to put power into our hands and buy death for the Romans.
That's not why I came back.
Judah, they are dead.
Four years.
No one could live so long in the dungeons.
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?
Yes, it is true.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You have come back to us like a returning faith.
Judah, I should like to laugh again.
- Let us laugh.
- We will.
There will be joy again in this house.
We will celebrate among the dust.
I will take him.
We stood here before.
A long while ago.
Four years.
But now it seems as if only yesterday....
I was saying:
"If you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye."
"If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said."
I am not a bride.
Why did you never marry?
My father needed me.
And also....
It's still on my finger.
I said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.
It's become a part of my hand.
If Messala once knew you were here....
As he must.
He will know where they are.
And if you should find...?
- if he should tell you they're dead...
- Then Messala will wish they were living.
I've seen too much of what hate can do.
My father is burned up with it.
But I've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater and love more powerful than hatred.
I believe it.
- Esther.
- Judah.
Stay alive.
Keep away from Messala.
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.
That time isn't yet come.
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.
This time you will be destroyed.
You'll die.
Tribune, compliments of Quintus Arrius.
He awaits your pleasure.
- Consul here?
- Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.
Thank him.
Bring him to me.
- I didn't know the consul had a son.
- He's a champion of the great circus.
Why is he here presenting me with gifts?
- Perhaps he'll race against you.
- Look.
It's magnificent.
And from a man I've never met.
You're wrong, Messala.
Judah.
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?
You were the magician, Messala.
You condemned me to the galleys.
When my ship was sunk, I saved the consul's life.
You know his seal?
Now I have come back as I swore I would.
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.
You suggest I use it on myself?
What has become of my mother and my sister?
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.
Find them, Messala.
Restore them to me, and I'll forget what I vowed with every stroke of that oar you chained me to.
I am not the governor of Judea.
I can do nothing without approval.
Then get it.
I will come back tomorrow.
Don't disappoint me, Messala.
What became of them?
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?
Go to the citadel, Drusus.
Find out.
- And if they're dead?
- They're dead!
"Miriam, wife.
Tirzah, daughter."
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?
East section lower level.
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.
Water.
Water.
Let me out!
Hear us!
Hear us!
- How long since you've seen them?
- Never.
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.
The food disappears.
Lepers.
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.
Then we'll burn out the cell.
Is someone there?
There is someone there.
Who are you?
Don't come any closer.
Who are you?
Esther.
It's Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam?
Stay where you are.
You have come home.
Stand back, Esther.
We are lepers.
Oh, Esther.
Tirzah.
Esther is Judah living?
Yes, he is alive.
He is here.
Where?
He is searching for you now.
I must find him and tell him.
- No!
- Tell my father.
No.
Tell no one.
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.
We won't return.
But Judah has to be told.
No.
Please.
I couldn't see his face.
Is it changed?
No, he is not changed.
He....
He's not changed.
You love him, Esther.
Promise me on your love for him you will never tell him you've seen us.
Is he never to know?
Let him remember us as we were.
Promise me.
There's nothing else I can hope for.
Only this.
I promise you.
I am content.
Wait.
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.
I pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.
He'll free them.
He wants to survive.
He cannot free them, Judah.
What do you mean?
- I saw them.
- You saw them?
Where?
When did you see them?
They were dead.
When?
When?
When?
In the prison.
When I was waiting for news of my father.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't tell you.
Nor even you, Father.
I was afraid that if you saw Messala....
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.
It's over now.
Over?
- Judah.
- Over?
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.
Gentlemen.
Officers.
Defenders of great Rome's imperium may I enter?
Certainly, sheik.
You do us an unexpected honor.
The noble tribune is most gracious.
And now, the question you're all asking yourselves:
Why am I here?
As you know, I am a gambling man.
The games approach.
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.
But I will back my own poor horses.
No limits?
- Mark me first!
- And me!
- What odds?
- A moment, please my lords, protectors of the far flung marshes.
May I first, uh, sit down?
Sit down.
Lie down.
How much will you wager?
- Yes, let's call his game.
- Give the Arab a seat.
A bench, quickly.
Thank you.
- Now.
- One thousand denarii.
- Two thousand!
- Mark me!
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient.
There is time and money enough for all.
First, gentlemen, the odds.
The tribune has won many times.
The odds should be in the same measure.
Now, what is your pleasure, gentlemen?
Two to one.
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth where is the courage that made Rome master of the world?
I can get better odds on any street market.
Three to one.
Let us not haggle.
Let us be fair.
In four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.
- In all truth...
- Just a moment.
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?
Oh.
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.
The Prince of Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur.
Prince of Hur?
- He was sent to the galleys years ago.
- He has returned.
Returned?
Impossible.
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.
Well?
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.
You, tribune will you give me four to one?
Four to one.
- Good.
- Bravo, Messala.
Four to one, sheik.
The difference between a Roman and a Jew.
Or an Arab.
Bravely spoken.
Now we will settle the amount of our wager.
I will venture....
A thousand talents?
- A thousand talents?
- Yes, a thousand talents.
Of course, if it is too much....
A thousand talents it will be.
Agreed.
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.
You're good fellows.
If only men were this good.
Hey!
Remember, Altair nine times around the circus, huh?
Aldebaran.
Hey, ha, ha.
Rigel, did you hear?
Nine lives to live.
My swift fellow.
You must not win the race the first time around.
You win the last time around.
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.
Steady Antares.
Like a rock.
You will be our anchor.
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.
They have taken me into their family.
Rest well, my stars.
Tomorrow we go up to the city.
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it the news will scorch the streets of the whole Roman world.
Pontius Pilate here?
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.
You will make him see what men are born in this land.
I only know that I race against Messala.
Look for the yoke.
Ease that strap.
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.
Into your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as you will.
The Star of David.
To shine out for your people and my people together and blind the eyes of Rome.
They are ready.
Ready, off!
Easy, girl, easy.
Number five.
Where is number five?
Whoa.
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.
Yes, this is the day.
Judah!
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.
Hail, Jupiter.
Give me victory.
Watch your line!
Keep your places!
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.
Citizens I welcome you to these games in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.
We dedicate them to his glory and to the glory of Rome of which you are all part.
Let us honor those who race for us today.
They come here from Alexandria Messina Carthage Cyprus Rome Corinth Athens Phrygia and Judea.
To the best of these, a crown of victory.
The race begins.
Hail, Caesar!
Hail, Caesar!
Oh, you dog!
Come, my children, come!
The Roman pig!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Steady!
Now, now!
Salute.
A great victory.
You are the people's one true god for the time being.
Permit us to worship.
I crown their god.
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.
A long life, young Arrius, and the good sense to live it.
We cannot wait, tribune.
He will come.
He will...
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.
He will come!
He will come.
I've sent for him, and he will come.
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.
Do you understand?
To hack the legs off me?
Not yet.
Not till I've seen him.
I don't receive him with half a body.
No.
No!
I told you, Drusus.
I told you.
Here he is.
Triumph c...
Triumph complete, Judah.
The race won.
The enemy destroyed.
I see no enemy.
What do you think you see?
The smashed body of a wretched animal?
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.
Let me help you.
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.
Dead.
And the race over.
It isn't over, Judah.
They're not dead.
Where are they?
Look for them in the Valley of the Lepers if you can recognize them.
It goes on.
It goes on, Judah.
The race....
The race is not over.
Is there a way down here?
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.
Man.
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.
There...
There are many women.
Of the family of Hur.
We have no names here.
For them?
- Why did you tell me they were dead?
- It was what they wanted.
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?
Not to see them?
They are coming.
Love them in the way they must need to be loved.
Not to look at them.
Let them be as if you had never come here.
Please!
Judah!
Is Judah well?
Is he happy?
Yes, he is well.
Your mind can be at rest for him.
He is well, Miriam.
God be with you.
They have gone.
We can go back.
Go back to what?
Judah, they have one blessing left.
To think you remember them as they were and live your own life.
Forget what is here.
Forget?
It's as though they were alive in a grave.
- But what can you do?
- Undo what you've done.
How could you have suffered them to come here?
I must see them.
No, Judah, please!
Judah!
Think, Judah, think.
It would tear them apart if they see you.
Judah!
Judah.
He is here.
I have found him.
The child has become a man.
And the man, I know it now, is the son of God.
The promise is true.
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.
Life has been answered.
God has answered it.
Come.
Come with me.
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys thirst had nearly killed me.
A man gave me water to drink.
I went on living.
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.
No.
I am thirsty still.
Come and listen.
I have business with Rome.
You insist on death.
Goodbye, Judah.
You sent for me?
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.
- I honor him.
- As you may honor yourself.
You have been made a citizen of Rome.
Do you say nothing to this?
I have just come from the Valley of Stone where my mother and sister live what's left of their lives.
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.
I have heard this.
There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.
Where there is greatness, great government or power even great feeling or compassion error also is great.
We progress and mature by fault.
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.
There are other voices.
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place not to crucify yourself on a shadow such as old resentment or impossible loyalties.
Perfect freedom has no existence.
A grown man knows the world he lives in.
And for the present, the world is Rome.
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.
I am Judah Ben-Hur.
I cross this floor in spoken friendship as I would speak to Arrius.
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar ready to crush all those who challenge his authority.
There are too many small men of envy and ambition who try to disrupt the government of Rome.
You have become the victor and hero to those people.
They look to you, their one true god, as I called you.
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.
I am already part of this tragedy.
Return this to Arrius.
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you from personal disaster if you stay here.
You are too great a danger.
Leave Judea.
You have my word.
Judah!
Oh, Judah!
I was afraid you would never come back afraid of what would happen to you.
But I see you again.
Your father's waiting for me.
Where is he?
What do you mean to do?
Oh, Judah.
Rest, sleep.
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.
Peace?
Love and peace.
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?
Where do you see them?
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.
Balthasar's word.
He is more than Balthasar's word.
His voice traveled with such a still purpose.
It was more than a voice.
A man more than a man.
He said, "Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the peacemakers...
"...for they shall be called the children of God."
Children of God?
In that dead valley where we left them?
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean until we have scoured off our bodies the crust and filth of being at the mercy of tyranny.
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.
- In blood?
- Yes, in blood!
I know there is a law in life.
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.
Death generates death as the vulture breeds the vulture.
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:
"Love your enemy.
Do good to those who despitefully use you."
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.
As you make us do now.
Are we to bear nothing together?
Even love?
I can hardly draw breath without feeling you in my heart.
But I know that everything I do from this moment will be as great a pain to you as you have ever suffered.
It is better not to love me.
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy giving evil for evil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.
It's as though you had become Messala.
I've lost you, Judah.
No further.
What are you doing here?
I was here last evening waiting for you.
I have waited all night.
What has happened?
Where is Tirzah?
Leave the food.
I am coming closer.
Don't be afraid.
- What are you doing?
- Don't be afraid.
I've heard him again, the man from Nazareth.
If ever words were from God, they are in everything he says.
I cannot bear that you should have never known this hand of quiet reaching towards us.
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find him there.
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find him.
Tirzah is dying.
Leave the food and go.
It's Judah.
Why did you tell him?
Yes, Judah, yes.
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.
Mother.
Wait, Mother, wait.
Let me talk with you.
Please.
No, no further.
Please.
No, Judah.
Son, no.
Mother, let me see Tirzah.
Tirzah is dying.
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know that life is everlasting and death is nothing to fear if you have faith.
I will take them to him.
No!
God, no!
No, no, dear son.
Mother where is Tirzah?
Judah, no.
You must not go to her, dear son.
Please.
Dear son.
I am afraid.
No cause.
The world is more than we know.
Tirzah, it's Judah.
No.
No, Judah.
No, Judah.
No.
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
- Why are the streets deserted?
- They have gone to the trial.
- Alms for the blind?
- Trial?
Whose trial?
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.
- This cannot be true.
- Alms?
What has he done?
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.
Help for the blind.
- Look, lepers!
- Lepers!
- Go away!
- Get away!
Stay away!
Go away!
Lepers!
Lepers!
How can this be?
I know this man.
Will someone help him?
Take pity on him.
Have mercy.
Have mercy.
In his pain this look of peace.
Watch over them, Esther.
We must go back.
I brought you here to this when I hoped....
You haven't failed, Esther.
Hail King of the Jews!
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.
He gave me water and a heart to live.
What has he done to merit this?
He has taken the world of our sins onto himself.
To this end he said he was born in that stable where I first saw him.
For this cause, he came into the world.
For this death?
This beginning.
I have lived too long.
As though he were carrying in that cross the pain of the world.
So fearful, and yet why is it I'm not afraid anymore?
The shadow of a storm.
A strange darkness but still day.
His life is over.
What is it?
This tearing.
I am in pain.
I feel it too.
Miriam.
I thought I....
Miriam.
Do you see your hand?
Tirzah.
Miriam.
Tirzah.
Almost at the moment he died I heard him say, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do."
- Even then.
- Even then.
And I felt his voice take the sword out of my hand.
BALTHASAR:
In the year of our Lord Judea, for nearly a century, had lain under the mastery of Rome.
In the seventh year of the reign of Augustus Caesar an imperial decree ordered every Judean each to return to his place of birth to be counted and taxed.
The converging ways of many of them led to their capital city, Jerusalem the troubled heart of their land.
The old city was dominated by the fortress of Antonia the seat of Roman power and by the great golden temple the outward sign of an inward and imperishable faith.
Even while they obeyed the will of Caesar the people clung proudly to their ancient heritage always remembering the promise of their prophets that one day there would be born among them a redeemer to bring them salvation and perfect freedom.
[MURMURING]
You'll be counted at Hebron.
- Name?
- Samuel.
- What city?
- Joppa.
- What family?
- Michael.
- Move on.
Move on.
- Yes.
- Name?
- Joseph.
- What city?
- Nazareth.
- What family?
- David of Bethlehem.
- And the woman?
- My wife.
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.
Come on, come on.
[OXEN BELLOWING]
[BABY CRYING]
[SHEEP BAAING]
[TRUMPETS]
What village is this?
Nazareth.
We should arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow night.
You're not watching the soldiers, Joseph?
We've seen Romans before.
Yes and we will see them again.
My table is not finished.
Where is your son?
- He's walking in the hills.
- Mm-hm.
He neglects his work, Joseph.
No.
Once, I reproached him with forgetting his work.
He said to me:
"I must be about my father's business."
Then why isn't he here, working?
He's working.
SEXTUS:
Trumpeters of the legion!
[TRUMPETING]
Welcome, Messala.
The command is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for relieving me.
Drusus when I was a boy, I dreamed of commanding this garrison.
Now the wheel has turned.
I am in command.
OFFICER:
Attention!
Aisle one, face right!
Forward!
I'd forgotten the heat.
If it were only the heat.
I lived here until I was 14.
Jerusalem was my home.
- My father was head of...
- Yes, I know.
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.
If there can be such a thing in this forsaken land.
If you want to rise, Sextus, do the difficult.
I asked to be sent here.
I think you'll find the people changed since you were a boy.
In what way?
Oh, won't pay their taxes, an irrational resentment of Rome....
There's nothing new in all that.
And then there's religion.
I tell you, they're drunk with religion.
They smash the statues of our gods, even those of the emperor.
Punish them.
We do.
When we can find them.
Find the leaders.
Oh, you don't know.
There's nothing you can put your finger on.
I tell you, there are strange forces at work here.
For instance, this "messiah" business...
I know.
There was one predicted when I was a boy.
A king of the Jews, who will lead them into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.
Makes your head spin.
There's a wild man in the desert named John who drowns people in water.
And a carpenter's son who does magic tricks. "Miracles" they call them.
There's always a rabble-rouser stirring up trouble.
No, no, no.
This man is different.
He teaches that God is near, in every man.
[MESSALA SCOFFS]
It's actually quite profound, some of it.
You've been too long away from Rome.
Go back, Sextus.
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea and forget that God is in every man.
- There is divinity in only one man.
- Yes, I know.
The emperor is displeased.
He wishes Judea made into a more obedient and disciplined province.
He has ordered me to restore order.
I intend to carry out his wishes.
But how?
You can break a man's skull, arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.
But how do you control what's up here?
How do you fight an idea?
Especially a new idea.
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.
I assume he has a name.
- He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
- Then treat him like one!
Tell him I will join him.
Yes, tribune.
Centurion!
This was his country before it was ours.
Don't forget that.
Yes, tribune.
Very wise.
This Ben-Hur is the richest man in Jerusalem.
And the head of one of the greatest families in Judea.
We were friends as boys.
We were like brothers.
Sextus you ask how to fight an idea.
Well, I'll tell you how.
With another idea.
I said I'd come back.
I never thought you would.
I'm so glad.
[BOTH LAUGH]
- Look at you.
- Look at you!
You've come back a tribune.
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.
We'll drink another now.
- Your sister and mother?
- They're fine.
They've talked of you ever since we knew you were coming.
- Is Tirzah married?
- No.
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.
She's been in love with you since she was 5.
I can't wait to see them.
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?
Or have you become too dignified?
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
- Down Eros, up Mars!
- Down Eros, up Mars!
MESSALA:
Where the beams cross?
BEN-HUR:
Good.
[BOTH LAUGH]
After all these years!
Still close.
In every way.
I hope so.
I know.
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew whose life you once saved.
The best thing I ever did.
Judah it will be very difficult to govern here.
I'm going to need help.
Your help.
Your advice.
- You want my advice?
- Yes, I do.
Withdraw your legions.
Give us our freedom.
Unfortunately, the emperor is devoted to his empire.
He's particularly fond of Judea.
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.
Is there anything so sad as unrequited love?
[MESSALA CHUCKLES]
My quarters.
Hmm.
A bit grim.
Not grim.
Austere.
Virtuous.
Roman.
I'm going to be second-in-command to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.
He's arriving in a few days with two more legions.
Then the rumors are true.
The emperor does not approve of your countrymen.
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.
But you and your family need have no concern.
I'm next in authority to the governor, and you're my friend.
- I'm a Jew.
- Ah, you are like a Roman!
What have you in common with the troublemaking rabble?
Rabble?
They're my people.
I'm one of them.
Be wise, Judah.
It's a Roman world.
If you want to live in it, you must become part of it.
You've changed.
I've grown up.
I've seen the world since I left Jerusalem.
I've seen Rome.
It's no accident that one small village on the Tiber was chosen to rule the world.
Your legions.
It wasn't just our legions.
Other countries have armies, fine armies.
I know, I fought them.
Oh, no.
No, it was fate that chose us to civilize the world.
And we have.
Our roads and ships connect every corner of the earth.
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.
I believe in the future of my people.
Of course you do.
And you can help them.
How?
You're an aristocrat.
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince among your people.
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.
They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.
Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.
It is worse than stupid, futile!
For it can end in only one way, extinction for your people!
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.
Then we're agreed!
Now, when can I come to see your family?
- We had hoped tomorrow.
- Good.
And now for our toast.
It's dreadful wine, by the way.
It's especially fermented for the Roman army.
[MESSALA CHUCKLES]
You're very cruel to your conquerors.
It's an insane world.
But in it there is one sanity:
The loyalty of old friends.
Judah, we must believe in one another.
Will you drink to that?
With all my heart.
Here it is, the place I've remembered.
The court where we played at changing the guard.
The roof where we'd throw pebbles at people in the street and then hide.
- We were rascals, weren't we?
- No, you were good boys.
I would have that time again.
And here it is.
Nothing has changed.
Except for the fountain.
- The old well would go dry, remember?
- Promptly, every summer.
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.
- He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
- No?
Of course he has.
He was a boy when he left us, now he's a man.
With great responsibilities.
Come.
The emperor builds and builds, turning brick to marble.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.
I've never seen anything like this before.
It's beautiful!
- Is it Roman?
- It's Libyan.
I was there last year.
A tremendous campaign.
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.
Or was, till we destroyed it.
Now it's nothing but ashes.
I'm boring you with soldier stories.
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.
Thank you for this.
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.
BEN-HUR:
What do you think of it?
MESSALA:
Magnificent.
It's Arabic.
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.
Let me try him sometime.
Whenever you like.
He's yours.
Do you mean you'll give me this?
Oh, Judah.
You are good.
It's going to be like old times, I know it.
Judah, tell me, did you think about what I said?
Yes.
Talked to a number of people already.
Spoken against violence, against incidents.
Most of the men agree with me.
Most?
Not all?
- No, not all.
- Who does not agree?
Well, the resentful, the impatient.
Who are they?
Yes, Judah.
Who are they?
Would I retain your friendship if I became an informer?
Telling the names of criminals is not informing.
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.
Patriots?
!
Judah.
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.
This is my great opportunity, and yours too.
If I bring order here, I can have any post I want.
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?
Rome!
Yes, perhaps at the side of Caesar himself.
I mean it.
It can happen and this is the moment.
I swear, this is the time.
The emperor is watching us, judging us.
All I need do is serve him.
And all you need do is help me serve him.
- You speak as if he were God.
- He is God.
The only God.
He is power, real power on earth, not...
Not that.
Help me, Judah.
I would do anything for you, Messala except betray my own people.
In the name of all the gods, what do the lives of a few Jews mean to you?
If I cannot persuade them, that does not mean I would help you murder them.
Besides, you must understand this, Messala.
I believe in the past and future of my people.
Future?
You are a conquered people.
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?
Joshua will not rise again to save you nor David.
There is only one reality in the world today.
Look to the West.
Don't be a fool!
Look to Rome!
Better a fool than a traitor or a killer.
- l am a soldier.
- Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.
- l warn you...
- No!
I warn you.
Rome is an affront to God.
Rome is strangling my people and my country, the whole earth!
But not forever.
And I tell you, the day Rome falls there will be a shout of freedom such as the world has never heard before.
Judah.
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.
You're either for me or against me.
If that is the choice then I am against you.
There they are.
Where's Messala?
- Where's...?
- He's gone.
Gone?
- But why?
- He couldn't stay.
- What happened?
- A new tribune must have many duties.
Come.
Let us have dinner.
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the world who bringeth to us bread from the earth.
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.
He wanted to use me to betray our people.
Judah.
[MURMURING]
[CAMEL BAYING]
- Master, the caravan from Antioch.
- Yes, Amrah, I saw.
Simonides.
- Welcome.
- Judah.
- Oh, welcome homecoming.
- Master.
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.
And for the master, Iberian wine.
Not to mention the best gift of all, your presence.
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.
- Caravans from Petra.
- Have all arrived.
- Good.
- Here is the accounting.
And what of Numidia?
The trade route is ours, guaranteed by treaty with the king.
Once a year, you bring your accounting.
And once a year, I find myself wealthier.
Yeah, but my greatest treasure is my steward.
SIMONIDES:
My life belongs to the House of Hur.
Nothing else exists for me, except my daughter.
- She must be a young woman by now.
- Yes, and your property.
She was born the daughter of your slave.
When I inherited you, I inherited a friend, not a slave.
Still, Esther has come with me from Antioch for your permission to marry.
It's granted.
I wish you the joy of many grandchildren.
SIMONIDES:
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.
With your permission, Esther wishes to speak to her master.
You're eager to marry, Esther?
It is my father's wish.
Your husband will be fortunate.
What is his name?
David, son of Mathias.
BEN-HUR:
Of what house?
- His own, master.
- He is a freeman.
Tell me more about him.
I have seen him only once.
He is a merchant, well-thought-of in Antioch.
He will pay for Esther's freedom.
Her freedom will be my wedding gift to Esther.
You are generous, master.
Do you love this man?
I will learn to love him.
You have my permission to marry.
We'll drink to your happiness.
And a safe return to Antioch.
BEN-HUR:
I disturbed you.
No.
What were you thinking?
I was saying goodbye to this city and this house.
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?
My father sometimes brought me here when I was little.
It was a house where I was always happy.
Except once.
When you and your friend, the Roman boy...
- Messala.
- Yes.
You had been out hunting and they brought you home injured.
I touched your face as you lay there and prayed to God, "Don't let this boy die."
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.
Yes, master.
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.
It's strange.
I hardly felt a slave.
And now I hardly feel free.
You know, in the old, wise days of Solomon if there was among his slaves some girl who filled his eyes he could choose her out from the rest and take her to him.
Wise days of Solomon.
Different days.
And long ago.
If you were not a bride I should kiss you goodbye.
If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said.
Your slave ring.
Fair exchange.
Freedom to you.
The ring to me.
You will wear it?
Until you meet the woman you will marry?
Until then.
[DRUMMING]
[TRUMPETING]
The gods favor my lord Gratus.
If it is the governor's pleasure, the wreath of office.
Thank you, tribune.
I see no delegation from the city.
- There will not be one, sir.
- No?
Jerusalem's welcome will not be a warm one.
But I pledge, my lord, it will be a quiet one.
Let us proceed.
[CHILDREN SHOUTING]
There's Messala.
He saw you, Judah.
The new governor.

You, come!
OFFICER 2:
Had to be the Jews!
OFFICER 3:
Open up in the name of the divine emperor!
Judah!
Tirzah!
What is it?
What's happened?
OFFICER 4:
Open up in the name of Rome!
- l was watching the Romans...
- A tile fell and struck the governor.
- It wasn't my fault.
- They won't believe her.
She won't have to say anything.
You hear?
Tirzah, say nothing.
MAN:
Open the gates!
I'll speak to them.
OFFICER 1:
Arrest him!
-Wait.
Let me tell you what happened.
OFFICER 2:
Hold those women.
BEN-HUR:
Not them!
-Judah!
BEN-HUR:
It was an accident.
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.
- This is the man, sir.
We saw him.
- It was an accident.
- Accident?
- l swear it.
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose.
It gave way.
Take him.
Take all of them.
MIRIAM:
He's telling the truth!
-It was me!
Let them go!
MIRIAM:
Judah!
CENTURION:
Attention!
BEN-HUR:
Messala.
In the name of God, tell them it's a mistake.
I leaned on the tile, and it broke loose.
It was an accident.
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!
MIRIAM:
Messala!
TIRZAH:
Messala.
Let the servants go.
Let them go.
Return to your ranks.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
- Come.
- Where?
Tirus.
Tirus?
I've had no trial.
I'm to die in the galleys without even a trial?
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!
Wait.
My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?
Tie his hands.
- At least tell me if they're safe.
- l can tell you nothing.

Send them out.
You can go.
Go!
The door.
Where are my mother and sister?
Where are they?
Here, within these walls.
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.
Of course, they will be sentenced.
Is it possible, Messala?
Is it possible you could do this to us?
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?
You'll let them go.
You must.
You will gladly let them go!
Messala!
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not mad.
I'm not a murderer!
I know you're not.
You know?
You are evil.
No, Judah, I am not evil.
I wanted your help.
Now you've given it to me.
By making this example of you, I discourage treason.
By condemning without hesitation an old friend, I shall be feared.
But not my family.
Let them go.
Please.
- Messala, I beg you.
- Beg?
!
Didn't I beg you?
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.
Kill me, and your mother and sister will die today nailed to crosses in front of you!
Go on, Judah.
Kill me!
[GRUNTS]
May God grant me vengeance.
I will pray that you live till I return.
Return?
Take him.
OFFICER:
Sentries, salute.
The tribune will see you now.
Tribune, I'm steward of the House of Hur.
I remember you.
We were on our way to Antioch when we heard what had happened.
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done this thing.
You knew him, tribune.
Better than you.
Then there must be no doubt in your mind, the charge is groundless.
The prisoners have been sentenced.
- Sentenced?
- But there's no truth in it.
There was never a threat against the governor in Judah's mind.
Surely you must know he would never have done this.
In your heart, you must know it.
Drusus.
This man had better be kept here until we have time to question him.
DECURION:

God help me.
You!
I said no water for him!
All right, on your feet, all of you!
Get them on their feet!
Back in line, you dog!
On your feet!
Get them going!
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!
Forward, you dogs!
In a few minutes, the consul's barge will be coming alongside.
Be ready to raise oars.
HORTATOR:
Raise oars!
Down oars!
[TRUMPETING]
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.
- How many rowers?
- Two hundred, consul.
- And reliefs?
- Of 30, every hour.
[MAN COUGHING]
This man is ill.
Replace him.
- Change him.
- Right, sir.
- This man has been giving you trouble?
- He's insubordinate, consul.
That will stop.
What service have you seen?
Forty-one.
A month's less a day in this ship.
You keep an exact account.
And before?
Three years in other ships.
Three years.
[BEN-HUR YELLS]
You have the spirit to fight back but the good sense to control it.
Your eyes are full of hate, 41.
That's good.
Hate keeps a man alive.
It gives him strength.
Now, listen to me, all of you.
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
So row well and live.
- Ship ready, consul.
- Strike oars.
HORTATOR:
Strike oars!
You know that a fleet of Macedonian galleys has been raiding Roman commerce.
The emperor has honored us with the task of seeking out and destroying them.
Battle speed, hortator.

[HORTATOR DRUMMING NEARBY]
Why are you here?
I was ordered to report to you during my relief.
Oh, yes.
I'd forgotten.
You could have killed me as I lay there.
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?
I'm not ready to die.
What do you think will save you?
The God of my fathers.
Hmm.
Your God has forsaken you.
He has no more power than the images I pray to.
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.
I might.
Does that interest you, 41?
I can see that it does.
I'm a fighting man by profession, and in my leisure moments it amuses me to train fighting men.
I own some of the best gladiators and charioteers in Rome.
Would you like to become one of them?
To die as your slave?
Better than to live in chains below these decks.
I will not be here forever.
No?
What would you do if you escaped?
Two people were condemned with me, my mother and sister though they were innocent.
I won't rest...
Do not say that you were innocent.
- Would it do any good to say it again?
- No.
Consider my offer carefully.
You will never escape while we are victorious.
If we are not, you will sink with this ship, chained to your oar.
I cannot believe that God has let me live these three years to die chained to an oar.
It's a strange, stubborn faith you keep to believe that existence has a purpose.
A sane man would have learned to lose it long before this.
As you have.
What drove it out of you?
Go back to your oar, 41.
Consul, enemy sighted.

Unlock 41.
No!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
41, why did he do that?
I don't know.
Once before, a man helped me.
I didn't know why then.

Why did you save me?
Why did you have me unchained?
What is your name, 41?
Judah Ben-Hur. ...let me die.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
Row well and live.
ARRIUS:
Is the sail square?
I can't tell.
Better for us both if it's the enemy.
My death.
Your freedom.
It's a Roman sail.
OFFICER:
Face rear!
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.
Water.
The fleet, all lost?
Five galleys.
- And the battle?
- The battle was won.
You have a victory.
ARRIUS:
It was a victory?

In his eagerness to save you your God has also saved the Roman fleet.
Hail Arrius!

[CROWD CHEERING]
[MUSIC AND CHEERING STOPS]
You have cleared the seaways of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.
This baton of victory has been nobly won.
[CROWD CHEERS]
This man riding beside you, who is he?
The man who saved me, divine emperor, to return and serve you.
Is that all you know about him?
No.
He was accused of an attack on the governor of Judea.
But he was innocent.
If not, there's a strange inconsistency in this man who tries to kill my governor, yet saves the life of my consul.
Come tomorrow.
We'll talk of it.
[CROWD CHEERS]
[BAND PLAYING TRIUMPHANT MUSIC]
We have all the information on this man a man of some influence in his own country.
His attack upon our governor is one upon the senate and the people of Rome.
I am convinced that no such attack was intended.
Consul, allow us to continue.
Allow us to be generous.
As a reward to you for your great victory we shall not send him back to the galleys.
We give him to you as your slave to do with him as you like.
Such is the will of the senate and the people of Rome.
[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]
[WOMEN YELLING]
[BAND PLAYING SOFT MUSIC]
Not long ago, I returned to Rome with a young man who had saved my life.
You all know him as the finest charioteer in Rome.
Five times, he's driven my horses to victory.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I know him as one who stands in the place of the son I lost.
I have the love and pride in a son's achievements which I thought I should never have again.
[MURMURING]
Nothing could make stronger the bond between us but tonight I wish to share it with you all.
The formalities of adoption have been completed.
Young Arrius is now the legal bearer of my name and the heir to my property.
[CROWD MURMURS]
This ring of my ancestors would have gone to my son.
So now it is yours.
It's a strange destiny that brought me to a new life a new home a new father.
It brought me here.
It may take me away.
But wherever I may be I shall always try to wear this ring as a son of Arrius should.
With gratitude and affection and with honor.
[CROWD CHEERING]
[SOFT MUSIC RESUMES]
I present my son to you.
My old friend Pontius Pilate, young Arrius.
Before you came to this city, my horses always won.
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.
Yes, but not swift enough to defeat you.
- Tell me, you come from Judea?
- Yes, sir.
I hear that the climate is difficult to live in.
Not for Judeans.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.
- Of Judea?
- Yes.
I asked for Alexandria.
But it seems the wilderness needs my particular talents.
The scorpions and holy prophets can't get on without me.
Lay the dust of Judea, at least for this evening.
Goats and Jehovah.
[ARRIUS CHUCKLES]
You're leaving.
I must.
It's a journey I can't keep you from.
Your eyes have never left it all these months.
I can recognize pain.
But still, my counsel is to wait.
Gratus is to be replaced.
The governorship goes to Pontius Pilate.
When?
Very soon.
It's very much to our purpose.
Nothing is to the purpose if, when I come back to Judea, I come too late.
That is the thought which has punished me every moment I've spent here.
Will Rome see you again?
Here is a part of my life which you have made for me.
I shall remember it.
Whoever the gods are, they take small interest in an old man's hopes.
They have their way.
Forgive me.
You're a stranger here.
Would you be from Nazareth?
Why do you ask?
I thought you might be the one....
The one that I have come back from my country to find.
He would be about your age.
Who?
When I find him I shall know him.
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.
SHEIK:
Hyah!
Hyah!
Sack of flesh without brains!
No!
No!
Not the whip!
That is my host.
SHEIK:
Gently!
Gently!
Fool!
Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood!
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run!
Go on!
SHEIK:
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!
Beautiful horses.
Now!
Now!
They are ready!
Let them go!
Watch.
They'll never hold the turn.
SHEIK:
No!
No!
Abadon, stop him!
Stop that whip!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill...!
SHEIK:
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!
You think you can treat my horses like animals?
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!
Get off, idiot!
SHEIK:
Drive goats, not horses!
Now I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.
Hmm?
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.
Not a team?
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.
- Antares.
- The slow one?
SHEIK:
Uh-huh.
I think he should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?
In the circus in Rome.
You have driven in the great circus?
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.
No other animal has descended so in scale from the first innocent falling of the world.
[SHEIK CHUCKLES]
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.
Yes.
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.
Your coming here was so fit, so right.
We might have achieved wonders.
You have to go.
I make a journey which will not wait.
Well, then perhaps you will come back.
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.
I have no wives.
No wives at all?
I have six, no, seven.
BALTHASAR:
Ha, ha.
I've counted eight.
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.
- Someday, I hope to have one.
- One wife!
Ha, ha, one God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.
It is not generous.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
[BURPS]
- Was the food not to your liking?
- Indeed.
[BURPS]
Thank you.
Thank you.
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.
And now I must say good night to my beauties.
When they're ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.
- I'll make my farewells then.
- No, no, no, stay.
Stay and see them.
Come, my children.
Come.
Strangers make them shy.
Come.
Come, do not be afraid.
Come.
There, my children.
They are descended from the Arabians of the first Pharaohs and I have named them for the stars.
Come, Antares.
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.
[ANTARES WHINNIES]
What?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.
Come, Rigel.
We've both supped well, and the world is good.
[CHUCKLES]
There's my good Rigel.
Ah.
Yes, you are ready for sleep.
The day's work done for you, eh?
Ah.
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.
Good night.
Good night, my treasure.
Ah!
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.
No.
You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.
[CHUCKLES]
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.
You should see their mother, Mira.
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.
All right, all right.
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.
You must be strong and swift.
Go, my children.
Go.
When they reach Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams not to mention the champion of the East, Messala, with his black devils.
He stops at nothing to win.
- Messala?
In the circus?
- Yes.
You knew him?
I know him.
Perhaps without much liking.
Judah Ben-Hur, my people are praying for a man to drive their team to victory over Messala.
You could be that man, the one to stamp his arrogance into the sand.
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.
It's not possible.
That is a pity.
Think of it.
To break his pride to humble this tribune before the very people he has degraded.
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!
I know it is not possible.
Does it not delight your imagination?
Does it not answer your purpose?
I must deal with Messala in my own way.
And your way is to kill him.
I see this terrible thing in your eyes, Judah Ben-Hur.
But no matter what this man has done, you have no right to take his life.
He will be punished inevitably.
I don't believe in miracles.
But all life is a miracle.
Why will you not accept God's judgment?
You do not believe in miracles.
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness and a star led me to a village called Bethlehem where I found a newborn child in a manger.
And God lived in this child.
By now, he is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.
That is why I have returned here so that I may be at hand when he comes among us.
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.
Perhaps he's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.
Perhaps he is a shepherd a merchant, a fisherman.
But he lives and all our lives from now on will carry his mark.
There are many paths to God, my son.
I hope yours will not be too difficult.
I'm ready for sleep.
Balthasar is a good man but until all men are like him, we must keep our swords bright.
And our intention true.
So I must leave you.
One last thought.
There is no law in the arena.
Many are killed.
I hope to see you again.
MERCHANT:
Fine Damascus silk.
Fine Damascus silk.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Esther?
[ESTHER GASPS]
It's Judah.
[GASPS]
Judah.
- You are alive.
- Esther.
You are alive.
What are you doing here?
What has happened?
[ESTHER SOBBING]
Shh.
I'm here.
I'm with you.
Esther.
Where's your father?
Hmm?
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.
They tortured him.
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.
You never went back to Antioch?
No.
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.
Esther.
Esther.
Where are my mother and sister?
SIMONIDES:
Esther.
Let me tell him first.
Father.
Father, something wonderful has happened.
- Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
- Judah.
He has come home.
He is here.
Judah.
Judah Ben-Hur.
My dear old friend.
Let me look at you.
Let me see you.
Yes, yes.
It is true.
Praise God for his mercy.
Where are they?
Since that terrible day there has been no word of them.
You should have been less loyal.
Do not pity me, Master Judah.
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.
We were released on the same day.
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.
Since then, I have been his tongue and he has been my legs.
Together, we make a considerable man.
Old friend.
She always said you would return.
She never gave up hope.
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.
I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.
But suppose that isn't possible.
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.
They could not make me tell them where it is.
It is there still to put power into our hands and buy death for the Romans.
That's not why I came back.
Judah, they are dead.
Four years.
No one could live so long in the dungeons.
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?
SIMONIDES:
Yes, it is true.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You have come back to us like a returning faith.
Judah, I should like to laugh again.
- Let us laugh.
- We will.
There will be joy again in this house.
We will celebrate among the dust.
[SOBBING]
I will take him.
We stood here before.
A long while ago.
Four years.
But now it seems as if only yesterday....
I was saying:
"If you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye."
"If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said."
I am not a bride.
Why did you never marry?
My father needed me.
And also....
It's still on my finger.
I said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.
It's become a part of my hand.
If Messala once knew you were here....
As he must.
He will know where they are.
And if you should find...?
- If he should tell you they're dead...
- Then Messala will wish they were living.
I've seen too much of what hate can do.
My father is burned up with it.
But I've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater and love more powerful than hatred.
I believe it.
- Esther.
- Judah.
Stay alive.
Keep away from Messala.
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.
That time isn't yet come.
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.
This time you will be destroyed.
You'll die.
Tribune, compliments of Quintus Arrius.
He awaits your pleasure.
- Consul here?
- Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.
Thank him.
Bring him to me.
- l didn't know the consul had a son.
- He's a champion of the great circus.
Why is he here presenting me with gifts?
- Perhaps he'll race against you.
- Look.
It's magnificent.
And from a man I've never met.
You're wrong, Messala.
Judah.
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?
You were the magician, Messala.
You condemned me to the galleys.
When my ship was sunk, I saved the consul's life.
You know his seal?
Now I have come back as I swore I would.
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.
You suggest I use it on myself?
What has become of my mother and my sister?
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.
Find them, Messala.
Restore them to me, and I'll forget what I vowed with every stroke of that oar you chained me to.
I am not the governor of Judea.
I can do nothing without approval.
Then get it.
I will come back tomorrow.
Don't disappoint me, Messala.
What became of them?
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?
Go to the citadel, Drusus.
Find out.
- And if they're dead?
- They're dead!
"Miriam, wife.
Tirzah, daughter."
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?
East section lower level.
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.
PRISONER 1:
Water.
Water.
PRISONER 2:
Let me out!
PRISONER 3:
Hear us!
Hear us!
[POUNDING]
- How long since you've seen them?
- Never.
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.
The food disappears.
Lepers.
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.
Then we'll burn out the cell.
[COUGHING]
ESTHER:
Is someone there?
[RUSTLING]
There is someone there.
Who are you?
MIRIAM:
Don't come any closer.
Who are you?
Esther.
It's Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam?
MIRIAM:
Stay where you are.
You have come home.
MIRIAM:
Stand back, Esther.
We are lepers.
[GASPS]
Oh, Esther.
Tirzah.
Esther is Judah living?
Yes, he is alive.
He is here.
Where?
He is searching for you now.
I must find him and tell him.
MIRIAM:
No!
-Tell my father.
MIRIAM:
No.
Tell no one.
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.
We won't return.
But Judah has to be told.
MIRIAM:
No.
Please.
I couldn't see his face.
Is it changed?
No, he is not changed.
He....
He's not changed.
You love him, Esther.
Promise me on your love for him you will never tell him you've seen us.
Is he never to know?
Let him remember us as we were.
Promise me.
There's nothing else I can hope for.
Only this.
I promise you.
I am content.
Wait.
[CRIES]
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.
I pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.
He'll free them.
He wants to survive.
He cannot free them, Judah.
What do you mean?
- l saw them.
- You saw them?
Where?
When did you see them?
They were dead.
They were dead.
When?
When?
When?
In the prison.
When I was waiting for news of my father.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't tell you.
Nor even you, Father.
I was afraid that if you saw Messala....
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.
It's over now.
Over?
- Judah.
- Over?
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.
[SOBBING]
[MURMURING]
[MEN CHUCKLING]
SHEIK:
Gentlemen.
Officers.
Defenders of great Rome's imperium may I enter?
Certainly, sheik.
You do us an unexpected honor.
The noble tribune is most gracious.
And now, the question you're all asking yourselves:
Why am I here?
As you know, I am a gambling man.
The games approach.
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.
But I will back my own poor horses.
No limits?
MARIUS:
Mark me first!
-And me!
MATELLUS:
What odds?
-A moment, please my lords, protectors of the far flung marshes.
May I first, uh, sit down?
MARIUS:
Sit down.
Lie down.
How much will you wager?
-Yes, let's call his game.
SPINTHO:
Give the Arab a seat.
A bench, quickly.
Thank you.
- Now.
- One thousand denarii.
- Two thousand!
- Mark me!
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient.
There is time and money enough for all.
First, gentlemen, the odds.
The tribune has won many times.
The odds should be in the same measure.
Now, what is your pleasure, gentlemen?
MARIUS:
Two to one.
[SHEIK CHUCKLES]
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth where is the courage that made Rome master of the world?
I can get better odds on any street market.
MARIUS:
Three to one.
Let us not haggle.
Let us be fair.
In four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.
- In all truth...
- Just a moment.
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?
Oh.
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.
The Prince of Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur.
Prince of Hur?
[CHUCKLES]
- He was sent to the galleys years ago.
- He has returned.
Returned?
Impossible.
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.
Well?
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.
You, tribune will you give me four to one?
Four to one.
- Good.
- Bravo, Messala.
Four to one, sheik.
The difference between a Roman and a Jew.
Or an Arab.
[ROMANS LAUGH]
[CHUCKLES]
Bravely spoken.
Now we will settle the amount of our wager.
I will venture....
A thousand talents?
- A thousand talents?
- Yes, a thousand talents.
Of course, if it is too much....
A thousand talents it will be.
Agreed.
[MURMURING]
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.
You're good fellows.
If only men were this good.
Hey!
Remember, Altair nine times around the circus, huh?
Aldebaran.
Hey, ha, ha.
Rigel, did you hear?
Nine lives to live.
My swift fellow.
You must not win the race the first time around.
You win the last time around.
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.
Steady Antares.
Like a rock.
You will be our anchor.
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.
They have taken me into their family.
Rest well, my stars.
Tomorrow we go up to the city.
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it the news will scorch the streets of the whole Roman world.
Pontius Pilate here?
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.
You will make him see what men are born in this land.
I only know that I race against Messala.
ATTENDANT:
Look for the yoke.
Ease that strap.
BEN-HUR:
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.
Into your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as you will.
The Star of David.
To shine out for your people and my people together and blind the eyes of Rome.
[TRUMPETS PLAYING]
They are ready.
ATTENDANT:
Ready, off!
MAN:
Easy, girl, easy.
STARTER:
Number five.
Where is number five?
Whoa.
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.
Yes, this is the day.
SHEIK:
Judah!
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.
[TRUMPETS PLAYING]
Hail, Jupiter.
Give me victory.
[BRASS BAND PLAYING]
[CROWD CHEERING]
ATTENDANT:
Watch your line!
Keep your places!
MAN:
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.
Citizens I welcome you to these games in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.
We dedicate them to his glory and to the glory of Rome of which you are all part.
Let us honor those who race for us today.
They come here from Alexandria Messina Carthage Cyprus Rome Corinth Athens Phrygia and Judea.
[CROWD ROARS]
To the best of these, a crown of victory.
The race begins.
Hail, Caesar!
CROWD:
Hail, Caesar!
Oh, you dog!
Come, my children, come!
The Roman pig!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Steady!
Now, now!
[BAND PLAYING TRIUMPHANT MUSIC]
OFFICER:
Salute.
A great victory.
You are the people's one true god for the time being.
Permit us to worship.
I crown their god.
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.
A long life, young Arrius, and the good sense to live it.
[HEAVY BREATHING]
We cannot wait, tribune.
MESSALA:
He will come.
He will...
[COUGHS AND GASPS]
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.
He will come!
He will come.
I've sent for him, and he will come.
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.
Do you understand?
To hack the legs off me?
Not yet.
Not till I've seen him.
I don't receive him with half a body.
No.
No!
[MESSALA GRUNTING]
I told you, Drusus.
I told you.
Here he is.
Triumph c...
Triumph complete, Judah.
The race won.
The enemy destroyed.
I see no enemy.
What do you think you see?
The smashed body of a wretched animal?
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.
Let me help you.
[GROANS]
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.
Dead.
And the race over.
It isn't over, Judah.
They're not dead.
Where are they?
Where are they?
Where are they?
Look for them in the Valley of the Lepers if you can recognize them.
[BEN-HUR YELLS]
It goes on.
It goes on, Judah.
The race....
The race is not over.
Is there a way down here?
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.
Man.
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.
MAN:
There...
There are many women.
Of the family of Hur.
We have no names here.
For them?
- Why did you tell me they were dead?
- It was what they wanted.
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?
Not to see them?
They are coming.
Love them in the way they must need to be loved.
Not to look at them.
Let them be as if you had never come here.
Please!
Judah!
Is Judah well?
Is he happy?
ESTHER:
Yes, he is well.
Your mind can be at rest for him.
He is well, Miriam.
MIRIAM:
God be with you.
They have gone.
We can go back.
Go back to what?
Judah, they have one blessing left.
To think you remember them as they were and live your own life.
Forget what is here.
Forget?
It's as though they were alive in a grave.
- But what can you do?
- Undo what you've done.
How could you have suffered them to come here?
I must see them.
No, Judah, please!
Judah!
Think, Judah, think.
It would tear them apart if they see you.
Judah!
Judah.
He is here.
I have found him.
The child has become a man.
And the man, I know it now, is the son of God.
The promise is true.
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.
Life has been answered.
God has answered it.
Come.
Come with me.
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys thirst had nearly killed me.
A man gave me water to drink.
I went on living.
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.
No.
I am thirsty still.
Come and listen.
I have business with Rome.
You insist on death.
Goodbye, Judah.
You sent for me?
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.
- l honor him.
- As you may honor yourself.
You have been made a citizen of Rome.
Do you say nothing to this?
I have just come from the Valley of Stone where my mother and sister live what's left of their lives.
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.
I have heard this.
There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.
Where there is greatness, great government or power even great feeling or compassion error also is great.
We progress and mature by fault.
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.
There are other voices.
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place not to crucify yourself on a shadow such as old resentment or impossible loyalties.
Perfect freedom has no existence.
A grown man knows the world he lives in.
And for the present, the world is Rome.
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.
I am Judah Ben-Hur.
I cross this floor in spoken friendship as I would speak to Arrius.
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar ready to crush all those who challenge his authority.
There are too many small men of envy and ambition who try to disrupt the government of Rome.
You have become the victor and hero to those people.
They look to you, their one true god, as I called you.
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.
I am already part of this tragedy.
Return this to Arrius.
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you from personal disaster if you stay here.
You are too great a danger.
Leave Judea.
You have my word.
Judah!
Oh, Judah!
I was afraid you would never come back afraid of what would happen to you.
But I see you again.
Your father's waiting for me.
Where is he?
What do you mean to do?
Oh, Judah.
Rest, sleep.
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.
Peace?
Love and peace.
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?
Where do you see them?
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.
Balthasar's word.
He is more than Balthasar's word.
His voice traveled with such a still purpose.
It was more than a voice.
A man more than a man.
He said, "Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God."
Children of God?
In that dead valley where we left them?
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean until we have scoured off our bodies the crust and filth of being at the mercy of tyranny.
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.
- In blood?
- Yes, in blood!
I know there is a law in life.
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.
Death generates death as the vulture breeds the vulture.
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:
"Love your enemy.
Do good to those who despitefully use you."
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.
As you make us do now.
Are we to bear nothing together?
Even love?
I can hardly draw breath without feeling you in my heart.
But I know that everything I do from this moment will be as great a pain to you as you have ever suffered.
It is better not to love me.
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy giving evil for evil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.
It's as though you had become Messala.
I've lost you, Judah.
MIRIAM:
No further.
What are you doing here?
I was here last evening waiting for you.
I have waited all night.
What has happened?
Where is Tirzah?
Leave the food.
I am coming closer.
Don't be afraid.
- What are you doing?
- Don't be afraid.
I've heard him again, the man from Nazareth.
If ever words were from God, they are in everything he says.
I cannot bear that you should have never known this hand of quiet reaching towards us.
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find him there.
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find him.
[MIRIAM WHIMPERS]
Tirzah is dying.
Leave the food and go.
It's Judah.
Why did you tell him?
Yes, Judah, yes.
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.
Mother.
Wait, Mother, wait.
Let me talk with you.
MIRIAM:
Please.
No, no further.
Please.
No, Judah.
Son, no.
Mother, let me see Tirzah.
Tirzah is dying.
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know that life is everlasting and death is nothing to fear if you have faith.
I will take them to him.
[MIRIAM SHRIEKS]
No!
God, no!
[MIRIAM SOBBING]
No, no, dear son.
Mother where is Tirzah?
Judah, no.
Judah, no.
You must not go to her, dear son.
Please.
Dear son.
I am afraid.
ESTHER:
No cause.
The world is more than we know.
[TIRZAH WHIMPERING]
Tirzah, it's Judah.
No.
No, Judah.
No, Judah.
No.
[TIRZAH SOBBING]
BEGGAR:
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
BEN-HUR:
Why are the streets deserted?
-They have gone to the trial.
- Alms for the blind?
- Trial?
Whose trial?
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.
- This cannot be true.
- Alms?
What has he done?
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.
Help for the blind.
WOMAN:
Look, lepers!
GIRL:
Lepers!
MAN 1:
Go away!
MAN 2:
Get away!
Stay away!
Go away!
[MURMURING]
Lepers!
Lepers!
How can this be?
I know this man.
Will someone help him?
TIRZAH:
Take pity on him.
WOMAN:
Have mercy.
Have mercy.
MIRIAM:
In his pain this look of peace.
Watch over them, Esther.
We must go back.
I brought you here to this when I hoped....
You haven't failed, Esther.
MAN:
Hail King of the Jews!
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.
He gave me water and a heart to live.
What has he done to merit this?
He has taken the world of our sins onto himself.
To this end he said he was born in that stable where I first saw him.
For this cause, he came into the world.
For this death?
This beginning.
I have lived too long.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
As though he were carrying in that cross the pain of the world.
So fearful, and yet why is it I'm not afraid anymore?
[THUNDER RUMBLES]
The shadow of a storm.
A strange darkness but still day.
[RUMBLING INTENSIFIES]
His life is over.
[WIND HOWLING]
[THUNDER CRASHING]
TIRZAH:
What is it?
This tearing.
I am in pain.
I feel it too.
Miriam.
I thought I....
Miriam.
Do you see your hand?
Tirzah.
Miriam.
Tirzah.
Almost at the moment he died I heard him say, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do."
- Even then.
- Even then.
And I felt his voice take the sword out of my hand.

In the year of our Lord Judea, for nearly a century, had lain under the mastery of Rome.
In the seventh year of the reign ofAugustus Caesar an imperial decree ordered every Judean each to return to his place of birth to be counted and taxed.
Converging ways of many of them led to their capital city, Jerusalem the troubled heart of their land.
The old city was dominated by the fortress ofAntonia the seat of Roman power and by the great golden temple the outward sign of an inward and imperishable faith.
Even while they obeyed the will of Caesar the people clung proudly to their ancient heritage always remembering the promise of their prophets that one day there would be born among them a redeemer to bring them salvation and perfect freedom.
You'll be counted at Hebron.
- Name?
- Samuel.
- What city?
- Joppa.
- What family?
- Michael.
- Move on.
Move on.
- Yes.
- Name?
- Joseph.
- What city?
- Nazareth.
- What family?
- David of Bethlehem.
And the woman?
My wife.
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.
Come on, come on.
What village is this?
Nazareth.
We should arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow night.
You're not watching the soldiers, Joseph?
We've seen Romans before.
Yes and we will see them again.
My table is not finished.
Where is your son?
He's walking in the hills.
He neglects his work, Joseph.
No.
Once, I reproached him with forgetting his work.
He said to me:
"I must be about my father's business. "
Then why isn't he here, working?
He's working.
Trumpeters of the legion!
Welcome, Messala.
The command is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for relieving me.
Drusus when I was a boy, I dreamed of commanding this garrison.
Now the wheel has turned.
I am in command.
Attention!
Aisle one, face right!
Forward!
I'd forgotten the heat.
If it were only the heat.
I lived here until I was 14.
Jerusalem was my home.
- My father was head of-
- Yes, I know.
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.
If there can be such a thing in this forsaken land.
If you want to rise, Sextus, do the difficult.
I asked to be sent here.
You'll find the people changed since you were a boy.
In what way?
Oh, won't pay their taxes, an irrational resentment of Rome....
There's nothing new in all that.
And then there's religion.
I tell you, they're drunk with religion.
They smash the statues of our gods, even those of the emperor.
Punish them.
We do.
When we can find them.
Find the leaders.
You don't know.
There's nothing you can put your finger on.
There are strange forces at work here.
This "messiah" business...
I know.
There was one predicted when I was a boy.
A king of the Jews, who will lead them into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.
Makes your head spin.
There's a wild man in the desert named John who drowns people in water.
And a carpenter's son who does magic tricks. "Miracles" they call them.
There's always a rabble-rouser stirring up trouble.
No, no, no.
This man is different.
He teaches that God is near, in every man.
It's actually quite profound, some of it.
You've been too long away from Rome.
Go back, Sextus.
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea and forget that God is in every man.
- There is divinity in only one man.
- Yes, I know.
The emperor is displeased.
He wishes Judea made into a more obedient and disciplined province.
He's ordered me to restore order.
I shall carry out his wishes.
How?
You can break a man's skull, arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.
But how do you control this?
How do you fight an idea?
Especially a new idea.
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.
I assume he has a name.
- He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
- Then treat him like one!
Tell him I will join him.
Yes, tribune.
Centurion!
This was his country before it was ours.
Don't forget that.
Yes, tribune.
Very wise.
This Ben-Hur is the richest man in Jerusalem.
And the head of one of the greatest families in Judea.
We were friends as boys.
We were like brothers.
Sextus you ask how to fight an idea.
Well, I'll tell you how.
With another idea.
I said I'd come back.
I never thought you would.
I'm so glad.
- Look at you.
- Look at you!
You've come back a tribune.
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.
We'll drink another now.
- Your sister and mother?
- They're fine.
They've talked of you ever since we knew you were coming.
- Is Tirzah married?
- No.
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.
She's been in love with you since she was 5.
I can't wait to see them.
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?
Or have you become too dignified?
- Down Eros, up Mars!
- Down Eros, up Mars!
Where the beams cross?
Good.
After all these years!
Still close.
In every way.
I hope so.
I know.
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew whose life you once saved.
The best thing I ever did.
Judah it will be very difficult to govern here.
I'm going to need help.
Your help.
Your advice.
- You want my advice?
- Yes, I do.
Withdraw your legions.
Give us our freedom.
Unfortunately, the emperor is devoted to his empire.
He's particularly fond of Judea.
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.
Is there anything so sad as unrequited love?
My quarters.
A bit grim.
Not grim.
Austere.
Virtuous.
Roman.
I'm going to be second-in-command to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.
He's coming in a few days with more legions.
Then the rumors are true.
The emperor does not approve of your countrymen.
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.
But you and your family need have no concern.
I'm next in authority to the governor, and you're my friend.
- I'm a Jew.
- Ah, you are like a Roman!
What have you in common with the troublemaking rabble?
- They're my people.
I'm one of them.
- Be wise, Judah.
It's a Roman world.
If you want to live in it, you must become part of it.
You've changed.
I've grown up.
I've seen the world since I left Jerusalem.
I've seen Rome.
It's no accident that one small village on the Tiber was chosen to rule the world.
Your legions.
It wasn't just our legions.
Other countries have armies, fine armies.
I know, I fought them.
Oh, no.
No, it was fate that chose us to civilize the world.
And we have.
Our roads and ships connect every corner of the earth.
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.
I believe in the future of my people.
Of course you do.
And you can help them.
How?
You're an aristocrat.
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince to your people.
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.
They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.
Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.
It is worse than stupid, futile!
For it can end in only one way, extinction for your people!
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.
Then we're agreed!
Now, when can I come to see your family?
- We had hoped tomorrow.
- Good.
And now for our toast.
It's dreadful wine, by the way.
It's especially fermented for the Roman army.
You're very cruel to your conquerors.
It's an insane world.
But in it there is one sanity:
The loyalty of old friends.
Judah, we must believe in one another.
Will you drink to that?
With all my heart.
Here it is, the place I've remembered.
The court where we played at changing the guard.
The roof where we'd throw pebbles at people in the street and then hide.
- We were rascals, weren't we?
- No, you were good boys.
I would have that time again.
And here it is.
Nothing has changed.
Except for the fountain.
- The old well would go dry, remember?
- Promptly, every summer.
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.
- He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
- No?
Of course he has.
He was a boy when he left us, now he's a man.
With great responsibilities.
Come.
The emperor builds and builds, turning brick to marble.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.
I've never seen anything like this before.
It's beautiful!
- Is it Roman?
- It's Libyan.
I was there last year.
A tremendous campaign.
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.
Or was, till we destroyed it.
Now it's nothing but ashes.
I'm boring you with soldier stories.
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.
Thank you for this.
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.
What do you think of it?
Magnificent.
It's Arabic.
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.
Let me try him sometime.
Whenever you like.
He's yours.
Do you mean you'll give me this?
Oh, Judah.
You are good.
It's going to be like old times, I know it.
Judah, tell me, did you think about what I said?
Yes.
Talked to a number of people already.
Spoken against violence, against incidents.
Most of the men agree with me.
Most?
Not all?
No, not all.
Who does not agree?
Well, the resentful, the impatient.
Who are they?
Yes, Judah.
Who are they?
Would I retain your friendship if I became an informer?
Telling the names of criminals is not informing.
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.
Patriots?
!
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.
This is my great opportunity, and yours too.
If I bring order here, I can have any post I want.
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?
Rome!
Yes, perhaps at the side of Caesar himself.
I mean it.
It can happen and this is the moment.
I swear, this is the time.
The emperor is watching us, judging us.
All I need do is serve him.
And all you need do is help me serve him.
- You speak as if he were God.
- He is God.
The only God.
He is power, real power on earth, not...
Not that.
Help me, Judah.
I would do anything for you, Messala except betray my own people.
In the name of all the gods, what do the lives of a few Jews mean to you?
If I cannot persuade them, that does not mean I would help you murder them.
Besides, you must understand this, Messala.
I believe in the past and future of my people.
Future?
You are a conquered people.
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?
Joshua will not rise again to save you nor David.
There is only one reality in the world today.
Look to the West.
Don't be a fool!
Look to Rome!
Better a fool than a traitor or a killer.
- I am a soldier.
- Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.
- I warn you-
- No!
I warn you.
Rome is an affront to God.
Rome is strangling my people and my country, the whole earth!
But not forever.
And I tell you, the day Rome falls there will be a shout of freedom such as the world has never heard before.
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.
You're either for me or against me.
If that is the choice then I am against you.
There they are.
Where's Messala?
- Where's-?
- He's gone.
Gone?
- But why?
- He couldn't stay.
- What happened?
- A new tribune must have many duties.
Come.
Let us have dinner.
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the world who bringeth to us bread from the earth.
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.
He wanted to use me to betray our people.
- Master, the caravan from Antioch.
- Yes, Amrah, I saw.
Simonides.
- Oh, welcome homecoming.
- Master.
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.
And for the master, Iberian wine.
Not to mention the best gift of all, your presence.
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.
- Caravans from Petra.
- Have all arrived.
- Good.
- Here is the accounting.
And what of Numidia?
The trade route is ours, guaranteed by treaty with the king.
Once a year, you bring your accounting.
And once a year, I find myself wealthier.
Yeah, but my greatest treasure is my steward.
My life belongs to the House of Hur.
Nothing else exists for me, except my daughter.
- She must be a young woman by now.
- Yes, and your property.
She was born the daughter of your slave.
When I inherited you, I inherited a friend, not a slave.
Still, Esther has come with me from Antioch for your permission to marry.
It's granted.
I wish you the joy of many grandchildren.
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.
With your permission, Esther wishes to speak to her master.
You're eager to marry, Esther?
It is my father's wish.
Your husband will be fortunate.
What is his name?
David, son of Mathias.
Of what house?
- His own, master.
- He is a freeman.
Tell me more about him.
I have seen him only once.
He is a merchant, well-thought-of in Antioch.
He will pay for Esther's freedom.
Her freedom will be my wedding gift to Esther.
You are generous, master.
Do you love this man?
I will learn to love him.
You have my permission to marry.
We'll drink to your happiness.
And a safe return to Antioch.
I disturbed you.
No.
What were you thinking?
I was saying goodbye to this city and this house.
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?
My father sometimes brought me here when I was little.
It was a house where I was always happy.
Except once.
When you and your friend, the Roman boy...
- Messala.
- Yes.
You had been out hunting and they brought you home injured.
I touched your face as you lay there and prayed to God, "Don't let this boy die. "
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.
Yes, master.
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.
It's strange.
I hardly felt a slave.
And now I hardly feel free.
You know, in the old, wise days of Solomon if there was among his slaves some girl who filled his eyes he could choose her out from the rest and take her to him.
Wise days of Solomon.
Different days.
And long ago.
If you were not a bride I should kiss you goodbye.
If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said.
Your slave ring.
Fair exchange.
Freedom to you.
The ring to me.
You will wear it?
Until you meet the woman you will marry?
Until then.
The gods favor my lord Gratus.
If it is the governor's pleasure, the wreath of office.
Thank you, tribune.
I see no delegation from the city.
- There will not be one, sir.
- No?
Jerusalem's welcome will not be a warm one.
But I pledge, my lord, it will be a quiet one.
Let us proceed.
There's Messala.
He saw you, Judah.
The new governor.
Stand back!
- Stand back.
- You, come!
Had to be the Jews!
Open up in the name of the divine emperor!
Judah!
Tirzah!
What is it?
What's happened?
Open up in the name of the law!
- I was watching the-
- A tile fell and struck the governor.
- It wasn't my fault.
- They won't believe her.
She won't have to say anything.
You hear?
Tirzah, say nothing.
Open the gates!
I'll speak to them.
- Arrest him!
- Let me tell you what happened.
- Hold those women.
- Stop them!
It was an accident.
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.
- This is the man, sir.
We saw him.
- It was an accident.
- Accident?
- I swear it.
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose.
It gave way.
Take him.
Take all of them.
- He's telling the truth!
- It was me!
Let them go!
Attention!
Messala.
In the name of God, tell them it's a mistake.
I leaned on the tile, and it broke loose.
It was an accident.
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!
Let the servants go.
Let them go.
Return to your ranks.
Come.
Where?
Tirus.
Tirus?
I've had no trial.
I'm to die in the galleys without even a trial?
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!
Wait.
My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?
Tie his hands.
- At least tell me if they're safe.
- I can tell you nothing.
Get along.
Keep moving.
Jailer!
Guard, in there!
Up the stairs!
Jailer!
Jailer!
To the right.
- Wait!
- Send them out.
Go!
The door.
Where are my mother and sister?
Where are they?
Here, within these walls.
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.
Of course, they will be sentenced.
Is it possible?
Is it possible you could do this to us?
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?
You will let them go.
You will gladly let them go!
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not a murderer!
I know you're not.
You know?
You are evil.
No, Judah, I am not evil.
I wanted your help.
Now you've given it to me.
By making this example of you, I discourage treason.
By condemning without hesitation an old friend, I shall be feared.
But not my family.
Let them go.
Please.
- Messala, I beg you.
- Beg?
!
Didn't I beg you?
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.
Kill me, and your mother and sister will die nailed to crosses in front of you!
Go on, Judah.
Kill me!
May God grant me vengeance.
I will pray that you live till I return.
Return?
Take him.
Sentries, salute.
The tribune will see you now.
Tribune, I'm steward of the House of Hur.
I remember you.
We were on our way to Antioch when we heard what had happened.
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done this thing.
You knew him, tribune.
Better than you.
Then there must be no doubt in your mind, the charge is groundless.
The prisoners have been sentenced.
- Sentenced?
- But there's no truth in it.
There was never a threat against the governor in Judah's mind.
Surely you must know he would never have done this.
In your heart, you must know it.
Drusus.
This man had better be kept here until we can question him.
Hold!
Water for the soldiers.
Soldiers first!
Get away from that well.
No water for them!
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!
Come on, you!
Water for the horses!
- Water.
Water.
- Soldiers first!
Here.
Wait.
No water for him.
God help me.
You!
I said no water for him!
All right, on your feet, all of you!
Get them on their feet!
Back in line, you dog!
On your feet!
Get them going!
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!
Forward, you dogs!
Soon, the counselor's barge will be coming alongside.
Be ready to raise oars.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.
- How many rowers?
- Two hundred, consul.
- And reliefs?
- Of 30, every hour.
This man is ill.
Replace him.
- Change him.
- Right, sir.
- This man's been giving you trouble?
- He's insubordinate, consul.
That will stop.
What service have you seen?
Forty-one.
A month's less a day in this ship.
You keep an exact account.
And before?
Three years in other ships.
Three years.
You have the spirit to fight back but the good sense to control it.
Your eyes are full of hate, 41.
That's good.
Hate keeps a man alive.
It gives him strength.
Now, listen to me, all of you.
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
So row well and live.
- Ship ready, consul.
- Strike oars.
Strike oars!
You know a fleet of Macedonian galleys has been raiding Roman commerce.
The emperor has honored us with the task of seeking out and destroying them.
Battle speed, hortator.
Battle speed!
Attack speed.
Attack speed!
Ramming speed.
Ramming speed!
Rest.
Halt!
Rest!
Why are you here?
I was ordered to report to you during my relief.
Oh, yes.
I'd forgotten.
You could have killed me as I lay there.
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?
I'm not ready to die.
What do you think will save you?
The God of my fathers.
Your God has forsaken you.
He has no more power than the images I pray to.
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.
I might.
Does that interest you, 41?
I can see that it does.
I'm a fighting man by profession, and in my leisure moments it amuses me to train fighting men.
I own some of the best gladiators and charioteers in Rome.
Would you like to become one of them?
To die as your slave?
Better than to live in chains below these decks.
I will not be here forever.
No?
What would you do if you escaped?
Two people were condemned with me, my mother and sister though they were innocent.
I won't rest...
Do not say that you were innocent.
- Would it do any good to say it again?
- No.
Consider my offer carefully.
You will never escape while we are victorious.
If we are not, you will sink with this ship, chained to your oar.
I cannot believe that God has let me live these years to die chained to an oar.
It's a strange, stubborn faith you keep to believe that existence has a purpose.
A sane man would have learned to lose it long before this.
As you have.
What drove it out of you?
Go back to your oar, 41.
Consul, enemy sighted.
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.
All the watch to battle posts.
- Stand by to load.
- Make ready to fire.
Hurry, quick!
Hurry up with that resin.
Get some more ammunition.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
Chain rowers!
Guard.
Unlock 41.
No!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
41, why did he do that?
I don't know.
Once before, a man helped me.
I didn't know why then.
Normal speed!
Number 1, flame.
Fire.
Fire!
Fire!
Hold withdrawal on command.
Lift oars!
Raise!
Withdraw!
Steersman, right.
Extend oars!
Fire!
- Watch out!
- Fire!
Steersman, ram course!
Order below!
- Ramming speed!
- Ramming speed!
Consul, barge on ramming course.
We're going to be rammed!
We're going to be rammed!
Why did you save me?
Why did you have me unchained?
What is your name, 41?
Judah Ben-Hur. ...let me die.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
Row well and live.
Is the sail square?
I can't tell.
Better for us both if it's the enemy.
My death.
Your freedom.
It's a Roman sail.
Face rear!
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.
Water.
The fleet, all lost?
Five galleys.
- And the battle?
- The battle was won.
You have a victory.
- It was a victory?
- Complete.
In His eagerness to save you your God has also saved the Roman fleet.
Hail Arrius!
Right oars!
You have cleared the seaways of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.
This baton of victory has been nobly won.
This man riding beside you, who is he?
The man who saved me, divine emperor, to return and serve you.
Is that all you know about him?
No.
He was accused of an attack on the governor of Judea.
But he was innocent.
If not, there's a strange inconsistency in this man who tries to kill my governor, yet saves the life of my consul.
Come tomorrow.
We'll talk of it.
We have all the information on this man a man of some influence in his own country.
His attack upon our governor is one upon the senate and the people of Rome.
I am convinced that no such attack was intended.
Consul, allow us to continue.
Allow us to be generous.
As a reward to you for your great victory we shall not send him back to the galleys.
Take him as your slave.
Such is the will of the senate and the people of Rome.
Not long ago, I returned to Rome with a young man who had saved my life.
You all know him as the finest charioteer in Rome.
Five times, he's driven my horses to victory.
I know him as one who stands in the place of the son I lost.
I have the love and pride in a son's achievements which I thought I should never have again.
Nothing could make stronger our bond but tonight I wish to share it with you all.
The formalities of adoption have been completed.
Young Arrius is now the legal bearer of my name and the heir to my property.
This ring of my ancestors would have gone to my son.
So now it is yours.
It's a strange destiny that brought me to a new life a new home a new father.
It brought me here.
It may take me away.
But wherever I may be I shall always try to wear this ring as a son of Arrius should.
With gratitude and affection and with honor.
My old friend Pontius Pilate, young Arrius.
Before you came to this city, my horses always won.
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.
Yes, but not swift enough to defeat you.
- Tell me, you come from Judea?
- Yes, sir.
I hear that the climate is difficult to live in.
Not for Judeans.
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.
- Of Judea?
- Yes.
I asked for Alexandria.
But it seems the wilderness needs my particular talents.
The scorpions and holy prophets can't get on without me.
Lay the dust of Judea, at least for this evening.
Goats and Jehovah.
You're leaving.
I must.
It's a journey I can't keep you from.
Your eyes have never left it all these months.
I can recognize pain.
But still, my counsel is to wait.
Gratus is to be replaced.
The governorship goes to Pontius Pilate.
When?
Very soon.
It's very much to our purpose.
Nothing is to the purpose if, when I come back to Judea, I come too late.
That is the thought which has punished me every moment I've spent here.
Will Rome see you again?
Here is a part of my life which you have made for me.
I shall remember it.
Whoever the gods are, they take small interest in an old man's hopes.
They have their way.
Forgive me.
You're a stranger here.
Would you be from Nazareth?
Why do you ask?
I thought you might be the one...
The one that I have come back from my country to find.
He would be about your age.
Who?
When I find Him I shall know Him.
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.
Sack of flesh without brains!
No!
No!
Not the whip!
That is my host.
Gently!
Gently!
Fool!
Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood.
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run!
Go on!
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!
Beautiful horses.
Now!
Now!
They are ready!
Let them go!
Watch.
They'll never hold the turn.
No!
No!
Abadon, stop him!
Stop that whip!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill-!
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!
You think you can treat my horses like animals?
!
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!
Get off, idiot!
Drive goats, not horses!
I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.
Not a team?
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.
- Antares.
- The slow one?
He should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?
In the circus in Rome.
You have driven in the great circus?
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.
No other animal has descended so in scale from the first innocent falling of the world.
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.
Yes.
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.
Your coming here was so fit, so right.
We might have achieved wonders!
You have to go.
I make a journey which will not wait.
Ah, well, then perhaps you will come back.
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.
I have no wives.
No wives at all?
I have six, no, seven.
I've counted eight.
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.
- Someday, I hope to have one.
- One wife!
One God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.
It is not generous.
- Was the food not to your liking?
- Indeed.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.
And now I must say good night to my beauties.
When ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.
- I'll make my farewells then.
- No, no, no, stay.
Stay and see them.
Come, my children.
Come.
Strangers make them shy.
Come.
Come, do not be afraid.
Come.
There, my children.
They are descended from the Arabians of the Pharaohs and I have named them for the stars.
Come, Antares.
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.
What?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.
Come, Rigel.
We've both supped well, and the world is good.
There's my good Rigel.
Yes, you are ready for sleep.
The day's work done for you, eh?
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.
Good night.
Good night, my treasure.
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.
No.
You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.
You should see their mother, Mira.
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.
All right, all right.
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.
You must be strong and swift.
Go, my children.
Go.
At Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams and the champion of the East, Messala, with his black devils.
He stops at nothing to win.
- Messala?
In the circus?
- Yes.
You knew him?
I know him.
Perhaps without much liking.
My people are praying for a man to drive their team to victory over Messala.
You could be that man, the one to stamp his arrogance into the sand.
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.
It's not possible.
That is a pity.
Think of it.
To break his pride to humble this tribune before the very people he has degraded.
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!
I know it is not possible.
Does it not delight your imagination?
Does it not answer your purpose?
I must deal with Messala in my own way.
And your way is to kill him.
I see this terrible thing in your eyes.
But no matter what this man has done, you have no right to kill him.
He will be punished inevitably.
I don't believe in miracles.
But all life is a miracle.
Why will you not accept God's judgment?
You do not believe in miracles.
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness and a star led me to a village called Bethlehem where I found a newborn child in a manger.
And God lived in this child.
By now, He is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.
That is why I have returned here so that I may be at hand when He comes among us.
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.
Perhaps He's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.
Perhaps He is a shepherd a merchant, a fisherman.
But He lives and all our lives from now on will carry His mark.
There are many paths to God, my son.
I hope yours will not be too difficult.
I'm ready for sleep.
Balthasar is a good man but until all men are like him, we must keep our swords bright.
And our intention true.
So I must leave you.
One last thought.
There is no law in the arena.
Many are killed.
I hope to see you again.
Fine Damascus silk.
Fine Damascus silk.
Esther?
It's Judah.
You are alive.
You are alive.
What are you doing here?
What has happened?
I'm here.
I'm with you.
Where's your father?
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.
They tortured him.
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.
You never went back to Antioch?
No.
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.
Where are my mother and sister?
Let me tell him first.
Father.
Father, something wonderful has happened.
Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
He has come home.
He is here.
Judah.
Judah Ben-Hur.
My dear old friend.
Let me look at you.
Let me see you.
Yes, yes.
It is true.
Praise God for His mercy.
Where are they?
Since that terrible day there has been no word of them.
You should have been less loyal.
Do not pity me, Master Judah.
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.
We were released on the same day.
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.
Since then, I have been his tongue and he has been my legs.
Together, we make a considerable man.
Old friend.
She always said you would return.
She never gave up hope.
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.
I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.
But suppose that isn't possible.
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.
They could not make me tell them where it is.
It is there still to put power into our hands and buy death for the Romans.
That's not why I came back.
Judah, they are dead.
Four years.
No one could live so long in the dungeons.
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?
Yes, it is true.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You have come back to us like a returning faith.
Judah, I should like to laugh again.
- Let us laugh.
- We will.
There will be joy again in this house.
We will celebrate among the dust.
I will take him.
We stood here before.
A long while ago.
Four years.
But now it seems as if only yesterday....
I was saying:
"If you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye. "
"If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said. "
I am not a bride.
Why did you never marry?
My father needed me.
And also....
It's still on my finger.
I said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.
It's become a part of my hand.
If Messala once knew you were here....
As he must.
He will know where they are.
And if you should find...?
- If he says they're dead-
- Messala will wish they were living.
I've seen too much of what hate can do.
My father is burned up with it.
But I've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater and love more powerful than hatred.
I believe it.
- Esther.
- Judah.
Stay alive.
Keep away from Messala.
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.
That time isn't yet come.
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.
This time you will be destroyed.
You'll die.
Tribune, compliments of Quintus Arrius.
He awaits your pleasure.
- Consul here?
- Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.
Thank him.
Bring him to me.
- I didn't know the consul had a son.
- He's a champion of the great circus.
Why is he presenting me with gifts?
- Perhaps he'll race against you.
- Look.
It's magnificent.
And from a man I've never met.
You're wrong, Messala.
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?
You were the magician, Messala.
You condemned me to the galleys.
When my ship was sunk, I saved the consul's life.
You know his seal?
Now I have come back as I swore I would.
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.
You suggest I use it on myself?
What has become of my mother and my sister?
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.
Find them, Messala.
Restore them to me, and I'll forget what I vowed with every stroke of that oar you chained me to.
I am not the governor.
I can do nothing without approval.
Then get it.
I will come back tomorrow.
Don't disappoint me, Messala.
What became of them?
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?
Go to the citadel, Drusus.
Find out.
- And if they're dead?
- They're dead!
"Miriam, wife.
Tirzah, daughter. "
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?
E section lower level.
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.
Water.
Water.
Let me out!
- How long since you've seen them?
- Never.
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.
The food disappears.
Lepers.
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.
Then we'll burn out the cell.
Is someone there?
There is someone there.
Who are you?
Don't come any closer.
Who are you?
Esther.
It's Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam?
Stay where you are.
You have come home.
Stand back, Esther.
We are lepers.
Oh, Esther.
Tirzah.
Esther is Judah living?
Yes, he is alive.
He is here.
Where?
He is searching for you now.
I must find him and tell him.
- No!
- Tell my father.
No.
Tell no one.
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.
We won't return.
Judah has to be told.
No.
Please.
I couldn't see his face.
Is it changed?
No, he is not changed.
He's not changed.
You love him, Esther.
Promise me on your love for him you will never tell him you've seen us.
Is he never to know?
Let him remember us as we were.
Promise me.
There's nothing else I can hope for.
Only this.
I promise.
I am content.
Wait.
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.
I pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.
He'll free them.
He wants to survive.
He cannot free them, Judah.
What do you mean?
I saw them.
You saw them?
Where?
When did you see them?
They were dead.
They were dead.
When?
When?
When?
!
In the prison.
When I was waiting for news of my father.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't tell you.
Nor even you, Father.
I was afraid that if you saw Messala....
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.
It's over now.
Over?
- Judah.
- Over?
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.
Gentlemen.
Officers.
Defenders of great Rome's imperium may I enter?
Certainly, sheik.
You do us an unexpected honor.
The noble tribune is most gracious.
And now the question you're asking:
Why am I here?
As you know, I am a gambling man.
The games approach.
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.
I will back my own poor horses.
No limits?
- Mark me first!
- And me!
- What odds?
- A moment, please my lords, protectors of the far flung marshes.
May I first sit down?
Sit.
How much will you wager?
- Yes, let's call his game.
- Give the Arab a seat.
A bench, quickly.
Thank you.
- Now.
-1000 denarii.
-2000!
- Mark me!
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient.
There is time.
First gentlemen, the odds.
The tribune has won many times.
The odds should be in the same measure.
What is your pleasure, gentlemen?
Two to one.
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth where is the courage that made Rome master of the world?
I can get better odds on any street market.
Three to one.
Let us not haggle.
Let us be fair.
In four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.
- In all truth-
- Just a moment.
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.
The Prince of Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur.
Prince of Hur?
- He was sent to the galleys years ago.
- He has returned.
Returned?
Impossible.
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.
Well?
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.
You, tribune will you give me four to one?
Four to one.
Good.
Four to one, sheik.
The difference between a Roman and a Jew.
Or an Arab.
Bravely spoken.
Now we will settle the amount of our wager.
I will venture....
A thousand talents?
- A thousand talents?
- Yes, a thousand talents.
Of course, if it is too much....
A thousand talents it will be.
Agreed.
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.
You're good fellows.
If only men were this good.
Remember, Altair nine times around the circus.
Aldebaran.
Rigel, did you hear?
Nine lives to live.
My swift fellow.
You must not win the race the first time around.
You win the last time around.
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.
Steady Antares.
Like a rock.
You will be our anchor.
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.
They have taken me into their family.
Rest well, my stars.
Tomorrow we go up to the city.
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it the news will scorch the streets of the Roman world.
Pontius Pilate here?
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.
You will make him see what men are born in this land.
I only know that I race against Messala.
Look for the yoke.
Ease that strap.
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.
Into Your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as You will.
The Star of David.
To shine out for your people and my people together and blind the eyes of Rome.
They are ready.
Easy, girl, easy.
Number five.
Where is number five?
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.
Yes, this is the day.
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.
Hail, Jupiter.
Give me victory.
Watch your line!
Keep your places!
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.
Citizens I welcome you to these games in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.
We dedicate them to his glory and to the glory of Rome of which you are all part.
Let us honor those who race for us today.
They come here from Alexandria Messina Carthage Cyprus Rome Corinth Athens Phrygia and Judea.
To the best of these, a crown of victory.
The race begins.
Hail, Caesar!
Come, my children, come!
The Roman pig!
Salute.
A great victory.
You are the people's one true god for the time being.
Permit us to worship.
I crown their god.
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.
A long life, young Arrius and the good sense to live it.
We cannot wait, tribune.
He will come.
He will...
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.
He will come!
He will come.
I've sent for him, and he will come.
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.
Do you understand?
To hack the legs off me?
Not yet.
Not till I've seen him.
I don't receive him with half a body.
No!
I told you, Drusus.
I told you.
Here he is.
Triumph complete, Judah.
The race won.
The enemy destroyed.
I see no enemy.
What do you think you see?
The smashed body of a wretched animal?
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.
Let me help you.
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.
Dead.
And the race over.
It isn't over, Judah.
They're not dead.
Where are they?
Where are they?
Look for them in the Valley of the Lepers if you can recognize them.
It goes on.
It goes on, Judah.
The race....
The race is not over.
Is there a way down here?
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.
Man.
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.
There are many women.
Of the family of Hur.
We have no names here.
For them?
- Why did you say they were dead?
- It was what they wanted.
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?
Not to see them?
They are coming.
Love them in the way they must need to be loved.
Not to look at them.
Let them be as if you had never come here.
Please!
Is Judah well?
Is he happy?
Yes, he is well.
Your mind can be at rest for him.
He is well, Miriam.
God be with you.
They have gone.
We can go back.
Go back to what?
Judah, they have one blessing left.
To think you remember them as they were and live your own life.
Forget what is here.
Forget?
It's as though they're alive in a grave.
- But what can you do?
- Undo what you've done.
How could you have suffered them to come here?
I must see them.
No, Judah, please!
Judah!
Think, Judah, think.
It would tear them apart if they see you.
He is here.
I have found Him.
The child has become a man.
And the man, I know it now, is the Son of God.
The promise is true.
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.
Life has been answered.
God has answered it.
Come.
Come with me.
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys thirst had nearly killed me.
A man gave me water to drink.
I went on living.
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.
No.
I am thirsty still.
Come and listen.
I have business with Rome.
You insist on death.
Goodbye, Judah.
You sent for me?
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.
- I honor him.
- As you may honor yourself.
You have been made a citizen of Rome.
Do you say nothing to this?
I have just come from the Valley of Stone where my mother and sister live what's left of their lives.
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.
I have heard this.
There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.
Where there is greatness, great government or power even great feeling or compassion error also is great.
We progress and mature by fault.
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.
There are other voices.
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place not to crucify yourself on a shadow such as old resentment or impossible loyalties.
Perfect freedom has no existence.
A grown man knows the world he lives in.
And for the present, the world is Rome.
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.
I am Judah Ben-Hur.
I cross this floor in spoken friendship as I would speak to Arrius.
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar ready to crush those who challenge his authority.
There are too many men of envy and ambition who try to disrupt the government of Rome.
You have become the victor and hero to those people.
They look to you, their one true god, as I call you.
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.
I am already part of this tragedy.
Return this to Arrius.
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you from personal disaster if you stay here.
You are too great a danger.
Leave Judea.
You have my word.
I was afraid you would never come back afraid of what would happen to you.
But I see you again.
Your father's waiting for me.
Where is he?
What do you mean to do?
Rest, sleep.
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.
Peace?
Love and peace.
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?
Where do you see them?
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.
Balthasar's word.
He is more than Balthasar's word.
His voiced traveled with such a still purpose.
It was more than a voice.
A man more than a man.
He said, "Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God. "
Children of God?
In that dead valley where we left them?
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean until we have scoured off our bodies the crust and filth of being at the mercy of tyranny.
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.
- In blood?
- Yes, in blood!
I know there is a law in life.
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.
Death generates death as the vulture breeds the vulture.
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:
"Love your enemy.
Do good to those who despitefully use you. "
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.
As you make us do now.
Are we to bear nothing together?
Even love?
I can hardly draw breath without feeling you in my heart.
But I know that everything I do from this moment bears greater pain than you have ever suffered.
It is better not to love me.
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy giving evil for evil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.
It's as though you had become Messala.
I've lost you, Judah.
No further.
What are you doing here?
I was here last evening waiting for you.
I have waited all night.
What has happened?
Where is Tirzah?
Leave the food.
I am coming closer.
Don't be afraid.
- What are you doing?
- Don't be afraid.
I've heard Him again, the man from Nazareth.
If ever words were from God, they are in everything He says.
I cannot bear that you should have never known this hand of quiet reaching towards us.
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find Him there.
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find Him.
Tirzah is dying.
Leave the food and go.
It's Judah.
Why did you tell him?
Yes, Judah, yes.
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.
Mother.
Wait, Mother, wait.
Let me talk with you.
Please.
No, no further.
Please.
No, Judah.
Son, no.
Mother, let me see Tirzah.
Tirzah is dying.
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know that life is everlasting and death is nothing to fear if you have faith.
I will take them to Him.
No!
God, no!
No, no, dear son.
Mother where is Tirzah?
Judah, no.
Judah, no.
You must not go to her, dear son.
Please.
Dear son.
I am afraid.
No cause.
The world is more than we know.
Tirzah, it's Judah.
No, Judah.
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
- Why are the streets deserted?
- They have gone to the trial.
Trial?
Whose trial?
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.
- This cannot be true.
- Alms?
What has he done?
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.
Help for the blind.
- Look, lepers!
- Lepers!
Get away!
Stay away!
Go away!
Lepers!
Lepers!
How can this be?
I know this man.
Will someone help Him?
Take pity on Him.
Have mercy.
In His pain this look of peace.
Watch over them, Esther.
We must go back.
I brought you here to this when I hoped....
You haven't failed, Esther.
Hail King of the Jews!
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.
He gave me water and a heart to live.
What has He done to merit this?
He has taken the world of our sins onto Himself.
To this end He said He was born in that stable where I first saw Him.
For this cause, He came into the world.
For this death?
This beginning.
I have lived too long.
As though He were carrying in that cross the pain of the world.
So fearful, and yet why is it I'm not afraid anymore?
The shadow of a storm.
A strange darkness but still day.
His life is over.
What is it?
This tearing.
I am in pain.
I feel it too.
Do you see your hand?
Almost at the moment He died I heard Him say, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do. "
Even then.
Even then.
And I felt His voice take the sword out of my hand.
In the year of our Lord Judea, for nearly a century, had lain under the mastery of Rome.
In the seventh year of the reign of Augustus Caesar an imperial decree ordered every Judean each to return to his place of birth to be counted and taxed.
The converging ways of many of them led to their capital city, Jerusalem the troubled heart of their land.
The old city was dominated by the fortress of Antonia the seat of Roman power and by the great golden temple the outward sign of an inward and imperishable faith.
Even while they obeyed the will of Caesar the people clung proudly to their ancient heritage always remembering the promise of their prophets that one day there would be born among them a redeemer to bring them salvation and perfect freedom.
You'll be counted at Hebron.
- Name?
- Samuel.
- What city?
- Joppa.
- What family?
- Michael.
- Move on.
Move on.
- Yes.
- Name?
- Joseph.
- What city?
- Nazareth.
- What family?
- David of Bethlehem.
- And the woman?
- My wife.
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.
Come on, come on.
What village is this?
Nazareth.
We should arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow night.
You're not watching the soldiers, Joseph?
We've seen Romans before.
Yes and we will see them again.
My table is not finished.
Where is your son?
He's walking in the hills.
He neglects his work, Joseph.
No.
Once, I reproached him with forgetting his work.
He said to me:
"I must be about my father's business."
Then why isn't he here, working?
He's working.
Trumpeters of the legion!
Welcome, Messala.
The command is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for relieving me.
Drusus when I was a boy, I dreamed of commanding this garrison.
Now the wheel has turned.
I am in command.
Attention!
Aisle one, face right!
Forward!
I'd forgotten the heat.
If it were only the heat.
I lived here until I was 14.
Jerusalem was my home.
- My father was head of...
- Yes, I know.
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.
If there can be such a thing in this forsaken land.
If you want to rise, Sextus, do the difficult.
I asked to be sent here.
I think you'll find the people changed since you were a boy.
In what way?
Oh, won't pay their taxes, an irrational resentment of Rome...
There's nothing new in all that.
And then there's religion.
I tell you, they're drunk with religion.
They smash the statues of our gods, even those of the emperor.
Punish them.
We do.
When we can find them.
Find the leaders.
Oh, you don't know.
There's nothing you can put your finger on.
I tell you, there are strange forces at work here.
For instance, this "messiah" business...
I know.
There was one predicted when I was a boy.
A king of the Jews, who will lead them into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.
Makes your head spin.
There's a wild man in the desert named John who drowns people in water.
And a carpenter's son who does magic tricks. "Miracles" they call them.
There's always a rabble-rouser stirring up trouble.
No, no, no.
This man is different.
He teaches that God is near, in every man.
It's actually quite profound, some of it.
You've been too long away from Rome.
Go back, Sextus.
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea and forget that God is in every man.
- There is divinity in only one man.
- Yes, I know.
The emperor is displeased.
He wishes Judea made into a more obedient and disciplined province.
He has ordered me to restore order.
I intend to carry out his wishes.
But how?
You can break a man's skull, arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.
But how do you control what's up here?
How do you fight an idea?
Especially a new idea.
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.
I assume he has a name.
- He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
- Then treat him like one!
Tell him I will join him.
Yes, tribune.
Centurion!
This was his country before it was ours.
Don't forget that.
Yes, tribune.
Very wise.
This Ben-Hur is the richest man in Jerusalem.
And the head of one of the greatest families in Judea.
We were friends as boys.
We were like brothers.
Sextus you ask how to fight an idea.
Well, I'll tell you how.
With another idea.
I said I'd come back.
I never thought you would.
I'm so glad.
- Look at you.
- Look at you!
You've come back a tribune.
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.
We'll drink another now.
- Your sister and mother?
- They're fine.
They've talked of you ever since we knew you were coming.
- Is Tirzah married?
- No.
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.
She's been in love with you since she was 5.
I can't wait to see them.
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?
Or have you become too dignified?
- Down Eros, up Mars!
- Down Eros, up Mars!
Where the beams cross?
Good.
After all these years!
Still close.
In every way.
I hope so.
I know.
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew whose life you once saved.
The best thing I ever did.
Judah it will be very difficult to govern here.
I'm going to need help.
Your help.
Your advice.
- You want my advice?
- Yes, I do.
Withdraw your legions.
Give us our freedom.
Unfortunately, the emperor is devoted to his empire.
He's particularly fond of Judea.
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.
Is there anything so sad as unrequited love?
My quarters.
A bit grim.
Not grim.
Austere.
Virtuous.
Roman.
I'm going to be second-in-command to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.
He's arriving in a few days with two more legions.
Then the rumors are true.
The emperor does not approve of your countrymen.
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.
But you and your family need have no concern.
I'm next in authority to the governor, and you're my friend.
- I'm a Jew.
- Ah, you are like a Roman!
What have you in common with the troublemaking rabble?
Rabble?
They're my people.
I'm one of them.
Be wise, Judah.
It's a Roman world.
If you want to live in it, you must become part of it.
You've changed.
I've grown up.
I've seen the world since I left Jerusalem.
I've seen Rome.
It's no accident that one small village on the Tiber was chosen to rule the world.
Your legions.
It wasn't just our legions.
Other countries have armies, fine armies.
I know, I fought them.
Oh, no.
No, it was fate that chose us to civilize the world.
And we have.
Our roads and ships connect every corner of the earth.
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.
I believe in the future of my people.
Of course you do.
And you can help them.
How?
You're an aristocrat.
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince among your people.
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.
They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.
Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.
It is worse than stupid, futile!
For it can end in only one way, extinction for your people!
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.
Then we're agreed!
Now, when can I come to see your family?
- We had hoped tomorrow.
- Good.
And now for our toast.
It's dreadful wine, by the way.
It's especially fermented for the Roman army.
You're very cruel to your conquerors.
It's an insane world.
But in it there is one sanity:
The loyalty of old friends.
Judah, we must believe in one another.
Will you drink to that?
With all my heart.
Here it is, the place I've remembered.
The court where we played at changing the guard.
The roof where we'd throw pebbles at people in the street and then hide.
- We were rascals, weren't we?
- No, you were good boys.
I would have that time again.
And here it is.
Nothing has changed.
Except for the fountain.
- The old well would go dry, remember?
- Promptly, every summer.
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.
- He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
- No?
Of course he has.
He was a boy when he left us, now he's a man.
With great responsibilities.
Come.
The emperor builds and builds, turning brick to marble.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.
I've never seen anything like this before.
It's beautiful!
- Is it Roman?
- It's Libyan.
I was there last year.
A tremendous campaign.
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.
Or was, till we destroyed it.
Now it's nothing but ashes.
I'm boring you with soldier stories.
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.
Thank you for this.
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.
What do you think of it?
Magnificent.
It's Arabic.
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.
Let me try him sometime.
Whenever you like.
He's yours.
Do you mean you'll give me this?
Oh, Judah.
You are good.
It's going to be like old times, I know it.
Judah, tell me, did you think about what I said?
Yes.
Talked to a number of people already.
Spoken against violence, against incidents.
Most of the men agree with me.
Most?
Not all?
- No, not all.
- Who does not agree?
Well, the resentful, the impatient.
Who are they?
Yes, Judah.
Who are they?
Would I retain your friendship if I became an informer?
Telling the names of criminals is not informing.
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.
Patriots?
!
Judah.
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.
This is my great opportunity, and yours too.
If I bring order here, I can have any post I want.
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?
Rome!
Yes, perhaps at the side of Caesar himself.
I mean it.
It can happen and this is the moment.
I swear, this is the time.
The emperor is watching us, judging us.
All I need do is serve him.
And all you need do is help me serve him.
- You speak as if he were God.
- He is God.
The only God.
He is power, real power on earth, not...
Not that.
Help me, Judah.
I would do anything for you, Messala except betray my own people.
In the name of all the gods, what do the lives of a few Jews mean to you?
If I cannot persuade them, that does not mean I would help you murder them.
Besides, you must understand this, Messala.
I believe in the past and future of my people.
Future?
You are a conquered people.
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?
Joshua will not rise again to save you nor David.
There is only one reality in the world today.
Look to the West.
Don't be a fool!
Look to Rome!
Better a fool than a traitor or a killer.
- I am a soldier.
- Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.
- I warn you...
- No!
I warn you.
Rome is an affront to God.
Rome is strangling my people and my country, the whole earth!
But not forever.
And I tell you, the day Rome falls there will be a shout of freedom such as the world has never heard before.
Judah.
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.
You're either for me or against me.
If that is the choice then I am against you.
There they are.
Where's Messala?
- Where's?
- He's gone.
Gone?
- But why?
- He couldn't stay.
- What happened?
- A new tribune must have many duties.
Come.
Let us have dinner.
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the world who bringeth to us bread from the earth.
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.
He wanted to use me to betray our people.
Judah.
- Master, the caravan from Antioch.
- Yes, Amrah, I saw.
Simonides.
- Welcome.
- Judah.
- Oh, welcome homecoming.
- Master.
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.
And for the master, lberian wine.
Not to mention the best gift of all, your presence.
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.
- Caravans from Petra.
- Have all arrived.
- Good.
- Here is the accounting.
And what of Numidia?
The trade route is ours, guaranteed by treaty with the king.
Once a year, you bring your accounting.
And once a year, I find myself wealthier.
Yeah, but my greatest treasure is my steward.
My life belongs to the House of Hur.
Nothing else exists for me, except my daughter.
- She must be a young woman by now.
- Yes, and your property.
She was born the daughter of your slave.
When I inherited you, I inherited a friend, not a slave.
Still, Esther has come with me from Antioch for your permission to marry.
It's granted.
I wish you the joy of many grandchildren.
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.
With your permission, Esther wishes to speak to her master.
You're eager to marry, Esther?
It is my father's wish.
Your husband will be fortunate.
What is his name?
David, son of Mathias.
Of what house?
- His own, master.
- He is a freeman.
Tell me more about him.
I have seen him only once.
He is a merchant, well-thought-of in Antioch.
He will pay for Esther's freedom.
Her freedom will be my wedding gift to Esther.
You are generous, master.
Do you love this man?
I will learn to love him.
You have my permission to marry.
We'll drink to your happiness.
And a safe return to Antioch.
I disturbed you.
No.
What were you thinking?
I was saying goodbye to this city and this house.
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?
My father sometimes brought me here when I was little.
It was a house where I was always happy.
Except once.
When you and your friend, the Roman boy...
- Messala.
- Yes.
You had been out hunting and they brought you home injured.
I touched your face as you lay there and prayed to God, "Don't let this boy die."
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.
Yes, master.
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.
It's strange.
I hardly felt a slave.
And now I hardly feel free.
You know, in the old, wise days of Solomon if there was among his slaves some girl who filled his eyes he could choose her out from the rest and take her to him.
Wise days of Solomon.
Different days.
And long ago.
If you were not a bride I should kiss you goodbye.
If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said.
Your slave ring.
Fair exchange.
Freedom to you.
The ring to me.
You will wear it?
Until you meet the woman you will marry?
Until then.
The gods favor my lord Gratus.
If it is the governor's pleasure, the wreath of office.
Thank you, tribune.
I see no delegation from the city.
- There will not be one, sir.
- No?
Jerusalem's welcome will not be a warm one.
But I pledge, my lord, it will be a quiet one.
Let us proceed.
There's Messala.
He saw you, Judah.
The new governor.
Stand back!
- Stand back.
- Up there.
You, come!
Had to be the Jews!
Open up in the name of the divine emperor!
Judah!
Tirzah!
What is it?
What's happened?
Open up in the name of Rome!
- I was watching the Romans...
- A tile fell and struck the governor.
- It wasn't my fault.
- They won't believe her.
She won't have to say anything.
You hear?
Tirzah, say nothing.
Open the gates!
I'll speak to them.
- Arrest him!
- Wait.
Let me tell you what happened.
Hold those women.
Not them!
- Judah!
- It was an accident.
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.
- This is the man, sir.
We saw him.
- It was an accident.
- Accident?
- I swear it.
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose.
It gave way.
Take him.
Take all of them.
He's telling the truth!
- It was me!
Let them go!
Judah!
Attention!
Messala.
In the name of God, tell them it's a mistake.
I leaned on the tile, and it broke loose.
It was an accident.
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!
Messala!
Messala.
Let the servants go.
Let them go.
Return to your ranks.
- Come.
- Where?
Tirus.
Tirus?
I've had no trial.
I'm to die in the galleys without even a trial?
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!
Wait.
My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?
Tie his hands.
- At least tell me if they're safe.
- I can tell you nothing.
Get along.
Keep moving.
Jailer!
Guard, in there!
Up the stairs!
Jailer!
To the right.
Wait!
Send them out.
Send them out.
You can go.
Go!
The door.
Where are my mother and sister?
Where are they?
Here, within these walls.
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.
Of course, they will be sentenced.
Is it possible, Messala?
Is it possible you could do this to us?
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?
You'll let them go.
You must.
You will gladly let them go!
Messala!
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not mad.
I'm not a murderer!
I know you're not.
You know?
You are evil.
No, Judah, I am not evil.
I wanted your help.
Now you've given it to me.
By making this example of you, I discourage treason.
By condemning without hesitation an old friend, I shall be feared.
But not my family.
Let them go.
Please.
- Messala, I beg you.
- Beg?
!
Didn't I beg you?
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.
Kill me, and your mother and sister will die today nailed to crosses in front of you!
Go on, Judah.
Kill me!
May God grant me vengeance.
I will pray that you live till I return.
Return?
Take him.
Sentries, salute.
The tribune will see you now.
Tribune, I'm steward of the House of Hur.
I remember you.
We were on our way to Antioch when we heard what had happened.
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done this thing.
You knew him, tribune.
Better than you.
Then there must be no doubt in your mind, the charge is groundless.
The prisoners have been sentenced.
- Sentenced?
- But there's no truth in it.
There was never a threat against the governor in Judah's mind.
Surely you must know he would never have done this.
In your heart, you must know it.
Drusus.
This man had better be kept here until we have time to question him.
Hold!
Water for the soldiers.
Soldiers first!
Get away from that well!
No water for them!
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!
Come on, you!
Water for the horses!
Water.
Water.
Soldiers first!
Here.
Wait.
No water for him.
God help me.
You!
I said no water for him!
All right, on your feet, all of you!
Get them on their feet!
Back in line, you dog!
On your feet!
Get them going!
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!
Forward, you dogs!
In a few minutes, the consul's barge will be coming alongside.
Be ready to raise oars.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.
- How many rowers?
- Two hundred, consul.
- And reliefs?
- Of 30, every hour.
This man is ill.
Replace him.
- Change him.
- Right, sir.
- This man has been giving you trouble?
- He's insubordinate, consul.
That will stop.
What service have you seen?
Forty-one.
A month's less a day in this ship.
You keep an exact account.
And before?
Three years in other ships.
Three years.
You have the spirit to fight back but the good sense to control it.
Your eyes are full of hate, 41.
That's good.
Hate keeps a man alive.
It gives him strength.
Now, listen to me, all of you.
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
So row well and live.
- Ship ready, consul.
- Strike oars.
Strike oars!
You know that a fleet of Macedonian galleys has been raiding Roman commerce.
The emperor has honored us with the task of seeking out and destroying them.
Battle speed, hortator.
Battle speed!
Attack speed.
Attack speed!
Ramming speed.
Ramming speed!
Rest.
Halt!
Rest!
Why are you here?
I was ordered to report to you during my relief.
Oh, yes.
I'd forgotten.
You could have killed me as I lay there.
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?
I'm not ready to die.
What do you think will save you?
The God of my fathers.
Hmm.
Your God has forsaken you.
He has no more power than the images I pray to.
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.
I might.
Does that interest you, 41?
I can see that it does.
I'm a fighting man by profession, and in my leisure moments it amuses me to train fighting men.
I own some of the best gladiators and charioteers in Rome.
Would you like to become one of them?
To die as your slave?
Better than to live in chains below these decks.
I will not be here forever.
No?
What would you do if you escaped?
Two people were condemned with me, my mother and sister though they were innocent.
I won't rest...
Do not say that you were innocent.
- Would it do any good to say it again?
- No.
Consider my offer carefully.
You will never escape while we are victorious.
If we are not, you will sink with this ship, chained to your oar.
I cannot believe that God has let me live these three years to die chained to an oar.
It's a strange, stubborn faith you keep to believe that existence has a purpose.
A sane man would have learned to lose it long before this.
As you have.
What drove it out of you?
Go back to your oar, 41.
Consul, enemy sighted.
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.
All the watch to battle posts.
Stand by to load.
Make ready to fire.
Hurry, quick!
Hurry up with that resin.
Get some more ammunition.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
Chain rowers!
Guard.
Unlock 41.
No!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
41, why did he do that?
I don't know.
Once before, a man helped me.
I didn't know why then.
Normal speed!
Number 1, flame.
- Fire.
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Hold withdrawal on command.
Lift oars!
Raise!
Withdraw!
Steersman, right.
Extend oars!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Watch out!
Fire!
Fire!
Steersman, ram course!
Order below!
Ramming speed!
Ramming speed!
Consul, barge on ramming course.
We're going to be rammed!
We're going to be rammed!
Why did you save me?
Why did you have me unchained?
What is your name, 41?
Judah Ben-Hur. ...let me die.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
Row well and live.
Is the sail square?
I can't tell.
Better for us both if it's the enemy.
My death.
Your freedom.
It's a Roman sail.
Face rear!
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.
Water.
The fleet, all lost?
Five galleys.
- And the battle?
- The battle was won.
You have a victory.
It was a victory?
Complete.
In his eagerness to save you your God has also saved the Roman fleet.
Hail Arrius!
Hail Arrius!
Right oars!
You have cleared the seaways of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.
This baton of victory has been nobly won.
This man riding beside you, who is he?
The man who saved me, divine emperor, to return and serve you.
Is that all you know about him?
No.
He was accused of an attack on the governor of Judea.
But he was innocent.
If not, there's a strange inconsistency in this man who tries to kill my governor, yet saves the life of my consul.
Come tomorrow.
We'll talk of it.
We have all the information on this man a man of some influence in his own country.
His attack upon our governor is one upon the senate and the people of Rome.
I am convinced that no such attack was intended.
Consul, allow us to continue.
Allow us to be generous.
As a reward to you for your great victory we shall not send him back to the galleys.
We give him to you as your slave to do with him as you like.
Such is the will of the senate and the people of Rome.
Not long ago, I returned to Rome with a young man who had saved my life.
You all know him as the finest charioteer in Rome.
Five times, he's driven my horses to victory.
I know him as one who stands in the place of the son I lost.
I have the love and pride in a son's achievements which I thought I should never have again.
Nothing could make stronger the bond between us but tonight I wish to share it with you all.
The formalities of adoption have been completed.
Young Arrius is now the legal bearer of my name and the heir to my property.
This ring of my ancestors would have gone to my son.
So now it is yours.
It's a strange destiny that brought me to a new life a new home a new father.
It brought me here.
It may take me away.
But wherever I may be I shall always try to wear this ring as a son of Arrius should.
With gratitude and affection and with honor.
I present my son to you.
My old friend Pontius Pilate, young Arrius.
Before you came to this city, my horses always won.
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.
Yes, but not swift enough to defeat you.
- Tell me, you come from Judea?
- Yes, sir.
I hear that the climate is difficult to live in.
Not for Judeans.
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.
- Of Judea?
- Yes.
I asked for Alexandria.
But it seems the wilderness needs my particular talents.
The scorpions and holy prophets can't get on without me.
Lay the dust of Judea, at least for this evening.
Goats and Jehovah.
You're leaving.
I must.
It's a journey I can't keep you from.
Your eyes have never left it all these months.
I can recognize pain.
But still, my counsel is to wait.
Gratus is to be replaced.
The governorship goes to Pontius Pilate.
When?
Very soon.
It's very much to our purpose.
Nothing is to the purpose if, when I come back to Judea, I come too late.
That is the thought which has punished me every moment I've spent here.
Will Rome see you again?
Here is a part of my life which you have made for me.
I shall remember it.
Whoever the gods are, they take small interest in an old man's hopes.
They have their way.
Forgive me.
You're a stranger here.
Would you be from Nazareth?
Why do you ask?
I thought you might be the one...
The one that I have come back from my country to find.
He would be about your age.
Who?
When I find him I shall know him.
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.
Hyah!
Hyah!
Sack of flesh without brains!
No!
No!
Not the whip!
That is my host.
Gently!
Gently!
Fool!
Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood!
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run!
Go on!
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!
Beautiful horses.
Now!
Now!
They are ready!
Let them go!
Watch.
They'll never hold the turn.
No!
No!
Abadon, stop him!
Stop that whip!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill!
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!
You think you can treat my horses like animals?
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!
Get off, idiot!
Drive goats, not horses!
Now I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.
Hmm?
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.
Not a team?
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.
- Antares.
- The slow one?
Uh-huh.
I think he should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?
In the circus in Rome.
You have driven in the great circus?
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.
No other animal has descended so in scale from the first innocent falling of the world.
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.
Yes.
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.
Your coming here was so fit, so right.
We might have achieved wonders.
You have to go.
I make a journey which will not wait.
Well, then perhaps you will come back.
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.
I have no wives.
No wives at all?
I have six, no, seven.
Ha, ha.
I've counted eight.
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.
- Someday, I hope to have one.
- One wife!
Ha, ha, one God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.
It is not generous.
- Was the food not to your liking?
- Indeed.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.
And now I must say good night to my beauties.
When they're ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.
- I'll make my farewells then.
- No, no, no, stay.
Stay and see them.
Come, my children.
Come.
Strangers make them shy.
Come.
Come, do not be afraid.
Come.
There, my children.
They are descended from the Arabians of the first Pharaohs and I have named them for the stars.
Come, Antares.
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.
What?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.
Come, Rigel.
We've both supped well, and the world is good.
There's my good Rigel.
Yes, you are ready for sleep.
The day's work done for you, eh?
Ah.
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.
Good night.
Good night, my treasure.
Ah!
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.
No.
You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.
You should see their mother, Mira.
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.
All right, all right.
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.
You must be strong and swift.
Go, my children.
Go.
When they reach Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams not to mention the champion of the East, Messala, with his black devils.
He stops at nothing to win.
- Messala?
In the circus?
- Yes.
You knew him?
I know him.
Perhaps without much liking.
Judah Ben-Hur, my people are praying for a man to drive their team to victory over Messala.
You could be that man, the one to stamp his arrogance into the sand.
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.
It's not possible.
That is a pity.
Think of it.
To break his pride to humble this tribune before the very people he has degraded.
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!
I know it is not possible.
Does it not delight your imagination?
Does it not answer your purpose?
I must deal with Messala in my own way.
And your way is to kill him.
I see this terrible thing in your eyes, Judah Ben-Hur.
But no matter what this man has done, you have no right to take his life.
He will be punished inevitably.
I don't believe in miracles.
But all life is a miracle.
Why will you not accept God's judgment?
You do not believe in miracles.
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness and a star led me to a village called Bethlehem where I found a newborn child in a manger.
And God lived in this child.
By now, he is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.
That is why I have returned here so that I may be at hand when he comes among us.
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.
Perhaps he's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.
Perhaps he is a shepherd a merchant, a fisherman.
But he lives and all our lives from now on will carry his mark.
There are many paths to God, my son.
I hope yours will not be too difficult.
I'm ready for sleep.
Balthasar is a good man but until all men are like him, we must keep our swords bright.
And our intention true.
So I must leave you.
One last thought.
There is no law in the arena.
Many are killed.
I hope to see you again.
Fine Damascus silk.
Fine Damascus silk.
Esther?
It's Judah.
Judah.
- You are alive.
- Esther.
You are alive.
What are you doing here?
What has happened?
Shh.
I'm here.
I'm with you.
Esther.
Where's your father?
Hmm?
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.
They tortured him.
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.
You never went back to Antioch?
No.
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.
Esther.
Where are my mother and sister?
Esther.
Let me tell him first.
Father.
Father, something wonderful has happened.
- Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
- Judah.
He has come home.
He is here.
Judah.
Judah Ben-Hur.
My dear old friend.
Let me look at you.
Let me see you.
Yes, yes.
It is true.
Praise God for his mercy.
Where are they?
Since that terrible day there has been no word of them.
You should have been less loyal.
Do not pity me, Master Judah.
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.
We were released on the same day.
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.
Since then, I have been his tongue and he has been my legs.
Together, we make a considerable man.
Old friend.
She always said you would return.
She never gave up hope.
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.
I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.
But suppose that isn't possible.
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.
They could not make me tell them where it is.
It is there still to put power into our hands and buy death for the Romans.
That's not why I came back.
Judah, they are dead.
Four years.
No one could live so long in the dungeons.
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?
Yes, it is true.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You have come back to us like a returning faith.
Judah, I should like to laugh again.
- Let us laugh.
- We will.
There will be joy again in this house.
We will celebrate among the dust.
I will take him.
We stood here before.
A long while ago.
Four years.
But now it seems as if only yesterday...
I was saying:
"If you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye."
"If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said."
I am not a bride.
Why did you never marry?
My father needed me.
And also...
It's still on my finger.
I said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.
It's become a part of my hand.
If Messala once knew you were here...
As he must.
He will know where they are.
And if you should find?
- If he should tell you they're dead...
- Then Messala will wish they were living.
I've seen too much of what hate can do.
My father is burned up with it.
But I've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater and love more powerful than hatred.
I believe it.
- Esther.
- Judah.
Stay alive.
Keep away from Messala.
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.
That time isn't yet come.
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.
This time you will be destroyed.
You'll die.
Tribune, compliments of Quintus Arrius.
He awaits your pleasure.
- Consul here?
- Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.
Thank him.
Bring him to me.
- I didn't know the consul had a son.
- He's a champion of the great circus.
Why is he here presenting me with gifts?
- Perhaps he'll race against you.
- Look.
It's magnificent.
And from a man I've never met.
You're wrong, Messala.
Judah.
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?
You were the magician, Messala.
You condemned me to the galleys.
When my ship was sunk, I saved the consul's life.
You know his seal?
Now I have come back as I swore I would.
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.
You suggest I use it on myself?
What has become of my mother and my sister?
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.
Find them, Messala.
Restore them to me, and I'll forget what I vowed with every stroke of that oar you chained me to.
I am not the governor of Judea.
I can do nothing without approval.
Then get it.
I will come back tomorrow.
Don't disappoint me, Messala.
What became of them?
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?
Go to the citadel, Drusus.
Find out.
- And if they're dead?
- They're dead!
"Miriam, wife.
Tirzah, daughter."
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?
East section lower level.
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.
Water.
Water.
Let me out!
Hear us!
Hear us!
- How long since you've seen them?
- Never.
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.
The food disappears.
Lepers.
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.
Then we'll burn out the cell.
Is someone there?
There is someone there.
Who are you?
Don't come any closer.
Who are you?
Esther.
It's Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam?
Stay where you are.
You have come home.
Stand back, Esther.
We are lepers.
Oh, Esther.
Tirzah.
Esther is Judah living?
Yes, he is alive.
He is here.
Where?
He is searching for you now.
I must find him and tell him.
No!
- Tell my father.
No.
Tell no one.
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.
We won't return.
But Judah has to be told.
No.
Please.
I couldn't see his face.
Is it changed?
No, he is not changed.
He...
He's not changed.
You love him, Esther.
Promise me on your love for him you will never tell him you've seen us.
Is he never to know?
Let him remember us as we were.
Promise me.
There's nothing else I can hope for.
Only this.
I promise you.
I am content.
Wait.
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.
I pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.
He'll free them.
He wants to survive.
He cannot free them, Judah.
What do you mean?
- I saw them.
- You saw them?
Where?
When did you see them?
They were dead.
When?
When?
When?
In the prison.
When I was waiting for news of my father.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't tell you.
Nor even you, Father.
I was afraid that if you saw Messala...
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.
It's over now.
Over?
- Judah.
- Over?
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.
Gentlemen.
Officers.
Defenders of great Rome's imperium may I enter?
Certainly, sheik.
You do us an unexpected honor.
The noble tribune is most gracious.
And now, the question you're all asking yourselves:
Why am I here?
As you know, I am a gambling man.
The games approach.
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.
But I will back my own poor horses.
No limits?
Mark me first!
- And me!
What odds?
- A moment, please my lords, protectors of the far flung marshes.
May I first, uh, sit down?
Sit down.
Lie down.
How much will you wager?
- Yes, let's call his game.
Give the Arab a seat.
A bench, quickly.
Thank you.
- Now.
- One thousand denarii.
- Two thousand!
- Mark me!
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient.
There is time and money enough for all.
First, gentlemen, the odds.
The tribune has won many times.
The odds should be in the same measure.
Now, what is your pleasure, gentlemen?
Two to one.
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth where is the courage that made Rome master of the world?
I can get better odds on any street market.
Three to one.
Let us not haggle.
Let us be fair.
In four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.
- In all truth...
- Just a moment.
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.
The Prince of Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur.
Prince of Hur?
- He was sent to the galleys years ago.
- He has returned.
Returned?
Impossible.
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.
Well?
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.
You, tribune will you give me four to one?
Four to one.
- Good.
- Bravo, Messala.
Four to one, sheik.
The difference between a Roman and a Jew.
Or an Arab.
Bravely spoken.
Now we will settle the amount of our wager.
I will venture...
A thousand talents?
- A thousand talents?
- Yes, a thousand talents.
Of course, if it is too much...
A thousand talents it will be.
Agreed.
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.
You're good fellows.
If only men were this good.
Hey!
Remember, Altair nine times around the circus, huh?
Aldebaran.
Hey, ha, ha.
Rigel, did you hear?
Nine lives to live.
My swift fellow.
You must not win the race the first time around.
You win the last time around.
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.
Steady Antares.
Like a rock.
You will be our anchor.
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.
They have taken me into their family.
Rest well, my stars.
Tomorrow we go up to the city.
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it the news will scorch the streets of the whole Roman world.
Pontius Pilate here?
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.
You will make him see what men are born in this land.
I only know that I race against Messala.
Look for the yoke.
Ease that strap.
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.
Into your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as you will.
The Star of David.
To shine out for your people and my people together and blind the eyes of Rome.
They are ready.
Ready, off!
Easy, girl, easy.
Number five.
Where is number five?
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.
Yes, this is the day.
Judah!
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.
Hail, Jupiter.
Give me victory.
Watch your line!
Keep your places!
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.
Citizens I welcome you to these games in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.
We dedicate them to his glory and to the glory of Rome of which you are all part.
Let us honor those who race for us today.
They come here from Alexandria Messina Carthage Cyprus Rome Corinth Athens Phrygia and Judea.
To the best of these, a crown of victory.
The race begins.
Hail, Caesar!
Hail, Caesar!
Oh, you dog!
Come, my children, come!
The Roman pig!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Steady!
Now, now!
Salute.
A great victory.
You are the people's one true god for the time being.
Permit us to worship.
I crown their god.
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.
A long life, young Arrius, and the good sense to live it.
We cannot wait, tribune.
He will come.
He will...
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.
He will come!
He will come.
I've sent for him, and he will come.
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.
Do you understand?
To hack the legs off me?
Not yet.
Not till I've seen him.
I don't receive him with half a body.
No.
No!
I told you, Drusus.
I told you.
Here he is.
Triumph c...
Triumph complete, Judah.
The race won.
The enemy destroyed.
I see no enemy.
What do you think you see?
The smashed body of a wretched animal?
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.
Let me help you.
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.
Dead.
And the race over.
It isn't over, Judah.
They're not dead.
Where are they?
Look for them in the Valley of the Lepers if you can recognize them.
It goes on.
It goes on, Judah.
The race...
The race is not over.
Is there a way down here?
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.
Man.
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.
There...
There are many women.
Of the family of Hur.
We have no names here.
For them?
- Why did you tell me they were dead?
- It was what they wanted.
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?
Not to see them?
They are coming.
Love them in the way they must need to be loved.
Not to look at them.
Let them be as if you had never come here.
Please!
Judah!
Is Judah well?
Is he happy?
Yes, he is well.
Your mind can be at rest for him.
He is well, Miriam.
God be with you.
They have gone.
We can go back.
Go back to what?
Judah, they have one blessing left.
To think you remember them as they were and live your own life.
Forget what is here.
Forget?
It's as though they were alive in a grave.
- But what can you do?
- Undo what you've done.
How could you have suffered them to come here?
I must see them.
No, Judah, please!
Judah!
Think, Judah, think.
It would tear them apart if they see you.
Judah!
Judah.
He is here.
I have found him.
The child has become a man.
And the man, I know it now, is the son of God.
The promise is true.
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.
Life has been answered.
God has answered it.
Come.
Come with me.
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys thirst had nearly killed me.
A man gave me water to drink.
I went on living.
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.
No.
I am thirsty still.
Come and listen.
I have business with Rome.
You insist on death.
Goodbye, Judah.
You sent for me?
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.
- I honor him.
- As you may honor yourself.
You have been made a citizen of Rome.
Do you say nothing to this?
I have just come from the Valley of Stone where my mother and sister live what's left of their lives.
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.
I have heard this.
There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.
Where there is greatness, great government or power even great feeling or compassion error also is great.
We progress and mature by fault.
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.
There are other voices.
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place not to crucify yourself on a shadow such as old resentment or impossible loyalties.
Perfect freedom has no existence.
A grown man knows the world he lives in.
And for the present, the world is Rome.
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.
I am Judah Ben-Hur.
I cross this floor in spoken friendship as I would speak to Arrius.
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar ready to crush all those who challenge his authority.
There are too many small men of envy and ambition who try to disrupt the government of Rome.
You have become the victor and hero to those people.
They look to you, their one true god, as I called you.
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.
I am already part of this tragedy.
Return this to Arrius.
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you from personal disaster if you stay here.
You are too great a danger.
Leave Judea.
You have my word.
Judah!
Oh, Judah!
I was afraid you would never come back afraid of what would happen to you.
But I see you again.
Your father's waiting for me.
Where is he?
What do you mean to do?
Oh, Judah.
Rest, sleep.
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.
Peace?
Love and peace.
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?
Where do you see them?
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.
Balthasar's word.
He is more than Balthasar's word.
His voice traveled with such a still purpose.
It was more than a voice.
A man more than a man.
He said, "Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God."
Children of God?
In that dead valley where we left them?
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean until we have scoured off our bodies the crust and filth of being at the mercy of tyranny.
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.
- In blood?
- Yes, in blood!
I know there is a law in life.
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.
Death generates death as the vulture breeds the vulture.
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:
"Love your enemy.
Do good to those who despitefully use you."
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.
As you make us do now.
Are we to bear nothing together?
Even love?
I can hardly draw breath without feeling you in my heart.
But I know that everything I do from this moment will be as great a pain to you as you have ever suffered.
It is better not to love me.
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy giving evil for evil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.
It's as though you had become Messala.
I've lost you, Judah.
No further.
What are you doing here?
I was here last evening waiting for you.
I have waited all night.
What has happened?
Where is Tirzah?
Leave the food.
I am coming closer.
Don't be afraid.
- What are you doing?
- Don't be afraid.
I've heard him again, the man from Nazareth.
If ever words were from God, they are in everything he says.
I cannot bear that you should have never known this hand of quiet reaching towards us.
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find him there.
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find him.
Tirzah is dying.
Leave the food and go.
It's Judah.
Why did you tell him?
Yes, Judah, yes.
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.
Mother.
Wait, Mother, wait.
Let me talk with you.
Please.
No, no further.
Please.
No, Judah.
Son, no.
Mother, let me see Tirzah.
Tirzah is dying.
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know that life is everlasting and death is nothing to fear if you have faith.
I will take them to him.
No!
God, no!
No, no, dear son.
Mother where is Tirzah?
Judah, no.
You must not go to her, dear son.
Please.
Dear son.
I am afraid.
No cause.
The world is more than we know.
Tirzah, it's Judah.
No.
No, Judah.
No, Judah.
No.
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Why are the streets deserted?
- They have gone to the trial.
- Alms for the blind?
- Trial?
Whose trial?
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.
- This cannot be true.
- Alms?
What has he done?
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.
Help for the blind.
Look, lepers!
Lepers!
Go away!
Get away!
Stay away!
Go away!
Lepers!
Lepers!
How can this be?
I know this man.
Will someone help him?
Take pity on him.
Have mercy.
Have mercy.
In his pain this look of peace.
Watch over them, Esther.
We must go back.
I brought you here to this when I hoped...
You haven't failed, Esther.
Hail King of the Jews!
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.
He gave me water and a heart to live.
What has he done to merit this?
He has taken the world of our sins onto himself.
To this end he said he was born in that stable where I first saw him.
For this cause, he came into the world.
For this death?
This beginning.
I have lived too long.
As though he were carrying in that cross the pain of the world.
So fearful, and yet why is it I'm not afraid anymore?
The shadow of a storm.
A strange darkness but still day.
His life is over.
What is it?
This tearing.
I am in pain.
I feel it too.
Miriam.
I thought I...
Miriam.
Do you see your hand?
Tirzah.
Miriam.
Tirzah.
Almost at the moment he died I heard him say, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do."
- Even then.
- Even then.
And I felt his voice take the sword out of my hand.
In the year of our Lord Judea, for nearly a century, had lain under the mastery of Rome.
In the seventh year of the reign of Augustus Caesar an imperial decree ordered every Judean each to return to his place of birth to be counted and taxed.
Converging ways of many of them led to their capital city, Jerusalem the troubled heart of their land.
The old city was dominated by the fortress of Antonia the seat of Roman power and by the great golden temple the outward sign of an inward and imperishable faith.
Even while they obeyed the will of Caesar the people clung proudly to their ancient heritage always remembering the promise of their prophets that one day there would be born among them a redeemer to bring them salvation and perfect freedom.
You'll be counted at Hebron.
- Name?
- Samuel.
- What city?
- Joppa.
- What family?
- Michael.
- Move on.
Move on.
- Yes.
- Name?
- Joseph.
- What city?
- Nazareth.
- What family?
- David of Bethlehem.
And the woman?
My wife.
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.
Come on, come on.
What village is this?
Nazareth.
We should arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow night.
You're not watching the soldiers, Joseph?
We've seen Romans before.
Yes and we will see them again.
My table is not finished.
Where is your son?
He's walking in the hills.
He neglects his work, Joseph.
No.
Once, I reproached him with forgetting his work.
He said to me:
"I must be about my father's business."
Then why isn't he here, working?
He's working.
Trumpeters of the legion!
Welcome, Messala.
The command is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for relieving me.
Drusus when I was a boy, I dreamed of commanding this garrison.
Now the wheel has turned.
I am in command.
Attention!
Aisle one, face right!
Forward!
I'd forgotten the heat.
If it were only the heat.
I lived here until I was 14.
Jerusalem was my home.
- My father was head of...
- Yes, I know.
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.
If there can be such a thing in this forsaken land.
If you want to rise, Sextus, do the difficult.
I asked to be sent here.
You'll find the people changed since you were a boy.
In what way?
Oh, won't pay their taxes, an irrational resentment of Rome...
There's nothing new in all that.
And then there's religion.
I tell you, they're drunk with religion.
They smash the statues of our gods, even those of the emperor.
Punish them.
We do.
When we can find them.
Find the leaders.
You don't know.
There's nothing you can put your finger on.
There are strange forces at work here.
This "messiah" business...
I know.
There was one predicted when I was a boy.
A king of the Jews, who will lead them into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.
Makes your head spin.
There's a wild man in the desert named John who drowns people in water.
And a carpenter's son who does magic tricks. "Miracles" they call them.
There's always a rabble-rouser stirring up trouble.
No, no, no.
This man is different.
He teaches that God is near, in every man.
It's actually quite profound, some of it.
You've been too long away from Rome.
Go back, Sextus.
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea and forget that God is in every man.
- There is divinity in only one man.
- Yes, I know.
The emperor is displeased.
He wishes Judea made into a more obedient and disciplined province.
He's ordered me to restore order.
I shall carry out his wishes.
How?
You can break a man's skull, arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.
But how do you control this?
How do you fight an idea?
Especially a new idea.
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.
I assume he has a name.
- He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
- Then treat him like one!
Tell him I will join him.
Yes, tribune.
Centurion!
This was his country before it was ours.
Don't forget that.
Yes, tribune.
Very wise.
This Ben-Hur is the richest man in Jerusalem.
And the head of one of the greatest families in Judea.
We were friends as boys.
We were like brothers.
Sextus you ask how to fight an idea.
Well, I'll tell you how.
With another idea.
I said I'd come back.
I never thought you would.
I'm so glad.
- Look at you.
- Look at you!
You've come back a tribune.
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.
We'll drink another now.
- Your sister and mother?
- They're fine.
They've talked of you ever since we knew you were coming.
- Is Tirzah married?
- No.
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.
She's been in love with you since she was 5.
I can't wait to see them.
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?
Or have you become too dignified?
- Down Eros, up Mars!
- Down Eros, up Mars!
Where the beams cross?
Good.
After all these years!
Still close.
In every way.
I hope so.
I know.
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew whose life you once saved.
The best thing I ever did.
Judah it will be very difficult to govern here.
I'm going to need help.
Your help.
Your advice.
- You want my advice?
- Yes, I do.
Withdraw your legions.
Give us our freedom.
Unfortunately, the emperor is devoted to his empire.
He's particularly fond of Judea.
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.
Is there anything so sad as unrequited love?
My quarters.
A bit grim.
Not grim.
Austere.
Virtuous.
Roman.
I'm going to be second-in-command to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.
He's coming in a few days with more legions.
Then the rumors are true.
The emperor does not approve of your countrymen.
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.
But you and your family need have no concern.
I'm next in authority to the governor, and you're my friend.
- I'm a Jew.
- Ah, you are like a Roman!
What have you in common with the troublemaking rabble?
- They're my people.
I'm one of them.
- Be wise, Judah.
It's a Roman world.
If you want to live in it, you must become part of it.
You've changed.
I've grown up.
I've seen the world since I left Jerusalem.
I've seen Rome.
It's no accident that one small village on the Tiber was chosen to rule the world.
Your legions.
It wasn't just our legions.
Other countries have armies, fine armies.
I know, I fought them.
Oh, no.
No, it was fate that chose us to civilize the world.
And we have.
Our roads and ships connect every corner of the earth.
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.
I believe in the future of my people.
Of course you do.
And you can help them.
How?
You're an aristocrat.
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince to your people.
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.
They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.
Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.
It is worse than stupid, futile!
For it can end in only one way, extinction for your people!
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.
Then we're agreed!
Now, when can I come to see your family?
- We had hoped tomorrow.
- Good.
And now for our toast.
It's dreadful wine, by the way.
It's especially fermented for the Roman army.
You're very cruel to your conquerors.
It's an insane world.
But in it there is one sanity:
The loyalty of old friends.
Judah, we must believe in one another.
Will you drink to that?
With all my heart.
Here it is, the place I've remembered.
The court where we played at changing the guard.
The roof where we'd throw pebbles at people in the street and then hide.
- We were rascals, weren't we?
- No, you were good boys.
I would have that time again.
And here it is.
Nothing has changed.
Except for the fountain.
- The old well would go dry, remember?
- Promptly, every summer.
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.
- He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
- No?
Of course he has.
He was a boy when he left us, now he's a man.
With great responsibilities.
Come.
The emperor builds and builds, turning brick to marble.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.
I've never seen anything like this before.
It's beautiful!
- Is it Roman?
- It's Libyan.
I was there last year.
A tremendous campaign.
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.
Or was, till we destroyed it.
Now it's nothing but ashes.
I'm boring you with soldier stories.
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.
Thank you for this.
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.
What do you think of it?
Magnificent.
It's Arabic.
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.
Let me try him sometime.
Whenever you like.
He's yours.
Do you mean you'll give me this?
Oh, Judah.
You are good.
It's going to be like old times, I know it.
Judah, tell me, did you think about what I said?
Yes.
Talked to a number of people already.
Spoken against violence, against incidents.
Most of the men agree with me.
Most?
Not all?
No, not all.
Who does not agree?
Well, the resentful, the impatient.
Who are they?
Yes, Judah.
Who are they?
Would I retain your friendship if I became an informer?
Telling the names of criminals is not informing.
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.
Patriots?
!
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.
This is my great opportunity, and yours too.
If I bring order here, I can have any post I want.
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?
Rome!
Yes, perhaps at the side of Caesar himself.
I mean it.
It can happen and this is the moment.
I swear, this is the time.
The emperor is watching us, judging us.
All I need do is serve him.
And all you need do is help me serve him.
- You speak as if he were God.
- He is God.
The only God.
He is power, real power on earth, not...
Not that.
Help me, Judah.
I would do anything for you, Messala except betray my own people.
In the name of all the gods, what do the lives of a few Jews mean to you?
If I cannot persuade them, that does not mean I would help you murder them.
Besides, you must understand this, Messala.
I believe in the past and future of my people.
Future?
You are a conquered people.
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?
Joshua will not rise again to save you nor David.
There is only one reality in the world today.
Look to the West.
Don't be a fool!
Look to Rome!
Better a fool than a traitor or a killer.
- I am a soldier.
- Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.
- I warn you...
- No!
I warn you.
Rome is an affront to God.
Rome is strangling my people and my country, the whole earth!
But not forever.
And I tell you, the day Rome falls there will be a shout of freedom such as the world has never heard before.
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.
You're either for me or against me.
If that is the choice then I am against you.
There they are.
Where's Messala?
- Where's...?
- He's gone.
Gone?
- But why?
- He couldn't stay.
- What happened?
- A new tribune must have many duties.
Come.
Let us have dinner.
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the world who bringeth to us bread from the earth.
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.
He wanted to use me to betray our people.
- Master, the caravan from Antioch.
- Yes, Amrah, I saw.
Simonides.
- Oh, welcome homecoming.
- Master.
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.
And for the master, Iberian wine.
Not to mention the best gift of all, your presence.
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.
- Caravans from Petra.
- Have all arrived.
- Good.
- Here is the accounting.
And what of Numidia?
The trade route is ours, guaranteed by treaty with the king.
Once a year, you bring your accounting.
And once a year, I find myself wealthier.
Yeah, but my greatest treasure is my steward.
My life belongs to the House of Hur.
Nothing else exists for me, except my daughter.
- She must be a young woman by now.
- Yes, and your property.
She was born the daughter of your slave.
When I inherited you, I inherited a friend, not a slave.
Still, Esther has come with me from Antioch for your permission to marry.
It's granted.
I wish you the joy of many grandchildren.
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.
With your permission, Esther wishes to speak to her master.
You're eager to marry, Esther?
It is my father's wish.
Your husband will be fortunate.
What is his name?
David, son of Mathias.
Of what house?
- His own, master.
- He is a freeman.
Tell me more about him.
I have seen him only once.
He is a merchant, well-thought-of in Antioch.
He will pay for Esther's freedom.
Her freedom will be my wedding gift to Esther.
You are generous, master.
Do you love this man?
I will learn to love him.
You have my permission to marry.
We'll drink to your happiness.
And a safe return to Antioch.
I disturbed you.
No.
What were you thinking?
I was saying goodbye to this city and this house.
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?
My father sometimes brought me here when I was little.
It was a house where I was always happy.
Except once.
When you and your friend, the Roman boy...
- Messala.
- Yes.
You had been out hunting and they brought you home injured.
I touched your face as you lay there and prayed to God, "Don't let this boy die."
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.
Yes, master.
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.
It's strange.
I hardly felt a slave.
And now I hardly feel free.
You know, in the old, wise days of Solomon if there was among his slaves some girl who filled his eyes he could choose her out from the rest and take her to him.
Wise days of Solomon.
Different days.
And long ago.
If you were not a bride I should kiss you goodbye.
If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said.
Your slave ring.
Fair exchange.
Freedom to you.
The ring to me.
You will wear it?
Until you meet the woman you will marry?
Until then.
The gods favor my lord Gratus.
If it is the governor's pleasure, the wreath of office.
Thank you, tribune.
I see no delegation from the city.
- There will not be one, sir.
- No?
Jerusalem's welcome will not be a warm one.
But I pledge, my lord, it will be a quiet one.
Let us proceed.
There's Messala.
He saw you, Judah.
The new governor.
Stand back!
- Stand back.
- You, come!
Had to be the Jews!
Open up in the name of the divine emperor!
Judah!
Tirzah!
What is it?
What's happened?
Open up in the name of the law!
- I was watching the...
- A tile fell and struck the governor.
- It wasn't my fault.
- They won't believe her.
She won't have to say anything.
You hear?
Tirzah, say nothing.
Open the gates!
I'll speak to them.
- Arrest him!
- Let me tell you what happened.
- Hold those women.
- Stop them!
It was an accident.
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.
- This is the man, sir.
We saw him.
- It was an accident.
- Accident?
- I swear it.
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose.
It gave way.
Take him.
Take all of them.
- He's telling the truth!
- It was me!
Let them go!
Attention!
Messala.
In the name of God, tell them it's a mistake.
I leaned on the tile, and it broke loose.
It was an accident.
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!
Let the servants go.
Let them go.
Return to your ranks.
Come.
Where?
Tirus.
Tirus?
I've had no trial.
I'm to die in the galleys without even a trial?
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!
Wait.
My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?
Tie his hands.
- At least tell me if they're safe.
- I can tell you nothing.
Get along.
Keep moving.
Jailer!
Guard, in there!
Up the stairs!
Jailer!
Jailer!
To the right.
- Wait!
- Send them out.
Go!
The door.
Where are my mother and sister?
Where are they?
Here, within these walls.
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.
Of course, they will be sentenced.
Is it possible?
Is it possible you could do this to us?
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?
You will let them go.
You will gladly let them go!
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not a murderer!
I know you're not.
You know?
You are evil.
No, Judah, I am not evil.
I wanted your help.
Now you've given it to me.
By making this example of you, I discourage treason.
By condemning without hesitation an old friend, I shall be feared.
But not my family.
Let them go.
Please.
- Messala, I beg you.
- Beg?
!
Didn't I beg you?
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.
Kill me, and your mother and sister will die nailed to crosses in front of you!
Go on, Judah.
Kill me!
May God grant me vengeance.
I will pray that you live till I return.
Return?
Take him.
Sentries, salute.
The tribune will see you now.
Tribune, I'm steward of the House of Hur.
I remember you.
We were on our way to Antioch when we heard what had happened.
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done this thing.
You knew him, tribune.
Better than you.
Then there must be no doubt in your mind, the charge is groundless.
The prisoners have been sentenced.
- Sentenced?
- But there's no truth in it.
There was never a threat against the governor in Judah's mind.
Surely you must know he would never have done this.
In your heart, you must know it.
Drusus.
This man had better be kept here until we can question him.
Hold!
Water for the soldiers.
Soldiers first!
Get away from that well.
No water for them!
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!
Come on, you!
Water for the horses!
- Water.
Water.
- Soldiers first!
Here.
Wait.
No water for him.
God help me.
You!
I said no water for him!
All right, on your feet, all of you!
Get them on their feet!
Back in line, you dog!
On your feet!
Get them going!
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!
Forward, you dogs!
Soon, the counselor's barge will be coming alongside.
Be ready to raise oars.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.
- How many rowers?
- Two hundred, consul.
- And reliefs?
- Of 30, every hour.
This man is ill.
Replace him.
- Change him.
- Right, sir.
- This man's been giving you trouble?
- He's insubordinate, consul.
That will stop.
What service have you seen?
Forty-one.
A month's less a day in this ship.
You keep an exact account.
And before?
Three years in other ships.
Three years.
You have the spirit to fight back but the good sense to control it.
Your eyes are full of hate, 41.
That's good.
Hate keeps a man alive.
It gives him strength.
Now, listen to me, all of you.
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
So row well and live.
- Ship ready, consul.
- Strike oars.
Strike oars!
You know a fleet of Macedonian galleys has been raiding Roman commerce.
The emperor has honored us with the task of seeking out and destroying them.
Battle speed, hortator.
Battle speed!
Attack speed.
Attack speed!
Ramming speed.
Ramming speed!
Rest.
Halt!
Rest!
Why are you here?
I was ordered to report to you during my relief.
Oh, yes.
I'd forgotten.
You could have killed me as I lay there.
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?
I'm not ready to die.
What do you think will save you?
The God of my fathers.
Your God has forsaken you.
He has no more power than the images I pray to.
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.
I might.
Does that interest you, 41?
I can see that it does.
I'm a fighting man by profession, and in my leisure moments it amuses me to train fighting men.
I own some of the best gladiators and charioteers in Rome.
Would you like to become one of them?
To die as your slave?
Better than to live in chains below these decks.
I will not be here forever.
No?
What would you do if you escaped?
Two people were condemned with me, my mother and sister though they were innocent.
I won't rest...
Do not say that you were innocent.
- Would it do any good to say it again?
- No.
Consider my offer carefully.
You will never escape while we are victorious.
If we are not, you will sink with this ship, chained to your oar.
I cannot believe that God has let me live these years to die chained to an oar.
It's a strange, stubborn faith you keep to believe that existence has a purpose.
A sane man would have learned to lose it long before this.
As you have.
What drove it out of you?
Go back to your oar, 41.
Consul, enemy sighted.
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.
All the watch to battle posts.
- Stand by to load.
- Make ready to fire.
Hurry, quick!
Hurry up with that resin.
Get some more ammunition.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
Chain rowers!
Guard.
Unlock 41.
No!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
41, why did he do that?
I don't know.
Once before, a man helped me.
I didn't know why then.
Normal speed!
Number 1, flame.
Fire.
Fire!
Fire!
Hold withdrawal on command.
Lift oars!
Raise!
Withdraw!
Steersman, right.
Extend oars!
Fire!
- Watch out!
- Fire!
Steersman, ram course!
Order below!
- Ramming speed!
- Ramming speed!
Consul, barge on ramming course.
We're going to be rammed!
We're going to be rammed!
Why did you save me?
Why did you have me unchained?
What is your name, 41?
Judah Ben-Hur. ...let me die.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
Row well and live.
Is the sail square?
I can't tell.
Better for us both if it's the enemy.
My death.
Your freedom.
It's a Roman sail.
Face rear!
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.
Water.
The fleet, all lost?
Five galleys.
- And the battle?
- The battle was won.
You have a victory.
- It was a victory?
- Complete.
In His eagerness to save you your God has also saved the Roman fleet.
Hail Arrius!
Right oars!
You have cleared the seaways of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.
This baton of victory has been nobly won.
This man riding beside you, who is he?
The man who saved me, divine emperor, to return and serve you.
Is that all you know about him?
No.
He was accused of an attack on the governor of Judea.
But he was innocent.
If not, there's a strange inconsistency in this man who tries to kill my governor, yet saves the life of my consul.
Come tomorrow.
We'll talk of it.
We have all the information on this man a man of some influence in his own country.
His attack upon our governor is one upon the senate and the people of Rome.
I am convinced that no such attack was intended.
Consul, allow us to continue.
Allow us to be generous.
As a reward to you for your great victory we shall not send him back to the galleys.
Take him as your slave.
Such is the will of the senate and the people of Rome.
Not long ago, I returned to Rome with a young man who had saved my life.
You all know him as the finest charioteer in Rome.
Five times, he's driven my horses to victory.
I know him as one who stands in the place of the son I lost.
I have the love and pride in a son's achievements which I thought I should never have again.
Nothing could make stronger our bond but tonight I wish to share it with you all.
The formalities of adoption have been completed.
Young Arrius is now the legal bearer of my name and the heir to my property.
This ring of my ancestors would have gone to my son.
So now it is yours.
It's a strange destiny that brought me to a new life a new home a new father.
It brought me here.
It may take me away.
But wherever I may be I shall always try to wear this ring as a son of Arrius should.
With gratitude and affection and with honor.
My old friend Pontius Pilate, young Arrius.
Before you came to this city, my horses always won.
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.
Yes, but not swift enough to defeat you.
- Tell me, you come from Judea?
- Yes, sir.
I hear that the climate is difficult to live in.
Not for Judeans.
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.
- Of Judea?
- Yes.
I asked for Alexandria.
But it seems the wilderness needs my particular talents.
The scorpions and holy prophets can't get on without me.
Lay the dust of Judea, at least for this evening.
Goats and Jehovah.
You're leaving.
I must.
It's a journey I can't keep you from.
Your eyes have never left it all these months.
I can recognize pain.
But still, my counsel is to wait.
Gratus is to be replaced.
The governorship goes to Pontius Pilate.
When?
Very soon.
It's very much to our purpose.
Nothing is to the purpose if, when I come back to Judea, I come too late.
That is the thought which has punished me every moment I've spent here.
Will Rome see you again?
Here is a part of my life which you have made for me.
I shall remember it.
Whoever the gods are, they take small interest in an old man's hopes.
They have their way.
Forgive me.
You're a stranger here.
Would you be from Nazareth?
Why do you ask?
I thought you might be the one...
The one that I have come back from my country to find.
He would be about your age.
Who?
When I find Him I shall know Him.
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.
Sack of flesh without brains!
No!
No!
Not the whip!
That is my host.
Gently!
Gently!
Fool!
Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood.
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run!
Go on!
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!
Beautiful horses.
Now!
Now!
They are ready!
Let them go!
Watch.
They'll never hold the turn.
No!
No!
Abadon, stop him!
Stop that whip!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill...!
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!
You think you can treat my horses like animals?
!
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!
Get off, idiot!
Drive goats, not horses!
I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.
Not a team?
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.
- Antares.
- The slow one?
He should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?
In the circus in Rome.
You have driven in the great circus?
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.
No other animal has descended so in scale from the first innocent falling of the world.
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.
Yes.
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.
Your coming here was so fit, so right.
We might have achieved wonders!
You have to go.
I make a journey which will not wait.
Ah, well, then perhaps you will come back.
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.
I have no wives.
No wives at all?
I have six, no, seven.
I've counted eight.
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.
- Someday, I hope to have one.
- One wife!
One God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.
It is not generous.
- Was the food not to your liking?
- Indeed.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.
And now I must say good night to my beauties.
When ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.
- I'll make my farewells then.
- No, no, no, stay.
Stay and see them.
Come, my children.
Come.
Strangers make them shy.
Come.
Come, do not be afraid.
Come.
There, my children.
They are descended from the Arabians of the Pharaohs and I have named them for the stars.
Come, Antares.
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.
What?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.
Come, Rigel.
We've both supped well, and the world is good.
There's my good Rigel.
Yes, you are ready for sleep.
The day's work done for you, eh?
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.
Good night.
Good night, my treasure.
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.
No.
You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.
You should see their mother, Mira.
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.
All right, all right.
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.
You must be strong and swift.
Go, my children.
Go.
At Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams and the champion of the East, Messala, with his black devils.
He stops at nothing to win.
- Messala?
In the circus?
- Yes.
You knew him?
I know him.
Perhaps without much liking.
My people are praying for a man to drive their team to victory over Messala.
You could be that man, the one to stamp his arrogance into the sand.
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.
It's not possible.
That is a pity.
Think of it.
To break his pride to humble this tribune before the very people he has degraded.
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!
I know it is not possible.
Does it not delight your imagination?
Does it not answer your purpose?
I must deal with Messala in my own way.
And your way is to kill him.
I see this terrible thing in your eyes.
But no matter what this man has done, you have no right to kill him.
He will be punished inevitably.
I don't believe in miracles.
But all life is a miracle.
Why will you not accept God's judgment?
You do not believe in miracles.
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness and a star led me to a village called Bethlehem where I found a newborn child in a manger.
And God lived in this child.
By now, He is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.
That is why I have returned here so that I may be at hand when He comes among us.
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.
Perhaps He's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.
Perhaps He is a shepherd a merchant, a fisherman.
But He lives and all our lives from now on will carry His mark.
There are many paths to God, my son.
I hope yours will not be too difficult.
I'm ready for sleep.
Balthasar is a good man but until all men are like him, we must keep our swords bright.
And our intention true.
So I must leave you.
One last thought.
There is no law in the arena.
Many are killed.
I hope to see you again.
Fine Damascus silk.
Fine Damascus silk.
Esther?
It's Judah.
You are alive.
You are alive.
What are you doing here?
What has happened?
I'm here.
I'm with you.
Where's your father?
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.
They tortured him.
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.
You never went back to Antioch?
No.
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.
Where are my mother and sister?
Let me tell him first.
Father.
Father, something wonderful has happened.
Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
He has come home.
He is here.
Judah.
Judah Ben-Hur.
My dear old friend.
Let me look at you.
Let me see you.
Yes, yes.
It is true.
Praise God for His mercy.
Where are they?
Since that terrible day there has been no word of them.
You should have been less loyal.
Do not pity me, Master Judah.
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.
We were released on the same day.
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.
Since then, I have been his tongue and he has been my legs.
Together, we make a considerable man.
Old friend.
She always said you would return.
She never gave up hope.
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.
I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.
But suppose that isn't possible.
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.
They could not make me tell them where it is.
It is there still to put power into our hands and buy death for the Romans.
That's not why I came back.
Judah, they are dead.
Four years.
No one could live so long in the dungeons.
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?
Yes, it is true.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You have come back to us like a returning faith.
Judah, I should like to laugh again.
- Let us laugh.
- We will.
There will be joy again in this house.
We will celebrate among the dust.
I will take him.
We stood here before.
A long while ago.
Four years.
But now it seems as if only yesterday...
I was saying:
"If you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye."
"If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said."
I am not a bride.
Why did you never marry?
My father needed me.
And also...
It's still on my finger.
I said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.
It's become a part of my hand.
If Messala once knew you were here...
As he must.
He will know where they are.
And if you should find...?
- If he says they're dead...
- Messala will wish they were living.
I've seen too much of what hate can do.
My father is burned up with it.
But I've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater and love more powerful than hatred.
I believe it.
- Esther.
- Judah.
Stay alive.
Keep away from Messala.
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.
That time isn't yet come.
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.
This time you will be destroyed.
You'll die.
Tribune, compliments of Quintus Arrius.
He awaits your pleasure.
- Consul here?
- Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.
Thank him.
Bring him to me.
- I didn't know the consul had a son.
- He's a champion of the great circus.
Why is he presenting me with gifts?
- Perhaps he'll race against you.
- Look.
It's magnificent.
And from a man I've never met.
You're wrong, Messala.
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?
You were the magician, Messala.
You condemned me to the galleys.
When my ship was sunk, I saved the consul's life.
You know his seal?
Now I have come back as I swore I would.
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.
You suggest I use it on myself?
What has become of my mother and my sister?
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.
Find them, Messala.
Restore them to me, and I'll forget what I vowed with every stroke of that oar you chained me to.
I am not the governor.
I can do nothing without approval.
Then get it.
I will come back tomorrow.
Don't disappoint me, Messala.
What became of them?
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?
Go to the citadel, Drusus.
Find out.
- And if they're dead?
- They're dead!
"Miriam, wife.
Tirzah, daughter."
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?
E section lower level.
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.
Water.
Water.
Let me out!
- How long since you've seen them?
- Never.
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.
The food disappears.
Lepers.
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.
Then we'll burn out the cell.
Is someone there?
There is someone there.
Who are you?
Don't come any closer.
Who are you?
Esther.
It's Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam?
Stay where you are.
You have come home.
Stand back, Esther.
We are lepers.
Oh, Esther.
Tirzah.
Esther is Judah living?
Yes, he is alive.
He is here.
Where?
He is searching for you now.
I must find him and tell him.
- No!
- Tell my father.
No.
Tell no one.
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.
We won't return.
Judah has to be told.
No.
Please.
I couldn't see his face.
Is it changed?
No, he is not changed.
He's not changed.
You love him, Esther.
Promise me on your love for him you will never tell him you've seen us.
Is he never to know?
Let him remember us as we were.
Promise me.
There's nothing else I can hope for.
Only this.
I promise.
I am content.
Wait.
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.
I pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.
He'll free them.
He wants to survive.
He cannot free them, Judah.
What do you mean?
I saw them.
You saw them?
Where?
When did you see them?
They were dead.
They were dead.
When?
When?
When?
!
In the prison.
When I was waiting for news of my father.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't tell you.
Nor even you, Father.
I was afraid that if you saw Messala...
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.
It's over now.
Over?
- Judah.
- Over?
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.
Gentlemen.
Officers.
Defenders of great Rome's Imperium may I enter?
Certainly, sheik.
You do us an unexpected honor.
The noble tribune is most gracious.
And now the question you're asking:
Why am I here?
As you know, I am a gambling man.
The games approach.
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.
I will back my own poor horses.
No limits?
- Mark me first!
- And me!
- What odds?
- A moment, please my lords, protectors of the far flung marshes.
May I first sit down?
Sit.
How much will you wager?
- Yes, let's call his game.
- Give the Arab a seat.
A bench, quickly.
Thank you.
- Now.
- 1000 denarii.
- 2000!
- Mark me!
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient.
There is time.
First gentlemen, the odds.
The tribune has won many times.
The odds should be in the same measure.
What is your pleasure, gentlemen?
Two to one.
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth where is the courage that made Rome master of the world?
I can get better odds on any street market.
Three to one.
Let us not haggle.
Let us be fair.
In four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.
- In all truth...
- Just a moment.
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.
The Prince of Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur.
Prince of Hur?
- He was sent to the galleys years ago.
- He has returned.
Returned?
Impossible.
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.
Well?
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.
You, tribune will you give me four to one?
Four to one.
Good.
Four to one, sheik.
The difference between a Roman and a Jew.
Or an Arab.
Bravely spoken.
Now we will settle the amount of our wager.
I will venture...
A thousand talents?
- A thousand talents?
- Yes, a thousand talents.
Of course, if it is too much...
A thousand talents it will be.
Agreed.
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.
You're good fellows.
If only men were this good.
Remember, Altair nine times around the circus.
Aldebaran.
Rigel, did you hear?
Nine lives to live.
My swift fellow.
You must not win the race the first time around.
You win the last time around.
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.
Steady Antares.
Like a rock.
You will be our anchor.
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.
They have taken me into their family.
Rest well, my stars.
Tomorrow we go up to the city.
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it the news will scorch the streets of the Roman world.
Pontius Pilate here?
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.
You will make him see what men are born in this land.
I only know that I race against Messala.
Look for the yoke.
Ease that strap.
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.
Into Your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as You will.
The Star of David.
To shine out for your people and my people together and blind the eyes of Rome.
They are ready.
Easy, girl, easy.
Number five.
Where is number five?
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.
Yes, this is the day.
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.
Hail, Jupiter.
Give me victory.
Watch your line!
Keep your places!
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.
Citizens I welcome you to these games in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.
We dedicate them to his glory and to the glory of Rome of which you are all part.
Let us honor those who race for us today.
They come here from Alexandria Messina Carthage Cyprus Rome Corinth Athens Phrygia and Judea.
To the best of these, a crown of victory.
The race begins.
Hail, Caesar!
Come, my children, come!
The Roman pig!
Salute.
A great victory.
You are the people's one true god for the time being.
Permit us to worship.
I crown their god.
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.
A long life, young Arrius and the good sense to live it.
We cannot wait, tribune.
He will come.
He will...
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.
He will come!
He will come.
I've sent for him, and he will come.
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.
Do you understand?
To hack the legs off me?
Not yet.
Not till I've seen him.
I don't receive him with half a body.
No!
I told you, Drusus.
I told you.
Here he is.
Triumph complete, Judah.
The race won.
The enemy destroyed.
I see no enemy.
What do you think you see?
The smashed body of a wretched animal?
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.
Let me help you.
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.
Dead.
And the race over.
It isn't over, Judah.
They're not dead.
Where are they?
Where are they?
Look for them in the Valley of the Lepers if you can recognize them.
It goes on.
It goes on, Judah.
The race...
The race is not over.
Is there a way down here?
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.
Man.
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.
There are many women.
Of the family of Hur.
We have no names here.
For them?
- Why did you say they were dead?
- It was what they wanted.
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?
Not to see them?
They are coming.
Love them in the way they must need to be loved.
Not to look at them.
Let them be as if you had never come here.
Please!
Is Judah well?
Is he happy?
Yes, he is well.
Your mind can be at rest for him.
He is well, Miriam.
God be with you.
They have gone.
We can go back.
Go back to what?
Judah, they have one blessing left.
To think you remember them as they were and live your own life.
Forget what is here.
Forget?
It's as though they're alive in a grave.
- But what can you do?
- Undo what you've done.
How could you have suffered them to come here?
I must see them.
No, Judah, please!
Judah!
Think, Judah, think.
It would tear them apart if they see you.
He is here.
I have found Him.
The child has become a man.
And the man, I know it now, is the Son of God.
The promise is true.
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.
Life has been answered.
God has answered it.
Come.
Come with me.
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys thirst had nearly killed me.
A man gave me water to drink.
I went on living.
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.
No.
I am thirsty still.
Come and listen.
I have business with Rome.
You insist on death.
Goodbye, Judah.
You sent for me?
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.
- I honor him.
- As you may honor yourself.
You have been made a citizen of Rome.
Do you say nothing to this?
I have just come from the Valley of Stone where my mother and sister live what's left of their lives.
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.
I have heard this.
There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.
Where there is greatness, great government or power even great feeling or compassion error also is great.
We progress and mature by fault.
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.
There are other voices.
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place not to crucify yourself on a shadow such as old resentment or impossible loyalties.
Perfect freedom has no existence.
A grown man knows the world he lives in.
And for the present, the world is Rome.
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.
I am Judah Ben-Hur.
I cross this floor in spoken friendship as I would speak to Arrius.
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar ready to crush those who challenge his authority.
There are too many men of envy and ambition who try to disrupt the government of Rome.
You have become the victor and hero to those people.
They look to you, their one true god, as I call you.
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.
I am already part of this tragedy.
Return this to Arrius.
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you from personal disaster if you stay here.
You are too great a danger.
Leave Judea.
You have my word.
I was afraid you would never come back afraid of what would happen to you.
But I see you again.
Your father's waiting for me.
Where is he?
What do you mean to do?
Rest, sleep.
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.
Peace?
Love and peace.
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?
Where do you see them?
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.
Balthasar's word.
He is more than Balthasar's word.
His voiced traveled with such a still purpose.
It was more than a voice.
A man more than a man.
He said, " Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God."
Children of God?
In that dead valley where we left them?
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean until we have scoured off our bodies the crust and filth of being at the mercy of tyranny.
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.
- In blood?
- Yes, in blood!
I know there is a law in life.
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.
Death generates death as the vulture breeds the vulture.
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:
"Love your enemy.
Do good to those who despitefully use you."
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.
As you make us do now.
Are we to bear nothing together?
Even love?
I can hardly draw breath without feeling you in my heart.
But I know that everything I do from this moment bears greater pain than you have ever suffered.
It is better not to love me.
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy giving evil for evil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.
It's as though you had become Messala.
I've lost you, Judah.
No further.
What are you doing here?
I was here last evening waiting for you.
I have waited all night.
What has happened?
Where is Tirzah?
Leave the food.
I am coming closer.
Don't be afraid.
- What are you doing?
- Don't be afraid.
I've heard Him again, the man from Nazareth.
If ever words were from God, they are in everything He says.
I cannot bear that you should have never known this hand of quiet reaching towards us.
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find Him there.
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find Him.
Tirzah is dying.
Leave the food and go.
It's Judah.
Why did you tell him?
Yes, Judah, yes.
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.
Mother.
Wait, Mother, wait.
Let me talk with you.
Please.
No, no further.
Please.
No, Judah.
Son, no.
Mother, let me see Tirzah.
Tirzah is dying.
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know that life is everlasting and death is nothing to fear if you have faith.
I will take them to Him.
No!
God, no!
No, no, dear son.
Mother where is Tirzah?
Judah, no.
Judah, no.
You must not go to her, dear son.
Please.
Dear son.
I am afraid.
No cause.
The world is more than we know.
Tirzah, it's Judah.
No, Judah.
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
- Why are the streets deserted?
- They have gone to the trial.
Trial?
Whose trial?
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.
- This cannot be true.
- Alms?
What has he done?
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.
Help for the blind.
- Look, lepers!
- Lepers!
Get away!
Stay away!
Go away!
Lepers!
Lepers!
How can this be?
I know this man.
Will someone help Him?
Take pity on Him.
Have mercy.
In His pain this look of peace.
Watch over them, Esther.
We must go back.
I brought you here to this when I hoped...
You haven't failed, Esther.
Hail King of the Jews!
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.
He gave me water and a heart to live.
What has He done to merit this?
He has taken the world of our sins onto Himself.
To this end He said He was born in that stable where I first saw Him.
For this cause, He came into the world.
For this death?
This beginning.
I have lived too long.
As though He were carrying in that cross the pain of the world.
So fearful, and yet why is it I'm not afraid anymore?
The shadow of a storm.
A strange darkness but still day.
His life is over.
What is it?
This tearing.
I am in pain.
I feel it too.
Do you see your hand?
Almost at the moment He died I heard Him say, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do."
Even then.
Even then.
And I felt His voice take the sword out of my hand.

BALTHASAR:
In the year of our Lord Judea, for nearly a century, had lain under the mastery of Rome.
In the seventh year of the reign of Augustus Caesar an imperial decree ordered every Judean each to return to his place of birth to be counted and taxed.
The converging ways of many of them led to their capital city, Jerusalem the troubled heart of their land.
The old city was dominated by the fortress of Anton ia the seat of Roman power and by the great golden temple the outward sign of an inward and imperishable faith.
Even while they obeyed the will of Caesar the people clung proudly to their ancient heritage always remembering the promise of their prophets that one day there would be born among them a redeemer to bring them salvation and perfect freedom.
[MURMURING]
You'll be counted at Hebron.
-Name?
-Samuel.
-What city?
-Joppa.
-What family?
-Michael.
-Move on.
Move on.
-Yes.
-Name?
-Joseph.
-What city?
-Nazareth.
-What family?
-David of Bethlehem.
-And the woman?
-My wife.
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.
Come on, come on.
[OXEN BELLOWING]
[BABY CRYING]
[SHEEP BAAING]
[TRUMPETS]
What village is this?
Nazareth.
We should arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow night.
You're not watching the soldiers, Joseph?
We've seen Romans before.
Yes and we will see them again.
My table is not finished.
Where is your son?
-He's walking in the hills.
-Mm-hm.
He neglects his work, Joseph.
No.
Once, I reproached him with forgetting his work.
He said to me:
"I must be about my father's business."
Then why isn't he here, working?
He's working.
SEXTUS:
Trumpeters of the legion!
[TRUMPETING]
Welcome, Messala.
The command is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for relieving me.
Drusus when I was a boy, I dreamed of commanding this garrison.
Now the wheel has turned.
I am in command.
OFFICER:
Attention!
Aisle one, face right!
Forward!
I'd forgotten the heat.
If it were only the heat.
I lived here until I was 14.
Jerusalem was my home.
-My father was head of~
-Yes, I know.
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.
If there can be such a thing in this forsaken land.
If you want to rise, Sextus, do the difficult.
I asked to be sent here.
I think you'll find the people changed since you were a boy.
In what way?
Oh, won't pay their taxes, an irrational resentment of Rome....
There's nothing new in all that.
And then there's religion.
I tell you, they're drunk with religion.
They smash the statues of our gods, even those of the emperor.
Punish them.
We do.
When we can find them.
Find the leaders.
Oh, you don't know.
There's nothing you can put your finger on.
I tell you, there are strange forces at work here.
For instance, this "messiah" business-
I know.
There was one predicted when I was a boy.
A king of the Jews, who will lead them into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.
Makes your head spin.
There's a wild man in the desert named John who drowns people in water.
And a carpenter's son who does magic tricks. "Miracles" they call them.
There's always a rabble-rouser stirring up trouble.
No, no, no.
This man is different.
He teaches that God is near, in every man.
[MESSALA SCOFFS]
It's actually quite profound, some of it.
You've been too long away from Rome.
Go back, Sextus.
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea and forget that God is in every man.
-There is divinity in only one man.
-Yes, I know.
The emperor is displeased.
He wishes Judea made into a more obedient and disciplined province.
He has ordered me to restore order.
I intend to carry out his wishes.
But how?
You can break a man's skull, arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.
But how do you control what's up here?
How do you fight an idea?
Especially a new idea.
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.
I assume he has a name.
-He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
-Then treat him like one!
Tell him I will join him.
Yes, tribune.
Centurion!
This was his country before it was ours.
Don't forget that.
Yes, tribune.
Very wise.
This Ben-Hur is the richest man in Jerusalem.
And the head of one of the greatest families in Judea.
We were friends as boys.
We were like brothers.
Sextus you ask how to fight an idea.
Well, I'll tell you how.
With another idea.
I said I'd come back.
I never thought you would.
I'm so glad.
[BOTH LAUGH]
-Look at you.
-Look at you!
You've come back a tribune.
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.
We'll drink another now.
-Your sister and mother?
-They're fine.
They've talked of you ever since we knew you were coming.
-Is Tirzah married?
-No.
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.
She's been in love with you since she was 5.
I can't wait to see them.
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?
Or have you become too dignified?
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
-Down Eros, up Mars!
-Down Eros, up Mars!
MESSALA:
Where the beams cross?
BEN-HUR:
Good.
[BOTH LAUGH]
After all these years!
Still close.
In every way.
I hope so.
I know.
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew whose life you once saved.
The best thing I ever did.
Judah it will be very difficult to govern here.
I'm going to need help.
Your help.
Your advice.
-You want my advice?
-Yes, I do.
Withdraw your legions.
Give us our freedom.
Unfortunately, the emperor is devoted to his empire.
He's particularly fond of Judea.
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.
Is there anything so sad as unrequited love?
[MESSALA CHUCKLES]
My quarters.
Hmm.
A bit grim.
Not grim.
Austere.
Virtuous.
Roman.
I'm going to be second-in-command to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.
He's arriving in a few days with two more legions.
Then the rumors are true.
The emperor does not approve of your countrymen.
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.
But you and your family need have no concern.
I'm next in authority to the governor, and you're my friend.
-I'm a Jew.
-Ah, you are like a Roman!
What have you in common with the troublemaking rabble?
Rabble?
They're my people.
I'm one of them.
Be wise, Judah.
It's a Roman world.
If you want to live in it, you must become part of it.
You've changed.
I've grown up.
I've seen the world since I left Jerusalem.
I've seen Rome.
It's no accident that one small village on the Tiber was chosen to rule the world.
Your legions.
It wasn't just our legions.
Other countries have armies, fine armies.
I know, I fought them.
Oh, no.
No, it was fate that chose us to civilize the world.
And we have.
Our roads and ships connect every corner of the earth.
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.
I believe in the future of my people.
Of course you do.
And you can help them.
How?
You're an aristocrat.
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince among your people.
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.
They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.
Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.
It is worse than stupid, futile!
For it can end in only one way, extinction for your people!
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.
Then we're agreed!
Now, when can I come to see your family?
-We had hoped tomorrow.
-Good.
And now for our toast.
It's dreadful wine, by the way.
It's especially fermented for the Roman army.
[MESSALA CHUCKLES]
You're very cruel to your conquerors.
It's an insane world.
But in it there is one sanity:
The loyalty of old friends.
Judah, we must believe in one another.
Will you drink to that?
With all my heart.
Here it is, the place I've remembered.
The court where we played at changing the guard.
The roof where we'd throw pebbles at people in the street and then hide.
-We were rascals, weren't we?
-No, you were good boys.
I would have that time again.
And here it is.
Nothing has changed.
Except for the fountain.
-The old well would go dry, remember?
-Promptly, every summer.
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.
-He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
-No?
Of course he has.
He was a boy when he left us, now he's a man.
With great responsibilities.
Come.
The emperor builds and builds, turning brick to marble.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.
I've never seen anything like this before.
It's beautiful!
-Is it Roman?
-It's Libyan.
I was there last year.
A tremendous campaign.
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.
Or was, till we destroyed it.
Now it's nothing but ashes.
I'm boring you with soldier stories.
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.
Thank you for this.
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.
BEN-HUR:
What do you think of it?
MESSALA:
Magnificent.
It's Arabic.
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.
Let me try him sometime.
Whenever you like.
He's yours.
Do you mean you'll give me this?
Oh, Judah.
You are good.
It's going to be like old times, I know it.
Judah, tell me, did you think about what I said?
Yes.
Talked to a number of people already.
Spoken against violence, against incidents.
Most of the men agree with me.
Most?
Not all?
-No, not all.
-Who does not agree?
Well, the resentful, the impatient.
Who are they?
Yes, Judah.
Who are they?
Would I retain your friendship if I became an informer?
Telling the names of criminals is not informing.
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.
Patriots?
!
Judah.
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.
This is my great opportunity, and yours too.
If I bring order here, I can have any post I want.
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?
Rome!
Yes, perhaps at the side of Caesar himself.
I mean it.
It can happen and this is the moment.
I swear, this is the time.
The emperor is watching us, judging us.
All I need do is serve him.
And all you need do is help me serve him.
-You speak as if he were God.
-He is God.
The only God.
He is power, real power on earth, not-
Not that.
Help me, Judah.
I would do anything for you, Messala except betray my own people.
In the name of all the gods, what do the lives of a few Jews mean to you?
If I cannot persuade them, that does not mean I would help you murder them.
Besides, you must understand this, Messala.
I believe in the past and future of my people.
Future?
You are a conquered people.
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?
Joshua will not rise again to save you nor David.
There is only one reality in the world today.
Look to the West.
Don't be a fool!
Look to Rome!
Better a fool than a traitor or a killer.
-I am a soldier.
-Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.
-I warn you—
-No!
I warn you.
Rome is an affront to God.
Rome is strangling my people and my country, the whole earth!
But not forever.
And I tell you, the day Rome falls there will be a shout of freedom such as the world has never heard before.
Judah.
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.
You're either for me or against me.
If that is the choice then I am against you.
There they are.
Where's Messala?
-Where's-?
-He's gone.
Gone?
-But why?
-He couldn't stay.
-What happened?
-A new tribune must have many duties.
Come.
Let us have dinner.
Blessed art Thou, О Lord, our God, King of the world who bringeth to us bread from the earth.
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.
He wanted to use me to betray our people.
Judah.
[MURMURING]
[CAMEL BAYING]
-Master, the caravan from Antioch.
-Yes, Amrah, I saw.
Simonides.
-Welcome.
-Judah.
-Oh, welcome homecoming.
-Master.
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.
And for the master, Iberian wine.
Not to mention the best gift of all, your presence.
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.
-Caravans from Petra.
-Have all arrived.
-Good.
-Here is the accounting.
And what of Numidia?
The trade route is ours, guaranteed by treaty with the king.
Once a year, you bring your accounting.
And once a year, I find myself wealthier.
Yeah, but my greatest treasure is my steward.
SIMONIDES:
My life belongs to the House of Hur.
Nothing else exists for me, except my daughter.
-She must be a young woman by now.
-Yes, and your property.
She was born the daughter of your slave.
When I inherited you, I inherited a friend, not a slave.
Still, Esther has come with me from Antioch for your permission to marry.
It's granted.
I wish you the joy of many grandchildren.
SIMONIDES:
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.
With your permission, Esther wishes to speak to her master.
You're eager to marry, Esther?
It is my father's wish.
Your husband will be fortunate.
What is his name?
David, son of Mathias.
BEN-HUR:
Of what house?
-His own, master.
-He is a freeman.
Tell me more about him.
I have seen him only once.
He is a merchant, well-thought-of in Antioch.
He will pay for Esther's freedom.
Her freedom will be my wedding gift to Esther.
You are generous, master.
Do you love this man?
I will learn to love him.
You have my permission to marry.
We'll drink to your happiness.
And a safe return to Antioch.
BEN-HUR:
I disturbed you.
No.
What were you thinking?
I was saying goodbye to this city and this house.
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?
My father sometimes brought me here when I was little.
It was a house where I was always happy.
Except once.
When you and your friend, the Roman boy-
-Messala.
-Yes.
You had been out hunting and they brought you home injured.
I touched your face as you lay there and prayed to God, "Don't let this boy die."
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.
Yes, master.
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.
It's strange.
I hardly felt a slave.
And now I hardly feel free.
You know, in the old, wise days of Solomon if there was among his slaves some girl who filled his eyes he could choose her out from the rest and take her to him.
Wise days of Solomon.
Different days.
And long ago.
If you were not a bride I should kiss you goodbye.
If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said.
Your slave ring.
Fair exchange.
Freedom to you.
The ring to me.
You will wear it?
Until you meet the woman you will marry?
Until then.
[DRUMMING]
[TRUMPETING]
The gods favor my lord Gratus.
If it is the governor's pleasure, the wreath of office.
Thank you, tribune.
I see no delegation from the city.
-There will not be one, sir.
-No?
Jerusalem's welcome will not be a warm one.
But I pledge, my lord, it will be a quiet one.
Let us proceed.
[CHILDREN SHOUTING]
There's Messala.
He saw you, Judah.
The new governor.
[GASPS]
[HORSE NEIGHS]
[WOMAN SCREAMS]
[CHATTERING]
OFFICER 1:
Stand back!
-Stand back.
-Up there.
You, come!
OFFICER 2:
Had to be the Jews!
OFFICER 3:
Open up in the name of the divine emperor!
Judah!
Tirzah!
What is it?
What's happened?
OFFICER 4:
Open up in the name of Rome!
-I was watching the Romans-
-A tile fell and struck the governor.
-It wasn't my fault.
-They won't believe her.
She won't have to say anything.
You hear?
Tirzah, say nothing.
MAN:
Open the gates!
I'll speak to them.
OFFICER 1:
Arrest him!
-Wait.
Let me tell you what happened.
OFFICER 2:
Hold those women.
BEN-HUR:
Not them!
-Judah!
BEN-HUR:
It was an accident.
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.
-This is the man, sir.
We saw him.
-It was an accident.
-Accident?
-I swear it.
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose.
It gave way.
Take him.
Take all of them.
MIRIAM:
He's telling the truth!
-It was me!
Let them go!
MIRIAM:
Judah!
CENTURION:
Attention!
BEN-HUR:
Messala.
In the name of God, tell them it's a mistake.
I leaned on the tile, and it broke loose.
It was an accident.
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!
MIRIAM:
Messala!
TIRZAH:
Messala.
Let the servants go.
Let them go.
Return to your ranks.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
-Come.
-Where?
Tirus.
Tirus?
I've had no trial.
I'm to die in the galleys without even a trial?
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!
Wait.
My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?
Tie his hands.
-At least tell me if they're safe.
-I can tell you nothing.
[GRUNTS]
[BEN-HUR GASPS]
OFFICER:
Get along.
Keep moving.

[OFFICERS YELL]

[SHOUTING]
MESSALA:
Wait!
BEN-HUR:
Send them out.
Send them out.
You can go.
Go!
The door.
Where are my mother and sister?
Where are they?
Here, within these walls.
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.
Of course, they will be sentenced.
Is it possible, Messala?
Is it possible you could do this to us?
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?
You'll let them go.
You must.
You will gladly let them go!
Messala!
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not mad.
I'm not a murderer!
I know you're not.
You know?
You are evil.
No, Judah, I am not evil.
I wanted your help.
Now you've given it to me.
By making this example of you, I discourage treason.
By condemning without hesitation an old friend, I shall be feared.
But not my family.
Let them go.
Please.
-Messala, I beg you.
-Beg?
!
Didn't I beg you?
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.
Kill me, and your mother and sister will die today nailed to crosses in front of you!
Go on, Judah.
Kill me!
[GRUNTS]
May God grant me vengeance.
I will pray that you live till I return.
Return?
Take him.
OFFICER:
Sentries, salute.
The tribune will see you now.
Tribune, I'm steward of the House of Hur.
I remember you.
We were on our way to Antioch when we heard what had happened.
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done this thing.
You knew him, tribune.
Better than you.
Then there must be no doubt in your mind, the charge is groundless.
The prisoners have been sentenced.
-Sentenced?
-But there's no truth in it.
There was never a threat against the governor in Judah's mind.
Surely you must know he would never have done this.
In your heart, you must know it.
Drusus.
This man had better be kept here until we have time to question him.
DECURION:
Hold!
[SAWING]
DECURION:
Water for the soldiers.
Soldiers first!
Get away from that well!
No water for them!
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!
Come on, you!
Water for the horses!
MAN:
Water.
Water.
DECURION:
Soldiers first!
Here.
Wait.
No water for him.
[GROANS]
God help me.
You!
I said no water for him!
All right, on your feet, all of you!
Get them on their feet!
Back in line, you dog!
On your feet!
Get them going!
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!
Forward, you dogs!
In a few minutes, the consul's barge will be coming alongside.
Be ready to raise oars.
HORTATOR:
Raise oars!
Down oars!
[TRUMPETING]
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.
-How many rowers?
-Two hundred, consul.
-And reliefs?
-Of 30, every hour.
[MAN COUGHING]
This man is ill.
Replace him.
-Change him.
-Right, sir.
-This man has been giving you trouble?
-He's insubordinate, consul.
That will stop.
What service have you seen?
Forty-one.
A month's less a day in this ship.
You keep an exact account.
And before?
Three years in other ships.
Three years.
[BEN-HUR YELLS]
You have the spirit to fight back but the good sense to control it.
Your eyes are full of hate, 41.
That's good.
Hate keeps a man alive.
It gives him strength.
Now, listen to me, all of you.
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
So row well and live.
-Ship ready, consul.
-Strike oars.
HORTATOR:
Strike oars!
You know that a fleet of Macedonian galleys has been raiding Roman commerce.
The emperor has honored us with the task of seeking out and destroying them.
Battle speed, hortator.

Why are you here?
I was ordered to report to you during my relief.
Oh, yes.
I'd forgotten.
You could have killed me as I lay there.
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?
I'm not ready to die.
What do you think will save you?
The God of my fathers.
Hmm.
Your God has forsaken you.
He has no more power than the images I pray to.
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.
I might.
Does that interest you, 41?
I can see that it does.
I'm a fighting man by profession, and in my leisure moments it amuses me to train fighting men.
I own some of the best gladiators and charioteers in Rome.
Would you like to become one of them?
To die as your slave?
Better than to live in chains below these decks.
I will not be here forever.
No?
What would you do if you escaped?
Two people were condemned with me, my mother and sister though they were innocent.
I won't rest-
Do not say that you were innocent.
-Would it do any good to say it again?
-No.
Consider my offer carefully.
You will never escape while we are victorious.
If we are not, you will sink with this ship, chained to your oar.
I cannot believe that God has let me live these three years to die chained to an oar.
It's a strange, stubborn faith you keep to believe that existence has a purpose.
A sane man would have learned to lose it long before this.
As you have.
What drove it out of you?
Go back to your oar, 41.
Consul, enemy sighted.
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.
OFFICER:

I didn't know why then.

Is the sail square?
I can't tell.
Better for us both if it's the enemy.

You have cleared the seaways of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.
This baton of victory has been nobly won.
[CROWD CHEERS]
This man riding beside you, who is he?
The man who saved me, divine emperor, to return and serve you.
Is that all you know about him?
No.
He was accused of an attack on the governor of Judea.
But he was innocent.
If not, there's a strange inconsistency in this man who tries to kill my governor, yet saves the life of my consul.
Come tomorrow.
We'll talk of it.
[CROWD CHEERS]
[BAND PLAYING TRIUMPHANT MUSIC]
We have all the information on this man a man of some influence in his own country.
His attack upon our governor is one upon the senate and the people of Rome.
I am convinced that no such attack was intended.
Consul, allow us to continue.
Allow us to be generous.
As a reward to you for your great victory we shall not send him back to the galleys.
We give him to you as your slave to do with him as you like.
Such is the will of the senate and the people of Rome.
[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]
[WOMEN YELLING]
[BAND PLAYING SOFT MUSIC]
Not long ago, I returned to Rome with a young man who had saved my life.
You all know him as the finest charioteer in Rome.
Five times, he's driven my horses to victory.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I know him as one who stands in the place of the son I lost.
I have the love and pride in a son's achievements which I thought I should never have again.
[MURMURING]
Nothing could make stronger the bond between us but tonight I wish to share it with you all.
The formalities of adoption have been completed.
Young Arrius is now the legal bearer of my name and the heir to my property.
[CROWD MURMURS]
This ring of my ancestors would have gone to my son.
So now it is yours.
It's a strange destiny that brought me to a new life a new home a new father.
It brought me here.
It may take me away.
But wherever I may be I shall always try to wear this ring as a son of Arrius should.
With gratitude and affection and with honor.
[CROWD CHEERING]
[SOFT MUSIC RESUMES]
I present my son to you.
My old friend Pontius Pilate, young Arrius.
Before you came to this city, my horses always won.
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.
Yes, but not swift enough to defeat you.
-Tell me, you come from Judea?
-Yes, sir.
I hear that the climate is difficult to live in.
Not for Judeans.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.
-Of Judea?
-Yes.
I asked for Alexandria.
But it seems the wilderness needs my particular talents.
The scorpions and holy prophets can't get on without me.
Lay the dust of Judea, at least for this evening.
Goats and Jehovah.
[ARRIUS CHUCKLES]
You're leaving.
I must.
It's a journey I can't keep you from.
Your eyes have never left it all these months.
I can recognize pain.
But still, my counsel is to wait.
Gratus is to be replaced.
The governorship goes to Pontius Pilate.
When?
Very soon.
It's very much to our purpose.
Nothing is to the purpose if, when I come back to Judea, I come too late.
That is the thought which has punished me every moment I've spent here.
Will Rome see you again?
Here is a part of my life which you have made for me.
I shall remember it.
Whoever the gods are, they take small interest in an old man's hopes.
They have their way.
Forgive me.
You're a stranger here.
Would you be from Nazareth?
Why do you ask?
I thought you might be the one....
The one that I have come back from my country to find.
He would be about your age.
Who?
When I find him I shall know him.
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.
SHEIK:
Hyah!
Hyah!
Sack of flesh without brains!
No!
No!
Not the whip!
That is my host.
SHEIK:
Gently!
Gently!
Fool!
Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood!
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run!
Go on!
SHEIK:
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!
Beautiful horses.
Now!
Now!
They are ready!
Let them go!
Watch.
They'll never hold the turn.
SHEIK:
No!
No!
Abadon, stop him!
Stop that whip!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill-!
SHEIK:
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!
You think you can treat my horses like animals?
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!
Get off, idiot!
SHEIK:
Drive goats, not horses!
Now I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.
Hmm?
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.
Not a team?
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.
-Antares.
-The slow one?
SHEIK:
Uh-huh.
I think he should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?
In the circus in Rome.
You have driven in the great circus?
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.
No other animal has descended so in scale from the first innocent falling of the world.
[SHEIK CHUCKLES]
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.
Yes.
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.
Your coming here was so fit, so right.
We might have achieved wonders.
You have to go.
I make a journey which will not wait.
Well, then perhaps you will come back.
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.
I have no wives.
No wives at all?
I have six, no, seven.
BALTHASAR:
Ha, ha.
I've counted eight.
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.
-Someday, I hope to have one.
-One wife!
Ha, ha, one God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.
It is not generous.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
[BURPS]
-Was the food not to your liking?
-Indeed.
[BURPS]
Thank you.
Thank you.
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.
And now I must say good night to my beauties.
When they're ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.
-I'll make my farewells then.
-No, no, no, stay.
Stay and see them.
Come, my children.
Come.
Strangers make them shy.
Come.
Come, do not be afraid.
Come.
There, my children.
They are descended from the Arabians of the first Pharaohs and I have named them for the stars.
Come, Antares.
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.
[ANTARES WHINNIES]
What?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.
Come, Rigel.
We've both supped well, and the world is good.
[CHUCKLES]
There's my good Rigel.
Ah.
Yes, you are ready for sleep.
The day's work done for you, eh?
Ah.
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.
Good night.
Good night, my treasure.
Ah!
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.
No.
You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.
[CHUCKLES]
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.
You should see their mother, Mira.
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.
All right, all right.
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.
You must be strong and swift.
Go, my children.
Go.
When they reach Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams not to mention the champion of the East, Messala, with his black devils.
He stops at nothing to win.
-Messala?
In the circus?
-Yes.
You knew him?
I know him.
Perhaps without much liking.
Judah Ben-Hur, my people are praying for a man to drive their team to victory over Messala.
You could be that man, the one to stamp his arrogance into the sand.
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.
It's not possible.
That is a pity.
Think of it.
To break his pride to humble this tribune before the very people he has degraded.
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!
I know it is not possible.
Does it not delight your imagination?
Does it not answer your purpose?
I must deal with Messala in my own way.
And your way is to kill him.
I see this terrible thing in your eyes, Judah Ben-Hur.
But no matter what this man has done, you have no right to take his life.
He will be punished inevitably.
I don't believe in miracles.
But all life is a miracle.
Why will you not accept God's judgment?
You do not believe in miracles.
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness and a star led me to a village called Bethlehem where I found a newborn child in a manger.
And God lived in this child.
By now, he is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.
That is why I have returned here so that I may be at hand when he comes among us.
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.
Perhaps he's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.
Perhaps he is a shepherd a merchant, a fisherman.
But he lives and all our lives from now on will carry his mark.
There are many paths to God, my son.
I hope yours will not be too difficult.
I'm ready for sleep.
Balthasar is a good man but until all men are like him, we must keep our swords bright.
And our intention true.
So I must leave you.
One last thought.
There is no law in the arena.
Many are killed.
I hope to see you again.

Fine Damascus silk.

Esther?

It's Judah.

Judah.
-You are alive.
-Esther.
You are alive.
What are you doing here?
What has happened?
[ESTHER SOBBING]
Shh.
I'm here.
I'm with you.
Esther.
Where's your father?
Hmm?
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.
They tortured him.
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.
You never went back to Antioch?
No.
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.
Esther.
Esther.
Where are my mother and sister?
SIMONIDES:
Esther.
Let me tell him first.
Father.
Father, something wonderful has happened.
-Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
-Judah.
He has come home.
He is here.
Judah.
Judah Ben-Hur.
My dear old friend.
Let me look at you.
Let me see you.
Yes, yes.
It is true.
Praise God for his mercy.
Where are they?
Since that terrible day there has been no word of them.
You should have been less loyal.
Do not pity me, Master Judah.
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.
We were released on the same day.
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.
Since then, I have been his tongue and he has been my legs.
Together, we make a considerable man.
Old friend.
She always said you would return.
She never gave up hope.
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.
I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.
But suppose that isn't possible.
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.
They could not make me tell them where it is.
It is there still to put power into our hands and buy death for the Romans.
That's not why I came back.
Judah, they are dead.
Four years.
No one could live so long in the dungeons.
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?
SIMONIDES:
Yes, it is true.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You have come back to us like a returning faith.
Judah, I should like to laugh again.
-Let us laugh.
-We will.
There will be joy again in this house.
We will celebrate among the dust.
[SOBBING]
I will take him.
We stood here before.
A long while ago.
Four years.
But now it seems as if only yesterday....
I was saying:
"If you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye."
"If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said."
I am not a bride.
Why did you never marry?
My father needed me.
And also....
It's still on my finger.
I said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.
It's become a part of my hand.
If Messala once knew you were here....
As he must.
He will know where they are.
And if you should find...?
-If he should tell you they're dead-
-Then Messala will wish they were living.
I've seen too much of what hate can do.
My father is burned up with it.
But I've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater and love more powerful than hatred.
I believe it.
-Esther.
-Judah.
Stay alive.
Keep away from Messala.
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.
That time isn't yet come.
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.
This time you will be destroyed.
You'll die.
Tribune, compliments of Quintus Arrius.
He awaits your pleasure.
-Consul here?
-Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.
Thank him.
Bring him to me.
-I didn't know the consul had a son.
-He's a champion of the great circus.
Why is he here presenting me with gifts?
-Perhaps he'll race against you.
-Look.
It's magnificent.
And from a man I've never met.
You're wrong, Messala.
Judah.
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?
You were the magician, Messala.
You condemned me to the galleys.
When my ship was sunk, I saved the consul's life.
You know his seal?
Now I have come back as I swore I would.
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.
You suggest I use it on myself?
What has become of my mother and my sister?
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.
Find them, Messala.
Restore them to me, and I'll forget what I vowed with every stroke of that oar you chained me to.
I am not the governor of Judea.
I can do nothing without approval.
Then get it.
I will come back tomorrow.
Don't disappoint me, Messala.
What became of them?
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?
Go to the citadel, Drusus.
Find out.
-And if they're dead?
-They're dead!
"Miriam, wife.
Tirzah, daughter."
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?
East section lower level.
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.

PRISONER 2:
Let me out!
PRISONER 3:
Hear us!
Hear us!
[POUNDING]
-How long since you've seen them?
-Never.
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.
The food disappears.
Lepers.
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.
Then we'll burn out the cell.
[COUGHING]
ESTHER:
Is someone there?
[RUSTLING]
There is someone there.
Who are you?
MIRIAM:
Don't come any closer.
Who are you?

It's Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam?
MIRIAM:
Stay where you are.
You have come home.
MIRIAM:
Stand back, Esther.
We are lepers.
[GASPS]
Oh, Esther.
Tirzah.
Esther is Judah living?
Yes, he is alive.
He is here.
Where?
He is searching for you now.
I must find him and tell him.
MIRIAM:
No!
-Tell my father.
MIRIAM:
No.
Tell no one.
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.
We won't return.
But Judah has to be told.
MIRIAM:
No.
Please.
I couldn't see his face.
Is it changed?
No, he is not changed.
Не....
He's not changed.
You love him, Esther.
Promise me on your love for him you will never tell him you've seen us.
Is he never to know?
Let him remember us as we were.
Promise me.
There's nothing else I can hope for.
Only this.
I promise you.
I am content.
Wait.
[CRIES]
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.
I pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.
He'll free them.
He wants to survive.
He cannot free them, Judah.
What do you mean?
-I saw them.
-You saw them?
Where?
When did you see them?
They were dead.
They were dead.
When?
When?
When?
In the prison.
When I was waiting for news of my father.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't tell you.
Nor even you, Father.
I was afraid that if you saw Messala....
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.
It's over now.
Over?
-Judah.
-Over?
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.

[MEN CHUCKLING]
SHEIK:
Gentlemen.
Officers.
Defenders of great Rome's imperium may I enter?
Certainly, sheik.
You do us an unexpected honor.
The noble tribune is most gracious.
And now, the question you're all asking yourselves:
Why am I here?
As you know, I am a gambling man.
The games approach.
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.
But I will back my own poor horses.
No limits?
MARIUS:
Mark me first!
-And me!
MATELLUS:
What odds?
-A moment, please my lords, protectors of the far flung marshes.
May I first, uh, sit down?
MARIUS:
Sit down.
Lie down.
How much will you wager?
-Yes, let's call his game.
SPINTHO:
Give the Arab a seat.
A bench, quickly.
Thank you.
-Now.
-One thousand denarii.
-Two thousand!
-Mark me!
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient.
There is time and money enough for all.
First, gentlemen, the odds.
The tribune has won many times.
The odds should be in the same measure.
Now, what is your pleasure, gentlemen?
MARIUS:
Two to one.
[SHEIK CHUCKLES]
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth where is the courage that made Rome master of the world?
I can get better odds on any street market.
MARIUS:
Three to one.
Let us not haggle.
Let us be fair.
In four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.
-In all truth-
-Just a moment.
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?
Oh.
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.
The Prince of Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur.
Prince of Hur?
[CHUCKLES]
-He was sent to the galleys years ago.
-He has returned.
Returned?
Impossible.
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.
Well?
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.
You, tribune will you give me four to one?
Four to one.
-Good.
-Bravo, Messala.
Four to one, sheik.
The difference between a Roman and a Jew.
Or an Arab.
[ROMANS LAUGH]
[CHUCKLES]
Bravely spoken.
Now we will settle the amount of our wager.
I will venture....
A thousand talents?
-A thousand talents?
-Yes, a thousand talents.
Of course, if it is too much....
A thousand talents it will be.
Agreed.
[MURMURING]
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.
You're good fellows.
If only men were this good.
Hey!
Remember, Altair nine times around the circus, huh?
Aldebaran.
Hey, ha, ha.
Rigel, did you hear?
Nine lives to live.
My swift fellow.
You must not win the race the first time around.
You win the last time around.
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.
Steady Antares.
Like a rock.
You will be our anchor.
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.
They have taken me into their family.
Rest well, my stars.
Tomorrow we go up to the city.
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it the news will scorch the streets of the whole Roman world.
Pontius Pilate here?
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.
You will make him see what men are born in this land.
I only know that I race against Messala.
ATTENDANT:
Look for the yoke.
Ease that strap.
BEN-HUR:
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.
Into your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as you will.
The Star of David.
To shine out for your people and my people together and blind the eyes of Rome.

A long life, young Arrius, and the good sense to live it.
[HEAVY BREATHING]
We cannot wait, tribune.
MESSALA:
He will come.
He will-
[COUGHS AND GASPS]
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.
He will come!
He will come.
I've sent for him, and he will come.
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.
Do you understand?
To hack the legs off me?
Not yet.
Not till I've seen him.
I don't receive him with half a body.
No.
No!
[MESSALA GRUNTING]
I told you, Drusus.
I told you.
Here he is.
Triumph c~ Triumph complete, Judah.
The race won.
The enemy destroyed.
I see no enemy.
What do you think you see?
The smashed body of a wretched animal?
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.
Let me help you.
[GROANS]
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.
Dead.
And the race over.
It isn't over, Judah.
They're not dead.
Where are they?
Where are they?
Where are they?
Look for them in the Valley of the Lepers if you can recognize them.
[BEN-HUR YELLS]
It goes on.
It goes on, Judah.
The race....
The race is not over.
Is there a way down here?
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.
Man.
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.
MAN:
There
- There are many women.
Of the family of Hur.
We have no names here.
For them?
-Why did you tell me they were dead?
-It was what they wanted.
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?
Not to see them?
They are coming.
Love them in the way they must need to be loved.
Not to look at them.
Let them be as if you had never come here.
Please!
Judah!
Is Judah well?
Is he happy?
ESTHER:
Yes, he is well.
Your mind can be at rest for him.
He is well, Miriam.
MIRIAM:
God be with you.
They have gone.
We can go back.
Go back to what?
Judah, they have one blessing left.
To think you remember them as they were and live your own life.
Forget what is here.
Forget?
It's as though they were alive in a grave.
-But what can you do?
-Undo what you've done.
How could you have suffered them to come here?
I must see them.
No, Judah, please!
Judah!
Think, Judah, think.
It would tear them apart if they see you.
Judah!
Judah.
He is here.
I have found him.
The child has become a man.
And the man, I know it now, is the son of God.
The promise is true.
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.
Life has been answered.
God has answered it.
Come.
Come with me.
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys thirst had nearly killed me.
A man gave me water to drink.
I went on living.
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.
No.
I am thirsty still.
Come and listen.
I have business with Rome.
You insist on death.
Goodbye, Judah.
You sent for me?
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.
-I honor him.
-As you may honor yourself.
You have been made a citizen of Rome.
Do you say nothing to this?
I have just come from the Valley of Stone where my mother and sister live what's left of their lives.
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.
I have heard this.
There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.
Where there is greatness, great government or power even great feeling or compassion error also is great.
We progress and mature by fault.
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.
There are other voices.
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place not to crucify yourself on a shadow such as old resentment or impossible loyalties.
Perfect freedom has no existence.
A grown man knows the world he lives in.
And for the present, the world is Rome.
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.
I am Judah Ben-Hur.
I cross this floor in spoken friendship as I would speak to Arrius.
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar ready to crush all those who challenge his authority.
There are too many small men of envy and ambition who try to disrupt the government of Rome.
You have become the victor and hero to those people.
They look to you, their one true god, as I called you.
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.
I am already part of this tragedy.
Return this to Arrius.
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you from personal disaster if you stay here.
You are too great a danger.
Leave Judea.
You have my word.
Judah!
Oh, Judah!
I was afraid you would never come back afraid of what would happen to you.
But I see you again.
Your father's waiting for me.
Where is he?
What do you mean to do?
Oh, Judah.
Rest, sleep.
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.
Peace?
Love and peace.
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?
Where do you see them?
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.
Balthasar's word.
He is more than Balthasar's word.
His voice traveled with such a still purpose.
It was more than a voice.
A man more than a man.
He said, "Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God."
Children of God?
In that dead valley where we left them?
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean until we have scoured off our bodies the crust and filth of being at the mercy of tyranny.
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.
-In blood?
-Yes, in blood!
I know there is a law in life.
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.
Death generates death as the vulture breeds the vulture.
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:
"Love your enemy.
Do good to those who despitefully use you."
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.
As you make us do now.
Are we to bear nothing together?
Even love?
I can hardly draw breath without feeling you in my heart.
But I know that everything I do from this moment will be as great a pain to you as you have ever suffered.
It is better not to love me.
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy giving evil for evil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.
It's as though you had become Messala.
I've lost you, Judah.
MIRIAM:
No further.
What are you doing here?
I was here last evening waiting for you.
I have waited all night.
What has happened?
Where is Tirzah?
Leave the food.
I am coming closer.
Don't be afraid.
-What are you doing?
-Don't be afraid.
I've heard him again, the man from Nazareth.
If ever words were from God, they are in everything he says.
I cannot bear that you should have never known this hand of quiet reaching towards us.
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find him there.
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find him.
[MIRIAM WHIMPERS]
Tirzah is dying.
Leave the food and go.
It's Judah.
Why did you tell him?
Yes, Judah, yes.
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.
Mother.
Wait, Mother, wait.
Let me talk with you.
MIRIAM:
Please.
No, no further.
Please.
No, Judah.
Son, no.
Mother, let me see Tirzah.
Tirzah is dying.
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know that life is everlasting and death is nothing to fear if you have faith.
I will take them to him.
[MIRIAM SHRIEKS]
No!
God, no!
[MIRIAM SOBBING]
No, no, dear son.
Mother where is Tirzah?
Judah, no.
Judah, no.
You must not go to her, dear son.
Please.
Dear son.
I am afraid.
ESTHER:
No cause.
The world is more than we know.
[TIRZAH WHIMPERING]
Tirzah, it's Judah.
No.
No, Judah.
No, Judah.
No.
[TIRZAH SOBBING]
BEGGAR:
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
BEN-HUR:
Why are the streets deserted?
-They have gone to the trial.
-Alms for the blind?
-Trial?
Whose trial?
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.
-This cannot be true.
-Alms?
What has he done?
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.
Help for the blind.
WOMAN:
Look, lepers!
GIRL:
Lepers!
MAN 1:
Go away!
MAN 2:
Get away!
Stay away!
Go away!
[MURMURING]
Lepers!
Lepers!
How can this be?
I know this man.
Will someone help him?
TIRZAH:
Take pity on him.
WOMAN:
Have mercy.
Have mercy.
MIRIAM:
In his pain this look of peace.
Watch over them, Esther.
We must go back.
I brought you here to this when I hoped....
You haven't failed, Esther.
MAN:
Hail King of the Jews!
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.
He gave me water and a heart to live.
What has he done to merit this?
He has taken the world of our sins onto himself.
To this end he said he was born in that stable where I first saw him.
For this cause, he came into the world.
For this death?
This beginning.
I have lived too long.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
As though he were carrying in that cross the pain of the world.
So fearful, and yet why is it I'm not afraid anymore?
[THUNDER RUMBLES]
The shadow of a storm.
A strange darkness but still day.
[RUMBLING INTENSIFIES]
His life is over.
[WIND HOWLING]
[THUNDER CRASHING]
TIRZAH:
What is it?
This tearing.
I am in pain.
I feel it too.
Miriam.
I thought I....
Miriam.
Do you see your hand?
Tirzah.
Miriam.
Tirzah.
Almost at the moment he died I heard him say, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do."
-Even then.
-Even then.
And I felt his voice take the sword out of my hand.
[English

In the year of our Lord Judea, for nearly a century, had lain under the mastery of Rome.
In the seventh year of the reign of Augustus Caesar an imperial decree ordered every Judean each to return to his place of birth to be counted and taxed.
Converging ways of many of them led to their capital city, Jerusalem the troubled heart of their land.
The old city was dominated by the fortress of Antonia the seat of Roman power and by the great golden temple the outward sign of an inward and imperishable faith.
Even while they obeyed the will of Caesar the people clung proudly to their ancient heritage always remembering the promise of their prophets that one day there would be born among them a redeemer to bring them salvation and perfect freedom.
You'll be counted at Hebron.
- Name?
- Samuel.
- What city?
- Joppa.
- What family?
- Michael.
- Move on.
Move on.
- Yes.
- Name?
- Joseph.
- What city?
- Nazareth.
- What family?
- David of Bethlehem.
And the woman?
My wife.
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.
Come on, come on.
What village is this?
Nazareth.
We should arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow night.
You're not watching the soldiers, Joseph?
We've seen Romans before.
Yes and we will see them again.
My table is not finished.
Where is your son?
He's walking in the hills.
He neglects his work, Joseph.
No.
Once, I reproached him with forgetting his work.
He said to me:
"I must be about my father's business."
Then why isn't he here, working?
He's working.
Trumpeters of the legion!
Welcome, Messala.
The command is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for relieving me.
Drusus when I was a boy, I dreamed of commanding this garrison.
Now the wheel has turned.
I am in command.
Attention!
Aisle one, face right!
Forward!
I'd forgotten the heat.
If it were only the heat.
I lived here until I was 14.
Jerusalem was my home.
- My father was head of...
- Yes, I know.
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.
If there can be such a thing in this forsaken land.
If you want to rise, Sextus, do the difficult.
I asked to be sent here.
You'll find the people changed since you were a boy.
In what way?
Oh, won't pay their taxes, an irrational resentment of Rome...
There's nothing new in all that.
And then there's religion.
I tell you, they're drunk with religion.
They smash the statues of our gods, even those of the emperor.
Punish them.
We do.
When we can find them.
Find the leaders.
You don't know.
There's nothing you can put your finger on.
There are strange forces at work here.
This "messiah" business...
I know.
There was one predicted when I was a boy.
A king of the Jews, who will lead them into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.
Makes your head spin.
There's a wild man in the desert named John who drowns people in water.
And a carpenter's son who does magic tricks. "Miracles" they call them.
There's always a rabble-rouser stirring up trouble.
No, no, no.
This man is different.
He teaches that God is near, in every man.
It's actually quite profound, some of it.
You've been too long away from Rome.
Go back, Sextus.
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea and forget that God is in every man.
- There is divinity in only one man.
- Yes, I know.
The emperor is displeased.
He wishes Judea made into a more obedient and disciplined province.
He's ordered me to restore order.
I shall carry out his wishes.
How?
You can break a man's skull, arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.
But how do you control this?
How do you fight an idea?
Especially a new idea.
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.
I assume he has a name.
- He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
- Then treat him like one!
Tell him I will join him.
Yes, tribune.
Centurion!
This was his country before it was ours.
Don't forget that.
Yes, tribune.
Very wise.
This Ben-Hur is the richest man in Jerusalem.
And the head of one of the greatest families in Judea.
We were friends as boys.
We were like brothers.
Sextus you ask how to fight an idea.
Well, I'll tell you how.
With another idea.
I said I'd come back.
I never thought you would.
I'm so glad.
- Look at you.
- Look at you!
You've come back a tribune.
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.
We'll drink another now.
- Your sister and mother?
- They're fine.
They've talked of you ever since we knew you were coming.
- Is Tirzah married?
- No.
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.
She's been in love with you since she was 5.
I can't wait to see them.
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?
Or have you become too dignified?
- Down Eros, up Mars!
- Down Eros, up Mars!
Where the beams cross?
Good.
After all these years!
Still close.
In every way.
I hope so.
I know.
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew whose life you once saved.
The best thing I ever did.
Judah it will be very difficult to govern here.
I'm going to need help.
Your help.
Your advice.
- You want my advice?
- Yes, I do.
Withdraw your legions.
Give us our freedom.
Unfortunately, the emperor is devoted to his empire.
He's particularly fond of Judea.
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.
Is there anything so sad as unrequited love?
My quarters.
A bit grim.
Not grim.
Austere.
Virtuous.
Roman.
I'm going to be second-in-command to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.
He's coming in a few days with more legions.
Then the rumors are true.
The emperor does not approve of your countrymen.
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.
But you and your family need have no concern.
I'm next in authority to the governor, and you're my friend.
- I'm a Jew.
- Ah, you are like a Roman!
What have you in common with the troublemaking rabble?
- They're my people.
I'm one of them.
- Be wise, Judah.
It's a Roman world.
If you want to live in it, you must become part of it.
You've changed.
I've grown up.
I've seen the world since I left Jerusalem.
I've seen Rome.
It's no accident that one small village on the Tiber was chosen to rule the world.
Your legions.
It wasn't just our legions.
Other countries have armies, fine armies.
I know, I fought them.
Oh, no.
No, it was fate that chose us to civilize the world.
And we have.
Our roads and ships connect every corner of the earth.
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.
I believe in the future of my people.
Of course you do.
And you can help them.
How?
You're an aristocrat.
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince to your people.
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.
They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.
Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.
It is worse than stupid, futile!
For it can end in only one way, extinction for your people!
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.
Then we're agreed!
Now, when can I come to see your family?
- We had hoped tomorrow.
- Good.
And now for our toast.
It's dreadful wine, by the way.
It's especially fermented for the Roman army.
You're very cruel to your conquerors.
It's an insane world.
But in it there is one sanity:
The loyalty of old friends.
Judah, we must believe in one another.
Will you drink to that?
With all my heart.
Here it is, the place I've remembered.
The court where we played at changing the guard.
The roof where we'd throw pebbles at people in the street and then hide.
- We were rascals, weren't we?
- No, you were good boys.
I would have that time again.
And here it is.
Nothing has changed.
Except for the fountain.
- The old well would go dry, remember?
- Promptly, every summer.
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.
- He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
- No?
Of course he has.
He was a boy when he left us, now he's a man.
With great responsibilities.
Come.
The emperor builds and builds, turning brick to marble.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.
I've never seen anything like this before.
It's beautiful!
- Is it Roman?
- It's Libyan.
I was there last year.
A tremendous campaign.
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.
Or was, till we destroyed it.
Now it's nothing but ashes.
I'm boring you with soldier stories.
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.
Thank you for this.
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.
What do you think of it?
Magnificent.
It's Arabic.
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.
Let me try him sometime.
Whenever you like.
He's yours.
Do you mean you'll give me this?
Oh, Judah.
You are good.
It's going to be like old times, I know it.
Judah, tell me, did you think about what I said?
Yes.
Talked to a number of people already.
Spoken against violence, against incidents.
Most of the men agree with me.
Most?
Not all?
No, not all.
Who does not agree?
Well, the resentful, the impatient.
Who are they?
Yes, Judah.
Who are they?
Would I retain your friendship if I became an informer?
Telling the names of criminals is not informing.
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.
Patriots?
!
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.
This is my great opportunity, and yours too.
If I bring order here, I can have any post I want.
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?
Rome!
Yes, perhaps at the side of Caesar himself.
I mean it.
It can happen and this is the moment.
I swear, this is the time.
The emperor is watching us, judging us.
All I need do is serve him.
And all you need do is help me serve him.
- You speak as if he were God.
- He is God.
The only God.
He is power, real power on earth, not...
Not that.
Help me, Judah.
I would do anything for you, Messala except betray my own people.
In the name of all the gods, what do the lives of a few Jews mean to you?
If I cannot persuade them, that does not mean I would help you murder them.
Besides, you must understand this, Messala.
I believe in the past and future of my people.
Future?
You are a conquered people.
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?
Joshua will not rise again to save you nor David.
There is only one reality in the world today.
Look to the West.
Don't be a fool!
Look to Rome!
Better a fool than a traitor or a killer.
- I am a soldier.
- Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.
- I warn you...
- No!
I warn you.
Rome is an affront to God.
Rome is strangling my people and my country, the whole earth!
But not forever.
And I tell you, the day Rome falls there will be a shout of freedom such as the world has never heard before.
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.
You're either for me or against me.
If that is the choice then I am against you.
There they are.
Where's Messala?
- Where's...?
- He's gone.
Gone?
- But why?
- He couldn't stay.
- What happened?
- A new tribune must have many duties.
Come.
Let us have dinner.
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the world who bringeth to us bread from the earth.
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.
He wanted to use me to betray our people.
- Master, the caravan from Antioch.
- Yes, Amrah, I saw.
Simonides.
- Oh, welcome homecoming.
- Master.
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.
And for the master, lberian wine.
Not to mention the best gift of all, your presence.
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.
- Caravans from Petra.
- Have all arrived.
- Good.
- Here is the accounting.
And what of Numidia?
The trade route is ours, guaranteed by treaty with the king.
Once a year, you bring your accounting.
And once a year, I find myself wealthier.
Yeah, but my greatest treasure is my steward.
My life belongs to the House of Hur.
Nothing else exists for me, except my daughter.
- She must be a young woman by now.
- Yes, and your property.
She was born the daughter of your slave.
When I inherited you, I inherited a friend, not a slave.
Still, Esther has come with me from Antioch for your permission to marry.
It's granted.
I wish you the joy of many grandchildren.
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.
With your permission, Esther wishes to speak to her master.
You're eager to marry, Esther?
It is my father's wish.
Your husband will be fortunate.
What is his name?
David, son of Mathias.
Of what house?
- His own, master.
- He is a freeman.
Tell me more about him.
I have seen him only once.
He is a merchant, well-thought-of in Antioch.
He will pay for Esther's freedom.
Her freedom will be my wedding gift to Esther.
You are generous, master.
Do you love this man?
I will learn to love him.
You have my permission to marry.
We'll drink to your happiness.
And a safe return to Antioch.
I disturbed you.
No.
What were you thinking?
I was saying goodbye to this city and this house.
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?
My father sometimes brought me here when I was little.
It was a house where I was always happy.
Except once.
When you and your friend, the Roman boy...
- Messala.
- Yes.
You had been out hunting and they brought you home injured.
I touched your face as you lay there and prayed to God, "Don't let this boy die."
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.
Yes, master.
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.
It's strange.
I hardly felt a slave.
And now I hardly feel free.
You know, in the old, wise days of Solomon if there was among his slaves some girl who filled his eyes he could choose her out from the rest and take her to him.
Wise days of Solomon.
Different days.
And long ago.
If you were not a bride I should kiss you goodbye.
If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said.
Your slave ring.
Fair exchange.
Freedom to you.
The ring to me.
You will wear it?
Until you meet the woman you will marry?
Until then.
The gods favor my lord Gratus.
If it is the governor's pleasure, the wreath of office.
Thank you, tribune.
I see no delegation from the city.
- There will not be one, sir.
- No?
Jerusalem's welcome will not be a warm one.
But I pledge, my lord, it will be a quiet one.
Let us proceed.
There's Messala.
He saw you, Judah.
The new governor.
Stand back!
- Stand back.
- You, come!
Had to be the Jews!
Open up in the name of the divine emperor!
Judah!
Tirzah!
What is it?
What's happened?
Open up in the name of the law!
- I was watching the...
- A tile fell and struck the governor.
- It wasn't my fault.
- They won't believe her.
She won't have to say anything.
You hear?
Tirzah, say nothing.
Open the gates!
I'll speak to them.
- Arrest him!
- Let me tell you what happened.
- Hold those women.
- Stop them!
It was an accident.
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.
- This is the man, sir.
We saw him.
- It was an accident.
- Accident?
- I swear it.
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose.
It gave way.
Take him.
Take all of them.
- He's telling the truth!
- It was me!
Let them go!
Attention!
Messala.
In the name of God, tell them it's a mistake.
I leaned on the tile, and it broke loose.
It was an accident.
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!
Let the servants go.
Let them go.
Return to your ranks.
Come.
Where?
Tirus.
Tirus?
I've had no trial.
I'm to die in the galleys without even a trial?
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!
Wait.
My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?
Tie his hands.
- At least tell me if they're safe.
- I can tell you nothing.
Get along.
Keep moving.
Jailer!
Guard, in there!
Up the stairs!
Jailer!
Jailer!
To the right.
- Wait!
- Send them out.
Go!
The door.
Where are my mother and sister?
Where are they?
Here, within these walls.
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.
Of course, they will be sentenced.
Is it possible?
Is it possible you could do this to us?
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?
You will let them go.
You will gladly let them go!
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not a murderer!
I know you're not.
You know?
You are evil.
No, Judah, I am not evil.
I wanted your help.
Now you've given it to me.
By making this example of you, I discourage treason.
By condemning without hesitation an old friend, I shall be feared.
But not my family.
Let them go.
Please.
- Messala, I beg you.
- Beg?
!
Didn't I beg you?
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.
Kill me, and your mother and sister will die nailed to crosses in front of you!
Go on, Judah.
Kill me!
May God grant me vengeance.
I will pray that you live till I return.
Return?
Take him.
Sentries, salute.
The tribune will see you now.
Tribune, I'm steward of the House of Hur.
I remember you.
We were on our way to Antioch when we heard what had happened.
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done this thing.
You knew him, tribune.
Better than you.
Then there must be no doubt in your mind, the charge is groundless.
The prisoners have been sentenced.
- Sentenced?
- But there's no truth in it.
There was never a threat against the governor in Judah's mind.
Surely you must know he would never have done this.
In your heart, you must know it.
Drusus.
This man had better be kept here until we can question him.
Hold!
Water for the soldiers.
Soldiers first!
Get away from that well.
No water for them!
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!
Come on, you!
Water for the horses!
- Water.
Water.
- Soldiers first!
Here.
Wait.
No water for him.
God help me.
You!
I said no water for him!
All right, on your feet, all of you!
Get them on their feet!
Back in line, you dog!
On your feet!
Get them going!
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!
Forward, you dogs!
Soon, the counselor's barge will be coming alongside.
Be ready to raise oars.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.
- How many rowers?
- Two hundred, consul.
- And reliefs?
- Of 30, every hour.
This man is ill.
Replace him.
- Change him.
- Right, sir.
- This man's been giving you trouble?
- He's insubordinate, consul.
That will stop.
What service have you seen?
Forty-one.
A month's less a day in this ship.
You keep an exact account.
And before?
Three years in other ships.
Three years.
You have the spirit to fight back but the good sense to control it.
Your eyes are full of hate, 41.
That's good.
Hate keeps a man alive.
It gives him strength.
Now, listen to me, all of you.
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
So row well and live.
- Ship ready, consul.
- Strike oars.
Strike oars!
You know a fleet of Macedonian galleys has been raiding Roman commerce.
The emperor has honored us with the task of seeking out and destroying them.
Battle speed, hortator.
Battle speed!
Attack speed.
Attack speed!
Ramming speed.
Ramming speed!
Rest.
Halt!
Rest!
Why are you here?
I was ordered to report to you during my relief.
Oh, yes.
I'd forgotten.
You could have killed me as I lay there.
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?
I'm not ready to die.
What do you think will save you?
The God of my fathers.
Your God has forsaken you.
He has no more power than the images I pray to.
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.
I might.
Does that interest you, 41?
I can see that it does.
I'm a fighting man by profession, and in my leisure moments it amuses me to train fighting men.
I own some of the best gladiators and charioteers in Rome.
Would you like to become one of them?
To die as your slave?
Better than to live in chains below these decks.
I will not be here forever.
No?
What would you do if you escaped?
Two people were condemned with me, my mother and sister though they were innocent.
I won't rest...
Do not say that you were innocent.
- Would it do any good to say it again?
- No.
Consider my offer carefully.
You will never escape while we are victorious.
If we are not, you will sink with this ship, chained to your oar.
I cannot believe that God has let me live these years to die chained to an oar.
It's a strange, stubborn faith you keep to believe that existence has a purpose.
A sane man would have learned to lose it long before this.
As you have.
What drove it out of you?
Go back to your oar, 41.
Consul, enemy sighted.
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.
All the watch to battle posts.
- Stand by to load.
- Make ready to fire.
Hurry, quick!
Hurry up with that resin.
Get some more ammunition.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
Chain rowers!
Guard.
Unlock 41.
No!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
41, why did he do that?
I don't know.
Once before, a man helped me.
I didn't know why then.
Normal speed!
Number 1, flame.
Fire.
Fire!
Fire!
Hold withdrawal on command.
Lift oars!
Raise!
Withdraw!
Steersman, right.
Extend oars!
Fire!
- Watch out!
- Fire!
Steersman, ram course!
Order below!
- Ramming speed!
- Ramming speed!
Consul, barge on ramming course.
We're going to be rammed!
We're going to be rammed!
Why did you save me?
Why did you have me unchained?
What is your name, 41?
Judah Ben-Hur. ...let me die.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
Row well and live.
Is the sail square?
I can't tell.
Better for us both if it's the enemy.
My death.
Your freedom.
It's a Roman sail.
Face rear!
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.
Water.
The fleet, all lost?
Five galleys.
- And the battle?
- The battle was won.
You have a victory.
- It was a victory?
- Complete.
In His eagerness to save you your God has also saved the Roman fleet.
Hail Arrius!
Right oars!
You have cleared the seaways of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.
This baton of victory has been nobly won.
This man riding beside you, who is he?
The man who saved me, divine emperor, to return and serve you.
Is that all you know about him?
No.
He was accused of an attack on the governor of Judea.
But he was innocent.
If not, there's a strange inconsistency in this man who tries to kill my governor, yet saves the life of my consul.
Come tomorrow.
We'll talk of it.
We have all the information on this man a man of some influence in his own country.
His attack upon our governor is one upon the senate and the people of Rome.
I am convinced that no such attack was intended.
Consul, allow us to continue.
Allow us to be generous.
As a reward to you for your great victory we shall not send him back to the galleys.
Take him as your slave.
Such is the will of the senate and the people of Rome.
Not long ago, I returned to Rome with a young man who had saved my life.
You all know him as the finest charioteer in Rome.
Five times, he's driven my horses to victory.
I know him as one who stands in the place of the son I lost.
I have the love and pride in a son's achievements which I thought I should never have again.
Nothing could make stronger our bond but tonight I wish to share it with you all.
The formalities of adoption have been completed.
Young Arrius is now the legal bearer of my name and the heir to my property.
This ring of my ancestors would have gone to my son.
So now it is yours.
It's a strange destiny that brought me to a new life a new home a new father.
It brought me here.
It may take me away.
But wherever I may be I shall always try to wear this ring as a son of Arrius should.
With gratitude and affection and with honor.
My old friend Pontius Pilate, young Arrius.
Before you came to this city, my horses always won.
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.
Yes, but not swift enough to defeat you.
- Tell me, you come from Judea?
- Yes, sir.
I hear that the climate is difficult to live in.
Not for Judeans.
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.
- Of Judea?
- Yes.
I asked for Alexandria.
But it seems the wilderness needs my particular talents.
The scorpions and holy prophets can't get on without me.
Lay the dust of Judea, at least for this evening.
Goats and Jehovah.
You're leaving.
I must.
It's a journey I can't keep you from.
Your eyes have never left it all these months.
I can recognize pain.
But still, my counsel is to wait.
Gratus is to be replaced.
The governorship goes to Pontius Pilate.
When?
Very soon.
It's very much to our purpose.
Nothing is to the purpose if, when I come back to Judea, I come too late.
That is the thought which has punished me every moment I've spent here.
Will Rome see you again?
Here is a part of my life which you have made for me.
I shall remember it.
Whoever the gods are, they take small interest in an old man's hopes.
They have their way.
Forgive me.
You're a stranger here.
Would you be from Nazareth?
Why do you ask?
I thought you might be the one...
The one that I have come back from my country to find.
He would be about your age.
Who?
When I find Him I shall know Him.
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.
Sack of flesh without brains!
No!
No!
Not the whip!
That is my host.
Gently!
Gently!
Fool!
Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood.
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run!
Go on!
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!
Beautiful horses.
Now!
Now!
They are ready!
Let them go!
Watch.
They'll never hold the turn.
No!
No!
Abadon, stop him!
Stop that whip!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill...!
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!
You think you can treat my horses like animals?
!
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!
Get off, idiot!
Drive goats, not horses!
I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.
Not a team?
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.
- Antares.
- The slow one?
He should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?
In the circus in Rome.
You have driven in the great circus?
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.
No other animal has descended so in scale from the first innocent falling of the world.
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.
Yes.
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.
Your coming here was so fit, so right.
We might have achieved wonders!
You have to go.
I make a journey which will not wait.
Ah, well, then perhaps you will come back.
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.
I have no wives.
No wives at all?
I have six, no, seven.
I've counted eight.
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.
- Someday, I hope to have one.
- One wife!
One God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.
It is not generous.
- Was the food not to your liking?
- Indeed.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.
And now I must say good night to my beauties.
When ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.
- I'll make my farewells then.
- No, no, no, stay.
Stay and see them.
Come, my children.
Come.
Strangers make them shy.
Come.
Come, do not be afraid.
Come.
There, my children.
They are descended from the Arabians of the Pharaohs and I have named them for the stars.
Come, Antares.
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.
What?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.
Come, Rigel.
We've both supped well, and the world is good.
There's my good Rigel.
Yes, you are ready for sleep.
The day's work done for you, eh?
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.
Good night.
Good night, my treasure.
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.
No.
You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.
You should see their mother, Mira.
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.
All right, all right.
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.
You must be strong and swift.
Go, my children.
Go.
At Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams and the champion of the East, Messala, with his black devils.
He stops at nothing to win.
- Messala?
In the circus?
- Yes.
You knew him?
I know him.
Perhaps without much liking.
My people are praying for a man to drive their team to victory over Messala.
You could be that man, the one to stamp his arrogance into the sand.
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.
It's not possible.
That is a pity.
Think of it.
To break his pride to humble this tribune before the very people he has degraded.
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!
I know it is not possible.
Does it not delight your imagination?
Does it not answer your purpose?
I must deal with Messala in my own way.
And your way is to kill him.
I see this terrible thing in your eyes.
But no matter what this man has done, you have no right to kill him.
He will be punished inevitably.
I don't believe in miracles.
But all life is a miracle.
Why will you not accept God's judgment?
You do not believe in miracles.
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness and a star led me to a village called Bethlehem where I found a newborn child in a manger.
And God lived in this child.
By now, He is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.
That is why I have returned here so that I may be at hand when He comes among us.
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.
Perhaps He's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.
Perhaps He is a shepherd a merchant, a fisherman.
But He lives and all our lives from now on will carry His mark.
There are many paths to God, my son.
I hope yours will not be too difficult.
I'm ready for sleep.
Balthasar is a good man but until all men are like him, we must keep our swords bright.
And our intention true.
So I must leave you.
One last thought.
There is no law in the arena.
Many are killed.
I hope to see you again.
Fine Damascus silk.
Fine Damascus silk.
Esther?
It's Judah.
You are alive.
You are alive.
What are you doing here?
What has happened?
I'm here.
I'm with you.
Where's your father?
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.
They tortured him.
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.
You never went back to Antioch?
No.
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.
Where are my mother and sister?
Let me tell him first.
Father.
Father, something wonderful has happened.
Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
He has come home.
He is here.
Judah.
Judah Ben-Hur.
My dear old friend.
Let me look at you.
Let me see you.
Yes, yes.
It is true.
Praise God for His mercy.
Where are they?
Since that terrible day there has been no word of them.
You should have been less loyal.
Do not pity me, Master Judah.
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.
We were released on the same day.
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.
Since then, I have been his tongue and he has been my legs.
Together, we make a considerable man.
Old friend.
She always said you would return.
She never gave up hope.
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.
I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.
But suppose that isn't possible.
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.
They could not make me tell them where it is.
It is there still to put power into our hands and buy death for the Romans.
That's not why I came back.
Judah, they are dead.
Four years.
No one could live so long in the dungeons.
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?
Yes, it is true.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You have come back to us like a returning faith.
Judah, I should like to laugh again.
- Let us laugh.
- We will.
There will be joy again in this house.
We will celebrate among the dust.
I will take him.
We stood here before.
A long while ago.
Four years.
But now it seems as if only yesterday...
I was saying:
"If you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye."
"If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said."
I am not a bride.
Why did you never marry?
My father needed me.
And also...
It's still on my finger.
I said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.
It's become a part of my hand.
If Messala once knew you were here...
As he must.
He will know where they are.
And if you should find...?
- If he says they're dead...
- Messala will wish they were living.
I've seen too much of what hate can do.
My father is burned up with it.
But I've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater and love more powerful than hatred.
I believe it.
- Esther.
- Judah.
Stay alive.
Keep away from Messala.
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.
That time isn't yet come.
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.
This time you will be destroyed.
You'll die.
Tribune, compliments of Quintus Arrius.
He awaits your pleasure.
- Consul here?
- Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.
Thank him.
Bring him to me.
- I didn't know the consul had a son.
- He's a champion of the great circus.
Why is he presenting me with gifts?
- Perhaps he'll race against you.
- Look.
It's magnificent.
And from a man I've never met.
You're wrong, Messala.
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?
You were the magician, Messala.
You condemned me to the galleys.
When my ship was sunk, I saved the consul's life.
You know his seal?
Now I have come back as I swore I would.
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.
You suggest I use it on myself?
What has become of my mother and my sister?
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.
Find them, Messala.
Restore them to me, and I'll forget what I vowed with every stroke of that oar you chained me to.
I am not the governor.
I can do nothing without approval.
Then get it.
I will come back tomorrow.
Don't disappoint me, Messala.
What became of them?
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?
Go to the citadel, Drusus.
Find out.
- And if they're dead?
- They're dead!
"Miriam, wife.
Tirzah, daughter."
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?
E section lower level.
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.
Water.
Water.
Let me out!
- How long since you've seen them?
- Never.
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.
The food disappears.
Lepers.
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.
Then we'll burn out the cell.
Is someone there?
There is someone there.
Who are you?
Don't come any closer.
Who are you?
Esther.
It's Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam?
Stay where you are.
You have come home.
Stand back, Esther.
We are lepers.
Oh, Esther.
Tirzah.
Esther is Judah living?
Yes, he is alive.
He is here.
Where?
He is searching for you now.
I must find him and tell him.
- No!
- Tell my father.
No.
Tell no one.
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.
We won't return.
Judah has to be told.
No.
Please.
I couldn't see his face.
Is it changed?
No, he is not changed.
He's not changed.
You love him, Esther.
Promise me on your love for him you will never tell him you've seen us.
Is he never to know?
Let him remember us as we were.
Promise me.
There's nothing else I can hope for.
Only this.
I promise.
I am content.
Wait.
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.
I pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.
He'll free them.
He wants to survive.
He cannot free them, Judah.
What do you mean?
I saw them.
You saw them?
Where?
When did you see them?
They were dead.
They were dead.
When?
When?
When?
!
In the prison.
When I was waiting for news of my father.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't tell you.
Nor even you, Father.
I was afraid that if you saw Messala...
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.
It's over now.
Over?
- Judah.
- Over?
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.
Gentlemen.
Officers.
Defenders of great Rome's imperium may I enter?
Certainly, sheik.
You do us an unexpected honor.
The noble tribune is most gracious.
And now the question you're asking:
Why am I here?
As you know, I am a gambling man.
The games approach.
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.
I will back my own poor horses.
No limits?
- Mark me first!
- And me!
- What odds?
- A moment, please my lords, protectors of the far flung marshes.
May I first sit down?
Sit.
How much will you wager?
- Yes, let's call his game.
- Give the Arab a seat.
A bench, quickly.
Thank you.
- Now.
- 1000 denarii.
- 2000!
- Mark me!
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient.
There is time.
First gentlemen, the odds.
The tribune has won many times.
The odds should be in the same measure.
What is your pleasure, gentlemen?
Two to one.
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth where is the courage that made Rome master of the world?
I can get better odds on any street market.
Three to one.
Let us not haggle.
Let us be fair.
In four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.
- In all truth...
- Just a moment.
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.
The Prince of Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur.
Prince of Hur?
- He was sent to the galleys years ago.
- He has returned.
Returned?
Lmpossible.
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.
Well?
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.
You, tribune will you give me four to one?
Four to one.
Good.
Four to one, sheik.
The difference between a Roman and a Jew.
Or an Arab.
Bravely spoken.
Now we will settle the amount of our wager.
I will venture...
A thousand talents?
- A thousand talents?
- Yes, a thousand talents.
Of course, if it is too much...
A thousand talents it will be.
Agreed.
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.
You're good fellows.
If only men were this good.
Remember, Altair nine times around the circus.
Aldebaran.
Rigel, did you hear?
Nine lives to live.
My swift fellow.
You must not win the race the first time around.
You win the last time around.
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.
Steady Antares.
Like a rock.
You will be our anchor.
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.
They have taken me into their family.
Rest well, my stars.
Tomorrow we go up to the city.
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it the news will scorch the streets of the Roman world.
Pontius Pilate here?
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.
You will make him see what men are born in this land.
I only know that I race against Messala.
Look for the yoke.
Ease that strap.
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.
Into Your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as You will.
The Star of David.
To shine out for your people and my people together and blind the eyes of Rome.
They are ready.
Easy, girl, easy.
Number five.
Where is number five?
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.
Yes, this is the day.
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.
Hail, Jupiter.
Give me victory.
Watch your line!
Keep your places!
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.
Citizens I welcome you to these games in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.
We dedicate them to his glory and to the glory of Rome of which you are all part.
Let us honor those who race for us today.
They come here from Alexandria Messina Carthage Cyprus Rome Corinth Athens Phrygia and Judea.
To the best of these, a crown of victory.
The race begins.
Hail, Caesar!
Come, my children, come!
The Roman pig!
Salute.
A great victory.
You are the people's one true god for the time being.
Permit us to worship.
I crown their god.
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.
A long life, young Arrius and the good sense to live it.
We cannot wait, tribune.
He will come.
He will...
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.
He will come!
He will come.
I've sent for him, and he will come.
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.
Do you understand?
To hack the legs off me?
Not yet.
Not till I've seen him.
I don't receive him with half a body.
No!
I told you, Drusus.
I told you.
Here he is.
Triumph complete, Judah.
The race won.
The enemy destroyed.
I see no enemy.
What do you think you see?
The smashed body of a wretched animal?
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.
Let me help you.
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.
Dead.
And the race over.
It isn't over, Judah.
They're not dead.
Where are they?
Where are they?
Look for them in the Valley of the Lepers if you can recognize them.
It goes on.
It goes on, Judah.
The race...
The race is not over.
Is there a way down here?
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.
Man.
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.
There are many women.
Of the family of Hur.
We have no names here.
For them?
- Why did you say they were dead?
- It was what they wanted.
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?
Not to see them?
They are coming.
Love them in the way they must need to be loved.
Not to look at them.
Let them be as if you had never come here.
Please!
Is Judah well?
Is he happy?
Yes, he is well.
Your mind can be at rest for him.
He is well, Miriam.
God be with you.
They have gone.
We can go back.
Go back to what?
Judah, they have one blessing left.
To think you remember them as they were and live your own life.
Forget what is here.
Forget?
It's as though they're alive in a grave.
- But what can you do?
- Undo what you've done.
How could you have suffered them to come here?
I must see them.
No, Judah, please!
Judah!
Think, Judah, think.
It would tear them apart if they see you.
He is here.
I have found Him.
The child has become a man.
And the man, I know it now, is the Son of God.
The promise is true.
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.
Life has been answered.
God has answered it.
Come.
Come with me.
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys thirst had nearly killed me.
A man gave me water to drink.
I went on living.
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.
No.
I am thirsty still.
Come and listen.
I have business with Rome.
You insist on death.
Goodbye, Judah.
You sent for me?
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.
- I honor him.
- As you may honor yourself.
You have been made a citizen of Rome.
Do you say nothing to this?
I have just come from the Valley of Stone where my mother and sister live what's left of their lives.
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.
I have heard this.
There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.
Where there is greatness, great government or power even great feeling or compassion error also is great.
We progress and mature by fault.
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.
There are other voices.
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place not to crucify yourself on a shadow such as old resentment or impossible loyalties.
Perfect freedom has no existence.
A grown man knows the world he lives in.
And for the present, the world is Rome.
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.
I am Judah Ben-Hur.
I cross this floor in spoken friendship as I would speak to Arrius.
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar ready to crush those who challenge his authority.
There are too many men of envy and ambition who try to disrupt the government of Rome.
You have become the victor and hero to those people.
They look to you, their one true god, as I call you.
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.
I am already part of this tragedy.
Return this to Arrius.
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you from personal disaster if you stay here.
You are too great a danger.
Leave Judea.
You have my word.
I was afraid you would never come back afraid of what would happen to you.
But I see you again.
Your father's waiting for me.
Where is he?
What do you mean to do?
Rest, sleep.
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.
Peace?
Love and peace.
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?
Where do you see them?
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.
Balthasar's word.
He is more than Balthasar's word.
His voiced traveled with such a still purpose.
It was more than a voice.
A man more than a man.
He said, "Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God."
Children of God?
In that dead valley where we left them?
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean until we have scoured off our bodies the crust and filth of being at the mercy of tyranny.
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.
- In blood?
- Yes, in blood!
I know there is a law in life.
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.
Death generates death as the vulture breeds the vulture.
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:
"Love your enemy.
Do good to those who despitefully use you."
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.
As you make us do now.
Are we to bear nothing together?
Even love?
I can hardly draw breath without feeling you in my heart.
But I know that everything I do from this moment bears greater pain than you have ever suffered.
It is better not to love me.
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy giving evil for evil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.
It's as though you had become Messala.
I've lost you, Judah.
No further.
What are you doing here?
I was here last evening waiting for you.
I have waited all night.
What has happened?
Where is Tirzah?
Leave the food.
I am coming closer.
Don't be afraid.
- What are you doing?
- Don't be afraid.
I've heard Him again, the man from Nazareth.
If ever words were from God, they are in everything He says.
I cannot bear that you should have never known this hand of quiet reaching towards us.
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find Him there.
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find Him.
Tirzah is dying.
Leave the food and go.
It's Judah.
Why did you tell him?
Yes, Judah, yes.
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.
Mother.
Wait, Mother, wait.
Let me talk with you.
Please.
No, no further.
Please.
No, Judah.
Son, no.
Mother, let me see Tirzah.
Tirzah is dying.
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know that life is everlasting and death is nothing to fear if you have faith.
I will take them to Him.
No!
God, no!
No, no, dear son.
Mother where is Tirzah?
Judah, no.
Judah, no.
You must not go to her, dear son.
Please.
Dear son.
I am afraid.
No cause.
The world is more than we know.
Tirzah, it's Judah.
No, Judah.
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
- Why are the streets deserted?
- They have gone to the trial.
Trial?
Whose trial?
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.
- This cannot be true.
- Alms?
What has he done?
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.
Help for the blind.
- Look, lepers!
- Lepers!
Get away!
Stay away!
Go away!
Lepers!
Lepers!
How can this be?
I know this man.
Will someone help Him?
Take pity on Him.
Have mercy.
In His pain this look of peace.
Watch over them, Esther.
We must go back.
I brought you here to this when I hoped...
You haven't failed, Esther.
Hail King of the Jews!
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.
He gave me water and a heart to live.
What has He done to merit this?
He has taken the world of our sins onto Himself.
To this end He said He was born in that stable where I first saw Him.
For this cause, He came into the world.
For this death?
This beginning.
I have lived too long.
As though He were carrying in that cross the pain of the world.
So fearful, and yet why is it I'm not afraid anymore?
The shadow of a storm.
A strange darkness but still day.
His life is over.
What is it?
This tearing.
I am in pain.
I feel it too.
Do you see your hand?
Almost at the moment He died I heard Him say, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do."
Even then.
Even then.
And I felt His voice take the sword out of my hand.
In the year of our Lord Judea, for nearly a century, had lain under the mastery of Rome.
In the seventh year of the reign of Augustus Caesar an imperial decree ordered every Judean each to return to his place of birth to be counted and taxed.
Converging ways of many of them led to their capital city, Jerusalem the troubled heart of their land.
The old city was dominated by the fortress of Antonia the seat of Roman power and by the great golden temple the outward sign of an inward and imperishable faith.
Even while they obeyed the will of Caesar the people clung proudly to their ancient heritage always remembering the promise of their prophets that one day there would be born among them a redeemer to bring them salvation and perfect freedom.
You'll be counted at Hebron.
- Name?
- Samuel.
- What city?
- Joppa.
- What family?
- Michael.
- Move on.
Move on.
- Yes.
- Name?
- Joseph.
- What city?
- Nazareth.
- What family?
- David of Bethlehem.
And the woman?
My wife.
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.
Come on, come on.
What village is this?
Nazareth.
We should arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow night.
You're not watching the soldiers, Joseph?
We've seen Romans before.
Yes and we will see them again.
My table is not finished.
Where is your son?
He's walking in the hills.
He neglects his work, Joseph.
No.
Once, I reproached him with forgetting his work.
He said to me:
"I must be about my father's business."
Then why isn't he here, working?
He's working.
Trumpeters of the legion!
Welcome, Messala.
The command is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for relieving me.
Drusus when I was a boy, I dreamed of commanding this garrison.
Now the wheel has turned.
I am in command.
Attention!
Aisle one, face right!
Forward!
I'd forgotten the heat.
If it were only the heat.
I lived here until I was 14.
Jerusalem was my home.
- My father was head of...
- Yes, I know.
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.
If there can be such a thing in this forsaken land.
If you want to rise, Sextus, do the difficult.
I asked to be sent here.
You'll find the people changed since you were a boy.
In what way?
Oh, won't pay their taxes, an irrational resentment of Rome...
There's nothing new in all that.
And then there's religion.
I tell you, they're drunk with religion.
They smash the statues of our gods, even those of the emperor.
Punish them.
We do.
When we can find them.
Find the leaders.
You don't know.
There's nothing you can put your finger on.
There are strange forces at work here.
This "messiah" business...
I know.
There was one predicted when I was a boy.
A king of the Jews, who will lead them into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.
Makes your head spin.
There's a wild man in the desert named John who drowns people in water.
And a carpenter's son who does magic tricks. "Miracles" they call them.
There's always a rabble-rouser stirring up trouble.
No, no, no.
This man is different.
He teaches that God is near, in every man.
It's actually quite profound, some of it.
You've been too long away from Rome.
Go back, Sextus.
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea and forget that God is in every man.
- There is divinity in only one man.
- Yes, I know.
The emperor is displeased.
He wishes Judea made into a more obedient and disciplined province.
He's ordered me to restore order.
I shall carry out his wishes.
How?
You can break a man's skull, arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.
But how do you control this?
How do you fight an idea?
Especially a new idea.
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.
I assume he has a name.
- He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
- Then treat him like one!
Tell him I will join him.
Yes, tribune.
Centurion!
This was his country before it was ours.
Don't forget that.
Yes, tribune.
Very wise.
This Ben-Hur is the richest man in Jerusalem.
And the head of one of the greatest families in Judea.
We were friends as boys.
We were like brothers.
Sextus you ask how to fight an idea.
Well, I'll tell you how.
With another idea.
I said I'd come back.
I never thought you would.
I'm so glad.
- Look at you.
- Look at you!
You've come back a tribune.
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.
We'll drink another now.
- Your sister and mother?
- They're fine.
They've talked of you ever since we knew you were coming.
- Is Tirzah married?
- No.
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.
She's been in love with you since she was 5.
I can't wait to see them.
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?
Or have you become too dignified?
- Down Eros, up Mars!
- Down Eros, up Mars!
Where the beams cross?
Good.
After all these years!
Still close.
In every way.
I hope so.
I know.
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew whose life you once saved.
The best thing I ever did.
Judah it will be very difficult to govern here.
I'm going to need help.
Your help.
Your advice.
- You want my advice?
- Yes, I do.
Withdraw your legions.
Give us our freedom.
Unfortunately, the emperor is devoted to his empire.
He's particularly fond of Judea.
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.
Is there anything so sad as unrequited love?
My quarters.
A bit grim.
Not grim.
Austere.
Virtuous.
Roman.
I'm going to be second-in-command to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.
He's coming in a few days with more legions.
Then the rumors are true.
The emperor does not approve of your countrymen.
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.
But you and your family need have no concern.
I'm next in authority to the governor, and you're my friend.
- I'm a Jew.
- Ah, you are like a Roman!
What have you in common with the troublemaking rabble?
- They're my people.
I'm one of them.
- Be wise, Judah.
It's a Roman world.
If you want to live in it, you must become part of it.
You've changed.
I've grown up.
I've seen the world since I left Jerusalem.
I've seen Rome.
It's no accident that one small village on the Tiber was chosen to rule the world.
Your legions.
It wasn't just our legions.
Other countries have armies, fine armies.
I know, I fought them.
Oh, no.
No, it was fate that chose us to civilize the world.
And we have.
Our roads and ships connect every corner of the earth.
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.
I believe in the future of my people.
Of course you do.
And you can help them.
How?
You're an aristocrat.
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince to your people.
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.
They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.
Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.
It is worse than stupid, futile!
For it can end in only one way, extinction for your people!
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.
Then we're agreed!
Now, when can I come to see your family?
- We had hoped tomorrow.
- Good.
And now for our toast.
It's dreadful wine, by the way.
It's especially fermented for the Roman army.
You're very cruel to your conquerors.
It's an insane world.
But in it there is one sanity:
The loyalty of old friends.
Judah, we must believe in one another.
Will you drink to that?
With all my heart.
Here it is, the place I've remembered.
The court where we played at changing the guard.
The roof where we'd throw pebbles at people in the street and then hide.
- We were rascals, weren't we?
- No, you were good boys.
I would have that time again.
And here it is.
Nothing has changed.
Except for the fountain.
- The old well would go dry, remember?
- Promptly, every summer.
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.
- He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
- No?
Of course he has.
He was a boy when he left us, now he's a man.
With great responsibilities.
Come.
The emperor builds and builds, turning brick to marble.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.
I've never seen anything like this before.
It's beautiful!
- Is it Roman?
- It's Libyan.
I was there last year.
A tremendous campaign.
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.
Or was, till we destroyed it.
Now it's nothing but ashes.
I'm boring you with soldier stories.
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.
Thank you for this.
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.
What do you think of it?
Magnificent.
It's Arabic.
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.
Let me try him sometime.
Whenever you like.
He's yours.
Do you mean you'll give me this?
Oh, Judah.
You are good.
It's going to be like old times, I know it.
Judah, tell me, did you think about what I said?
Yes.
Talked to a number of people already.
Spoken against violence, against incidents.
Most of the men agree with me.
Most?
Not all?
No, not all.
Who does not agree?
Well, the resentful, the impatient.
Who are they?
Yes, Judah.
Who are they?
Would I retain your friendship if I became an informer?
Telling the names of criminals is not informing.
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.
Patriots?
!
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.
This is my great opportunity, and yours too.
If I bring order here, I can have any post I want.
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?
Rome!
Yes, perhaps at the side of Caesar himself.
I mean it.
It can happen and this is the moment.
I swear, this is the time.
The emperor is watching us, judging us.
All I need do is serve him.
And all you need do is help me serve him.
- You speak as if he were God.
- He is God.
The only God.
He is power, real power on earth, not...
Not that.
Help me, Judah.
I would do anything for you, Messala except betray my own people.
In the name of all the gods, what do the lives of a few Jews mean to you?
If I cannot persuade them, that does not mean I would help you murder them.
Besides, you must understand this, Messala.
I believe in the past and future of my people.
Future?
You are a conquered people.
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?
Joshua will not rise again to save you nor David.
There is only one reality in the world today.
Look to the West.
Don't be a fool!
Look to Rome!
Better a fool than a traitor or a killer.
- I am a soldier.
- Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.
- I warn you...
- No!
I warn you.
Rome is an affront to God.
Rome is strangling my people and my country, the whole earth!
But not forever.
And I tell you, the day Rome falls there will be a shout of freedom such as the world has never heard before.
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.
You're either for me or against me.
If that is the choice then I am against you.
There they are.
Where's Messala?
- Where's...?
- He's gone.
Gone?
- But why?
- He couldn't stay.
- What happened?
- A new tribune must have many duties.
Come.
Let us have dinner.
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the world who bringeth to us bread from the earth.
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.
He wanted to use me to betray our people.
- Master, the caravan from Antioch.
- Yes, Amrah, I saw.
Simonides.
- Oh, welcome homecoming.
- Master.
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.
And for the master, lberian wine.
Not to mention the best gift of all, your presence.
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.
- Caravans from Petra.
- Have all arrived.
- Good.
- Here is the accounting.
And what of Numidia?
The trade route is ours, guaranteed by treaty with the king.
Once a year, you bring your accounting.
And once a year, I find myself wealthier.
Yeah, but my greatest treasure is my steward.
My life belongs to the House of Hur.
Nothing else exists for me, except my daughter.
- She must be a young woman by now.
- Yes, and your property.
She was born the daughter of your slave.
When I inherited you, I inherited a friend, not a slave.
Still, Esther has come with me from Antioch for your permission to marry.
It's granted.
I wish you the joy of many grandchildren.
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.
With your permission, Esther wishes to speak to her master.
You're eager to marry, Esther?
It is my father's wish.
Your husband will be fortunate.
What is his name?
David, son of Mathias.
Of what house?
- His own, master.
- He is a freeman.
Tell me more about him.
I have seen him only once.
He is a merchant, well-thought-of in Antioch.
He will pay for Esther's freedom.
Her freedom will be my wedding gift to Esther.
You are generous, master.
Do you love this man?
I will learn to love him.
You have my permission to marry.
We'll drink to your happiness.
And a safe return to Antioch.
I disturbed you.
No.
What were you thinking?
I was saying goodbye to this city and this house.
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?
My father sometimes brought me here when I was little.
It was a house where I was always happy.
Except once.
When you and your friend, the Roman boy...
- Messala.
- Yes.
You had been out hunting and they brought you home injured.
I touched your face as you lay there and prayed to God, "Don't let this boy die."
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.
Yes, master.
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.
It's strange.
I hardly felt a slave.
And now I hardly feel free.
You know, in the old, wise days of Solomon if there was among his slaves some girl who filled his eyes he could choose her out from the rest and take her to him.
Wise days of Solomon.
Different days.
And long ago.
If you were not a bride I should kiss you goodbye.
If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said.
Your slave ring.
Fair exchange.
Freedom to you.
The ring to me.
You will wear it?
Until you meet the woman you will marry?
Until then.
The gods favor my lord Gratus.
If it is the governor's pleasure, the wreath of office.
Thank you, tribune.
I see no delegation from the city.
- There will not be one, sir.
- No?
Jerusalem's welcome will not be a warm one.
But I pledge, my lord, it will be a quiet one.
Let us proceed.
There's Messala.
He saw you, Judah.
The new governor.
Stand back!
- Stand back.
- You, come!
Had to be the Jews!
Open up in the name of the divine emperor!
Judah!
Tirzah!
What is it?
What's happened?
Open up in the name of the law!
- I was watching the...
- A tile fell and struck the governor.
- It wasn't my fault.
- They won't believe her.
She won't have to say anything.
You hear?
Tirzah, say nothing.
Open the gates!
I'll speak to them.
- Arrest him!
- Let me tell you what happened.
- Hold those women.
- Stop them!
It was an accident.
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.
- This is the man, sir.
We saw him.
- It was an accident.
- Accident?
- I swear it.
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose.
It gave way.
Take him.
Take all of them.
- He's telling the truth!
- It was me!
Let them go!
Attention!
Messala.
In the name of God, tell them it's a mistake.
I leaned on the tile, and it broke loose.
It was an accident.
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!
Let the servants go.
Let them go.
Return to your ranks.
Come.
Where?
Tirus.
Tirus?
I've had no trial.
I'm to die in the galleys without even a trial?
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!
Wait.
My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?
Tie his hands.
- At least tell me if they're safe.
- I can tell you nothing.
Get along.
Keep moving.
Jailer!
Guard, in there!
Up the stairs!
Jailer!
Jailer!
To the right.
- Wait!
- Send them out.
Go!
The door.
Where are my mother and sister?
Where are they?
Here, within these walls.
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.
Of course, they will be sentenced.
Is it possible?
Is it possible you could do this to us?
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?
You will let them go.
You will gladly let them go!
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not a murderer!
I know you're not.
You know?
You are evil.
No, Judah, I am not evil.
I wanted your help.
Now you've given it to me.
By making this example of you, I discourage treason.
By condemning without hesitation an old friend, I shall be feared.
But not my family.
Let them go.
Please.
- Messala, I beg you.
- Beg?
!
Didn't I beg you?
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.
Kill me, and your mother and sister will die nailed to crosses in front of you!
Go on, Judah.
Kill me!
May God grant me vengeance.
I will pray that you live till I return.
Return?
Take him.
Sentries, salute.
The tribune will see you now.
Tribune, I'm steward of the House of Hur.
I remember you.
We were on our way to Antioch when we heard what had happened.
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done this thing.
You knew him, tribune.
Better than you.
Then there must be no doubt in your mind, the charge is groundless.
The prisoners have been sentenced.
- Sentenced?
- But there's no truth in it.
There was never a threat against the governor in Judah's mind.
Surely you must know he would never have done this.
In your heart, you must know it.
Drusus.
This man had better be kept here until we can question him.
Hold!
Water for the soldiers.
Soldiers first!
Get away from that well.
No water for them!
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!
Come on, you!
Water for the horses!
- Water.
Water.
- Soldiers first!
Here.
Wait.
No water for him.
God help me.
You!
I said no water for him!
All right, on your feet, all of you!
Get them on their feet!
Back in line, you dog!
On your feet!
Get them going!
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!
Forward, you dogs!
Soon, the counselor's barge will be coming alongside.
Be ready to raise oars.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.
- How many rowers?
- Two hundred, consul.
- And reliefs?
- Of 30, every hour.
This man is ill.
Replace him.
- Change him.
- Right, sir.
- This man's been giving you trouble?
- He's insubordinate, consul.
That will stop.
What service have you seen?
Forty-one.
A month's less a day in this ship.
You keep an exact account.
And before?
Three years in other ships.
Three years.
You have the spirit to fight back but the good sense to control it.
Your eyes are full of hate, 41.
That's good.
Hate keeps a man alive.
It gives him strength.
Now, listen to me, all of you.
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
So row well and live.
- Ship ready, consul.
- Strike oars.
Strike oars!
You know a fleet of Macedonian galleys has been raiding Roman commerce.
The emperor has honored us with the task of seeking out and destroying them.
Battle speed, hortator.
Battle speed!
Attack speed.
Attack speed!
Ramming speed.
Ramming speed!
Rest.
Halt!
Rest!
Why are you here?
I was ordered to report to you during my relief.
Oh, yes.
I'd forgotten.
You could have killed me as I lay there.
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?
I'm not ready to die.
What do you think will save you?
The God of my fathers.
Your God has forsaken you.
He has no more power than the images I pray to.
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.
I might.
Does that interest you, 41?
I can see that it does.
I'm a fighting man by profession, and in my leisure moments it amuses me to train fighting men.
I own some of the best gladiators and charioteers in Rome.
Would you like to become one of them?
To die as your slave?
Better than to live in chains below these decks.
I will not be here forever.
No?
What would you do if you escaped?
Two people were condemned with me, my mother and sister though they were innocent.
I won't rest...
Do not say that you were innocent.
- Would it do any good to say it again?
- No.
Consider my offer carefully.
You will never escape while we are victorious.
If we are not, you will sink with this ship, chained to your oar.
I cannot believe that God has let me live these years to die chained to an oar.
It's a strange, stubborn faith you keep to believe that existence has a purpose.
A sane man would have learned to lose it long before this.
As you have.
What drove it out of you?
Go back to your oar, 41.
Consul, enemy sighted.
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.
All the watch to battle posts.
- Stand by to load.
- Make ready to fire.
Hurry, quick!
Hurry up with that resin.
Get some more ammunition.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
Chain rowers!
Guard.
Unlock 41.
No!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
41, why did he do that?
I don't know.
Once before, a man helped me.
I didn't know why then.
Normal speed!
Number 1, flame.
Fire.
Fire!
Fire!
Hold withdrawal on command.
Lift oars!
Raise!
Withdraw!
Steersman, right.
Extend oars!
Fire!
- Watch out!
- Fire!
Steersman, ram course!
Order below!
- Ramming speed!
- Ramming speed!
Consul, barge on ramming course.
We're going to be rammed!
We're going to be rammed!
Why did you save me?
Why did you have me unchained?
What is your name, 41?
Judah Ben-Hur. ...let me die.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
Row well and live.
Is the sail square?
I can't tell.
Better for us both if it's the enemy.
My death.
Your freedom.
It's a Roman sail.
Face rear!
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.
Water.
The fleet, all lost?
Five galleys.
- And the battle?
- The battle was won.
You have a victory.
- It was a victory?
- Complete.
In His eagerness to save you your God has also saved the Roman fleet.
Hail Arrius!
Right oars!
You have cleared the seaways of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.
This baton of victory has been nobly won.
This man riding beside you, who is he?
The man who saved me, divine emperor, to return and serve you.
Is that all you know about him?
No.
He was accused of an attack on the governor of Judea.
But he was innocent.
If not, there's a strange inconsistency in this man who tries to kill my governor, yet saves the life of my consul.
Come tomorrow.
We'll talk of it.
We have all the information on this man a man of some influence in his own country.
His attack upon our governor is one upon the senate and the people of Rome.
I am convinced that no such attack was intended.
Consul, allow us to continue.
Allow us to be generous.
As a reward to you for your great victory we shall not send him back to the galleys.
Take him as your slave.
Such is the will of the senate and the people of Rome.
Not long ago, I returned to Rome with a young man who had saved my life.
You all know him as the finest charioteer in Rome.
Five times, he's driven my horses to victory.
I know him as one who stands in the place of the son I lost.
I have the love and pride in a son's achievements which I thought I should never have again.
Nothing could make stronger our bond but tonight I wish to share it with you all.
The formalities of adoption have been completed.
Young Arrius is now the legal bearer of my name and the heir to my property.
This ring of my ancestors would have gone to my son.
So now it is yours.
It's a strange destiny that brought me to a new life a new home a new father.
It brought me here.
It may take me away.
But wherever I may be I shall always try to wear this ring as a son of Arrius should.
With gratitude and affection and with honor.
My old friend Pontius Pilate, young Arrius.
Before you came to this city, my horses always won.
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.
Yes, but not swift enough to defeat you.
- Tell me, you come from Judea?
- Yes, sir.
I hear that the climate is difficult to live in.
Not for Judeans.
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.
- Of Judea?
- Yes.
I asked for Alexandria.
But it seems the wilderness needs my particular talents.
The scorpions and holy prophets can't get on without me.
Lay the dust of Judea, at least for this evening.
Goats and Jehovah.
You're leaving.
I must.
It's a journey I can't keep you from.
Your eyes have never left it all these months.
I can recognize pain.
But still, my counsel is to wait.
Gratus is to be replaced.
The governorship goes to Pontius Pilate.
When?
Very soon.
It's very much to our purpose.
Nothing is to the purpose if, when I come back to Judea, I come too late.
That is the thought which has punished me every moment I've spent here.
Will Rome see you again?
Here is a part of my life which you have made for me.
I shall remember it.
Whoever the gods are, they take small interest in an old man's hopes.
They have their way.
Forgive me.
You're a stranger here.
Would you be from Nazareth?
Why do you ask?
I thought you might be the one...
The one that I have come back from my country to find.
He would be about your age.
Who?
When I find Him I shall know Him.
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.
Sack of flesh without brains!
No!
No!
Not the whip!
That is my host.
Gently!
Gently!
Fool!
Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood.
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run!
Go on!
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!
Beautiful horses.
Now!
Now!
They are ready!
Let them go!
Watch.
They'll never hold the turn.
No!
No!
Abadon, stop him!
Stop that whip!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill...!
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!
You think you can treat my horses like animals?
!
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!
Get off, idiot!
Drive goats, not horses!
I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.
Not a team?
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.
- Antares.
- The slow one?
He should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?
In the circus in Rome.
You have driven in the great circus?
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.
No other animal has descended so in scale from the first innocent falling of the world.
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.
Yes.
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.
Your coming here was so fit, so right.
We might have achieved wonders!
You have to go.
I make a journey which will not wait.
Ah, well, then perhaps you will come back.
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.
I have no wives.
No wives at all?
I have six, no, seven.
I've counted eight.
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.
- Someday, I hope to have one.
- One wife!
One God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.
It is not generous.
- Was the food not to your liking?
- Indeed.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.
And now I must say good night to my beauties.
When ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.
- I'll make my farewells then.
- No, no, no, stay.
Stay and see them.
Come, my children.
Come.
Strangers make them shy.
Come.
Come, do not be afraid.
Come.
There, my children.
They are descended from the Arabians of the Pharaohs and I have named them for the stars.
Come, Antares.
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.
What?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.
Come, Rigel.
We've both supped well, and the world is good.
There's my good Rigel.
Yes, you are ready for sleep.
The day's work done for you, eh?
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.
Good night.
Good night, my treasure.
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.
No.
You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.
You should see their mother, Mira.
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.
All right, all right.
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.
You must be strong and swift.
Go, my children.
Go.
At Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams and the champion of the East, Messala, with his black devils.
He stops at nothing to win.
- Messala?
In the circus?
- Yes.
You knew him?
I know him.
Perhaps without much liking.
My people are praying for a man to drive their team to victory over Messala.
You could be that man, the one to stamp his arrogance into the sand.
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.
It's not possible.
That is a pity.
Think of it.
To break his pride to humble this tribune before the very people he has degraded.
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!
I know it is not possible.
Does it not delight your imagination?
Does it not answer your purpose?
I must deal with Messala in my own way.
And your way is to kill him.
I see this terrible thing in your eyes.
But no matter what this man has done, you have no right to kill him.
He will be punished inevitably.
I don't believe in miracles.
But all life is a miracle.
Why will you not accept God's judgment?
You do not believe in miracles.
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness and a star led me to a village called Bethlehem where I found a newborn child in a manger.
And God lived in this child.
By now, He is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.
That is why I have returned here so that I may be at hand when He comes among us.
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.
Perhaps He's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.
Perhaps He is a shepherd a merchant, a fisherman.
But He lives and all our lives from now on will carry His mark.
There are many paths to God, my son.
I hope yours will not be too difficult.
I'm ready for sleep.
Balthasar is a good man but until all men are like him, we must keep our swords bright.
And our intention true.
So I must leave you.
One last thought.
There is no law in the arena.
Many are killed.
I hope to see you again.
Fine Damascus silk.
Fine Damascus silk.
Esther?
It's Judah.
You are alive.
You are alive.
What are you doing here?
What has happened?
I'm here.
I'm with you.
Where's your father?
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.
They tortured him.
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.
You never went back to Antioch?
No.
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.
Where are my mother and sister?
Let me tell him first.
Father.
Father, something wonderful has happened.
Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
He has come home.
He is here.
Judah.
Judah Ben-Hur.
My dear old friend.
Let me look at you.
Let me see you.
Yes, yes.
It is true.
Praise God for His mercy.
Where are they?
Since that terrible day there has been no word of them.
You should have been less loyal.
Do not pity me, Master Judah.
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.
We were released on the same day.
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.
Since then, I have been his tongue and he has been my legs.
Together, we make a considerable man.
Old friend.
She always said you would return.
She never gave up hope.
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.
I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.
But suppose that isn't possible.
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.
They could not make me tell them where it is.
It is there still to put power into our hands and buy death for the Romans.
That's not why I came back.
Judah, they are dead.
Four years.
No one could live so long in the dungeons.
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?
Yes, it is true.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You have come back to us like a returning faith.
Judah, I should like to laugh again.
- Let us laugh.
- We will.
There will be joy again in this house.
We will celebrate among the dust.
I will take him.
We stood here before.
A long while ago.
Four years.
But now it seems as if only yesterday...
I was saying:
"If you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye."
"If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said."
I am not a bride.
Why did you never marry?
My father needed me.
And also...
It's still on my finger.
I said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.
It's become a part of my hand.
If Messala once knew you were here...
As he must.
He will know where they are.
And if you should find...?
- Lf he says they're dead...
- Messala will wish they were living.
I've seen too much of what hate can do.
My father is burned up with it.
But I've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater and love more powerful than hatred.
I believe it.
- Esther.
- Judah.
Stay alive.
Keep away from Messala.
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.
That time isn't yet come.
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.
This time you will be destroyed.
You'll die.
Tribune, compliments of Quintus Arrius.
He awaits your pleasure.
- Consul here?
- Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.
Thank him.
Bring him to me.
- I didn't know the consul had a son.
- He's a champion of the great circus.
Why is he presenting me with gifts?
- Perhaps he'll race against you.
- Look.
It's magnificent.
And from a man I've never met.
You're wrong, Messala.
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?
You were the magician, Messala.
You condemned me to the galleys.
When my ship was sunk, I saved the consul's life.
You know his seal?
Now I have come back as I swore I would.
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.
You suggest I use it on myself?
What has become of my mother and my sister?
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.
Find them, Messala.
Restore them to me, and I'll forget what I vowed with every stroke of that oar you chained me to.
I am not the governor.
I can do nothing without approval.
Then get it.
I will come back tomorrow.
Don't disappoint me, Messala.
What became of them?
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?
Go to the citadel, Drusus.
Find out.
- And if they're dead?
- They're dead!
"Miriam, wife.
Tirzah, daughter."
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?
E section lower level.
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.
Water.
Water.
Let me out!
- How long since you've seen them?
- Never.
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.
The food disappears.
Lepers.
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.
Then we'll burn out the cell.
Is someone there?
There is someone there.
Who are you?
Don't come any closer.
Who are you?
Esther.
It's Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam?
Stay where you are.
You have come home.
Stand back, Esther.
We are lepers.
Oh, Esther.
Tirzah.
Esther is Judah living?
Yes, he is alive.
He is here.
Where?
He is searching for you now.
I must find him and tell him.
- No!
- Tell my father.
No.
Tell no one.
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.
We won't return.
Judah has to be told.
No.
Please.
I couldn't see his face.
Is it changed?
No, he is not changed.
He's not changed.
You love him, Esther.
Promise me on your love for him you will never tell him you've seen us.
Is he never to know?
Let him remember us as we were.
Promise me.
There's nothing else I can hope for.
Only this.
I promise.
I am content.
Wait.
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.
I pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.
He'll free them.
He wants to survive.
He cannot free them, Judah.
What do you mean?
I saw them.
You saw them?
Where?
When did you see them?
They were dead.
They were dead.
When?
When?
When?
!
In the prison.
When I was waiting for news of my father.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't tell you.
Nor even you, Father.
I was afraid that if you saw Messala...
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.
It's over now.
Over?
- Judah.
- Over?
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.
Gentlemen.
Officers.
Defenders of great Rome's imperium...
... mayI enter?
Certainly, sheik.
You do us an unexpected honor.
The noble tribune is most gracious.
And now...
... thequestionyou'reasking:
Why am I here?
As you know, I am a gambling man.
The games approach.
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.
I will back my own poor horses.
No limits?
-Mark me first!
-And me!
-What odds?
-A moment, please...
... mylords,protectors of the far flung marshes.
May I first sit down?
Sit.
How much will you wager?
-Yes, let's call his game.
-Give the Arab a seat.
A bench, quickly.
Thank you.
-Now.
-1 000 denarii.
-2000!
-Mark me!
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient.
There is time.
First gentlemen, the odds.
The tribune has won many times.
The odds should be in the same measure.
What is your pleasure, gentlemen?
Two to one.
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth...
... whereisthecourage that made Rome master of the world?
I can get better odds on any street market.
Three to one.
Let us not haggle.
Let us be fair.
ln four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.
-ln all truth--
-Just a moment.
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.
The Prince of Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur.
Prince of Hur?
-He was sent to the galleys years ago.
-He has returned.
Returned?
lmpossible.
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.
Well?
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.
You, tribune...
... willyougivemefour toone?
Four to one.
Good.
Four to one, sheik.
The difference between a Roman and a Jew.
Or an Arab.
Bravely spoken.
Now we will settle the amount of our wager. I will venture... .
A thousand talents?
-A thousand talents?
-Yes, a thousand talents.
Of course, if it is too much... .
A thousand talents it will be.
Agreed.
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.
You're good fellows.
If only men were this good.
Remember, Altair...
... ninetimesaroundthe circus.
Aldebaran.
Rigel, did you hear?
Nine lives to live.
My swift fellow.
You must not win the race the first time around.
You win the last time around.
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.
Steady Antares.
Like a rock.
You will be our anchor.
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.
They have taken me into their family.
Rest well, my stars.
Tomorrow we go up to the city.
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it...
... thenewswillscorchthestreets of the Roman world.
Pontius Pilate here?
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.
You will make him see what men are born in this land.
I only know that I race against Messala.
Look for the yoke.
Ease that strap.
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.
into Your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as You will.
The Star of David.
To shine out for your people and my people together...
... andblindtheeyesofRome.
They are ready.
Easy, girl, easy.
Number five.
Where is number five?
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.
Yes, this is the day.
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.
Hail, Jupiter.
Give me victory.
Watch your line!
Keep your places!
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.
Citizens...
... Iwelcomeyoutothesegames in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.
We dedicate them to his glory...
... andtothegloryofRome...
... ofwhichyouare all part.
Let us honor those who race for us today.
They come here from Alexandria...
... Messina...
... Carthage...
... Cyprus...
... Rome...
... Corinth...
... Athens...
... Phrygia...
... andJudea.
To the best of these, a crown of victory.
The race begins.
Hail, Caesar!
Come, my children, come!
The Roman pig!
Salute.
A great victory.
You are the people's one true god...
... forthetimebeing.
Permit us to worship.
I crown their god.
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.
A long life, young Arrius and the good sense to live it.
We cannot wait, tribune.
He will come.
He will--
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.
He will come!
He will come.
I've sent for him, and he will come.
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.
Do you understand?
To hack the legs off me?
Not yet.
Not till I've seen him.
I don't receive him with half a body.
No!
I told you, Drusus. I told you.
Here he is.
Triumph complete, Judah.
The race won.
The enemy destroyed.
I see no enemy.
What do you think you see?
The smashed body of a wretched animal?
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.
Let me help you.
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.
Dead.
And the race over.
It isn't over, Judah.
They're not dead.
Where are they?
Where are they?
Look for them...
... intheValleyoftheLepers...
... ifyoucanrecognizethem .
It goes on.
It goes on, Judah.
The race... .
The race is not over.
ls there a way down here?
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.
Man.
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.
There are many women.
Of the family of Hur.
We have no names here.
For them?
-Why did you say they were dead?
-lt was what they wanted.
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?
Not to see them?
They are coming.
Love them in the way they must need to be loved.
Not to look at them.
Let them be as if you had never come here.
Please!
ls Judah well?
ls he happy?
Yes, he is well.
Your mind can be at rest for him.
He is well, Miriam.
God be with you.
They have gone.
We can go back.
Go back to what?
Judah, they have one blessing left.
To think you remember them as they were...
... andliveyourown life.
Forget what is here.
Forget?
It's as though they're alive in a grave.
-But what can you do?
-Undo what you've done.
How could you have suffered them to come here?
I must see them.
No, Judah, please!
Judah!
Think, Judah, think. lt would tear them apart if they see you.
He is here. I have found Him.
The child has become a man.
And the man, I know it now, is the Son of God.
The promise is true.
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.
Life has been answered.
God has answered it.
Come.
Come with me.
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys...
... thirsthadnearlykilledme.
A man gave me water to drink.
I went on living.
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.
No.
I am thirsty still.
Come and listen.
I have business with Rome.
You insist on death.
Goodbye, Judah.
You sent for me?
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.
-l honor him.
-As you may honor yourself.
You have been made a citizen of Rome.
Do you say nothing to this?
I have just come from the Valley of Stone...
... wheremymotherand sisterlive what's left of their lives.
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.
I have heard this.
There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.
Where there is greatness, great government or power...
... evengreatfeelingorcompassion...
... erroralsois great.
We progress and mature by fault.
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.
There are other voices.
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place...
... nottocrucifyyourself on a shadow such as old resentment...
... orimpossibleloyalties.
Perfect freedom has no existence.
A grown man knows the world he lives in.
And for the present, the world is Rome.
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.
I am Judah Ben-Hur.
I cross this floor in spoken friendship...
... asI wouldspeaktoArrius.
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar...
... readytocrushthose who challenge his authority.
There are too many men of envy and ambition...
... whotryto disrupt the government of Rome.
You have become the victor and hero to those people.
They look to you, their one true god, as I call you.
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.
I am already part of this tragedy.
Return this to Arrius.
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you...
... frompersonaldisaster if you stay here.
You are too great a danger.
Leave Judea.
You have my word.
I was afraid you would never come back...
... afraidofwhatwouldhappentoyou .
But I see you again.
Your father's waiting for me.
Where is he?
What do you mean to do?
Rest, sleep.
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.
Peace?
Love and peace.
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?
Where do you see them?
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.
Balthasar's word.
He is more than Balthasar's word.
His voiced traveled with such a still purpose.
It was more than a voice.
A man more than a man.
He said, "Blessed are the merciful...
... fortheyshallobtainmercy.
Blessed are the peacemakers...
... fortheyshallbecalled the children of God. "
Children of God?
ln that dead valley where we left them?
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean...
... untilwehavescouredoff our bodies the crust and filth...
... ofbeingat themercyoftyranny.
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.
-ln blood?
-Yes, in blood!
I know there is a law in life.
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.
Death generates death...
... asthevulturebreedsthevulture.
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:
"Love your enemy.
Do good to those who despitefully use you. "
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.
As you make us do now.
Are we to bear nothing together?
Even love?
I can hardly draw breath...
... withoutfeelingyouinmyheart .
But I know...
... thateverythingIdo from this moment...
... bearsgreaterpain than you have ever suffered.
It is better not to love me.
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy...
... givingevilforevil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.
It's as though you had become Messala.
I've lost you, Judah.
No further.
What are you doing here?
I was here last evening waiting for you.
I have waited all night.
What has happened?
Where is Tirzah?
Leave the food.
I am coming closer.
Don't be afraid.
-What are you doing?
-Don't be afraid.
I've heard Him again, the man from Nazareth.
If ever words were from God, they are in everything He says.
I cannot bear that you should have never known...
... thishandof quiet reaching towards us.
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find Him there.
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find Him.
Tirzah is dying.
Leave the food and go.
It's Judah.
Why did you tell him?
Yes, Judah, yes.
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.
Mother.
Wait, Mother, wait.
Let me talk with you.
Please.
No, no further.
Please.
No, Judah.
Son, no.
Mother, let me see Tirzah.
Tirzah is dying.
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know...
... thatlifeis everlasting...
... anddeathis nothingtofear if you have faith.
I will take them to Him.
No!
God, no!
No, no, dear son.
Mother...
... whereisTirzah?
Judah, no.
Judah, no.
You must not go to her, dear son.
Please.
Dear son.
I am afraid.
No cause.
The world is more than we know.
Tirzah, it's Judah.
No, Judah.
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
-Why are the streets deserted?
-They have gone to the trial.
Trial?
Whose trial?
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.
-This cannot be true.
-Alms?
What has he done?
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.
Help for the blind.
-Look, lepers!
-Lepers!
Get away!
Stay away!
Go away!
Lepers!
Lepers!
How can this be?
I know this man.
Will someone help Him?
Take pity on Him.
Have mercy.
ln His pain...
... thislookof peace.
Watch over them, Esther.
We must go back.
I brought you here to this...
... whenI hoped... .
You haven't failed, Esther.
Hail King of the Jews!
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.
He gave me water...
... anda heartto live.
What has He done to merit this?
He has taken the world of our sins onto Himself.
To this end He said He was born...
... inthatstable...
... wherel firstsawHim .
For this cause, He came into the world.
For this death?
This beginning.
I have lived too long.
As though He were carrying in that cross...

So fearful, and yet why is it...

The shadow of a storm.

I am in pain.
I feel it too.
Do you see your hand?
Almost at the moment He died...

Even then.
And I felt His voice take the sword out of my hand.

In the year of our Lord Judea, for nearly a century, had lain under the mastery of Rome.
In the seventh year of the reign of Augustus Caesar an imperial decree ordered every Judean each to return to his place of birth to be counted and taxed.
Converging ways of many of them led to their capital city, Jerusalem the troubled heart of their land.
The old city was dominated by the fortress of Antonia the seat of Roman power and by the great golden temple the outward sign of an inward and imperishable faith.
Even while they obeyed the will of Caesar the people clung proudly to their ancient heritage always remembering the promise of their prophets that one day there would be born among them a redeemer to bring them salvation and perfect freedom.
You'll be counted at Hebron.
-Name?
-Samuel.
-What city?
-Joppa.
-What family?
-Michael.
-Move on.
Move on.
-Yes.
-Name?
-Joseph.
-What city?
-Nazareth.
-What family?
-David of Bethlehem.
And the woman?
My wife.
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.
Come on, come on.
What village is this?
Nazareth.
We should arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow night.
You're not watching the soldiers, Joseph?
We've seen Romans before.
Yes and we will see them again.
My table is not finished.
Where is your son?
He's walking in the hills.
He neglects his work, Joseph.
No.
Once, I reproached him with forgetting his work.
He said to me:
"I must be about my father's business. "
Then why isn't he here, working?
He's working.
Trumpeters of the legion!
Welcome, Messala.
The command is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for relieving me.
Drusus when I was a boy, I dreamed of commanding this garrison.
Now the wheel has turned.
I am in command.
Attention!
Aisle one, face right!
Forward!
I'd forgotten the heat.
If it were only the heat.
I lived here until I was 14.
Jerusalem was my home.
-My father was head of...
-Yes, I know.
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.
If there can be such a thing in this forsaken land.
If you want to rise, Sextus, do the difficult.
I asked to be sent here.
You'll find the people changed since you were a boy.
In what way?
Oh, won't pay their taxes, an irrational resentment of Rome....
There's nothing new in all that.
And then there's religion.
I tell you, they're drunk with religion.
They smash the statues of our gods, even those of the emperor.
Punish them.
We do.
When we can find them.
Find the leaders.
You don't know.
There's nothing you can put your finger on.
There are strange forces at work here.
This "messiah" business...
I know.
There was one predicted when I was a boy.
A king of the Jews, who will lead them into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.
Makes your head spin.
There's a wild man in the desert named John who drowns people in water.
And a carpenter's son who does magic tricks. "Miracles" they call them.
There's always a rabble-rouser stirring up trouble.
No, no, no.
This man is different.
He teaches that God is near, in every man.
It's actually quite profound, some of it.
You've been too long away from Rome.
Go back, Sextus.
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea and forget that God is in every man.
-There is divinity in only one man.
-Yes, I know.
The emperor is displeased.
He wishes Judea made into a more obedient and disciplined province.
He's ordered me to restore order.
I shall carry out his wishes.
How?
You can break a man's skull, arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.
But how do you control this?
How do you fight an idea?
Especially a new idea.
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.
I assume he has a name.
-He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
-Then treat him like one!
Tell him I will join him.
Yes, tribune.
Centurion!
This was his country before it was ours.
Don't forget that.
Yes, tribune.
Very wise.
This Ben-Hur is the richest man in Jerusalem.
And the head of one of the greatest families in Judea.
We were friends as boys.
We were like brothers.
Sextus you ask how to fight an idea.
Well, I'll tell you how.
With another idea.
I said I'd come back.
I never thought you would.
I'm so glad.
-Look at you.
-Look at you!
You've come back a tribune.
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.
We'll drink another now.
-Your sister and mother?
-They're fine.
They've talked of you ever since we knew you were coming.
-Is Tirzah married?
-No.
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.
She's been in love with you since she was 5.
I can't wait to see them.
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?
Or have you become too dignified?
-Down Eros, up Mars!
-Down Eros, up Mars!
Where the beams cross?
Good.
After all these years!
Still close.
In every way.
I hope so.
I know.
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew whose life you once saved.
The best thing I ever did.
Judah it will be very difficult to govern here.
I'm going to need help.
Your help.
Your advice.
-You want my advice?
-Yes, I do.
Withdraw your legions.
Give us our freedom.
Unfortunately, the emperor is devoted to his empire.
He's particularly fond of Judea.
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.
Is there anything so sad as unrequited love?
My quarters.
A bit grim.
Not grim.
Austere.
Virtuous.
Roman.
I'm going to be second-in-command to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.
He's coming in a few days with more legions.
Then the rumors are true.
The emperor does not approve of your countrymen.
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.
But you and your family need have no concern.
I'm next in authority to the governor, and you're my friend.
-I'm a Jew.
-Ah, you are like a Roman!
What have you in common with the troublemaking rabble?
-They're my people.
I'm one of them.
-Be wise, Judah.
It's a Roman world.
If you want to live in it, you must become part of it.
You've changed.
I've grown up.
I've seen the world since I left Jerusalem.
I've seen Rome.
It's no accident that one small village on the Tiber was chosen to rule the world.
Your legions.
It wasn't just our legions.
Other countries have armies, fine armies.
I know, I fought them.
Oh, no.
No, it was fate that chose us to civilize the world.
And we have.
Our roads and ships connect every corner of the earth.
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.
I believe in the future of my people.
Of course you do.
And you can help them.
How?
You're an aristocrat.
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince to your people.
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.
They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.
Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.
It is worse than stupid, futile!
For it can end in only one way, extinction for your people!
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.
Then we're agreed!
Now, when can I come to see your family?
-We had hoped tomorrow.
-Good.
And now for our toast.
It's dreadful wine, by the way.
It's especially fermented for the Roman army.
You're very cruel to your conquerors.
It's an insane world.
But in it there is one sanity:
The loyalty of old friends.
Judah, we must believe in one another.
Will you drink to that?
With all my heart.
Here it is, the place I've remembered.
The court where we played at changing the guard.
The roof where we'd throw pebbles at people in the street and then hide.
-We were rascals, weren't we?
-No, you were good boys.
I would have that time again.
And here it is.
Nothing has changed.
Except for the fountain.
-The old well would go dry, remember?
-Promptly, every summer.
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.
-He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
-No?
Of course he has.
He was a boy when he left us, now he's a man.
With great responsibilities.
Come.
The emperor builds and builds, turning brick to marble.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.
I've never seen anything like this before.
It's beautiful!
-Is it Roman?
-It's Libyan.
I was there last year.
A tremendous campaign.
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.
Or was, till we destroyed it.
Now it's nothing but ashes.
I'm boring you with soldier stories.
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.
Thank you for this.
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.
What do you think of it?
Magnificent.
It's Arabic.
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.
Let me try him sometime.
Whenever you like.
He's yours.
Do you mean you'll give me this?
Oh, Judah.
You are good.
It's going to be like old times, I know it.
Judah, tell me, did you think about what I said?
Yes.
Talked to a number of people already.
Spoken against violence, against incidents.
Most of the men agree with me.
Most?
Not all?
No, not all.
Who does not agree?
Well, the resentful, the impatient.
Who are they?
Yes, Judah.
Who are they?
Would I retain your friendship if I became an informer?
Telling the names of criminals is not informing.
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.
Patriots?
!
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.
This is my great opportunity, and yours too.
If I bring order here, I can have any post I want.
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?
Rome!
Yes, perhaps at the side of Caesar himself.
I mean it.
It can happen and this is the moment.
I swear, this is the time.
The emperor is watching us, judging us.
All I need do is serve him.
And all you need do is help me serve him.
-You speak as if he were God.
-He is God.
The only God.
He is power, real power on earth, not...
Not that.
Help me, Judah.
I would do anything for you, Messala except betray my own people.
In the name of all the gods, what do the lives of a few Jews mean to you?
If I cannot persuade them, that does not mean I would help you murder them.
Besides, you must understand this, Messala.
I believe in the past and future of my people.
Future?
You are a conquered people.
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?
Joshua will not rise again to save you nor David.
There is only one reality in the world today.
Look to the West.
Don't be a fool!
Look to Rome!
Better a fool than a traitor or a killer.
-I am a soldier.
-Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.
-I warn you...
-No!
I warn you.
Rome is an affront to God.
Rome is strangling my people and my country, the whole earth!
But not forever.
And I tell you, the day Rome falls there will be a shout of freedom such as the world has never heard before.
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.
You're either for me or against me.
If that is the choice then I am against you.
There they are.
Where's Messala?
-Where's...?
-He's gone.
Gone?
-But why?
-He couldn't stay.
-What happened?
-A new tribune must have many duties.
Come.
Let us have dinner.
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the world who bringeth to us bread from the earth.
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.
He wanted to use me to betray our people.
-Master, the caravan from Antioch.
-Yes, Amrah, I saw.
Simonides.
-Oh, welcome homecoming.
-Master.
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.
And for the master, Iberian wine.
Not to mention the best gift of all, your presence
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.
-Caravans from Petra.
-Have all arrived.
-Good.
-Here is the accounting.
And what of Numidia?
The trade route is ours, guaranteed by treaty with the king.
Once a year, you bring your accounting.
And once a year, I find myself wealthier.
Yeah, but my greatest treasure is my steward.
My life belongs to the House of Hur.
Nothing else exists for me, except my daughter.
-She must be a young woman by now.
-Yes, and your property.
She was born the daughter of your slave.
When I inherited you, I inherited a friend, not a slave.
Still, Esther has come with me from Antioch for your permission to marry.
It's granted.
I wish you the joy of many grandchildren.
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.
With your permission, Esther wishes to speak to her master.
You're eager to marry, Esther?
It is my father's wish.
Your husband will be fortunate.
What is his name?
David, son of Mathias.
Of what house?
-His own, master.
-He is a freeman.
Tell me more about him.
I have seen him only once.
He is a merchant, well-thought-of in Antioch.
He will pay for Esther's freedom.
Her freedom will be my wedding gift to Esther.
You are generous, master.
Do you love this man?
I will learn to love him.
You have my permission to marry.
We'll drink to your happiness.
And a safe return to Antioch.
I disturbed you.
No.
What were you thinking?
I was saying goodbye to this city and this house.
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?
My father sometimes brought me here when I was little.
It was a house where I was always happy.
Except once.
When you and your friend, the Roman boy...
-Messala.
-Yes.
You had been out hunting and they brought you home injured.
I touched your face as you lay there and prayed to God, "Don't let this boy die. "
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.
Yes, master.
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.
It's strange.
I hardly felt a slave.
And now I hardly feel free.
You know, in the old, wise days of Solomon if there was among his slaves some girl who filled his eyes he could choose her out from the rest and take her to him.
Wise days of Solomon.
Different days.
And long ago.
If you were not a bride I should kiss you goodbye.
If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said.
Your slave ring.
Fair exchange.
Freedom to you.
The ring to me.
You will wear it?
Until you meet the woman you will marry?
Until then.
The gods favor my lord Gratus.
If it is the governor's pleasure, the wreath of office.
Thank you, tribune.
I see no delegation from the city.
-There will not be one, sir.
-No?
Jerusalem's welcome will not be a warm one.
But I pledge, my lord, it will be a quiet one.
Let us proceed.
There's Messala.
He saw you, Judah.
The new governor.
Stand back!
-Stand back.
-You, come!
Had to be the Jews!
Open up in the name of the divine emperor!
Judah!
Tirzah!
What is it?
What's happened?
Open up in the name of the law!
-I was watching the...
-A tile fell and struck the governor.
-It wasn't my fault.
-They won't believe her.
She won't have to say anything.
You hear?
Tirzah, say nothing.
Open the gates!
I'll speak to them.
-Arrest him!
-Let me tell you what happened.
-Hold those women.
-Stop them!
It was an accident.
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.
-This is the man, sir.
We saw him.
-It was an accident.
-Accident?
-I swear it.
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose.
It gave way.
Take him.
Take all of them.
-He's telling the truth!
-It was me!
Let them go!
Attention!
Messala.
In the name of God, tell them it's a mistake.
I leaned on the tile, and it broke loose.
It was an accident.
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!
Let the servants go.
Let them go.
Return to your ranks.
Come.
Where?
Tirus.
Tirus?
I've had no trial.
I'm to die in the galleys without even a trial?
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!
Wait.
My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?
Tie his hands.
-At least tell me if they're safe.
-I can tell you nothing.
Get along.
Keep moving.
Jailer!
Guard, in there!
Up the stairs!
Jailer!
Jailer!
To the right.
-Wait!
-Send them out.
Go!
The door.
Where are my mother and sister?
Where are they?
Here, within these walls.
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.
Of course, they will be sentenced.
Is it possible?
Is it possible you could do this to us?
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?
You will let them go.
You will gladly let them go!
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not a murderer!
I know you're not.
You know?
You are evil.
No, Judah, I am not evil.
I wanted your help.
Now you've given it to me.
By making this example of you, I discourage treason.
By condemning without hesitation an old friend, I shall be feared.
But not my family.
Let them go.
Please.
-Messala, I beg you.
-Beg?
!
Didn't I beg you?
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.
Kill me, and your mother and sister will die nailed to crosses in front of you!
Go on, Judah.
Kill me!
May God grant me vengeance.
I will pray that you live till I return.
Return?
Take him.
Sentries, salute.
The tribune will see you now.
Tribune, I'm steward of the House of Hur.
I remember you.
We were on our way to Antioch when we heard what had happened.
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done this thing.
You knew him, tribune.
Better than you.
Then there must be no doubt in your mind, the charge is groundless.
The prisoners have been sentenced.
-Sentenced?
-But there's no truth in it.
There was never a threat against the governor in Judah's mind.
Surely you must know he would never have done this.
In your heart, you must know it.
Drusus.
This man had better be kept here until we can question him.
Hold!
Water for the soldiers.
Soldiers first!
Get away from that well.
No water for them!
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!
Come on, you!
Water for the horses!
-Water.
Water.
-Soldiers first!
Here.
Wait.
No water for him.
God help me.
You!
I said no water for him!
All right, on your feet, all of you!
Get them on their feet!
Back in line, you dog!
On your feet!
Get them going!
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!
Forward, you dogs!
Soon, the counselor's barge will be coming alongside.
Be ready to raise oars.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.
-How many rowers?
-Two hundred, consul.
-And reliefs?
-Of 30, every hour.
This man is ill.
Replace him.
-Change him.
-Right, sir.
-This man's been giving you trouble?
-He's insubordinate, consul.
That will stop.
What service have you seen?
Forty-one.
A month's less a day in this ship.
You keep an exact account.
And before?
Three years in other ships.
Three years.
You have the spirit to fight back but the good sense to control it.
Your eyes are full of hate, 41.
That's good.
Hate keeps a man alive.
It gives him strength.
Now, listen to me, all of you.
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
So row well and live.
-Ship ready, consul.
-Strike oars.
Strike oars!
You know a fleet of Macedonian galleys has been raiding Roman commerce.
The emperor has honored us with the task of seeking out and destroying them.
Battle speed, hortator.
Battle speed!
Attack speed.
Attack speed!
Ramming speed.
Ramming speed!
Rest.
Halt!
Rest!
Why are you here?
I was ordered to report to you during my relief.
Oh, yes.
I'd forgotten.
You could have killed me as I lay there.
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?
I'm not ready to die.
What do you think will save you?
The God of my fathers.
Your God has forsaken you.
He has no more power than the images I pray to.
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.
I might.
Does that interest you, 41?
I can see that it does.
I'm a fighting man by profession, and in my leisure moments it amuses me to train fighting men.
I own some of the best gladiators and charioteers in Rome.
Would you like to become one of them?
To die as your slave?
Better than to live in chains below these decks.
I will not be here forever.
No?
What would you do if you escaped?
Two people were condemned with me, my mother and sister though they were innocent.
I won't rest...
Do not say that you were innocent.
-Would it do any good to say it again?
-No.
Consider my offer carefully.
You will never escape while we are victorious.
If we are not, you will sink with this ship, chained to your oar.
I cannot believe that God has let me live these years to die chained to an oar.
It's a strange, stubborn faith you keep to believe that existence has a purpose.
A sane man would have learned to lose it long before this.
As you have.
What drove it out of you?
Go back to your oar, 41.
Consul, enemy sighted.
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.
All the watch to battle posts.
-Stand by to load.
-Make ready to fire.
Hurry, quick!
Hurry up with that resin.
Get some more ammunition.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
Chain rowers!
Guard.
Unlock 41.
No!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
41, why did he do that?
I don't know.
Once before, a man helped me.
I didn't know why then.
Normal speed!
Number 1, flame.
Fire.
Fire!
Fire!
Hold withdrawal on command.
Lift oars!
Raise!
Withdraw!
Steersman, right.
Extend oars!
Fire!
-Watch out!
-Fire!
Steersman, ram course!
Order below!
-Ramming speed!
-Ramming speed!
Consul, barge on ramming course.
We're going to be rammed!
We're going to be rammed!
Why did you save me?
Why did you have me unchained?
What is your name, 41?
Judah Ben-Hur. ...let me die.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
Row well and live.
Is the sail square?
I can't tell.
Better for us both if it's the enemy.
My death.
Your freedom.
It's a Roman sail.
Face rear!
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.
Water.
The fleet, all lost?
Five galleys.
-And the battle?
-The battle was won.
You have a victory.
-It was a victory?
-Complete.
In His eagerness to save you your God has also saved the Roman fleet.
Hail Arrius!
Right oars!
You have cleared the seaways of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.
This baton of victory has been nobly won.
This man riding beside you, who is he?
The man who saved me, divine emperor, to return and serve you.
Is that all you know about him?
No.
He was accused of an attack on the governor of Judea.
But he was innocent.
If not, there's a strange inconsistency in this man who tries to kill my governor, yet saves the life of my consul.
Come tomorrow.
We'll talk of it.
We have all the information on this man a man of some influence in his own country.
His attack upon our governor is one upon the senate and the people of Rome.
I am convinced that no such attack was intended.
Consul, allow us to continue.
Allow us to be generous.
As a reward to you for your great victory we shall not send him back to the galleys.
Take him as your slave.
Such is the will of the senate and the people of Rome.
Not long ago, I returned to Rome with a young man who had saved my life.
You all know him as the finest charioteer in Rome.
Five times, he's driven my horses to victory.
I know him as one who stands in the place of the son I lost.
I have the love and pride in a son's achievements which I thought I should never have again.
Nothing could make stronger our bond but tonight I wish to share it with you all.
The formalities of adoption have been completed.
Young Arrius is now the legal bearer of my name and the heir to my property.
This ring of my ancestors would have gone to my son.
So now it is yours.
It's a strange destiny that brought me to a new life a new home a new father.
It brought me here.
It may take me away.
But wherever I may be I shall always try to wear this ring as a son of Arrius should.
With gratitude and affection and with honor.
My old friend Pontius Pilate, young Arrius.
Before you came to this city, my horses always won.
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.
Yes, but not swift enough to defeat you.
-Tell me, you come from Judea?
-Yes, sir.
I hear that the climate is difficult to live in.
Not for Judeans.
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.
-Of Judea?
-Yes.
I asked for Alexandria.
But it seems the wilderness needs my particular talents.
The scorpions and holy prophets can't get on without me.
Lay the dust of Judea, at least for this evening.
Goats and Jehovah.
You're leaving.
I must.
It's a journey I can't keep you from.
Your eyes have never left it all these months.
I can recognize pain.
But still, my counsel is to wait.
Gratus is to be replaced.
The governorship goes to Pontius Pilate.
When?
Very soon.
It's very much to our purpose.
Nothing is to the purpose if, when I come back to Judea, I come too late.
That is the thought which has punished me every moment I've spent here.
Will Rome see you again?
Here is a part of my life which you have made for me.
I shall remember it.
Whoever the gods are, they take small interest in an old man's hopes.
They have their way.
Forgive me.
You're a stranger here.
Would you be from Nazareth?
Why do you ask?
I thought you might be the one...
The one that I have come back from my country to find.
He would be about your age.
Who?
When I find Him I shall know Him.
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.
Sack of flesh without brains!
No!
No!
Not the whip!
That is my host.
Gently!
Gently!
Fool!
Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood.
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run!
Go on!
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!
Beautiful horses.
Now!
Now!
They are ready!
Let them go!
Watch.
They'll never hold the turn.
No!
No!
Abadon, stop him!
Stop that whip!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill...!
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!
You think you can treat my horses like animals?
!
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!
Get off, idiot!
Drive goats, not horses!
I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.
Not a team?
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.
-Antares.
-The slow one?
He should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?
In the circus in Rome.
You have driven in the great circus?
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.
No other animal has descended so in scale from the first innocent falling of the world.
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.
Yes.
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.
Your coming here was so fit, so right.
We might have achieved wonders!
You have to go.
I make a journey which will not wait.
Ah, well, then perhaps you will come back.
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.
I have no wives.
No wives at all?
I have six, no, seven.
I've counted eight.
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.
-Someday, I hope to have one.
-One wife!
One God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.
It is not generous.
-Was the food not to your liking?
-Indeed.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.
And now I must say good night to my beauties.
When ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.
-I'll make my farewells then.
-No, no, no, stay.
Stay and see them.
Come, my children.
Come.
Strangers make them shy.
Come.
Come, do not be afraid.
Come.
There, my children.
They are descended from the Arabians of the Pharaohs and I have named them for the stars.
Come, Antares.
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.
What?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.
Come, Rigel.
We've both supped well, and the world is good.
There's my good Rigel.
Yes, you are ready for sleep.
The day's work done for you, eh?
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.
Good night.
Good night, my treasure.
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.
No.
You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.
You should see their mother, Mira.
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.
All right, all right.
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.
You must be strong and swift.
Go, my children.
Go.
At Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams and the champion of the East, Messala, with his black devils.
He stops at nothing to win.
-Messala?
In the circus?
-Yes.
You knew him?
I know him.
Perhaps without much liking.
My people are praying for a man to drive their team to victory over Messala.
You could be that man, the one to stamp his arrogance into the sand.
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.
It's not possible.
That is a pity.
Think of it.
To break his pride to humble this tribune before the very people he has degraded.
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!
I know it is not possible.
Does it not delight your imagination?
Does it not answer your purpose?
I must deal with Messala in my own way.
And your way is to kill him.
I see this terrible thing in your eyes.
But no matter what this man has done, you have no right to kill him.
He will be punished inevitably.
I don't believe in miracles.
But all life is a miracle.
Why will you not accept God's judgment?
You do not believe in miracles.
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness and a star led me to a village called Bethlehem where I found a newborn child in a manger.
And God lived in this child.
By now, He is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.
That is why I have returned here so that I may be at hand when He comes among us.
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.
Perhaps He's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.
Perhaps He is a shepherd a merchant, a fisherman.
But He lives and all our lives from now on will carry His mark.
There are many paths to God, my son.
I hope yours will not be too difficult.
I'm ready for sleep.
Balthasar is a good man but until all men are like him, we must keep our swords bright.
And our intention true.
So I must leave you.
One last thought.
There is no law in the arena.
Many are killed.
I hope to see you again.
Fine Damascus silk.
Fine Damascus silk.
Esther?
It's Judah.
You are alive.
You are alive.
What are you doing here?
What has happened?
I'm here.
I'm with you.
Where's your father?
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.
They tortured him.
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.
You never went back to Antioch?
No.
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.
Where are my mother and sister?
Let me tell him first.
Father.
Father, something wonderful has happened.
Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
He has come home.
He is here.
Judah.
Judah Ben-Hur.
My dear old friend.
Let me look at you.
Let me see you.
Yes, yes.
It is true.
Praise God for His mercy.
Where are they?
Since that terrible day there has been no word of them.
You should have been less loyal.
Do not pity me, Master Judah.
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.
We were released on the same day.
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.
Since then, I have been his tongue and he has been my legs.
Together, we make a considerable man.
Old friend.
She always said you would return.
She never gave up hope.
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.
I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.
But suppose that isn't possible.
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.
They could not make me tell them where it is.
It is there still to put power into our hands and buy death for the Romans.
That's not why I came back.
Judah, they are dead.
Four years.
No one could live so long in the dungeons.
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?
Yes, it is true.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You have come back to us like a returning faith.
Judah, I should like to laugh again.
-Let us laugh.
-We will.
There will be joy again in this house.
We will celebrate among the dust.
I will take him.
We stood here before.
A long while ago.
Four years.
But now it seems as if only yesterday....
I was saying:
"If you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye. "
"If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said. "
I am not a bride.
Why did you never marry?
My father needed me.
And also....
It's still on my finger.
I said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.
It's become a part of my hand.
If Messala once knew you were here....
As he must.
He will know where they are.
And if you should find...?
-If he says they're dead...
-Messala will wish they were living.
I've seen too much of what hate can do.
My father is burned up with it.
But I've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater and love more powerful than hatred.
I believe it.
-Esther.
-Judah.
Stay alive.
Keep away from Messala.
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.
That time isn't yet come.
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.
This time you will be destroyed.
You'll die.
Tribune, compliments of Quintus Arrius.
He awaits your pleasure.
-Consul here?
-Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.
Thank him.
Bring him to me.
-I didn't know the consul had a son.
-He's a champion of the great circus.
Why is he presenting me with gifts?
-Perhaps he'll race against you.
-Look.
It's magnificent.
And from a man I've never met.
You're wrong, Messala.
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?
You were the magician, Messala.
You condemned me to the galleys.
When my ship was sunk, I saved the consul's life.
You know his seal?
Now I have come back as I swore I would.
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.
You suggest I use it on myself?
What has become of my mother and my sister?
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.
Find them, Messala.
Restore them to me, and I'll forget what I vowed with every stroke of that oar you chained me to.
I am not the governor.
I can do nothing without approval.
Then get it.
I will come back tomorrow.
Don't disappoint me, Messala.
What became of them?
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?
Go to the citadel, Drusus.
Find out.
-And if they're dead?
-They're dead!
"Miriam, wife.
Tirzah, daughter. "
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?
E section lower level.
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.
Water.
Water.
Let me out!
-How long since you've seen them?
-Never.
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.
The food disappears.
Lepers.
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.
Then we'll burn out the cell.
Is someone there?
There is someone there.
Who are you?
Don't come any closer.
Who are you?
Esther.
It's Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam?
Stay where you are.
You have come home.
Stand back, Esther.
We are lepers.
Oh, Esther.
Tirzah.
Esther is Judah living?
Yes, he is alive.
He is here.
Where?
He is searching for you now.
I must find him and tell him.
-No!
-Tell my father.
No.
Tell no one.
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.
We won't return.
Judah has to be told.
No.
Please.
I couldn't see his face.
Is it changed?
No, he is not changed.
He's not changed.
You love him, Esther.
Promise me on your love for him you will never tell him you've seen us.
Is he never to know?
Let him remember us as we were.
Promise me.
There's nothing else I can hope for.
Only this.
I promise.
I am content.
Wait.
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.
I pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.
He'll free them.
He wants to survive.
He cannot free them, Judah.
What do you mean?
I saw them.
You saw them?
Where?
When did you see them?
They were dead.
They were dead.
When?
When?
When?
!
In the prison.
When I was waiting for news of my father.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't tell you.
Nor even you, Father.
I was afraid that if you saw Messala....
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.
It's over now.
Over?
-Judah.
-Over?
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.
Gentlemen.
Officers.
Defenders of great Rome's imperium may I enter?
Certainly, sheik.
You do us an unexpected honor.
The noble tribune is most gracious.
And now the question you're asking:
Why am I here?
As you know, I am a gambling man.
The games approach.
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.
I will back my own poor horses.
No limits?
-Mark me first!
-And me!
-What odds?
-A moment, please my lords, protectors of the far flung marshes.
May I first sit down?
Sit.
How much will you wager?
-Yes, let's call his game.
-Give the Arab a seat.
A bench, quickly.
Thank you.
-Now.
-1000 denarii.
-2000!
-Mark me!
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient.
There is time.
First gentlemen, the odds.
The tribune has won many times.
The odds should be in the same measure.
What is your pleasure, gentlemen?
Two to one.
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth where is the courage that made Rome master of the world?
I can get better odds on any street market.
Three to one.
Let us not haggle.
Let us be fair.
In four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.
-In all truth...
-Just a moment.
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.
The Prince of Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur.
Prince of Hur?
-He was sent to the galleys years ago.
-He has returned.
Returned?
Impossible.
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.
Well?
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.
You, tribune will you give me four to one?
Four to one.
Good.
Four to one, sheik.
The difference between a Roman and a Jew.
Or an Arab.
Bravely spoken.
Now we will settle the amount of our wager.
I will venture....
A thousand talents?
-A thousand talents?
-Yes, a thousand talents.
Of course, if it is too much....
A thousand talents it will be.
Agreed.
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.
You're good fellows.
If only men were this good.
Remember, Altair nine times around the circus.
Aldebaran.
Rigel, did you hear?
Nine lives to live.
My swift fellow.
You must not win the race the first time around.
You win the last time around.
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.
Steady Antares.
Like a rock.
You will be our anchor.
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.
They have taken me into their family.
Rest well, my stars.
Tomorrow we go up to the city.
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it the news will scorch the streets of the Roman world.
Pontius Pilate here?
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.
You will make him see what men are born in this land.
I only know that I race against Messala.
Look for the yoke.
Ease that strap.
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.
Into Your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as You will.
The Star of David.
To shine out for your people and my people together and blind the eyes of Rome.
They are ready.
Easy, girl, easy.
Number five.
Where is number five?
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.
Yes, this is the day.
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.
Hail, Jupiter.
Give me victory.
Watch your line!
Keep your places!
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.
Citizens I welcome you to these games in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.
We dedicate them to his glory and to the glory of Rome of which you are all part.
Let us honor those who race for us today.
They come here from Alexandria Messina Carthage Cyprus Rome Corinth Athens Phrygia and Judea.
To the best of these, a crown of victory.
The race begins.
Hail, Caesar!
Come, my children, come!
The Roman pig!
Salute.
A great victory.
You are the people's one true god for the time being.
Permit us to worship.
I crown their god.
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.
A long life, young Arrius and the good sense to live it.
We cannot wait, tribune.
He will come.
He will...
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.
He will come!
He will come.
I've sent for him, and he will come.
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.
Do you understand?
To hack the legs off me?
Not yet.
Not till I've seen him.
I don't receive him with half a body.
No!
I told you, Drusus.
I told you.
Here he is.
Triumph complete, Judah.
The race won.
The enemy destroyed.
I see no enemy.
What do you think you see?
The smashed body of a wretched animal?
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.
Let me help you.
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.
Dead.
And the race over.
It isn't over, Judah.
They're not dead.
Where are they?
Where are they?
Look for them in the Valley of the Lepers if you can recognize them.
It goes on.
It goes on, Judah.
The race....
The race is not over.
Is there a way down here?
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.
Man.
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.
There are many women.
Of the family of Hur.
We have no names here.
For them?
-Why did you say they were dead?
-It was what they wanted.
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?
Not to see them?
They are coming.
Love them in the way they must need to be loved.
Not to look at them.
Let them be as if you had never come here.
Please!
Is Judah well?
Is he happy?
Yes, he is well.
Your mind can be at rest for him.
He is well, Miriam.
God be with you.
They have gone.
We can go back.
Go back to what?
Judah, they have one blessing left.
To think you remember them as they were and live your own life.
Forget what is here.
Forget?
It's as though they're alive in a grave.
-But what can you do?
-Undo what you've done.
How could you have suffered them to come here?
I must see them.
No, Judah, please!
Judah!
Think, Judah, think.
It would tear them apart if they see you.
He is here.
I have found Him.
The child has become a man.
And the man, I know it now, is the Son of God.
The promise is true.
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.
Life has been answered.
God has answered it.
Come.
Come with me.
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys thirst had nearly killed me.
A man gave me water to drink.
I went on living.
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.
No.
I am thirsty still.
Come and listen.
I have business with Rome.
You insist on death.
Goodbye, Judah.
You sent for me?
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.
-I honor him.
-As you may honor yourself.
You have been made a citizen of Rome.
Do you say nothing to this?
I have just come from the Valley of Stone where my mother and sister live what's left of their lives.
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.
I have heard this.
There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.
Where there is greatness, great government or power ...even great feeling or compassion error also is great.
We progress and mature by fault.
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.
There are other voices.
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place not to crucify yourself on a shadow such as old resentment or impossible loyalties.
Perfect freedom has no existence.
A grown man knows the world he lives in.
And for the present, the world is Rome.
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.
I am Judah Ben-Hur.
I cross this floor in spoken friendship as I would speak to Arrius.
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar ready to crush those who challenge his authority.
There are too many men of envy and ambition who try to disrupt the government of Rome.
You have become the victor and hero to those people.
They look to you, their one true god, as I call you.
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.
I am already part of this tragedy.
Return this to Arrius.
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you from personal disaster if you stay here.
You are too great a danger.
Leave Judea.
You have my word.
I was afraid you would never come back afraid of what would happen to you.
But I see you again.
Your father's waiting for me.
Where is he?
What do you mean to do?
Rest, sleep.
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.
Peace?
Love and peace.
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?
Where do you see them?
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.
Balthasar's word.
He is more than Balthasar's word.
His voiced traveled with such a still purpose.
It was more than a voice.
A man more than a man.
He said, "Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God. "
Children of God?
In that dead valley where we left them?
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean until we have scoured off our bodies the crust and filth of being at the mercy of tyranny.
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.
-In blood?
-Yes, in blood!
I know there is a law in life.
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.
Death generates death as the vulture breeds the vulture.
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:
"Love your enemy.
Do good to those who despitefully use you. "
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.
As you make us do now.
Are we to bear nothing together?
Even love?
I can hardly draw breath without feeling you in my heart.
But I know that everything I do from this moment bears greater pain than you have ever suffered.
It is better not to love me.
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy giving evil for evil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.
It's as though you had become Messala.
I've lost you, Judah.
No further.
What are you doing here?
I was here last evening waiting for you.
I have waited all night.
What has happened?
Where is Tirzah?
Leave the food.
I am coming closer.
Don't be afraid.
-What are you doing?
-Don't be afraid.
I've heard Him again, the man from Nazareth.
If ever words were from God, they are in everything He says.
I cannot bear that you should have never known this hand of quiet reaching towards us.
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find Him there.
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find Him.
Tirzah is dying.
Leave the food and go.
It's Judah.
Why did you tell him?
Yes, Judah, yes.
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.
Mother.
Wait, Mother, wait.
Let me talk with you.
Please.
No, no further.
Please.
No, Judah.
Son, no.
Mother, let me see Tirzah.
Tirzah is dying.
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know that life is everlasting and death is nothing to fear if you have faith.
I will take them to Him.
No!
God, no!
No, no, dear son.
Mother where is Tirzah?
Judah, no.
Judah, no.
You must not go to her, dear son.
Please.
Dear son.
I am afraid.
No cause.
The world is more than we know.
Tirzah, it's Judah.
No, Judah.
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
-Why are the streets deserted?
-They have gone to the trial.
Trial?
Whose trial?
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.
-This cannot be true.
-Alms?
What has he done?
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.
Help for the blind.
-Look, lepers!
-Lepers!
Get away!
Stay away!
Go away!
Lepers!
Lepers!
How can this be?
I know this man.
Will someone help Him?
Take pity on Him.
Have mercy.
In His pain this look of peace.
Watch over them, Esther.
We must go back.
I brought you here to this when I hoped....
You haven't failed, Esther.
Hail King of the Jews!
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.
He gave me water and a heart to live.
What has He done to merit this?
He has taken the world of our sins onto Himself.
To this end He said He was born in that stable where I first saw Him.
For this cause, He came into the world.
For this death?
This beginning.
I have lived too long.
As though He were carrying in that cross the pain of the world.
So fearful, and yet why is it I'm not afraid anymore?
The shadow of a storm.
A strange darkness but still day.
His life is over.
What is it?
This tearing.
I am in pain.
I feel it too.
Do you see your hand?
Almost at the moment He died I heard Him say, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do. "
Even then.
Even then.
And I felt His voice take the sword out of my hand.
In the year of our Lord Judea, for nearly a century, had lain under the mastery of Rome.
In the seventh year of the reign ofAugustus Caesar an imperial decree ordered every Judean each to return to his place of birth to be counted and taxed.
Converging ways of many of them led to their capital city, Jerusalem the troubled heart of their land.
The old city was dominated by the fortress ofAntonia the seat of Roman power and by the great golden temple the outward sign of an inward and imperishable faith.
Even while they obeyed the will of Caesar the people clung proudly to their ancient heritage always remembering the promise of their prophets that one day there would be born among them a redeemer to bring them salvation and perfect freedom.
You'll be counted at Hebron.
-Name?
-Samuel.
-What city?
-Joppa.
-What family?
-Michael.
-Move on.
Move on.
-Yes.
-Name?
-Joseph.
-What city?
-Nazareth.
-What family?
-David of Bethlehem.
And the woman?
My wife.
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.
Come on, come on.
What village is this?
Nazareth.
We should arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow night.
You're not watching the soldiers, Joseph?
We've seen Romans before.
Yes...
... andwewillsee themagain.
My table is not finished.
Where is your son?
He's walking in the hills.
He neglects his work, Joseph.
No.
Once, I reproached him with forgetting his work.
He said to me:
"I must be about my father's business. "
Then why isn't he here, working?
He's working.
Trumpeters of the legion!
Welcome, Messala.
The command is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for relieving me.
Drusus...
... whenI wasaboy ,Idreamed of commanding this garrison.
Now the wheel has turned.
I am in command.
Attention!
Aisle one, face right!
Forward!
I'd forgotten the heat.
If it were only the heat.
I lived here until I was 1 4.
Jerusalem was my home.
-My father was head of--
-Yes, I know.
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.
If there can be such a thing in this forsaken land.
If you want to rise, Sextus, do the difficult.
I asked to be sent here.
You'll find the people changed since you were a boy.
In what way?
Oh, won't pay their taxes, an irrational resentment of Rome... .
There's nothing new in all that.
And then there's religion.
I tell you, they're drunk with religion.
They smash the statues of our gods, even those of the emperor.
Punish them.
We do.
When we can find them.
Find the leaders.
You don't know.
There's nothing you can put your finger on.
There are strange forces at work here.
This "messiah" business--
I know.
There was one predicted when I was a boy.
A king of the Jews, who will lead them into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.
Makes your head spin.
There's a wild man in the desert named John...
... whodrownspeopleinwater.
And a carpenter's son who does magic tricks. "Miracles" they call them.
There's always a rabble-rouser stirring up trouble.
No, no, no.
This man is different.
He teaches that God is near, in every man.
It's actually quite profound, some of it.
You've been too long away from Rome.
Go back, Sextus.
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea...
... andforgetthat God is in every man.
-There is divinity in only one man.
-Yes, I know.
The emperor is displeased.
He wishes Judea made into a more obedient and disciplined province.
He's ordered me to restore order.
I shall carry out his wishes.
How?
You can break a man's skull, arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.
But how do you control this?
How do you fight an idea?
Especially a new idea.
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.
I assume he has a name.
-He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
-Then treat him like one!
Tell him I will join him.
Yes, tribune.
Centurion!
This was his country before it was ours.
Don't forget that.
Yes, tribune.
Very wise.
This Ben-Hur is the richest man in Jerusalem.
And the head of one of the greatest families in Judea.
We were friends as boys.
We were like brothers.
Sextus...
... youaskhowtofightanidea.
Well, I'll tell you how.
With another idea.
I said I'd come back.
I never thought you would.
I'm so glad.
-Look at you.
-Look at you!
You've come back a tribune.
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.
We'll drink another now.
-Your sister and mother?
-They're fine.
They've talked of you ever since we knew you were coming.
-Is Tirzah married?
-No.
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.
She's been in love with you since she was 5.
I can't wait to see them.
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?
Or have you become too dignified?
-Down Eros, up Mars!
-Down Eros, up Mars!
Where the beams cross?
Good.
After all these years!
Still close.
In every way.
I hope so.
I know.
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew...
... whoselifeyouoncesaved.
The best thing I ever did.
Judah...
... itwillbe verydifficult to govern here.
I'm going to need help.
Your help.
Your advice.
-You want my advice?
-Yes, I do.
Withdraw your legions.
Give us our freedom.
Unfortunately, the emperor is devoted to his empire.
He's particularly fond of Judea.
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.
Is there anything so sad as unrequited love?
My quarters.
A bit grim.
Not grim.
Austere.
Virtuous.
Roman.
I'm going to be second-in-command to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.
He's coming in a few days with more legions.
Then the rumors are true.
The emperor does not approve of your countrymen.
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.
But you and your family need have no concern.
I'm next in authority to the governor, and you're my friend.
-I'm a Jew.
-Ah, you are like a Roman!
What have you in common with the troublemaking rabble?
-They're my people.
I'm one of them.
-Be wise, Judah.
It's a Roman world.
If you want to live in it, you must become part of it.
You've changed.
I've grown up.
I've seen the world since I left Jerusalem.
I've seen Rome.
It's no accident that one small village on the Tiber...
... waschosento rulethe world.
Your legions.
It wasn't just our legions.
Other countries have armies, fine armies.
I know, I fought them.
Oh, no.
No, it was fate that chose us to civilize the world.
And we have.
Our roads and ships connect every corner of the earth.
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.
I believe in the future of my people.
Of course you do.
And you can help them.
How?
You're an aristocrat.
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince to your people.
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.
They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.
Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.
It is worse than stupid, futile!
For it can end in only one way, extinction for your people!
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.
Then we're agreed!
Now, when can I come to see your family?
-We had hoped tomorrow.
-Good.
And now for our toast.
It's dreadful wine, by the way.
It's especially fermented for the Roman army.
You're very cruel to your conquerors.
It's an insane world.
But in it there is one sanity:
The loyalty of old friends.
Judah, we must believe in one another.
Will you drink to that?
With all my heart.
Here it is, the place I've remembered.
The court where we played at changing the guard.
The roof where we'd throw pebbles at people in the street and then hide.
-We were rascals, weren't we?
-No, you were good boys.
I would have that time again.
And here it is.
Nothing has changed.
Except for the fountain.
-The old well would go dry, remember?
-Promptly, every summer.
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.
-He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
-No?
Of course he has.
He was a boy when he left us, now he's a man.
With great responsibilities.
Come.
The emperor builds and builds, turning brick to marble.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.
I've never seen anything like this before.
It's beautiful!
-Is it Roman?
-It's Libyan.
I was there last year.
A tremendous campaign.
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.
Or was, till we destroyed it.
Now it's nothing but ashes.
I'm boring you with soldier stories.
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.
Thank you for this.
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.
What do you think of it?
Magnificent.
It's Arabic.
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.
Let me try him sometime.
Whenever you like.
He's yours.
Do you mean you'll give me this?
Oh, Judah.
You are good.
It's going to be like old times, I know it.
Judah, tell me, did you...
... thinkaboutwhatIsaid ?
Yes.
Talked to a number of people already.
Spoken against violence, against incidents.
Most of the men agree with me.
Most?
Not all?
No, not all.
Who does not agree?
Well, the resentful, the impatient.
Who are they?
Yes, Judah.
Who are they?
Would I retain your friendship if I became an informer?
Telling the names of criminals is not informing.
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.
Patriots?
!
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.
This is my great opportunity, and yours too.
If I bring order here, I can have any post I want.
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?
Rome!
Yes, perhaps at the side of Caesar himself.
I mean it.
It can happen and this is the moment.
I swear, this is the time.
The emperor is watching us, judging us.
All I need do is serve him.
And all you need do is help me serve him.
-You speak as if he were God.
-He is God.
The only God.
He is power, real power on earth, not--
Not that.
Help me, Judah.
I would do anything for you, Messala...
... exceptbetraymy ownpeople.
In the name of all the gods, what do the lives of a few Jews mean to you?
If I cannot persuade them, that does not mean I would help you murder them.
Besides, you must understand this, Messala.
I believe in the past and future of my people.
Future?
You are a conquered people.
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?
Joshua will not rise again to save you nor David.
There is only one reality in the world today.
Look to the West.
Don't be a fool!
Look to Rome!
Better a fool than a traitor or a killer.
-I am a soldier.
-Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.
-I warn you--
-No!
I warn you.
Rome is an affront to God.
Rome is strangling my people and my country, the whole earth!
But not forever.
And I tell you, the day Rome falls there will be a shout of freedom...
... suchastheworld has never heard before.
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.
You're either for me or against me.
If that is the choice...
... thenI amagainstyou .
There they are.
Where's Messala?
-Where's--?
-He's gone.
Gone?
-But why?
-He couldn't stay.
-What happened?
-A new tribune must have many duties.
Come.
Let us have dinner.
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the world...
... whobringethto us bread from the earth.
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.
He wanted to use me to betray our people.
-Master, the caravan from Antioch.
-Yes, Amrah, I saw.
Simonides.
-Oh, welcome homecoming.
-Master.
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.
And for the master, lberian wine.
Not to mention the best gift of all, your presence.
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.
-Caravans from Petra.
-Have all arrived.
-Good.
-Here is the accounting.
And what of Numidia?
The trade route is ours, guaranteed by treaty with the king.
Once a year, you bring your accounting.
And once a year, I find myself wealthier.
Yeah, but my greatest treasure is my steward.
My life belongs to the House of Hur.
Nothing else exists for me, except my daughter.
-She must be a young woman by now.
-Yes, and your property.
She was born the daughter of your slave.
When I inherited you, I inherited a friend, not a slave.
Still, Esther has come with me from Antioch for your permission to marry.
It's granted.
I wish you the joy of many grandchildren.
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.
With your permission, Esther wishes to speak to her master.
You're eager to marry, Esther?
It is my father's wish.
Your husband will be fortunate.
What is his name?
David, son of Mathias.
Of what house?
-His own, master.
-He is a freeman.
Tell me more about him.
I have seen him only once.
He is a merchant, well-thought-of in Antioch.
He will pay for Esther's freedom.
Her freedom will be my wedding gift to Esther.
You are generous, master.
Do you love this man?
I will learn to love him.
You have my permission to marry.
We'll drink to your happiness.
And a safe return to Antioch.
I disturbed you.
No.
What were you thinking?
I was saying goodbye...
... tothiscity...
... andthishouse.
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?
My father sometimes brought me here...
... whenI waslittle.
It was a house where I was always happy.
Except once.
When you and your friend, the Roman boy--
-Messala.
-Yes.
You had been out hunting...
... andtheybroughtyou homeinjured.
I touched your face as you lay there...
... andprayedto God, "Don't let this boy die. "
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.
Yes, master.
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.
It's strange.
I hardly felt a slave.
And now...
... Ihardlyfeelfree.
You know, in the old, wise days of Solomon...
... iftherewasamonghisslaves...
... somegirlwhofilledhiseyes...
... hecouldchooseher out from the rest...
... andtakehertohim.
Wise days of Solomon.
Different days.
And long ago.
If you were not a bride...
... Ishouldkissyou goodbye.
If I were not a bride...
... therewouldbe no goodbyes to be said.
Your slave ring.
Fair exchange.
Freedom to you.
The ring to me.
You will wear it?
Until you meet the woman you will marry?
Until then.
The gods favor my lord Gratus.
If it is the governor's pleasure, the wreath of office.
Thank you, tribune.
I see no delegation from the city.
-There will not be one, sir.
-No?
Jerusalem's welcome will not be a warm one.
But I pledge, my lord, it will be a quiet one.
Let us proceed.
There's Messala.
He saw you, Judah.
The new governor.
Stand back!
-Stand back.
-You, come!
Had to be the Jews!
Open up in the name of the divine emperor!
Judah!
Tirzah!
What is it?
What's happened?
Open up in the name of the law!
-I was watching the--
-A tile fell and struck the governor.
-It wasn't my fault.
-They won't believe her.
She won't have to say anything.
You hear?
Tirzah, say nothing.
Open the gates!
I'll speak to them.
-Arrest him!
-Let me tell you what happened.
-Hold those women.
-Stop them!
It was an accident.
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.
-This is the man, sir.
We saw him.
-It was an accident.
-Accident?
-I swear it.
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose.
It gave way.
Take him.
Take all of them.
-He's telling the truth!
-It was me!
Let them go!
Attention!
Messala.
In the name of God, tell them it's a mistake.
I leaned on the tile, and it broke loose.
It was an accident.
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!
Let the servants go.
Let them go.
Return to your ranks.
Come.
Where?
Tirus.
Tirus?
I've had no trial.
I'm to die in the galleys without even a trial?
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!
Wait.
My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?
Tie his hands.
-At least tell me if they're safe.
-I can tell you nothing.
Get along.
Keep moving.
Jailer!
Guard, in there!
Up the stairs!
Jailer!
Jailer!
To the right.
-Wait!
-Send them out.
Go!
The door.
Where are my mother and sister?
Where are they?
Here, within these walls.
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.
Of course, they will be sentenced.
Is it possible?
Is it possible you could do this to us?
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?
You will let them go.
You will gladly let them go!
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not a murderer!
I know you're not.
You know?
You are evil.
No, Judah, I am not evil.
I wanted your help.
Now you've given it to me.
By making this example of you, I discourage treason.
By condemning without hesitation an old friend, I shall be feared.
But not my family.
Let them go.
Please.
-Messala, I beg you.
-Beg?
!
Didn't I beg you?
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.
Kill me, and your mother and sister will die...
... nailedtocrossesinfrontofyou !
Go on, Judah.
Kill me!
May God grant me vengeance.
I will pray that you live till I return.
Return?
Take him.
Sentries, salute.
The tribune will see you now.
Tribune, I'm steward of the House of Hur.
I remember you.
We were on our way to Antioch when we heard what had happened.
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done this thing.
You knew him, tribune.
Better than you.
Then there must be no doubt in your mind, the charge is groundless.
The prisoners have been sentenced.
-Sentenced?
-But there's no truth in it.
There was never a threat against the governor in Judah's mind.
Surely you must know he would never have done this.
In your heart, you must know it.
Drusus.
This man had better be kept here until we can question him.
Hold!
Water for the soldiers.
Soldiers first!
Get away from that well.
No water for them!
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!
Come on, you!
Water for the horses!
-Water.
Water.
-Soldiers first!
Here.
Wait.
No water for him.
God...
... helpme.
You!
I said no water for him!
All right, on your feet, all of you!
Get them on their feet!
Back in line, you dog!
On your feet!
Get them going!
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!
Forward, you dogs!
Soon, the counselor's barge will be coming alongside.
Be ready to raise oars.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.
-How many rowers?
-Two hundred, consul.
-And reliefs?
-Of 30, every hour.
This man is ill.
Replace him.
-Change him.
-Right, sir.
-This man's been giving you trouble?
-He's insubordinate, consul.
That will stop.
What service have you seen?
Forty-one.
A month's less a day in this ship.
You keep an exact account.
And before?
Three years in other ships.
Three years.
You have the spirit to fight back...
... butthegoodsensetocontrolit.
Your eyes are full of hate, 41 .
That's good.
Hate keeps a man alive.
It gives him strength.
Now, listen to me, all of you.
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
So row well...
... andlive.
-Ship ready, consul.
-Strike oars.
Strike oars!
You know a fleet of Macedonian galleys...
... hasbeenraidingRomancommerce.
The emperor has honored us with the task...
... ofseekingoutand destroyingthem .
Battle speed, hortator.
Battle speed!
Attack speed.
Attack speed!
Ramming speed.
Ramming speed!
Rest.
Halt!
Rest!
Why are you here?
I was ordered to report to you during my relief.
Oh, yes.
I'd forgotten.
You could have killed me as I lay there.
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?
I'm not ready to die.
What do you think will save you?
The God of my fathers.
Your God has forsaken you.
He has no more power than the images I pray to.
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.
I might.
Does that interest you, 41 ?
I can see that it does.
I'm a fighting man by profession, and in my leisure moments...
... itamusesme to trainfightingmen.
I own some of the best gladiators and charioteers in Rome.
Would you like to become one of them?
To die as your slave?
Better than to live in chains below these decks.
I will not be here forever.
No?
What would you do if you escaped?
Two people were condemned with me, my mother and sister...
... thoughtheywereinnocent.
I won't rest--
Do not say that you were innocent.
-Would it do any good to say it again?
-No.
Consider my offer carefully.
You will never escape while we are victorious.
If we are not, you will sink with this ship, chained to your oar.
I cannot believe that God has let me live these years...
... todiechainedtoanoar.
It's a strange, stubborn faith you keep...
... tobelievethat existence has a purpose.
A sane man would have learned to lose it long before this.
As you have.
What drove it out of you?
Go back to your oar, 41 .
Consul, enemy sighted.
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.
All the watch to battle posts.
-Stand by to load.
-Make ready to fire.
Hurry, quick!
Hurry up with that resin.
Get some more ammunition.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
Chain rowers!
Guard.
Unlock 41 .
No!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
41 , why did he do that?
I don't know.
Once before, a man helped me.
I didn't know why then.
Normal speed!
Number 1 , flame.
Fire.
Fire!
Fire!
Hold withdrawal on command.
Lift oars!
Raise!
Withdraw!
Steersman, right.
Extend oars!
Fire!
-Watch out!
-Fire!
Steersman, ram course!
Order below!
-Ramming speed!
-Ramming speed!
Consul, barge on ramming course.
We're going to be rammed!
We're going to be rammed!
Why did you save me?
Why did you have me unchained?
What is your name, 41 ?
Judah Ben-Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur...
... letmedie.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
Row well and live.
Is the sail square?
I can't tell.
Better for us both if it's the enemy.
My death.
Your freedom.
It's a Roman sail.
Face rear!
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.
Water.
The fleet, all lost?
Five galleys.
-And the battle?
-The battle was won.
You have a victory.
-It was a victory?
-Complete.
In His eagerness to save you...
... yourGodhasalsosaved the Roman fleet.
Hail Arrius!
Right oars!
You have cleared the seaways of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.
This baton of victory has been nobly won.
This man riding beside you, who is he?
The man who saved me, divine emperor, to return and serve you.
Is that all you know about him?
No.
He was accused of an attack on the governor of Judea.
But he was innocent.
If not, there's a strange inconsistency in this man...
... whotriesto killmygovernor, yet saves the life of my consul.
Come tomorrow.
We'll talk of it.
We have all the information on this man...
... amanof someinfluence in his own country.
His attack upon our governor is one upon the senate and the people of Rome.
I am convinced that no such attack was intended.
Consul, allow us to continue.
Allow us to be generous.
As a reward to you for your great victory...
... weshallnotsendhimbackto the galleys.
Take him as your slave.
Such is the will of the senate...
... andthepeopleofRome .
Not long ago, I returned to Rome...
... witha youngman who had saved my life.
You all know him as the finest charioteer in Rome.
Five times, he's driven my horses to victory.
I know him as one who stands in the place of the son I lost.
I have the love and pride in a son's achievements...
... whichI thought I should never have again.
Nothing could make stronger our bond...
... buttonightIwish to share it with you all.
The formalities of adoption have been completed.
Young Arrius is now the legal bearer of my name...
... andtheheirtomyproperty.
This ring of my ancestors...
... wouldhavegonetomyson.
So now it is yours.
It's a strange destiny that brought me to a new life...
... anewhome...
... anewfather.
It brought me here.
It may take me away.
But wherever I may be...
... Ishallalwaystry towear this ring as a son of Arrius should.
With gratitude and affection...
... andwithhonor.
My old friend Pontius Pilate, young Arrius.
Before you came to this city, my horses always won.
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.
Yes, but not swift enough to defeat you.
-Tell me, you come from Judea?
-Yes, sir.
I hear that the climate is difficult to live in.
Not for Judeans.
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.
-Of Judea?
-Yes.
I asked for Alexandria.
But it seems the wilderness needs my particular talents.
The scorpions and holy prophets can't get on without me.
Lay the dust of Judea, at least for this evening.
Goats and Jehovah.
You're leaving.
I must.
It's a journey I can't keep you from.
Your eyes have never left it all these months.
I can recognize pain.
But still, my counsel is to wait.
Gratus is to be replaced.
The governorship goes to Pontius Pilate.
When?
Very soon.
It's very much to our purpose.
Nothing is to the purpose if, when I come back to Judea, I come too late.
That is the thought which has punished me every moment I've spent here.
Will Rome see you again?
Here is a part of my life which you have made for me.
I shall remember it.
Whoever the gods are, they take small interest in an old man's hopes.
They have their way.
Forgive me.
You're a stranger here.
Would you be from Nazareth?
Why do you ask?
I thought...
... youmightbe theone--
The one that I have come back from my country to find.
He would be about your age.
Who?
When I find Him...
... IshallknowHim .
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.
Sack of flesh without brains!
No!
No!
Not the whip!
That is my host.
Gently!
Gently!
Fool!
Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood.
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run!
Go on!
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!
Beautiful horses.
Now!
Now!
They are ready!
Let them go!
Watch.
They'll never hold the turn.
No!
No!
Abadon, stop him!
Stop that whip!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill--!
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!
You think you can treat my horses like animals?
!
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!
Get off, idiot!
Drive goats, not horses!
I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.
Not a team?
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.
-Antares.
-The slow one?
He should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?
In the circus in Rome.
You have driven in the great circus?
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.
No other animal has descended so in scale...
... fromthefirstinnocentfalling of the world.
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.
Yes.
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.
Your coming here was so fit, so right.
We might have achieved wonders!
You have to go.
I make a journey which will not wait.
Ah, well, then perhaps you will come back.
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.
I have no wives.
No wives at all?
I have six, no, seven.
I've counted eight.
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.
-Someday, I hope to have one.
-One wife!
One God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.
It is not generous.
-Was the food not to your liking?
-Indeed.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.
And now I must say good night to my beauties.
When ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.
-I'll make my farewells then.
-No, no, no, stay.
Stay and see them.
Come, my children.
Come.
Strangers make them shy.
Come.
Come, do not be afraid.
Come.
There, my children.
They are descended from the Arabians of the Pharaohs...
... andI havenamedthem for the stars.
Come, Antares.
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.
What?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.
Come, Rigel.
We've both supped well, and the world is good.
There's my good Rigel.
Yes, you are ready for sleep.
The day's work done for you, eh?
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.
Good night.
Good night, my treasure.
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.
No.
You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.
You should see their mother, Mira.
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.
All right, all right.
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.
You must be strong and swift.
Go, my children.
Go.
At Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams...
... andthechampionoftheEast, Messala, with his black devils.
He stops at nothing to win.
-Messala?
ln the circus?
-Yes.
You knew him?
I know him.
Perhaps without much liking.
My people are praying for a man...
... todrivetheirteam to victory over Messala.
You could be that man, the one...
... tostamphisarrogance into the sand.
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them...
... onewhowillrulethem with love .
For him, they'd outrace the wind.
It's not possible.
That is a pity.
Think of it.
To break his pride...
... tohumblethistribunebefore the very people he has degraded.
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!
I know it is not possible.
Does it not delight your imagination?
Does it not answer your purpose?
I must deal with Messala in my own way.
And your way is to kill him.
I see this terrible thing in your eyes.
But no matter what this man has done, you have no right to kill him.
He will be punished inevitably.
I don't believe in miracles.
But all life is a miracle.
Why will you not accept God's judgment?
You do not believe in miracles.
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness...
... anda starledme to a village called Bethlehem...
... whereI foundanewbornchild in a manger.
And God lived in this child.
By now, He is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.
That is why I have returned here...
... sothatImay beathand when He comes among us.
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.
Perhaps He's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.
Perhaps He is a shepherd...
... amerchant,afisherman.
But He lives...
... andallourlivesfrom nowon will carry His mark.
There are many paths to God, my son.
I hope yours will not be too difficult.
I'm ready for sleep.
Balthasar is a good man...
... butuntilallmen are likehim, we must keep our swords bright.
And our intention true.
So I must leave you.
One last thought.
There is no law in the arena.
Many are killed.
I hope to see you again.
Fine Damascus silk.
Fine Damascus silk.
Esther?
It's Judah.
You are alive.
You are alive.
What are you doing here?
What has happened?
I'm here.
I'm with you.
Where's your father?
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.
They tortured him.
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.
You never went back to Antioch?
No.
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.
Where are my mother and sister?
Let me tell him first.
Father.
Father, something wonderful has happened.
Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
He has come home.
He is here.
Judah.
Judah Ben-Hur.
My dear old friend.
Let me look at you.
Let me see you.
Yes, yes.
It is true.
Praise God for His mercy.
Where are they?
Since that terrible day...
... therehasbeennoword ofthem.
You should have been less loyal.
Do not pity me, Master Judah.
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.
We were released on the same day.
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.
Since then, I have been his tongue...
... andhehasbeenmylegs.
Together, we make a considerable man.
Old friend.
She always said you would return.
She never gave up hope.
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.
I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.
But suppose that isn't possible.
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.
They could not make me tell them where it is.
It is there still...
... toputpowerintoourhands and buy death for the Romans.
That's not why I came back.
Judah, they are dead.
Four years.
No one could live so long in the dungeons.
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?
Yes, it is true.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You have come back to us like a returning faith.
Judah, I should like to laugh again.
-Let us laugh.
-We will.
There will be joy again in this house.
We will celebrate among the dust.
I will take him.
We stood here before.
A long while ago.
Four years.
But now it seems as if...
... onlyyesterday... .
I was saying:
"If you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye. "
"If I were not a bride...
... therewouldbe no goodbyes to be said. "
I am not a bride.
Why did you never marry?
My father needed me.
And also... .
It's still on my finger.
I said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.
It's become a part of my hand.
If Messala once knew you were here... .
As he must.
He will know where they are.
And if you should find... ?
-If he says they're dead--
-Messala will wish they were living.
I've seen too much of what hate can do.
My father is burned up with it.
But I've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater...
... andlovemorepowerfulthan hatred.
I believe it.
-Esther.
-Judah.
Stay alive.
Keep away from Messala.
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.
That time isn't yet come.
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.
This time you will be destroyed.
You'll die.
Tribune, compliments of Quintus Arrius.
He awaits your pleasure.
-Consul here?
-Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.
Thank him.
Bring him to me.
-I didn't know the consul had a son.
-He's a champion of the great circus.
Why is he presenting me with gifts?
-Perhaps he'll race against you.
-Look.
It's magnificent.
And from a man I've never met.
You're wrong, Messala.
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?
You were the magician, Messala.
You condemned me to the galleys.
When my ship was sunk, I saved the consul's life.
You know his seal?
Now I have come back...
... asI sworeIwould.
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.
You suggest I use it on myself?
What has become of my mother and my sister?
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.
Find them, Messala.
Restore them to me, and I'll forget what I vowed...
... witheverystrokeofthat oar you chained me to.
I am not the governor.
I can do nothing without approval.
Then get it.
I will come back tomorrow.
Don't disappoint me, Messala.
What became of them?
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?
Go to the citadel, Drusus.
Find out.
-And if they're dead?
-They're dead!
"Miriam, wife.
Tirzah, daughter. "
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?
E section...
... lowerlevel.
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.
Water.
Water.
Let me out!
-How long since you've seen them?
-Never.
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.
The food disappears.
Lepers.
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.
Then we'll burn out the cell.
Is someone there?
There is someone there.
Who are you?
Don't come any closer.
Who are you?
Esther.
It's Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam?
Stay where you are.
You have come home.
Stand back, Esther.
We are lepers.
Oh, Esther.
Tirzah.
Esther...
... isJudahliving?
Yes, he is alive.
He is here.
Where?
He is searching for you now.
I must find him and tell him.
-No!
-Tell my father.
No.
Tell no one.
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.
We won't return.
Judah has to be told.
No.
Please.
I couldn't see his face.
Is it changed?
No, he is not changed.
He's not changed.
You love him, Esther.
Promise me...
... onyourlovefor him ...
... youwillnevertellhim you've seen us.
Is he never to know?
Let him remember us as we were.
Promise me.
There's nothing else I can hope for.
Only this.
I promise.
I am content.
Wait.
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.
I pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.
He'll free them.
He wants to survive.
He cannot free them, Judah.
What do you mean?
I saw them.
You saw them?
Where?
When did you see them?
They were dead.
They were dead.
When?
When?
When?
!
In the prison.
When I was waiting for news of my father.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't tell you.
Nor even you, Father.
I was afraid that if you saw Messala... .
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.
It's over now.
Over?
-Judah.
-Over?
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.
Gentlemen.
Officers.
Defenders of great Rome's imperium...
... mayI enter?
Certainly, sheik.
You do us an unexpected honor.
The noble tribune is most gracious.
And now...
... thequestionyou'reasking:
Why am I here?
As you know, I am a gambling man.
The games approach.
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.
I will back my own poor horses.
No limits?
-Mark me first!
-And me!
-What odds?
-A moment, please...
... mylords,protectors of the far flung marshes.
May I first sit down?
Sit.
How much will you wager?
-Yes, let's call his game.
-Give the Arab a seat.
A bench, quickly.
Thank you.
-Now.
-1 000 denarii.
-2000!
-Mark me!
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient.
There is time.
First gentlemen, the odds.
The tribune has won many times.
The odds should be in the same measure.
What is your pleasure, gentlemen?
Two to one.
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth...
... whereisthecourage that made Rome master of the world?
I can get better odds on any street market.
Three to one.
Let us not haggle.
Let us be fair.
In four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.
-In all truth--
-Just a moment.
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.
The Prince of Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur.
Prince of Hur?
-He was sent to the galleys years ago.
-He has returned.
Returned?
lmpossible.
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.
Well?
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.
You, tribune...
... willyougivemefour toone?
Four to one.
Good.
Four to one, sheik.
The difference between a Roman and a Jew.
Or an Arab.
Bravely spoken.
Now we will settle the amount of our wager.
I will venture... .
A thousand talents?
-A thousand talents?
-Yes, a thousand talents.
Of course, if it is too much... .
A thousand talents it will be.
Agreed.
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.
You're good fellows.
If only men were this good.
Remember, Altair...
... ninetimesaroundthe circus.
Aldebaran.
Rigel, did you hear?
Nine lives to live.
My swift fellow.
You must not win the race the first time around.
You win the last time around.
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.
Steady Antares.
Like a rock.
You will be our anchor.
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.
They have taken me into their family.
Rest well, my stars.
Tomorrow we go up to the city.
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it...
... thenewswillscorchthestreets of the Roman world.
Pontius Pilate here?
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.
You will make him see what men are born in this land.
I only know that I race against Messala.
Look for the yoke.
Ease that strap.
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.
Into Your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as You will.
The Star of David.
To shine out for your people and my people together...
... andblindtheeyesofRome.
They are ready.
Easy, girl, easy.
Number five.
Where is number five?
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.
Yes, this is the day.
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.
Hail, Jupiter.
Give me victory.
Watch your line!
Keep your places!
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.
Citizens...
... Iwelcomeyoutothesegames in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.
We dedicate them to his glory...
... andtothegloryofRome...
... ofwhichyouare all part.
Let us honor those who race for us today.
They come here from Alexandria...
... Messina...
... Carthage...
... Cyprus...
... Rome...
... Corinth...
... Athens...
... Phrygia...
... andJudea.
To the best of these, a crown of victory.
The race begins.
Hail, Caesar!
Come, my children, come!
The Roman pig!
Salute.
A great victory.
You are the people's one true god...
... forthetimebeing.
Permit us to worship.
I crown their god.
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.
A long life, young Arrius and the good sense to live it.
We cannot wait, tribune.
He will come.
He will--
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.
He will come!
He will come.
I've sent for him, and he will come.
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.
Do you understand?
To hack the legs off me?
Not yet.
Not till I've seen him.
I don't receive him with half a body.
No!
I told you, Drusus.
I told you.
Here he is.
Triumph complete, Judah.
The race won.
The enemy destroyed.
I see no enemy.
What do you think you see?
The smashed body of a wretched animal?
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.
Let me help you.
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.
Dead.
And the race over.
It isn't over, Judah.
They're not dead.
Where are they?
Where are they?
Look for them...
... intheValleyoftheLepers...
... ifyoucanrecognizethem .
It goes on.
It goes on, Judah.
The race... .
The race is not over.
Is there a way down here?
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.
Man.
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.
There are many women.
Of the family of Hur.
We have no names here.
For them?
-Why did you say they were dead?
-It was what they wanted.
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?
Not to see them?
They are coming.
Love them in the way they must need to be loved.
Not to look at them.
Let them be as if you had never come here.
Please!
Is Judah well?
Is he happy?
Yes, he is well.
Your mind can be at rest for him.
He is well, Miriam.
God be with you.
They have gone.
We can go back.
Go back to what?
Judah, they have one blessing left.
To think you remember them as they were...
... andliveyourown life.
Forget what is here.
Forget?
It's as though they're alive in a grave.
-But what can you do?
-Undo what you've done.
How could you have suffered them to come here?
I must see them.
No, Judah, please!
Judah!
Think, Judah, think.
It would tear them apart if they see you.
He is here.
I have found Him.
The child has become a man.
And the man, I know it now, is the Son of God.
The promise is true.
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.
Life has been answered.
God has answered it.
Come.
Come with me.
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys...
... thirsthadnearlykilledme.
A man gave me water to drink.
I went on living.
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.
No.
I am thirsty still.
Come and listen.
I have business with Rome.
You insist on death.
Goodbye, Judah.
You sent for me?
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.
-I honor him.
-As you may honor yourself.
You have been made a citizen of Rome.
Do you say nothing to this?
I have just come from the Valley of Stone...
... wheremymotherand sisterlive what's left of their lives.
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.
I have heard this.
There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.
Where there is greatness, great government or power...
... evengreatfeelingorcompassion...
... erroralsois great.
We progress and mature by fault.
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.
There are other voices.
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place...
... nottocrucifyyourself on a shadow such as old resentment...
... orimpossibleloyalties.
Perfect freedom has no existence.
A grown man knows the world he lives in.
And for the present, the world is Rome.
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.
I am Judah Ben-Hur.
I cross this floor in spoken friendship...
... asI wouldspeaktoArrius.
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar...
... readytocrushthose who challenge his authority.
There are too many men of envy and ambition...
... whotryto disrupt the government of Rome.
You have become the victor and hero to those people.
They look to you, their one true god, as I call you.
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.
I am already part of this tragedy.
Return this to Arrius.
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you...
... frompersonaldisaster if you stay here.
You are too great a danger.
Leave Judea.
You have my word.
I was afraid you would never come back...
... afraidofwhatwouldhappentoyou .
But I see you again.
Your father's waiting for me.
Where is he?
What do you mean to do?
Rest, sleep.
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.
Peace?
Love and peace.
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?
Where do you see them?
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.
Balthasar's word.
He is more than Balthasar's word.
His voiced traveled with such a still purpose.
It was more than a voice.
A man more than a man.
He said, "Blessed are the merciful...
... fortheyshallobtainmercy.
Blessed are the peacemakers...
... fortheyshallbecalled the children of God. "
Children of God?
In that dead valley where we left them?
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean...
... untilwehavescouredoff our bodies the crust and filth...
... ofbeingat themercyoftyranny.
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.
-In blood?
-Yes, in blood!
I know there is a law in life.
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.
Death generates death...
... asthevulturebreedsthevulture.
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:
"Love your enemy.
Do good to those who despitefully use you. "
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.
As you make us do now.
Are we to bear nothing together?
Even love?
I can hardly draw breath...
... withoutfeelingyouinmyheart .
But I know...
... thateverythingIdo from this moment...
... bearsgreaterpain than you have ever suffered.
It is better not to love me.
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy...
... givingevilforevil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.
It's as though you had become Messala.
I've lost you, Judah.
No further.
What are you doing here?
I was here last evening waiting for you.
I have waited all night.
What has happened?
Where is Tirzah?
Leave the food.
I am coming closer.
Don't be afraid.
-What are you doing?
-Don't be afraid.
I've heard Him again, the man from Nazareth.
If ever words were from God, they are in everything He says.
I cannot bear that you should have never known...
... thishandof quiet reaching towards us.
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find Him there.
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find Him.
Tirzah is dying.
Leave the food and go.
It's Judah.
Why did you tell him?
Yes, Judah, yes.
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.
Mother.
Wait, Mother, wait.
Let me talk with you.
Please.
No, no further.
Please.
No, Judah.
Son, no.
Mother, let me see Tirzah.
Tirzah is dying.
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know...
... thatlifeis everlasting...
... anddeathis nothingtofear if you have faith.
I will take them to Him.
No!
God, no!
No, no, dear son.
Mother...
... whereisTirzah?
Judah, no.
Judah, no.
You must not go to her, dear son.
Please.
Dear son.
I am afraid.
No cause.
The world is more than we know.
Tirzah, it's Judah.
No, Judah.
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
-Why are the streets deserted?
-They have gone to the trial.
Trial?
Whose trial?
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.
-This cannot be true.
-Alms?
What has he done?
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.
Help for the blind.
-Look, lepers!
-Lepers!
Get away!
Stay away!
Go away!
Lepers!
Lepers!
How can this be?
I know this man.
Will someone help Him?
Take pity on Him.
Have mercy.
In His pain...
... thislookof peace.
Watch over them, Esther.
We must go back.
I brought you here to this...
... whenI hoped... .
You haven't failed, Esther.
Hail King of the Jews!
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.
He gave me water...
... anda heartto live.
What has He done to merit this?
He has taken the world of our sins onto Himself.
To this end He said He was born...
... inthatstable...
... whereI firstsawHim .
For this cause, He came into the world.
For this death?
This beginning.
I have lived too long.
As though He were carrying in that cross...
... thepainof theworld.
So fearful, and yet why is it...
... I'mnotafraidanymore?
The shadow of a storm.
A strange darkness...
... butstillday.
His life is over.
What is it?
This tearing.
I am in pain.
I feel it too.
Do you see your hand?
Almost at the moment He died...
... IheardHimsay , "Father, forgive them...
... fortheyknownot whatthey do."
Even then.
Even then.
And I felt His voice take the sword out of my hand.
In the year of our Lord Judea, for nearly a century, had lain under the mastery of Rome.
In the seventh year of the reign ofAugustus Caesar an imperial decree ordered every Judean each to return to his place of birth to be counted and taxed.
Converging ways of many of them led to their capital city, Jerusalem the troubled heart of their land.
The old city was dominated by the fortress ofAntonia the seat of Roman power and by the great golden temple the outward sign of an inward and imperishable faith.
Even while they obeyed the will of Caesar the people clung proudly to their ancient heritage always remembering the promise of their prophets that one day there would be born among them a redeemer to bring them salvation and perfect freedom.
You'll be counted at Hebron.
-Name?
-Samuel.
-What city?
-Joppa.
-What family?
-Michael.
-Move on.
Move on.
-Yes.
-Name?
-Joseph.
-What city?
-Nazareth.
-What family?
-David of Bethlehem.
And the woman?
My wife.
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.
Come on, come on.
What village is this?
Nazareth.
We should arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow night.
You're not watching the soldiers, Joseph?
We've seen Romans before.
Yes...
... andwewillsee themagain.
My table is not finished.
Where is your son?
He's walking in the hills.
He neglects his work, Joseph.
No.
Once, I reproached him with forgetting his work.
He said to me:
"I must be about my father's business. "
Then why isn't he here, working?
He's working.
Trumpeters of the legion!
Welcome, Messala.
The command is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for relieving me.
Drusus...
... whenI wasaboy ,Idreamed of commanding this garrison.
Now the wheel has turned.
I am in command.
Attention!
Aisle one, face right!
Forward!
I'd forgotten the heat.
If it were only the heat.
I lived here until I was 1 4.
Jerusalem was my home.
-My father was head of--
-Yes, I know.
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.
If there can be such a thing in this forsaken land.
If you want to rise, Sextus, do the difficult.
I asked to be sent here.
You'll find the people changed since you were a boy.
In what way?
Oh, won't pay their taxes, an irrational resentment of Rome... .
There's nothing new in all that.
And then there's religion.
I tell you, they're drunk with religion.
They smash the statues of our gods, even those of the emperor.
Punish them.
We do.
When we can find them.
Find the leaders.
You don't know.
There's nothing you can put your finger on.
There are strange forces at work here.
This "messiah" business--
I know.
There was one predicted when I was a boy.
A king of the Jews, who will lead them into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.
Makes your head spin.
There's a wild man in the desert named John...
... whodrownspeopleinwater.
And a carpenter's son who does magic tricks. "Miracles" they call them.
There's always a rabble-rouser stirring up trouble.
No, no, no.
This man is different.
He teaches that God is near, in every man.
It's actually quite profound, some of it.
You've been too long away from Rome.
Go back, Sextus.
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea...
... andforgetthat God is in every man.
-There is divinity in only one man.
-Yes, I know.
The emperor is displeased.
He wishes Judea made into a more obedient and disciplined province.
He's ordered me to restore order.
I shall carry out his wishes.
How?
You can break a man's skull, arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.
But how do you control this?
How do you fight an idea?
Especially a new idea.
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.
I assume he has a name.
-He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
-Then treat him like one!
Tell him I will join him.
Yes, tribune.
Centurion!
This was his country before it was ours.
Don't forget that.
Yes, tribune.
Very wise.
This Ben-Hur is the richest man in Jerusalem.
And the head of one of the greatest families in Judea.
We were friends as boys.
We were like brothers.
Sextus...
... youaskhowtofightanidea.
Well, I'll tell you how.
With another idea.
I said I'd come back.
I never thought you would.
I'm so glad.
-Look at you.
-Look at you!
You've come back a tribune.
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.
We'll drink another now.
-Your sister and mother?
-They're fine.
They've talked of you ever since we knew you were coming.
-Is Tirzah married?
-No.
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.
She's been in love with you since she was 5.
I can't wait to see them.
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?
Or have you become too dignified?
-Down Eros, up Mars!
-Down Eros, up Mars!
Where the beams cross?
Good.
After all these years!
Still close.
In every way.
I hope so.
I know.
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew...
... whoselifeyouoncesaved.
The best thing I ever did.
Judah...
... itwillbe verydifficult to govern here.
I'm going to need help.
Your help.
Your advice.
-You want my advice?
-Yes, I do.
Withdraw your legions.
Give us our freedom.
Unfortunately, the emperor is devoted to his empire.
He's particularly fond of Judea.
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.
Is there anything so sad as unrequited love?
My quarters.
A bit grim.
Not grim.
Austere.
Virtuous.
Roman.
I'm going to be second-in-command to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.
He's coming in a few days with more legions.
Then the rumors are true.
The emperor does not approve of your countrymen.
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.
But you and your family need have no concern.
I'm next in authority to the governor, and you're my friend.
-I'm a Jew.
-Ah, you are like a Roman!
What have you in common with the troublemaking rabble?
-They're my people.
I'm one of them.
-Be wise, Judah.
It's a Roman world.
If you want to live in it, you must become part of it.
You've changed.
I've grown up.
I've seen the world since I left Jerusalem.
I've seen Rome.
It's no accident that one small village on the Tiber...
... waschosento rulethe world.
Your legions.
It wasn't just our legions.
Other countries have armies, fine armies.
I know, I fought them.
Oh, no.
No, it was fate that chose us to civilize the world.
And we have.
Our roads and ships connect every corner of the earth.
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.
I believe in the future of my people.
Of course you do.
And you can help them.
How?
You're an aristocrat.
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince to your people.
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.
They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.
Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.
It is worse than stupid, futile!
For it can end in only one way, extinction for your people!
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.
Then we're agreed!
Now, when can I come to see your family?
-We had hoped tomorrow.
-Good.
And now for our toast.
It's dreadful wine, by the way.
It's especially fermented for the Roman army.
You're very cruel to your conquerors.
It's an insane world.
But in it there is one sanity:
The loyalty of old friends.
Judah, we must believe in one another.
Will you drink to that?
With all my heart.
Here it is, the place I've remembered.
The court where we played at changing the guard.
The roof where we'd throw pebbles at people in the street and then hide.
-We were rascals, weren't we?
-No, you were good boys.
I would have that time again.
And here it is.
Nothing has changed.
Except for the fountain.
-The old well would go dry, remember?
-Promptly, every summer.
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.
-He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
-No?
Of course he has.
He was a boy when he left us, now he's a man.
With great responsibilities.
Come.
The emperor builds and builds, turning brick to marble.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.
I've never seen anything like this before.
It's beautiful!
-Is it Roman?
-It's Libyan.
I was there last year.
A tremendous campaign.
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.
Or was, till we destroyed it.
Now it's nothing but ashes.
I'm boring you with soldier stories.
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.
Thank you for this.
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.
What do you think of it?
Magnificent.
It's Arabic.
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.
Let me try him sometime.
Whenever you like.
He's yours.
Do you mean you'll give me this?
Oh, Judah.
You are good.
It's going to be like old times, I know it.
Judah, tell me, did you...
... thinkaboutwhatIsaid ?
Yes.
Talked to a number of people already.
Spoken against violence, against incidents.
Most of the men agree with me.
Most?
Not all?
No, not all.
Who does not agree?
Well, the resentful, the impatient.
Who are they?
Yes, Judah.
Who are they?
Would I retain your friendship if I became an informer?
Telling the names of criminals is not informing.
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.
Patriots?
!
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.
This is my great opportunity, and yours too.
If I bring order here, I can have any post I want.
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?
Rome!
Yes, perhaps at the side of Caesar himself.
I mean it.
It can happen and this is the moment.
I swear, this is the time.
The emperor is watching us, judging us.
All I need do is serve him.
And all you need do is help me serve him.
-You speak as if he were God.
-He is God.
The only God.
He is power, real power on earth, not--
Not that.
Help me, Judah.
I would do anything for you, Messala...
... exceptbetraymy ownpeople.
In the name of all the gods, what do the lives of a few Jews mean to you?
If I cannot persuade them, that does not mean I would help you murder them.
Besides, you must understand this, Messala.
I believe in the past and future of my people.
Future?
You are a conquered people.
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?
Joshua will not rise again to save you nor David.
There is only one reality in the world today.
Look to the West.
Don't be a fool!
Look to Rome!
Better a fool than a traitor or a killer.
-I am a soldier.
-Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.
-I warn you--
-No!
I warn you.
Rome is an affront to God.
Rome is strangling my people and my country, the whole earth!
But not forever.
And I tell you, the day Rome falls there will be a shout of freedom...
... suchastheworld has never heard before.
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.
You're either for me or against me.
If that is the choice...
... thenI amagainstyou .
There they are.
Where's Messala?
-Where's--?
-He's gone.
Gone?
-But why?
-He couldn't stay.
-What happened?
-A new tribune must have many duties.
Come.
Let us have dinner.
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the world...
... whobringethto us bread from the earth.
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.
He wanted to use me to betray our people.
-Master, the caravan from Antioch.
-Yes, Amrah, I saw.
Simonides.
-Oh, welcome homecoming.
-Master.
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.
And for the master, lberian wine.
Not to mention the best gift of all, your presence.
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.
-Caravans from Petra.
-Have all arrived.
-Good.
-Here is the accounting.
And what of Numidia?
The trade route is ours, guaranteed by treaty with the king.
Once a year, you bring your accounting.
And once a year, I find myself wealthier.
Yeah, but my greatest treasure is my steward.
My life belongs to the House of Hur.
Nothing else exists for me, except my daughter.
-She must be a young woman by now.
-Yes, and your property.
She was born the daughter of your slave.
When I inherited you, I inherited a friend, not a slave.
Still, Esther has come with me from Antioch for your permission to marry.
It's granted.
I wish you the joy of many grandchildren.
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.
With your permission, Esther wishes to speak to her master.
You're eager to marry, Esther?
It is my father's wish.
Your husband will be fortunate.
What is his name?
David, son of Mathias.
Of what house?
-His own, master.
-He is a freeman.
Tell me more about him.
I have seen him only once.
He is a merchant, well-thought-of in Antioch.
He will pay for Esther's freedom.
Her freedom will be my wedding gift to Esther.
You are generous, master.
Do you love this man?
I will learn to love him.
You have my permission to marry.
We'll drink to your happiness.
And a safe return to Antioch.
I disturbed you.
No.
What were you thinking?
I was saying goodbye...
... tothiscity...
... andthishouse.
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?
My father sometimes brought me here...
... whenI waslittle.
It was a house where I was always happy.
Except once.
When you and your friend, the Roman boy--
-Messala.
-Yes.
You had been out hunting...
... andtheybroughtyou homeinjured.
I touched your face as you lay there...
... andprayedto God, "Don't let this boy die. "
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.
Yes, master.
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.
It's strange.
I hardly felt a slave.
And now...
... Ihardlyfeelfree.
You know, in the old, wise days of Solomon...
... iftherewasamonghisslaves...
... somegirlwhofilledhiseyes...
... hecouldchooseher out from the rest...
... andtakehertohim.
Wise days of Solomon.
Different days.
And long ago.
If you were not a bride...
... Ishouldkissyou goodbye.
If I were not a bride...
... therewouldbe no goodbyes to be said.
Your slave ring.
Fair exchange.
Freedom to you.
The ring to me.
You will wear it?
Until you meet the woman you will marry?
Until then.
The gods favor my lord Gratus.
If it is the governor's pleasure, the wreath of office.
Thank you, tribune.
I see no delegation from the city.
-There will not be one, sir.
-No?
Jerusalem's welcome will not be a warm one.
But I pledge, my lord, it will be a quiet one.
Let us proceed.
There's Messala.
He saw you, Judah.
The new governor.
Stand back!
-Stand back.
-You, come!
Had to be the Jews!
Open up in the name of the divine emperor!
Judah!
Tirzah!
What is it?
What's happened?
Open up in the name of the law!
-I was watching the--
-A tile fell and struck the governor.
-It wasn't my fault.
-They won't believe her.
She won't have to say anything.
You hear?
Tirzah, say nothing.
Open the gates!
I'll speak to them.
-Arrest him!
-Let me tell you what happened.
-Hold those women.
-Stop them!
It was an accident.
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.
-This is the man, sir.
We saw him.
-It was an accident.
-Accident?
-I swear it.
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose.
It gave way.
Take him.
Take all of them.
-He's telling the truth!
-It was me!
Let them go!
Attention!
Messala.
In the name of God, tell them it's a mistake.
I leaned on the tile, and it broke loose.
It was an accident.
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!
Let the servants go.
Let them go.
Return to your ranks.
Come.
Where?
Tirus.
Tirus?
I've had no trial.
I'm to die in the galleys without even a trial?
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!
Wait.
My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?
Tie his hands.
-At least tell me if they're safe.
-I can tell you nothing.
Get along.
Keep moving.
Jailer!
Guard, in there!
Up the stairs!
Jailer!
Jailer!
To the right.
-Wait!
-Send them out.
Go!
The door.
Where are my mother and sister?
Where are they?
Here, within these walls.
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.
Of course, they will be sentenced.
Is it possible?
Is it possible you could do this to us?
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?
You will let them go.
You will gladly let them go!
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not a murderer!
I know you're not.
You know?
You are evil.
No, Judah, I am not evil.
I wanted your help.
Now you've given it to me.
By making this example of you, I discourage treason.
By condemning without hesitation an old friend, I shall be feared.
But not my family.
Let them go.
Please.
-Messala, I beg you.
-Beg?
!
Didn't I beg you?
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.
Kill me, and your mother and sister will die...
... nailedtocrossesinfrontofyou !
Go on, Judah.
Kill me!
May God grant me vengeance.
I will pray that you live till I return.
Return?
Take him.
Sentries, salute.
The tribune will see you now.
Tribune, I'm steward of the House of Hur.
I remember you.
We were on our way to Antioch when we heard what had happened.
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done this thing.
You knew him, tribune.
Better than you.
Then there must be no doubt in your mind, the charge is groundless.
The prisoners have been sentenced.
-Sentenced?
-But there's no truth in it.
There was never a threat against the governor in Judah's mind.
Surely you must know he would never have done this.
In your heart, you must know it.
Drusus.
This man had better be kept here until we can question him.
Hold!
Water for the soldiers.
Soldiers first!
Get away from that well.
No water for them!
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!
Come on, you!
Water for the horses!
-Water.
Water.
-Soldiers first!
Here.
Wait.
No water for him.
God...
... helpme.
You!
I said no water for him!
All right, on your feet, all of you!
Get them on their feet!
Back in line, you dog!
On your feet!
Get them going!
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!
Forward, you dogs!
Soon, the counselor's barge will be coming alongside.
Be ready to raise oars.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.
-How many rowers?
-Two hundred, consul.
-And reliefs?
-Of 30, every hour.
This man is ill.
Replace him.
-Change him.
-Right, sir.
-This man's been giving you trouble?
-He's insubordinate, consul.
That will stop.
What service have you seen?
Forty-one.
A month's less a day in this ship.
You keep an exact account.
And before?
Three years in other ships.
Three years.
You have the spirit to fight back...
... butthegoodsensetocontrolit.
Your eyes are full of hate, 41 .
That's good.
Hate keeps a man alive.
It gives him strength.
Now, listen to me, all of you.
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
So row well...
... andlive.
-Ship ready, consul.
-Strike oars.
Strike oars!
You know a fleet of Macedonian galleys...
... hasbeenraidingRomancommerce.
The emperor has honored us with the task...
... ofseekingoutand destroyingthem .
Battle speed, hortator.
Battle speed!
Attack speed.
Attack speed!
Ramming speed.
Ramming speed!
Rest.
Halt!
Rest!
Why are you here?
I was ordered to report to you during my relief.
Oh, yes.
I'd forgotten.
You could have killed me as I lay there.
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?
I'm not ready to die.
What do you think will save you?
The God of my fathers.
Your God has forsaken you.
He has no more power than the images I pray to.
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.
I might.
Does that interest you, 41 ?
I can see that it does.
I'm a fighting man by profession, and in my leisure moments...
... itamusesme to trainfightingmen.
I own some of the best gladiators and charioteers in Rome.
Would you like to become one of them?
To die as your slave?
Better than to live in chains below these decks.
I will not be here forever.
No?
What would you do if you escaped?
Two people were condemned with me, my mother and sister...
... thoughtheywereinnocent.
I won't rest--
Do not say that you were innocent.
-Would it do any good to say it again?
-No.
Consider my offer carefully.
You will never escape while we are victorious.
If we are not, you will sink with this ship, chained to your oar.
I cannot believe that God has let me live these years...
... todiechainedtoanoar.
It's a strange, stubborn faith you keep...
... tobelievethat existence has a purpose.
A sane man would have learned to lose it long before this.
As you have.
What drove it out of you?
Go back to your oar, 41 .
Consul, enemy sighted.
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.
All the watch to battle posts.
-Stand by to load.
-Make ready to fire.
Hurry, quick!
Hurry up with that resin.
Get some more ammunition.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
Chain rowers!
Guard.
Unlock 41 .
No!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
41 , why did he do that?
I don't know.
Once before, a man helped me.
I didn't know why then.
Normal speed!
Number 1 , flame.
Fire.
Fire!
Fire!
Hold withdrawal on command.
Lift oars!
Raise!
Withdraw!
Steersman, right.
Extend oars!
Fire!
-Watch out!
-Fire!
Steersman, ram course!
Order below!
-Ramming speed!
-Ramming speed!
Consul, barge on ramming course.
We're going to be rammed!
We're going to be rammed!
Why did you save me?
Why did you have me unchained?
What is your name, 41 ?
Judah Ben-Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur...
... letmedie.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
Row well and live.
Is the sail square?
I can't tell.
Better for us both if it's the enemy.
My death.
Your freedom.
It's a Roman sail.
Face rear!
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.
Water.
The fleet, all lost?
Five galleys.
-And the battle?
-The battle was won.
You have a victory.
-It was a victory?
-Complete.
In His eagerness to save you...
... yourGodhasalsosaved the Roman fleet.
Hail Arrius!
Right oars!
You have cleared the seaways of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.
This baton of victory has been nobly won.
This man riding beside you, who is he?
The man who saved me, divine emperor, to return and serve you.
Is that all you know about him?
No.
He was accused of an attack on the governor of Judea.
But he was innocent.
If not, there's a strange inconsistency in this man...
... whotriesto killmygovernor, yet saves the life of my consul.
Come tomorrow.
We'll talk of it.
We have all the information on this man...
... amanof someinfluence in his own country.
His attack upon our governor is one upon the senate and the people of Rome.
I am convinced that no such attack was intended.
Consul, allow us to continue.
Allow us to be generous.
As a reward to you for your great victory...
... weshallnotsendhimbackto the galleys.
Take him as your slave.
Such is the will of the senate...
... andthepeopleofRome .
Not long ago, I returned to Rome...
... witha youngman who had saved my life.
You all know him as the finest charioteer in Rome.
Five times, he's driven my horses to victory.
I know him as one who stands in the place of the son I lost.
I have the love and pride in a son's achievements...
... whichI thought I should never have again.
Nothing could make stronger our bond...
... buttonightIwish to share it with you all.
The formalities of adoption have been completed.
Young Arrius is now the legal bearer of my name...
... andtheheirtomyproperty.
This ring of my ancestors...
... wouldhavegonetomyson.
So now it is yours.
It's a strange destiny that brought me to a new life...
... anewhome...
... anewfather.
It brought me here.
It may take me away.
But wherever I may be...
... Ishallalwaystry towear this ring as a son of Arrius should.
With gratitude and affection...
... andwithhonor.
My old friend Pontius Pilate, young Arrius.
Before you came to this city, my horses always won.
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.
Yes, but not swift enough to defeat you.
-Tell me, you come from Judea?
-Yes, sir.
I hear that the climate is difficult to live in.
Not for Judeans.
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.
-Of Judea?
-Yes.
I asked for Alexandria.
But it seems the wilderness needs my particular talents.
The scorpions and holy prophets can't get on without me.
Lay the dust of Judea, at least for this evening.
Goats and Jehovah.
You're leaving.
I must.
It's a journey I can't keep you from.
Your eyes have never left it all these months.
I can recognize pain.
But still, my counsel is to wait.
Gratus is to be replaced.
The governorship goes to Pontius Pilate.
When?
Very soon.
It's very much to our purpose.
Nothing is to the purpose if, when I come back to Judea, I come too late.
That is the thought which has punished me every moment I've spent here.
Will Rome see you again?
Here is a part of my life which you have made for me.
I shall remember it.
Whoever the gods are, they take small interest in an old man's hopes.
They have their way.
Forgive me.
You're a stranger here.
Would you be from Nazareth?
Why do you ask?
I thought...
... youmightbe theone--
The one that I have come back from my country to find.
He would be about your age.
Who?
When I find Him...
... IshallknowHim .
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.
Sack of flesh without brains!
No!
No!
Not the whip!
That is my host.
Gently!
Gently!
Fool!
Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood.
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run!
Go on!
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!
Beautiful horses.
Now!
Now!
They are ready!
Let them go!
Watch.
They'll never hold the turn.
No!
No!
Abadon, stop him!
Stop that whip!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill--!
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!
You think you can treat my horses like animals?
!
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!
Get off, idiot!
Drive goats, not horses!
I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.
Not a team?
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.
-Antares.
-The slow one?
He should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?
In the circus in Rome.
You have driven in the great circus?
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.
No other animal has descended so in scale...
... fromthefirstinnocentfalling of the world.
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.
Yes.
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.
Your coming here was so fit, so right.
We might have achieved wonders!
You have to go.
I make a journey which will not wait.
Ah, well, then perhaps you will come back.
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.
I have no wives.
No wives at all?
I have six, no, seven.
I've counted eight.
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.
-Someday, I hope to have one.
-One wife!
One God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.
It is not generous.
-Was the food not to your liking?
-Indeed.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.
And now I must say good night to my beauties.
When ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.
-I'll make my farewells then.
-No, no, no, stay.
Stay and see them.
Come, my children.
Come.
Strangers make them shy.
Come.
Come, do not be afraid.
Come.
There, my children.
They are descended from the Arabians of the Pharaohs...
... andI havenamedthem for the stars.
Come, Antares.
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.
What?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.
Come, Rigel.
We've both supped well, and the world is good.
There's my good Rigel.
Yes, you are ready for sleep.
The day's work done for you, eh?
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.
Good night.
Good night, my treasure.
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.
No.
You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.
You should see their mother, Mira.
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.
All right, all right.
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.
You must be strong and swift.
Go, my children.
Go.
At Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams...
... andthechampionoftheEast, Messala, with his black devils.
He stops at nothing to win.
-Messala?
ln the circus?
-Yes.
You knew him?
I know him.
Perhaps without much liking.
My people are praying for a man...
... todrivetheirteam to victory over Messala.
You could be that man, the one...
... tostamphisarrogance into the sand.
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them...
... onewhowillrulethem with love .
For him, they'd outrace the wind.
It's not possible.
That is a pity.
Think of it.
To break his pride...
... tohumblethistribunebefore the very people he has degraded.
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!
I know it is not possible.
Does it not delight your imagination?
Does it not answer your purpose?
I must deal with Messala in my own way.
And your way is to kill him.
I see this terrible thing in your eyes.
But no matter what this man has done, you have no right to kill him.
He will be punished inevitably.
I don't believe in miracles.
But all life is a miracle.
Why will you not accept God's judgment?
You do not believe in miracles.
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness...
... anda starledme to a village called Bethlehem...
... whereI foundanewbornchild in a manger.
And God lived in this child.
By now, He is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.
That is why I have returned here...
... sothatImay beathand when He comes among us.
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.
Perhaps He's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.
Perhaps He is a shepherd...
... amerchant,afisherman.
But He lives...
... andallourlivesfrom nowon will carry His mark.
There are many paths to God, my son.
I hope yours will not be too difficult.
I'm ready for sleep.
Balthasar is a good man...
... butuntilallmen are likehim, we must keep our swords bright.
And our intention true.
So I must leave you.
One last thought.
There is no law in the arena.
Many are killed.
I hope to see you again.
Fine Damascus silk.
Fine Damascus silk.
Esther?
It's Judah.
You are alive.
You are alive.
What are you doing here?
What has happened?
I'm here.
I'm with you.
Where's your father?
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.
They tortured him.
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.
You never went back to Antioch?
No.
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.
Where are my mother and sister?
Let me tell him first.
Father.
Father, something wonderful has happened.
Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
He has come home.
He is here.
Judah.
Judah Ben-Hur.
My dear old friend.
Let me look at you.
Let me see you.
Yes, yes.
It is true.
Praise God for His mercy.
Where are they?
Since that terrible day...
... therehasbeennoword ofthem.
You should have been less loyal.
Do not pity me, Master Judah.
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.
We were released on the same day.
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.
Since then, I have been his tongue...
... andhehasbeenmylegs.
Together, we make a considerable man.
Old friend.
She always said you would return.
She never gave up hope.
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.
I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.
But suppose that isn't possible.
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.
They could not make me tell them where it is.
It is there still...
... toputpowerintoourhands and buy death for the Romans.
That's not why I came back.
Judah, they are dead.
Four years.
No one could live so long in the dungeons.
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?
Yes, it is true.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You have come back to us like a returning faith.
Judah, I should like to laugh again.
-Let us laugh.
-We will.
There will be joy again in this house.
We will celebrate among the dust.
I will take him.
We stood here before.
A long while ago.
Four years.
But now it seems as if...
... onlyyesterday... .
I was saying:
"If you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye. "
"If I were not a bride...
... therewouldbe no goodbyes to be said. "
I am not a bride.
Why did you never marry?
My father needed me.
And also... .
It's still on my finger.
I said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.
It's become a part of my hand.
If Messala once knew you were here... .
As he must.
He will know where they are.
And if you should find... ?
-If he says they're dead--
-Messala will wish they were living.
I've seen too much of what hate can do.
My father is burned up with it.
But I've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater...
... andlovemorepowerfulthan hatred.
I believe it.
-Esther.
-Judah.
Stay alive.
Keep away from Messala.
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.
That time isn't yet come.
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.
This time you will be destroyed.
You'll die.
Tribune, compliments of Quintus Arrius.
He awaits your pleasure.
-Consul here?
-Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.
Thank him.
Bring him to me.
-I didn't know the consul had a son.
-He's a champion of the great circus.
Why is he presenting me with gifts?
-Perhaps he'll race against you.
-Look.
It's magnificent.
And from a man I've never met.
You're wrong, Messala.
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?
You were the magician, Messala.
You condemned me to the galleys.
When my ship was sunk, I saved the consul's life.
You know his seal?
Now I have come back...
... asI sworeIwould.
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.
You suggest I use it on myself?
What has become of my mother and my sister?
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.
Find them, Messala.
Restore them to me, and I'll forget what I vowed...
... witheverystrokeofthat oar you chained me to.
I am not the governor.
I can do nothing without approval.
Then get it.
I will come back tomorrow.
Don't disappoint me, Messala.
What became of them?
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?
Go to the citadel, Drusus.
Find out.
-And if they're dead?
-They're dead!
"Miriam, wife.
Tirzah, daughter. "
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?
E section...
... lowerlevel.
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.
Water.
Water.
Let me out!
-How long since you've seen them?
-Never.
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.
The food disappears.
Lepers.
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.
Then we'll burn out the cell.
Is someone there?
There is someone there.
Who are you?
Don't come any closer.
Who are you?
Esther.
It's Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam?
Stay where you are.
You have come home.
Stand back, Esther.
We are lepers.
Oh, Esther.
Tirzah.
Esther...
... isJudahliving?
Yes, he is alive.
He is here.
Where?
He is searching for you now.
I must find him and tell him.
-No!
-Tell my father.
No.
Tell no one.
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.
We won't return.
Judah has to be told.
No.
Please.
I couldn't see his face.
Is it changed?
No, he is not changed.
He's not changed.
You love him, Esther.
Promise me...
... onyourlovefor him ...
... youwillnevertellhim you've seen us.
Is he never to know?
Let him remember us as we were.
Promise me.
There's nothing else I can hope for.
Only this.
I promise.
I am content.
Wait.
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.
I pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.
He'll free them.
He wants to survive.
He cannot free them, Judah.
What do you mean?
I saw them.
You saw them?
Where?
When did you see them?
They were dead.
They were dead.
When?
When?
When?
!
In the prison.
When I was waiting for news of my father.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't tell you.
Nor even you, Father.
I was afraid that if you saw Messala... .
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.
It's over now.
Over?
-Judah.
-Over?
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.
Gentlemen.
Officers.
Defenders of great Rome's imperium...
... mayI enter?
Certainly, sheik.
You do us an unexpected honor.
The noble tribune is most gracious.
And now...
... thequestionyou'reasking:
Why am I here?
As you know, I am a gambling man.
The games approach.
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.
I will back my own poor horses.
No limits?
-Mark me first!
-And me!
-What odds?
-A moment, please...
... mylords,protectors of the far flung marshes.
May I first sit down?
Sit.
How much will you wager?
-Yes, let's call his game.
-Give the Arab a seat.
A bench, quickly.
Thank you.
-Now.
-1 000 denarii.
-2000!
-Mark me!
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient.
There is time.
First gentlemen, the odds.
The tribune has won many times.
The odds should be in the same measure.
What is your pleasure, gentlemen?
Two to one.
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth...
... whereisthecourage that made Rome master of the world?
I can get better odds on any street market.
Three to one.
Let us not haggle.
Let us be fair.
In four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.
-In all truth--
-Just a moment.
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.
The Prince of Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur.
Prince of Hur?
-He was sent to the galleys years ago.
-He has returned.
Returned?
lmpossible.
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.
Well?
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.
You, tribune...
... willyougivemefour toone?
Four to one.
Good.
Four to one, sheik.
The difference between a Roman and a Jew.
Or an Arab.
Bravely spoken.
Now we will settle the amount of our wager.
I will venture... .
A thousand talents?
-A thousand talents?
-Yes, a thousand talents.
Of course, if it is too much... .
A thousand talents it will be.
Agreed.
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.
You're good fellows.
If only men were this good.
Remember, Altair...
... ninetimesaroundthe circus.
Aldebaran.
Rigel, did you hear?
Nine lives to live.
My swift fellow.
You must not win the race the first time around.
You win the last time around.
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.
Steady Antares.
Like a rock.
You will be our anchor.
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.
They have taken me into their family.
Rest well, my stars.
Tomorrow we go up to the city.
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it...
... thenewswillscorchthestreets of the Roman world.
Pontius Pilate here?
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.
You will make him see what men are born in this land.
I only know that I race against Messala.
Look for the yoke.
Ease that strap.
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.
Into Your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as You will.
The Star of David.
To shine out for your people and my people together...
... andblindtheeyesofRome.
They are ready.
Easy, girl, easy.
Number five.
Where is number five?
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.
Yes, this is the day.
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.
Hail, Jupiter.
Give me victory.
Watch your line!
Keep your places!
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.
Citizens...
... Iwelcomeyoutothesegames in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.
We dedicate them to his glory...
... andtothegloryofRome...
... ofwhichyouare all part.
Let us honor those who race for us today.
They come here from Alexandria...
... Messina...
... Carthage...
... Cyprus...
... Rome...
... Corinth...
... Athens...
... Phrygia...
... andJudea.
To the best of these, a crown of victory.
The race begins.
Hail, Caesar!
Come, my children, come!
The Roman pig!
Salute.
A great victory.
You are the people's one true god...
... forthetimebeing.
Permit us to worship.
I crown their god.
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.
A long life, young Arrius and the good sense to live it.
We cannot wait, tribune.
He will come.
He will--
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.
He will come!
He will come.
I've sent for him, and he will come.
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.
Do you understand?
To hack the legs off me?
Not yet.
Not till I've seen him.
I don't receive him with half a body.
No!
I told you, Drusus.
I told you.
Here he is.
Triumph complete, Judah.
The race won.
The enemy destroyed.
I see no enemy.
What do you think you see?
The smashed body of a wretched animal?
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.
Let me help you.
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.
Dead.
And the race over.
It isn't over, Judah.
They're not dead.
Where are they?
Where are they?
Look for them...
... intheValleyoftheLepers...
... ifyoucanrecognizethem .
It goes on.
It goes on, Judah.
The race... .
The race is not over.
Is there a way down here?
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.
Man.
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.
There are many women.
Of the family of Hur.
We have no names here.
For them?
-Why did you say they were dead?
-It was what they wanted.
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?
Not to see them?
They are coming.
Love them in the way they must need to be loved.
Not to look at them.
Let them be as if you had never come here.
Please!
Is Judah well?
Is he happy?
Yes, he is well.
Your mind can be at rest for him.
He is well, Miriam.
God be with you.
They have gone.
We can go back.
Go back to what?
Judah, they have one blessing left.
To think you remember them as they were...
... andliveyourown life.
Forget what is here.
Forget?
It's as though they're alive in a grave.
-But what can you do?
-Undo what you've done.
How could you have suffered them to come here?
I must see them.
No, Judah, please!
Judah!
Think, Judah, think.
It would tear them apart if they see you.
He is here.
I have found Him.
The child has become a man.
And the man, I know it now, is the Son of God.
The promise is true.
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.
Life has been answered.
God has answered it.
Come.
Come with me.
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys...
... thirsthadnearlykilledme.
A man gave me water to drink.
I went on living.
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.
No.
I am thirsty still.
Come and listen.
I have business with Rome.
You insist on death.
Goodbye, Judah.
You sent for me?
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.
-I honor him.
-As you may honor yourself.
You have been made a citizen of Rome.
Do you say nothing to this?
I have just come from the Valley of Stone...
... wheremymotherand sisterlive what's left of their lives.
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.
I have heard this.
There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.
Where there is greatness, great government or power...
... evengreatfeelingorcompassion...
... erroralsois great.
We progress and mature by fault.
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.
There are other voices.
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place...
... nottocrucifyyourself on a shadow such as old resentment...
... orimpossibleloyalties.
Perfect freedom has no existence.
A grown man knows the world he lives in.
And for the present, the world is Rome.
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.
I am Judah Ben-Hur.
I cross this floor in spoken friendship...
... asI wouldspeaktoArrius.
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar...
... readytocrushthose who challenge his authority.
There are too many men of envy and ambition...
... whotryto disrupt the government of Rome.
You have become the victor and hero to those people.
They look to you, their one true god, as I call you.
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.
I am already part of this tragedy.
Return this to Arrius.
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you...
... frompersonaldisaster if you stay here.
You are too great a danger.
Leave Judea.
You have my word.
I was afraid you would never come back...
... afraidofwhatwouldhappentoyou .
But I see you again.
Your father's waiting for me.
Where is he?
What do you mean to do?
Rest, sleep.
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.
Peace?
Love and peace.
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?
Where do you see them?
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.
Balthasar's word.
He is more than Balthasar's word.
His voiced traveled with such a still purpose.
It was more than a voice.
A man more than a man.
He said, "Blessed are the merciful...
... fortheyshallobtainmercy.
Blessed are the peacemakers...
... fortheyshallbecalled the children of God. "
Children of God?
In that dead valley where we left them?
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean...
... untilwehavescouredoff our bodies the crust and filth...
... ofbeingat themercyoftyranny.
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.
-In blood?
-Yes, in blood!
I know there is a law in life.
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.
Death generates death...
... asthevulturebreedsthevulture.
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:
"Love your enemy.
Do good to those who despitefully use you. "
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.
As you make us do now.
Are we to bear nothing together?
Even love?
I can hardly draw breath...
... withoutfeelingyouinmyheart .
But I know...
... thateverythingIdo from this moment...
... bearsgreaterpain than you have ever suffered.
It is better not to love me.
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy...
... givingevilforevil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.
It's as though you had become Messala.
I've lost you, Judah.
No further.
What are you doing here?
I was here last evening waiting for you.
I have waited all night.
What has happened?
Where is Tirzah?
Leave the food.
I am coming closer.
Don't be afraid.
-What are you doing?
-Don't be afraid.
I've heard Him again, the man from Nazareth.
If ever words were from God, they are in everything He says.
I cannot bear that you should have never known...
... thishandof quiet reaching towards us.
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find Him there.
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find Him.
Tirzah is dying.
Leave the food and go.
It's Judah.
Why did you tell him?
Yes, Judah, yes.
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.
Mother.
Wait, Mother, wait.
Let me talk with you.
Please.
No, no further.
Please.
No, Judah.
Son, no.
Mother, let me see Tirzah.
Tirzah is dying.
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know...
... thatlifeis everlasting...
... anddeathis nothingtofear if you have faith.
I will take them to Him.
No!
God, no!
No, no, dear son.
Mother...
... whereisTirzah?
Judah, no.
Judah, no.
You must not go to her, dear son.
Please.
Dear son.
I am afraid.
No cause.
The world is more than we know.
Tirzah, it's Judah.
No, Judah.
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
-Why are the streets deserted?
-They have gone to the trial.
Trial?
Whose trial?
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.
-This cannot be true.
-Alms?
What has he done?
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.
Help for the blind.
-Look, lepers!
-Lepers!
Get away!
Stay away!
Go away!
Lepers!
Lepers!
How can this be?
I know this man.
Will someone help Him?
Take pity on Him.
Have mercy.
In His pain...
... thislookof peace.
Watch over them, Esther.
We must go back.
I brought you here to this...
... whenI hoped... .
You haven't failed, Esther.
Hail King of the Jews!
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.
He gave me water...
... anda heartto live.
What has He done to merit this?
He has taken the world of our sins onto Himself.
To this end He said He was born...
... inthatstable...
... whereI firstsawHim .
For this cause, He came into the world.
For this death?
This beginning.
I have lived too long.
As though He were carrying in that cross...
... thepainof theworld.
So fearful, and yet why is it...
... I'mnotafraidanymore?
The shadow of a storm.
A strange darkness...
... butstillday.
His life is over.
What is it?
This tearing.
I am in pain.
I feel it too.
Do you see your hand?
Almost at the moment He died...
... IheardHimsay , "Father, forgive them...
... fortheyknownot whatthey do."
Even then.
Even then.
And I felt His voice take the sword out of my hand.
BALTHASAR:
In the year of our Lord Judea, for nearly a century, had lain under the mastery of Rome.
In the seventh year of the reign of Augustus Caesar an imperial decree ordered every Judean each to return to his place of birth to be counted and taxed.
The converging ways of many of them led to their capital city, Jerusalem the troubled heart of their land.
The old city was dominated by the fortress of Antonia the seat of Roman power and by the great golden temple the outward sign of an inward and imperishable faith.
Even while they obeyed the will of Caesar the people clung proudly to their ancient heritage always remembering the promise of their prophets that one day there would be born among them a redeemer to bring them salvation and perfect freedom.
[MURMURING]
You'll be counted at Hebron.
- Name?
- Samuel.
- What city?
- Joppa.
- What family?
- Michael.
- Move on.
Move on.
- Yes.
- Name?
- Joseph.
- What city?
- Nazareth.
- What family?
- David of Bethlehem.
- And the woman?
- My wife.
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.
Come on, come on.
[OXEN BELLOWING]
[BABY CRYING]
[SHEEP BAAING]
[TRUMPETS]
What village is this?
Nazareth.
We should arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow night.
You're not watching the soldiers, Joseph?
We've seen Romans before.
Yes and we will see them again.
My table is not finished.
Where is your son?
- He's walking in the hills.
- Mm-hm.
He neglects his work, Joseph.
No.
Once, I reproached him with forgetting his work.
He said to me:
"I must be about my father's business."
Then why isn't he here, working?
He's working.
SEXTUS:
Trumpeters of the legion!
[TRUMPETING]
Welcome, Messala.
The command is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for relieving me.
Drusus when I was a boy, I dreamed of commanding this garrison.
Now the wheel has turned.
I am in command.
OFFICER:
Attention!
Aisle one, face right!
Forward!
I'd forgotten the heat.
If it were only the heat.
I lived here until I was 14.
Jerusalem was my home.
- My father was head of...
- Yes, I know.
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.
If there can be such a thing in this forsaken land.
If you want to rise, Sextus, do the difficult.
I asked to be sent here.
I think you'll find the people changed since you were a boy.
In what way?
Oh, won't pay their taxes, an irrational resentment of Rome...
There's nothing new in all that.
And then there's religion.
I tell you, they're drunk with religion.
They smash the statues of our gods, even those of the emperor.
Punish them.
We do.
When we can find them.
Find the leaders.
Oh, you don't know.
There's nothing you can put your finger on.
I tell you, there are strange forces at work here.
For instance, this "messiah" business...
I know.
There was one predicted when I was a boy.
A king of the Jews, who will lead them into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.
Makes your head spin.
There's a wild man in the desert named John who drowns people in water.
And a carpenter's son who does magic tricks. "Miracles" they call them.
There's always a rabble-rouser stirring up trouble.
No, no, no.
This man is different.
He teaches that God is near, in every man.
[MESSALA SCOFFS]
It's actually quite profound, some of it.
You've been too long away from Rome.
Go back, Sextus.
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea and forget that God is in every man.
- There is divinity in only one man.
- Yes, I know.
The emperor is displeased.
He wishes Judea made into a more obedient and disciplined province.
He has ordered me to restore order.
I intend to carry out his wishes.
But how?
You can break a man's skull, arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.
But how do you control what's up here?
How do you fight an idea?
Especially a new idea.
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.
I assume he has a name.
- He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
- Then treat him like one!
Tell him I will join him.
Yes, tribune.
Centurion!
This was his country before it was ours.
Don't forget that.
Yes, tribune.
Very wise.
This Ben-Hur is the richest man in Jerusalem.
And the head of one of the greatest families in Judea.
We were friends as boys.
We were like brothers.
Sextus you ask how to fight an idea.
Well, I'll tell you how.
With another idea.
I said I'd come back.
I never thought you would.
I'm so glad.
[BOTH LAUGH]
- Look at you.
- Look at you!
You've come back a tribune.
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.
We'll drink another now.
- Your sister and mother?
- They're fine.
They've talked of you ever since we knew you were coming.
- Is Tirzah married?
- No.
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.
She's been in love with you since she was 5.
I can't wait to see them.
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?
Or have you become too dignified?
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
- Down Eros, up Mars!
- Down Eros, up Mars!
MESSALA:
Where the beams cross?
BEN-HUR:
Good.
[BOTH LAUGH]
After all these years!
Still close.
In every way.
I hope so.
I know.
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew whose life you once saved.
The best thing I ever did.
Judah it will be very difficult to govern here.
I'm going to need help.
Your help.
Your advice.
- You want my advice?
- Yes, I do.
Withdraw your legions.
Give us our freedom.
Unfortunately, the emperor is devoted to his empire.
He's particularly fond of Judea.
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.
Is there anything so sad as unrequited love?
[MESSALA CHUCKLES]
My quarters.
Hmm.
A bit grim.
Not grim.
Austere.
Virtuous.
Roman.
I'm going to be second-in-command to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.
He's arriving in a few days with two more legions.
Then the rumors are true.
The emperor does not approve of your countrymen.
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.
But you and your family need have no concern.
I'm next in authority to the governor, and you're my friend.
- I'm a Jew.
- Ah, you are like a Roman!
What have you in common with the troublemaking rabble?
Rabble?
They're my people.
I'm one of them.
Be wise, Judah.
It's a Roman world.
If you want to live in it, you must become part of it.
You've changed.
I've grown up.
I've seen the world since I left Jerusalem.
I've seen Rome.
It's no accident that one small village on the Tiber was chosen to rule the world.
Your legions.
It wasn't just our legions.
Other countries have armies, fine armies.
I know, I fought them.
Oh, no.
No, it was fate that chose us to civilize the world.
And we have.
Our roads and ships connect every corner of the earth.
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.
I believe in the future of my people.
Of course you do.
And you can help them.
How?
You're an aristocrat.
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince among your people.
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.
They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.
Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.
It is worse than stupid, futile!
For it can end in only one way, extinction for your people!
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.
Then we're agreed!
Now, when can I come to see your family?
- We had hoped tomorrow.
- Good.
And now for our toast.
It's dreadful wine, by the way.
It's especially fermented for the Roman army.
[MESSALA CHUCKLES]
You're very cruel to your conquerors.
It's an insane world.
But in it there is one sanity:
The loyalty of old friends.
Judah, we must believe in one another.
Will you drink to that?
With all my heart.
Here it is, the place I've remembered.
The court where we played at changing the guard.
The roof where we'd throw pebbles at people in the street and then hide.
- We were rascals, weren't we?
- No, you were good boys.
I would have that time again.
And here it is.
Nothing has changed.
Except for the fountain.
- The old well would go dry, remember?
- Promptly, every summer.
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.
- He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
- No?
Of course he has.
He was a boy when he left us, now he's a man.
With great responsibilities.
Come.
The emperor builds and builds, turning brick to marble.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.
I've never seen anything like this before.
It's beautiful!
- Is it Roman?
- It's Libyan.
I was there last year.
A tremendous campaign.
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.
Or was, till we destroyed it.
Now it's nothing but ashes.
I'm boring you with soldier stories.
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.
Thank you for this.
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.
BEN-HUR:
What do you think of it?
MESSALA:
Magnificent.
It's Arabic.
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.
Let me try him sometime.
Whenever you like.
He's yours.
Do you mean you'll give me this?
Oh, Judah.
You are good.
It's going to be like old times, I know it.
Judah, tell me, did you think about what I said?
Yes.
Talked to a number of people already.
Spoken against violence, against incidents.
Most of the men agree with me.
Most?
Not all?
- No, not all.
- Who does not agree?
Well, the resentful, the impatient.
Who are they?
Yes, Judah.
Who are they?
Would I retain your friendship if I became an informer?
Telling the names of criminals is not informing.
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.
Patriots?
!
Judah.
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.
This is my great opportunity, and yours too.
If I bring order here, I can have any post I want.
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?
Rome!
Yes, perhaps at the side of Caesar himself.
I mean it.
It can happen and this is the moment.
I swear, this is the time.
The emperor is watching us, judging us.
All I need do is serve him.
And all you need do is help me serve him.
- You speak as if he were God.
- He is God.
The only God.
He is power, real power on earth, not...
Not that.
Help me, Judah.
I would do anything for you, Messala except betray my own people.
In the name of all the gods, what do the lives of a few Jews mean to you?
If I cannot persuade them, that does not mean I would help you murder them.
Besides, you must understand this, Messala.
I believe in the past and future of my people.
Future?
You are a conquered people.
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?
Joshua will not rise again to save you nor David.
There is only one reality in the world today.
Look to the West.
Don't be a fool!
Look to Rome!
Better a fool than a traitor or a killer.
- I am a soldier.
- Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.
- I warn you...
- No!
I warn you.
Rome is an affront to God.
Rome is strangling my people and my country, the whole earth!
But not forever.
And I tell you, the day Rome falls there will be a shout of freedom such as the world has never heard before.
Judah.
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.
You're either for me or against me.
If that is the choice then I am against you.
There they are.
Where's Messala?
- Where's?
- He's gone.
Gone?
- But why?
- He couldn't stay.
- What happened?
- A new tribune must have many duties.
Come.
Let us have dinner.
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the world who bringeth to us bread from the earth.
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.
He wanted to use me to betray our people.
Judah.
[MURMURING]
[CAMEL BAYING]
- Master, the caravan from Antioch.
- Yes, Amrah, I saw.
Simonides.
- Welcome.
- Judah.
- Oh, welcome homecoming.
- Master.
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.
And for the master, lberian wine.
Not to mention the best gift of all, your presence.
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.
- Caravans from Petra.
- Have all arrived.
- Good.
- Here is the accounting.
And what of Numidia?
The trade route is ours, guaranteed by treaty with the king.
Once a year, you bring your accounting.
And once a year, I find myself wealthier.
Yeah, but my greatest treasure is my steward.
SIMONIDES:
My life belongs to the House of Hur.
Nothing else exists for me, except my daughter.
- She must be a young woman by now.
- Yes, and your property.
She was born the daughter of your slave.
When I inherited you, I inherited a friend, not a slave.
Still, Esther has come with me from Antioch for your permission to marry.
It's granted.
I wish you the joy of many grandchildren.
SIMONIDES:
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.
With your permission, Esther wishes to speak to her master.
You're eager to marry, Esther?
It is my father's wish.
Your husband will be fortunate.
What is his name?
David, son of Mathias.
BEN-HUR:
Of what house?
- His own, master.
- He is a freeman.
Tell me more about him.
I have seen him only once.
He is a merchant, well-thought-of in Antioch.
He will pay for Esther's freedom.
Her freedom will be my wedding gift to Esther.
You are generous, master.
Do you love this man?
I will learn to love him.
You have my permission to marry.
We'll drink to your happiness.
And a safe return to Antioch.
BEN-HUR:
I disturbed you.
No.
What were you thinking?
I was saying goodbye to this city and this house.
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?
My father sometimes brought me here when I was little.
It was a house where I was always happy.
Except once.
When you and your friend, the Roman boy...
- Messala.
- Yes.
You had been out hunting and they brought you home injured.
I touched your face as you lay there and prayed to God, "Don't let this boy die."
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.
Yes, master.
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.
It's strange.
I hardly felt a slave.
And now I hardly feel free.
You know, in the old, wise days of Solomon if there was among his slaves some girl who filled his eyes he could choose her out from the rest and take her to him.
Wise days of Solomon.
Different days.
And long ago.
If you were not a bride I should kiss you goodbye.
If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said.
Your slave ring.
Fair exchange.
Freedom to you.
The ring to me.
You will wear it?
Until you meet the woman you will marry?
Until then.
[DRUMMING]
[TRUMPETING]
The gods favor my lord Gratus.
If it is the governor's pleasure, the wreath of office.
Thank you, tribune.
I see no delegation from the city.
- There will not be one, sir.
- No?
Jerusalem's welcome will not be a warm one.
But I pledge, my lord, it will be a quiet one.
Let us proceed.
[CHILDREN SHOUTING]
There's Messala.
He saw you, Judah.
The new governor.

OFFICER 3:
Open up in the name of the divine emperor!
Judah!
Tirzah!
What is it?
What's happened?
OFFICER 4:
Open up in the name of Rome!
- I was watching the Romans...
- A tile fell and struck the governor.
- It wasn't my fault.
- They won't believe her.
She won't have to say anything.
You hear?
Tirzah, say nothing.
MAN:
Open the gates!
I'll speak to them.
OFFICER 1:
Arrest him!
- Wait.
Let me tell you what happened.
OFFICER 2:
Hold those women.
BEN-HUR:
Not them!
- Judah!
BEN-HUR:
It was an accident.
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.
- This is the man, sir.
We saw him.
- It was an accident.
- Accident?
- I swear it.
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose.
It gave way.
Take him.
Take all of them.
MIRIAM:
He's telling the truth!
- It was me!
Let them go!
MIRIAM:
Judah!
CENTURION:
Attention!
BEN-HUR:
Messala.
In the name of God, tell them it's a mistake.
I leaned on the tile, and it broke loose.
It was an accident.
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!
MIRIAM:
Messala!
TIRZAH:
Messala.
Let the servants go.
Let them go.
Return to your ranks.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
- Come.
- Where?
Tirus.
Tirus?
I've had no trial.
I'm to die in the galleys without even a trial?
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!
Wait.
My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?
Tie his hands.
- At least tell me if they're safe.
- I can tell you nothing.

You can go.
Go!
The door.
Where are my mother and sister?
Where are they?
Here, within these walls.
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.
Of course, they will be sentenced.
Is it possible, Messala?
Is it possible you could do this to us?
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?
You'll let them go.
You must.
You will gladly let them go!
Messala!
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not mad.
I'm not a murderer!
I know you're not.
You know?
You are evil.
No, Judah, I am not evil.
I wanted your help.
Now you've given it to me.
By making this example of you, I discourage treason.
By condemning without hesitation an old friend, I shall be feared.
But not my family.
Let them go.
Please.
- Messala, I beg you.
- Beg?
!
Didn't I beg you?
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.
Kill me, and your mother and sister will die today nailed to crosses in front of you!
Go on, Judah.
Kill me!
[GRUNTS]
May God grant me vengeance.
I will pray that you live till I return.
Return?
Take him.
OFFICER:
Sentries, salute.
The tribune will see you now.
Tribune, I'm steward of the House of Hur.
I remember you.
We were on our way to Antioch when we heard what had happened.
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done this thing.
You knew him, tribune.
Better than you.
Then there must be no doubt in your mind, the charge is groundless.
The prisoners have been sentenced.
- Sentenced?
- But there's no truth in it.
There was never a threat against the governor in Judah's mind.
Surely you must know he would never have done this.
In your heart, you must know it.
Drusus.
This man had better be kept here until we have time to question him.
DECURION:
Hold!
[SAWING]
DECURION:
Water for the soldiers.
Soldiers first!
Get away from that well!
No water for them!
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!
Come on, you!
Water for the horses!
MAN:
Water.
Water.
DECURION:
Soldiers first!
Here.
Wait.
No water for him.
[GROANS]
God help me.
You!
I said no water for him!
All right, on your feet, all of you!
Get them on their feet!
Back in line, you dog!
On your feet!
Get them going!
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!
Forward, you dogs!
In a few minutes, the consul's barge will be coming alongside.
Be ready to raise oars.
HORTATOR:
Raise oars!
Down oars!
[TRUMPETING]
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.
- How many rowers?
- Two hundred, consul.
- And reliefs?
- Of 30, every hour.
[MAN COUGHING]
This man is ill.
Replace him.
- Change him.
- Right, sir.
- This man has been giving you trouble?
- He's insubordinate, consul.
That will stop.
What service have you seen?
Forty-one.
A month's less a day in this ship.
You keep an exact account.
And before?
Three years in other ships.
Three years.
[BEN-HUR YELLS]
You have the spirit to fight back but the good sense to control it.
Your eyes are full of hate, 41.
That's good.
Hate keeps a man alive.
It gives him strength.
Now, listen to me, all of you.
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
So row well and live.
- Ship ready, consul.
- Strike oars.
HORTATOR:
Strike oars!
You know that a fleet of Macedonian galleys has been raiding Roman commerce.
The emperor has honored us with the task of seeking out and destroying them.
Battle speed, hortator.
Battle speed!
Attack speed.

[COUGHING AND PANTING]
[HORTATOR DRUMMING NEARBY]
Why are you here?
I was ordered to report to you during my relief.
Oh, yes.
I'd forgotten.
You could have killed me as I lay there.
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?
I'm not ready to die.
What do you think will save you?
The God of my fathers.
Hmm.
Your God has forsaken you.
He has no more power than the images I pray to.
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.
I might.
Does that interest you, 41?
I can see that it does.
I'm a fighting man by profession, and in my leisure moments it amuses me to train fighting men.
I own some of the best gladiators and charioteers in Rome.
Would you like to become one of them?
To die as your slave?
Better than to live in chains below these decks.
I will not be here forever.
No?
What would you do if you escaped?
Two people were condemned with me, my mother and sister though they were innocent.
I won't rest...
Do not say that you were innocent.
- Would it do any good to say it again?
- No.
Consider my offer carefully.
You will never escape while we are victorious.
If we are not, you will sink with this ship, chained to your oar.
I cannot believe that God has let me live these three years to die chained to an oar.
It's a strange, stubborn faith you keep to believe that existence has a purpose.
A sane man would have learned to lose it long before this.
As you have.
What drove it out of you?
Go back to your oar, 41.
Consul, enemy sighted.
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.
OFFICER:
All the watch to battle posts.
OFFICER 1:
Stand by to load.
OFFICER 2:
Make ready to fire.
Hurry, quick!
Hurry up with that resin.
Get some more ammunition.
HORTATOR:

OFFICER:
Chain rowers!
Guard.
Unlock 41.
No!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
41, why did he do that?
I don't know.
Once before, a man helped me.
I didn't know why then.
HORTATOR:

Why did you save me?
Why did you have me unchained?
What is your name, 41?
Judah Ben-Hur. ...let me die.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
Row well and live.
ARRIUS:
Is the sail square?
I can't tell.
Better for us both if it's the enemy.
My death.
Your freedom.
It's a Roman sail.
OFFICER:
Face rear!
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.
Water.
The fleet, all lost?
Five galleys.
- And the battle?
- The battle was won.
You have a victory.
ARRIUS:
It was a victory?
CAPTAIN:
Complete.
In his eagerness to save you your God has also saved the Roman fleet.
Hail Arrius!

[BAND PLAYING TRIUMPHANT MUSIC]
[CROWD CHEERING]
[MUSIC AND CHEERING STOPS]
You have cleared the seaways of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.
This baton of victory has been nobly won.
[CROWD CHEERS]
This man riding beside you, who is he?
The man who saved me, divine emperor, to return and serve you.
Is that all you know about him?
No.
He was accused of an attack on the governor of Judea.
But he was innocent.
If not, there's a strange inconsistency in this man who tries to kill my governor, yet saves the life of my consul.
Come tomorrow.
We'll talk of it.
[CROWD CHEERS]
[BAND PLAYING TRIUMPHANT MUSIC]
We have all the information on this man a man of some influence in his own country.
His attack upon our governor is one upon the senate and the people of Rome.
I am convinced that no such attack was intended.
Consul, allow us to continue.
Allow us to be generous.
As a reward to you for your great victory we shall not send him back to the galleys.
We give him to you as your slave to do with him as you like.
Such is the will of the senate and the people of Rome.
[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]
[WOMEN YELLING]
[BAND PLAYING SOFT MUSIC]
Not long ago, I returned to Rome with a young man who had saved my life.
You all know him as the finest charioteer in Rome.
Five times, he's driven my horses to victory.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I know him as one who stands in the place of the son I lost.
I have the love and pride in a son's achievements which I thought I should never have again.
[MURMURING]
Nothing could make stronger the bond between us but tonight I wish to share it with you all.
The formalities of adoption have been completed.
Young Arrius is now the legal bearer of my name and the heir to my property.
[CROWD MURMURS]
This ring of my ancestors would have gone to my son.
So now it is yours.
It's a strange destiny that brought me to a new life a new home a new father.
It brought me here.
It may take me away.
But wherever I may be I shall always try to wear this ring as a son of Arrius should.
With gratitude and affection and with honor.
[CROWD CHEERING]
[SOFT MUSIC RESUMES]
I present my son to you.
My old friend Pontius Pilate, young Arrius.
Before you came to this city, my horses always won.
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.
Yes, but not swift enough to defeat you.
- Tell me, you come from Judea?
- Yes, sir.
I hear that the climate is difficult to live in.
Not for Judeans.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.
- Of Judea?
- Yes.
I asked for Alexandria.
But it seems the wilderness needs my particular talents.
The scorpions and holy prophets can't get on without me.
Lay the dust of Judea, at least for this evening.
Goats and Jehovah.
[ARRIUS CHUCKLES]
You're leaving.
I must.
It's a journey I can't keep you from.
Your eyes have never left it all these months.
I can recognize pain.
But still, my counsel is to wait.
Gratus is to be replaced.
The governorship goes to Pontius Pilate.
When?
Very soon.
It's very much to our purpose.
Nothing is to the purpose if, when I come back to Judea, I come too late.
That is the thought which has punished me every moment I've spent here.
Will Rome see you again?
Here is a part of my life which you have made for me.
I shall remember it.
Whoever the gods are, they take small interest in an old man's hopes.
They have their way.
Forgive me.
You're a stranger here.
Would you be from Nazareth?
Why do you ask?
I thought you might be the one...
The one that I have come back from my country to find.
He would be about your age.
Who?
When I find him I shall know him.
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.
SHEIK:
Hyah!
Hyah!
Sack of flesh without brains!
No!
No!
Not the whip!
That is my host.
SHEIK:
Gently!
Gently!
Fool!
Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood!
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run!
Go on!
SHEIK:
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!
Beautiful horses.
Now!
Now!
They are ready!
Let them go!
Watch.
They'll never hold the turn.
SHEIK:
No!
No!
Abadon, stop him!
Stop that whip!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill!
SHEIK:
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!
You think you can treat my horses like animals?
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!
Get off, idiot!
SHEIK:
Drive goats, not horses!
Now I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.
Hmm?
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.
Not a team?
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.
- Antares.
- The slow one?
SHEIK:
Uh-huh.
I think he should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?
In the circus in Rome.
You have driven in the great circus?
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.
No other animal has descended so in scale from the first innocent falling of the world.
[SHEIK CHUCKLES]
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.
Yes.
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.
Your coming here was so fit, so right.
We might have achieved wonders.
You have to go.
I make a journey which will not wait.
Well, then perhaps you will come back.
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.
I have no wives.
No wives at all?
I have six, no, seven.
BALTHASAR:
Ha, ha.
I've counted eight.
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.
- Someday, I hope to have one.
- One wife!
Ha, ha, one God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.
It is not generous.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
[BURPS]
- Was the food not to your liking?
- Indeed.
[BURPS]
Thank you.
Thank you.
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.
And now I must say good night to my beauties.
When they're ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.
- I'll make my farewells then.
- No, no, no, stay.
Stay and see them.
Come, my children.
Come.
Strangers make them shy.
Come.
Come, do not be afraid.
Come.
There, my children.
They are descended from the Arabians of the first Pharaohs and I have named them for the stars.
Come, Antares.
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.
[ANTARES WHINNIES]
What?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.
Come, Rigel.
We've both supped well, and the world is good.
[CHUCKLES]
There's my good Rigel.
Ah.
Yes, you are ready for sleep.
The day's work done for you, eh?
Ah.
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.
Good night.
Good night, my treasure.
Ah!
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.
No.
You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.
[CHUCKLES]
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.
You should see their mother, Mira.
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.
All right, all right.
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.
You must be strong and swift.
Go, my children.
Go.
When they reach Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams not to mention the champion of the East, Messala, with his black devils.
He stops at nothing to win.
- Messala?
In the circus?
- Yes.
You knew him?
I know him.
Perhaps without much liking.
Judah Ben-Hur, my people are praying for a man to drive their team to victory over Messala.
You could be that man, the one to stamp his arrogance into the sand.
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.
It's not possible.
That is a pity.
Think of it.
To break his pride to humble this tribune before the very people he has degraded.
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!
I know it is not possible.
Does it not delight your imagination?
Does it not answer your purpose?
I must deal with Messala in my own way.
And your way is to kill him.
I see this terrible thing in your eyes, Judah Ben-Hur.
But no matter what this man has done, you have no right to take his life.
He will be punished inevitably.
I don't believe in miracles.
But all life is a miracle.
Why will you not accept God's judgment?
You do not believe in miracles.
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness and a star led me to a village called Bethlehem where I found a newborn child in a manger.
And God lived in this child.
By now, he is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.
That is why I have returned here so that I may be at hand when he comes among us.
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.
Perhaps he's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.
Perhaps he is a shepherd a merchant, a fisherman.
But he lives and all our lives from now on will carry his mark.
There are many paths to God, my son.
I hope yours will not be too difficult.
I'm ready for sleep.
Balthasar is a good man but until all men are like him, we must keep our swords bright.
And our intention true.
So I must leave you.
One last thought.
There is no law in the arena.
Many are killed.
I hope to see you again.
MERCHANT:
Fine Damascus silk.
Fine Damascus silk.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Esther?
[ESTHER GASPS]
It's Judah.
[GASPS]
Judah.
- You are alive.
- Esther.
You are alive.
What are you doing here?
What has happened?
[ESTHER SOBBING]
Shh.
I'm here.
I'm with you.
Esther.
Where's your father?
Hmm?
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.
They tortured him.
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.
You never went back to Antioch?
No.
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.
Esther.
Where are my mother and sister?
SIMONIDES:
Esther.
Let me tell him first.
Father.
Father, something wonderful has happened.
- Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
- Judah.
He has come home.
He is here.
Judah.
Judah Ben-Hur.
My dear old friend.
Let me look at you.
Let me see you.
Yes, yes.
It is true.
Praise God for his mercy.
Where are they?
Since that terrible day there has been no word of them.
You should have been less loyal.
Do not pity me, Master Judah.
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.
We were released on the same day.
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.
Since then, I have been his tongue and he has been my legs.
Together, we make a considerable man.
Old friend.
She always said you would return.
She never gave up hope.
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.
I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.
But suppose that isn't possible.
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.
They could not make me tell them where it is.
It is there still to put power into our hands and buy death for the Romans.
That's not why I came back.
Judah, they are dead.
Four years.
No one could live so long in the dungeons.
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?
SIMONIDES:
Yes, it is true.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You have come back to us like a returning faith.
Judah, I should like to laugh again.
- Let us laugh.
- We will.
There will be joy again in this house.
We will celebrate among the dust.
[SOBBING]
I will take him.
We stood here before.
A long while ago.
Four years.
But now it seems as if only yesterday...
I was saying:
"If you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye."
"If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said."
I am not a bride.
Why did you never marry?
My father needed me.
And also...
It's still on my finger.
I said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.
It's become a part of my hand.
If Messala once knew you were here...
As he must.
He will know where they are.
And if you should find?
- If he should tell you they're dead...
- Then Messala will wish they were living.
I've seen too much of what hate can do.
My father is burned up with it.
But I've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater and love more powerful than hatred.
I believe it.
- Esther.
- Judah.
Stay alive.
Keep away from Messala.
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.
That time isn't yet come.
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.
This time you will be destroyed.
You'll die.
Tribune, compliments of Quintus Arrius.
He awaits your pleasure.
- Consul here?
- Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.
Thank him.
Bring him to me.
- I didn't know the consul had a son.
- He's a champion of the great circus.
Why is he here presenting me with gifts?
- Perhaps he'll race against you.
- Look.
It's magnificent.
And from a man I've never met.
You're wrong, Messala.
Judah.
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?
You were the magician, Messala.
You condemned me to the galleys.
When my ship was sunk, I saved the consul's life.
You know his seal?
Now I have come back as I swore I would.
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.
You suggest I use it on myself?
What has become of my mother and my sister?
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.
Find them, Messala.
Restore them to me, and I'll forget what I vowed with every stroke of that oar you chained me to.
I am not the governor of Judea.
I can do nothing without approval.
Then get it.
I will come back tomorrow.
Don't disappoint me, Messala.
What became of them?
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?
Go to the citadel, Drusus.
Find out.
- And if they're dead?
- They're dead!
"Miriam, wife.
Tirzah, daughter."
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?
East section lower level.
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.
PRISONER 1:
Water.
Water.
PRISONER 2:
Let me out!
PRISONER 3:
Hear us!
Hear us!
[POUNDING]
- How long since you've seen them?
- Never.
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.
The food disappears.
Lepers.
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.
Then we'll burn out the cell.
[COUGHING]
ESTHER:
Is someone there?
[RUSTLING]
There is someone there.
Who are you?
MIRIAM:
Don't come any closer.
Who are you?
Esther.
It's Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam?
MIRIAM:
Stay where you are.
You have come home.
MIRIAM:
Stand back, Esther.
We are lepers.
[GASPS]
Oh, Esther.
Tirzah.
Esther is Judah living?
Yes, he is alive.
He is here.
Where?
He is searching for you now.
I must find him and tell him.
MIRIAM:
No!
- Tell my father.
MIRIAM:
No.
Tell no one.
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.
We won't return.
But Judah has to be told.
MIRIAM:
No.
Please.
I couldn't see his face.
Is it changed?
No, he is not changed.
He...
He's not changed.
You love him, Esther.
Promise me on your love for him you will never tell him you've seen us.
Is he never to know?
Let him remember us as we were.
Promise me.
There's nothing else I can hope for.
Only this.
I promise you.
I am content.
Wait.
[CRIES]
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.
I pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.
He'll free them.
He wants to survive.
He cannot free them, Judah.
What do you mean?
- I saw them.
- You saw them?
Where?
When did you see them?
They were dead.
When?
When?
When?
In the prison.
When I was waiting for news of my father.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't tell you.
Nor even you, Father.
I was afraid that if you saw Messala...
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.
It's over now.
Over?
- Judah.
- Over?
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.
[SOBBING]
[MURMURING]
[MEN CHUCKLING]
SHEIK:
Gentlemen.
Officers.
Defenders of great Rome's imperium may I enter?
Certainly, sheik.
You do us an unexpected honor.
The noble tribune is most gracious.
And now, the question you're all asking yourselves:
Why am I here?
As you know, I am a gambling man.
The games approach.
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.
But I will back my own poor horses.
No limits?
MARIUS:
Mark me first!
- And me!
MATELLUS:
What odds?
- A moment, please my lords, protectors of the far flung marshes.
May I first, uh, sit down?
MARIUS:
Sit down.
Lie down.
How much will you wager?
- Yes, let's call his game.
SPINTHO:
Give the Arab a seat.
A bench, quickly.
Thank you.
- Now.
- One thousand denarii.
- Two thousand!
- Mark me!
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient.
There is time and money enough for all.
First, gentlemen, the odds.
The tribune has won many times.
The odds should be in the same measure.
Now, what is your pleasure, gentlemen?
MARIUS:
Two to one.
[SHEIK CHUCKLES]
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth where is the courage that made Rome master of the world?
I can get better odds on any street market.
MARIUS:
Three to one.
Let us not haggle.
Let us be fair.
In four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.
- In all truth...
- Just a moment.
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?
Oh.
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.
The Prince of Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur.
Prince of Hur?
[CHUCKLES]
- He was sent to the galleys years ago.
- He has returned.
Returned?
Impossible.
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.
Well?
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.
You, tribune will you give me four to one?
Four to one.
- Good.
- Bravo, Messala.
Four to one, sheik.
The difference between a Roman and a Jew.
Or an Arab.
[ROMANS LAUGH]
[CHUCKLES]
Bravely spoken.
Now we will settle the amount of our wager.
I will venture...
A thousand talents?
- A thousand talents?
- Yes, a thousand talents.
Of course, if it is too much...
A thousand talents it will be.
Agreed.
[MURMURING]
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.
You're good fellows.
If only men were this good.
Hey!
Remember, Altair nine times around the circus, huh?
Aldebaran.
Hey, ha, ha.
Rigel, did you hear?
Nine lives to live.
My swift fellow.
You must not win the race the first time around.
You win the last time around.
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.
Steady Antares.
Like a rock.
You will be our anchor.
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.
They have taken me into their family.
Rest well, my stars.
Tomorrow we go up to the city.
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it the news will scorch the streets of the whole Roman world.
Pontius Pilate here?
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.
You will make him see what men are born in this land.
I only know that I race against Messala.
ATTENDANT:
Look for the yoke.
Ease that strap.
BEN-HUR:
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.
Into your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as you will.
The Star of David.
To shine out for your people and my people together and blind the eyes of Rome.
[TRUMPETS PLAYING]
They are ready.
ATTENDANT:
Ready, off!
MAN:
Easy, girl, easy.
STARTER:
Number five.
Where is number five?
Whoa.
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.
Yes, this is the day.
SHEIK:
Judah!
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.
[TRUMPETS PLAYING]
Hail, Jupiter.
Give me victory.
[BRASS BAND PLAYING]
[CROWD CHEERING]
ATTENDANT:
Watch your line!
Keep your places!
MAN:
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.
Citizens I welcome you to these games in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.
We dedicate them to his glory and to the glory of Rome of which you are all part.
Let us honor those who race for us today.
They come here from Alexandria Messina Carthage Cyprus Rome Corinth Athens Phrygia and Judea.
[CROWD ROARS]
To the best of these, a crown of victory.
The race begins.
Hail, Caesar!
CROWD:
Hail, Caesar!
Oh, you dog!
Come, my children, come!
The Roman pig!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Steady!
Now, now!
[BAND PLAYING TRIUMPHANT MUSIC]
OFFICER:
Salute.
A great victory.
You are the people's one true god for the time being.
Permit us to worship.
I crown their god.
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.
A long life, young Arrius, and the good sense to live it.
[HEAVY BREATHING]
We cannot wait, tribune.
MESSALA:
He will come.
He will...
[COUGHS AND GASPS]
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.
He will come!
He will come.
I've sent for him, and he will come.
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.
Do you understand?
To hack the legs off me?
Not yet.
Not till I've seen him.
I don't receive him with half a body.
No.
No!
[MESSALA GRUNTING]
I told you, Drusus.
I told you.
Here he is.
Triumph c...
Triumph complete, Judah.
The race won.
The enemy destroyed.
I see no enemy.
What do you think you see?
The smashed body of a wretched animal?
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.
Let me help you.
[GROANS]
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.
Dead.
And the race over.
It isn't over, Judah.
They're not dead.
Where are they?
Look for them in the Valley of the Lepers if you can recognize them.
[BEN-HUR YELLS]
It goes on.
It goes on, Judah.
The race...
The race is not over.
Is there a way down here?
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.
Man.
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.
MAN:
There...
There are many women.
Of the family of Hur.
We have no names here.
For them?
- Why did you tell me they were dead?
- It was what they wanted.
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?
Not to see them?
They are coming.
Love them in the way they must need to be loved.
Not to look at them.
Let them be as if you had never come here.
Please!
Judah!
Is Judah well?
Is he happy?
ESTHER:
Yes, he is well.
Your mind can be at rest for him.
He is well, Miriam.
MIRIAM:
God be with you.
They have gone.
We can go back.
Go back to what?
Judah, they have one blessing left.
To think you remember them as they were and live your own life.
Forget what is here.
Forget?
It's as though they were alive in a grave.
- But what can you do?
- Undo what you've done.
How could you have suffered them to come here?
I must see them.
No, Judah, please!
Judah!
Think, Judah, think.
It would tear them apart if they see you.
Judah!
Judah.
He is here.
I have found him.
The child has become a man.
And the man, I know it now, is the son of God.
The promise is true.
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.
Life has been answered.
God has answered it.
Come.
Come with me.
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys thirst had nearly killed me.
A man gave me water to drink.
I went on living.
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.
No.
I am thirsty still.
Come and listen.
I have business with Rome.
You insist on death.
Goodbye, Judah.
You sent for me?
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.
- I honor him.
- As you may honor yourself.
You have been made a citizen of Rome.
Do you say nothing to this?
I have just come from the Valley of Stone where my mother and sister live what's left of their lives.
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.
I have heard this.
There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.
Where there is greatness, great government or power even great feeling or compassion error also is great.
We progress and mature by fault.
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.
There are other voices.
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place not to crucify yourself on a shadow such as old resentment or impossible loyalties.
Perfect freedom has no existence.
A grown man knows the world he lives in.
And for the present, the world is Rome.
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.
I am Judah Ben-Hur.
I cross this floor in spoken friendship as I would speak to Arrius.
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar ready to crush all those who challenge his authority.
There are too many small men of envy and ambition who try to disrupt the government of Rome.
You have become the victor and hero to those people.
They look to you, their one true god, as I called you.
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.
I am already part of this tragedy.
Return this to Arrius.
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you from personal disaster if you stay here.
You are too great a danger.
Leave Judea.
You have my word.
Judah!
Oh, Judah!
I was afraid you would never come back afraid of what would happen to you.
But I see you again.
Your father's waiting for me.
Where is he?
What do you mean to do?
Oh, Judah.
Rest, sleep.
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.
Peace?
Love and peace.
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?
Where do you see them?
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.
Balthasar's word.
He is more than Balthasar's word.
His voice traveled with such a still purpose.
It was more than a voice.
A man more than a man.
He said, "Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God."
Children of God?
In that dead valley where we left them?
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean until we have scoured off our bodies the crust and filth of being at the mercy of tyranny.
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.
- In blood?
- Yes, in blood!
I know there is a law in life.
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.
Death generates death as the vulture breeds the vulture.
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:
"Love your enemy.
Do good to those who despitefully use you."
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.
As you make us do now.
Are we to bear nothing together?
Even love?
I can hardly draw breath without feeling you in my heart.
But I know that everything I do from this moment will be as great a pain to you as you have ever suffered.
It is better not to love me.
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy giving evil for evil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.
It's as though you had become Messala.
I've lost you, Judah.
MIRIAM:
No further.
What are you doing here?
I was here last evening waiting for you.
I have waited all night.
What has happened?
Where is Tirzah?
Leave the food.
I am coming closer.
Don't be afraid.
- What are you doing?
- Don't be afraid.
I've heard him again, the man from Nazareth.
If ever words were from God, they are in everything he says.
I cannot bear that you should have never known this hand of quiet reaching towards us.
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find him there.
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find him.
[MIRIAM WHIMPERS]
Tirzah is dying.
Leave the food and go.
It's Judah.
Why did you tell him?
Yes, Judah, yes.
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.
Mother.
Wait, Mother, wait.
Let me talk with you.
MIRIAM:
Please.
No, no further.
Please.
No, Judah.
Son, no.
Mother, let me see Tirzah.
Tirzah is dying.
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know that life is everlasting and death is nothing to fear if you have faith.
I will take them to him.
[MIRIAM SHRIEKS]
No!
God, no!
[MIRIAM SOBBING]
No, no, dear son.
Mother where is Tirzah?
Judah, no.
You must not go to her, dear son.
Please.
Dear son.
I am afraid.
ESTHER:
No cause.
The world is more than we know.
[TIRZAH WHIMPERING]
Tirzah, it's Judah.
No.
No, Judah.
No, Judah.
No.
[TIRZAH SOBBING]
BEGGAR:
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
BEN-HUR:
Why are the streets deserted?
- They have gone to the trial.
- Alms for the blind?
- Trial?
Whose trial?
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.
- This cannot be true.
- Alms?
What has he done?
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.
Help for the blind.
WOMAN:
Look, lepers!
GIRL:
Lepers!
MAN 1:
Go away!
MAN 2:
Get away!
Stay away!
Go away!
[MURMURING]
Lepers!
Lepers!
How can this be?
I know this man.
Will someone help him?
TIRZAH:
Take pity on him.
WOMAN:
Have mercy.
Have mercy.
MIRIAM:
In his pain this look of peace.
Watch over them, Esther.
We must go back.
I brought you here to this when I hoped...
You haven't failed, Esther.
MAN:
Hail King of the Jews!
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.
He gave me water and a heart to live.
What has he done to merit this?
He has taken the world of our sins onto himself.
To this end he said he was born in that stable where I first saw him.
For this cause, he came into the world.
For this death?
This beginning.
I have lived too long.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
As though he were carrying in that cross the pain of the world.
So fearful, and yet why is it I'm not afraid anymore?
[THUNDER RUMBLES]
The shadow of a storm.
A strange darkness but still day.
[RUMBLING INTENSIFIES]
His life is over.
[WIND HOWLING]
[THUNDER CRASHING]
TIRZAH:
What is it?
This tearing.
I am in pain.
I feel it too.
Miriam.
I thought I...
Miriam.
Do you see your hand?
Tirzah.
Miriam.
Tirzah.
Almost at the moment he died I heard him say, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do."
- Even then.
- Even then.
And I felt his voice take the sword out of my hand.
[English

BALTHASAR:
In the year of our Lord Judea, for nearly a century, had lain under the mastery of Rome.
In the seventh year of the reign of Augustus Caesar an imperial decree ordered every Judean each to return to his place of birth to be counted and taxed.
The converging ways of many of them led to their capital city, Jerusalem the troubled heart of their land.
The old city was dominated by the fortress of Antonia the seat of Roman power and by the great golden temple the outward sign of an inward and imperishable faith.
Even while they obeyed the will of Caesar the people clung proudly to their ancient heritage always remembering the promise of their prophets that one day there would be born among them a redeemer to bring them salvation and perfect freedom.
[MURMURING]
You'll be counted at Hebron.
- Name?
- Samuel.
- What city?
- Joppa.
- What family?
- Michael.
- Move on.
Move on.
- Yes.
- Name?
- Joseph.
- What city?
- Nazareth.
- What family?
- David of Bethlehem.
- And the woman?
- My wife.
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.
Come on, come on.
[OXEN BELLOWING]
[BABY CRYING]
[SHEEP BAAING]
[TRUMPETS]
What village is this?
Nazareth.
We should arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow night.
You're not watching the soldiers, Joseph?
We've seen Romans before.
Yes and we will see them again.
My table is not finished.
Where is your son?
- He's walking in the hills.
- Mm-hm.
He neglects his work, Joseph.
No.
Once, I reproached him with forgetting his work.
He said to me:
"I must be about my father's business."
Then why isn't he here, working?
He's working.
SEXTUS:
Trumpeters of the legion!
[TRUMPETING]
Welcome, Messala.
The command is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for relieving me.
Drusus when I was a boy, I dreamed of commanding this garrison.
Now the wheel has turned.
I am in command.
OFFICER:
Attention!
Aisle one, face right!
Forward!
I'd forgotten the heat.
If it were only the heat.
I lived here until I was 14.
Jerusalem was my home.
- My father was head of...
- Yes, I know.
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.
If there can be such a thing in this forsaken land.
If you want to rise, Sextus, do the difficult.
I asked to be sent here.
I think you'll find the people changed since you were a boy.
In what way?
Oh, won't pay their taxes, an irrational resentment of Rome...
There's nothing new in all that.
And then there's religion.
I tell you, they're drunk with religion.
They smash the statues of our gods, even those of the emperor.
Punish them.
We do.
When we can find them.
Find the leaders.
Oh, you don't know.
There's nothing you can put your finger on.
I tell you, there are strange forces at work here.
For instance, this "messiah" business...
I know.
There was one predicted when I was a boy.
A king of the Jews, who will lead them into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.
Makes your head spin.
There's a wild man in the desert named John who drowns people in water.
And a carpenter's son who does magic tricks. "Miracles" they call them.
There's always a rabble-rouser stirring up trouble.
No, no, no.
This man is different.
He teaches that God is near, in every man.
[MESSALA SCOFFS]
It's actually quite profound, some of it.
You've been too long away from Rome.
Go back, Sextus.
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea and forget that God is in every man.
- There is divinity in only one man.
- Yes, I know.
The emperor is displeased.
He wishes Judea made into a more obedient and disciplined province.
He has ordered me to restore order.
I intend to carry out his wishes.
But how?
You can break a man's skull, arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.
But how do you control what's up here?
How do you fight an idea?
Especially a new idea.
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.
I assume he has a name.
- He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
- Then treat him like one!
Tell him I will join him.
Yes, tribune.
Centurion!
This was his country before it was ours.
Don't forget that.
Yes, tribune.
Very wise.
This Ben-Hur is the richest man in Jerusalem.
And the head of one of the greatest families in Judea.
We were friends as boys.
We were like brothers.
Sextus you ask how to fight an idea.
Well, I'll tell you how.
With another idea.
I said I'd come back.
I never thought you would.
I'm so glad.
[BOTH LAUGH]
- Look at you.
- Look at you!
You've come back a tribune.
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.
We'll drink another now.
- Your sister and mother?
- They're fine.
They've talked of you ever since we knew you were coming.
- Is Tirzah married?
- No.
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.
She's been in love with you since she was 5.
I can't wait to see them.
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?
Or have you become too dignified?
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
- Down Eros, up Mars!
- Down Eros, up Mars!
MESSALA:
Where the beams cross?
BEN-HUR:
Good.
[BOTH LAUGH]
After all these years!
Still close.
In every way.
I hope so.
I know.
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew whose life you once saved.
The best thing I ever did.
Judah it will be very difficult to govern here.
I'm going to need help.
Your help.
Your advice.
- You want my advice?
- Yes, I do.
Withdraw your legions.
Give us our freedom.
Unfortunately, the emperor is devoted to his empire.
He's particularly fond of Judea.
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.
Is there anything so sad as unrequited love?
[MESSALA CHUCKLES]
My quarters.
Hmm.
A bit grim.
Not grim.
Austere.
Virtuous.
Roman.
I'm going to be second-in-command to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.
He's arriving in a few days with two more legions.
Then the rumors are true.
The emperor does not approve of your countrymen.
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.
But you and your family need have no concern.
I'm next in authority to the governor, and you're my friend.
- I'm a Jew.
- Ah, you are like a Roman!
What have you in common with the troublemaking rabble?
Rabble?
They're my people.
I'm one of them.
Be wise, Judah.
It's a Roman world.
If you want to live in it, you must become part of it.
You've changed.
I've grown up.
I've seen the world since I left Jerusalem.
I've seen Rome.
It's no accident that one small village on the Tiber was chosen to rule the world.
Your legions.
It wasn't just our legions.
Other countries have armies, fine armies.
I know, I fought them.
Oh, no.
No, it was fate that chose us to civilize the world.
And we have.
Our roads and ships connect every corner of the earth.
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.
I believe in the future of my people.
Of course you do.
And you can help them.
How?
You're an aristocrat.
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince among your people.
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.
They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.
Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.
It is worse than stupid, futile!
For it can end in only one way, extinction for your people!
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.
Then we're agreed!
Now, when can I come to see your family?
- We had hoped tomorrow.
- Good.
And now for our toast.
It's dreadful wine, by the way.
It's especially fermented for the Roman army.
[MESSALA CHUCKLES]
You're very cruel to your conquerors.
It's an insane world.
But in it there is one sanity:
The loyalty of old friends.
Judah, we must believe in one another.
Will you drink to that?
With all my heart.
Here it is, the place I've remembered.
The court where we played at changing the guard.
The roof where we'd throw pebbles at people in the street and then hide.
- We were rascals, weren't we?
- No, you were good boys.
I would have that time again.
And here it is.
Nothing has changed.
Except for the fountain.
- The old well would go dry, remember?
- Promptly, every summer.
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.
- He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
- No?
Of course he has.
He was a boy when he left us, now he's a man.
With great responsibilities.
Come.
The emperor builds and builds, turning brick to marble.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.
I've never seen anything like this before.
It's beautiful!
- Is it Roman?
- It's Libyan.
I was there last year.
A tremendous campaign.
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.
Or was, till we destroyed it.
Now it's nothing but ashes.
I'm boring you with soldier stories.
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.
Thank you for this.
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.
BEN-HUR:
What do you think of it?
MESSALA:
Magnificent.
It's Arabic.
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.
Let me try him sometime.
Whenever you like.
He's yours.
Do you mean you'll give me this?
Oh, Judah.
You are good.
It's going to be like old times, I know it.
Judah, tell me, did you think about what I said?
Yes.
Talked to a number of people already.
Spoken against violence, against incidents.
Most of the men agree with me.
Most?
Not all?
- No, not all.
- Who does not agree?
Well, the resentful, the impatient.
Who are they?
Yes, Judah.
Who are they?
Would I retain your friendship if I became an informer?
Telling the names of criminals is not informing.
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.
Patriots?
!
Judah.
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.
This is my great opportunity, and yours too.
If I bring order here, I can have any post I want.
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?
Rome!
Yes, perhaps at the side of Caesar himself.
I mean it.
It can happen and this is the moment.
I swear, this is the time.
The emperor is watching us, judging us.
All I need do is serve him.
And all you need do is help me serve him.
- You speak as if he were God.
- He is God.
The only God.
He is power, real power on earth, not...
Not that.
Help me, Judah.
I would do anything for you, Messala except betray my own people.
In the name of all the gods, what do the lives of a few Jews mean to you?
If I cannot persuade them, that does not mean I would help you murder them.
Besides, you must understand this, Messala.
I believe in the past and future of my people.
Future?
You are a conquered people.
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?
Joshua will not rise again to save you nor David.
There is only one reality in the world today.
Look to the West.
Don't be a fool!
Look to Rome!
Better a fool than a traitor or a killer.
- I am a soldier.
- Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.
- I warn you...
- No!
I warn you.
Rome is an affront to God.
Rome is strangling my people and my country, the whole earth!
But not forever.
And I tell you, the day Rome falls there will be a shout of freedom such as the world has never heard before.
Judah.
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.
You're either for me or against me.
If that is the choice then I am against you.
There they are.
Where's Messala?
- Where's?
- He's gone.
Gone?
- But why?
- He couldn't stay.
- What happened?
- A new tribune must have many duties.
Come.
Let us have dinner.
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the world who bringeth to us bread from the earth.
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.
He wanted to use me to betray our people.
Judah.
[MURMURING]
[CAMEL BAYING]
- Master, the caravan from Antioch.
- Yes, Amrah, I saw.
Simonides.
- Welcome.
- Judah.
- Oh, welcome homecoming.
- Master.
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.
And for the master, lberian wine.
Not to mention the best gift of all, your presence.
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.
- Caravans from Petra.
- Have all arrived.
- Good.
- Here is the accounting.
And what of Numidia?
The trade route is ours, guaranteed by treaty with the king.
Once a year, you bring your accounting.
And once a year, I find myself wealthier.
Yeah, but my greatest treasure is my steward.
SIMONIDES:
My life belongs to the House of Hur.
Nothing else exists for me, except my daughter.
- She must be a young woman by now.
- Yes, and your property.
She was born the daughter of your slave.
When I inherited you, I inherited a friend, not a slave.
Still, Esther has come with me from Antioch for your permission to marry.
It's granted.
I wish you the joy of many grandchildren.
SIMONIDES:
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.
With your permission, Esther wishes to speak to her master.
You're eager to marry, Esther?
It is my father's wish.
Your husband will be fortunate.
What is his name?
David, son of Mathias.
BEN-HUR:
Of what house?
- His own, master.
- He is a freeman.
Tell me more about him.
I have seen him only once.
He is a merchant, well-thought-of in Antioch.
He will pay for Esther's freedom.
Her freedom will be my wedding gift to Esther.
You are generous, master.
Do you love this man?
I will learn to love him.
You have my permission to marry.
We'll drink to your happiness.
And a safe return to Antioch.
BEN-HUR:
I disturbed you.
No.
What were you thinking?
I was saying goodbye to this city and this house.
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?
My father sometimes brought me here when I was little.
It was a house where I was always happy.
Except once.
When you and your friend, the Roman boy...
- Messala.
- Yes.
You had been out hunting and they brought you home injured.
I touched your face as you lay there and prayed to God, "Don't let this boy die."
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.
Yes, master.
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.
It's strange.
I hardly felt a slave.
And now I hardly feel free.
You know, in the old, wise days of Solomon if there was among his slaves some girl who filled his eyes he could choose her out from the rest and take her to him.
Wise days of Solomon.
Different days.
And long ago.
If you were not a bride I should kiss you goodbye.
If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said.
Your slave ring.
Fair exchange.
Freedom to you.
The ring to me.
You will wear it?
Until you meet the woman you will marry?
Until then.
[DRUMMING]
[TRUMPETING]
The gods favor my lord Gratus.
If it is the governor's pleasure, the wreath of office.
Thank you, tribune.
I see no delegation from the city.
- There will not be one, sir.
- No?
Jerusalem's welcome will not be a warm one.
But I pledge, my lord, it will be a quiet one.
Let us proceed.

There's Messala.
He saw you, Judah.
The new governor.

Judah!
Tirzah!
What is it?
What's happened?
OFFICER 4:
Open up in the name of Rome!
- I was watching the Romans...
- A tile fell and struck the governor.
- It wasn't my fault.
- They won't believe her.
She won't have to say anything.
You hear?
Tirzah, say nothing.
MAN:
Open the gates!
I'll speak to them.
OFFICER 1:

Let me tell you what happened.
OFFICER 2:

BEN-HUR:

- Judah!
BEN-HUR:
It was an accident.
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.
- This is the man, sir.
We saw him.
- It was an accident.
- Accident?
- I swear it.
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose.
It gave way.
Take him.
Take all of them.
MIRIAM:
He's telling the truth!
- It was me!
Let them go!
MIRIAM:
Judah!
CENTURION:
Attention!
BEN-HUR:
Messala.
In the name of God, tell them it's a mistake.
I leaned on the tile, and it broke loose.
It was an accident.
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!
MIRIAM:
Messala!
TIRZAH:
Messala.
Let the servants go.
Let them go.
Return to your ranks.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
- Come.
- Where?
Tirus.
Tirus?
I've had no trial.
I'm to die in the galleys without even a trial?
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!
Wait.
My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?
Tie his hands.
- At least tell me if they're safe.
- I can tell you nothing.

You can go.
Go!
The door.
Where are my mother and sister?
Where are they?
Here, within these walls.
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.
Of course, they will be sentenced.
Is it possible, Messala?
Is it possible you could do this to us?
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?
You'll let them go.
You must.
You will gladly let them go!
Messala!
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not mad.
I'm not a murderer!
I know you're not.
You know?
You are evil.
No, Judah, I am not evil.
I wanted your help.
Now you've given it to me.
By making this example of you, I discourage treason.
By condemning without hesitation an old friend, I shall be feared.
But not my family.
Let them go.
Please.
- Messala, I beg you.
- Beg?
!
Didn't I beg you?
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.
Kill me, and your mother and sister will die today nailed to crosses in front of you!
Go on, Judah.
Kill me!
[GRUNTS]
May God grant me vengeance.
I will pray that you live till I return.
Return?
Take him.
OFFICER:
Sentries, salute.
The tribune will see you now.
Tribune, I'm steward of the House of Hur.
I remember you.
We were on our way to Antioch when we heard what had happened.
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done this thing.
You knew him, tribune.
Better than you.
Then there must be no doubt in your mind, the charge is groundless.
The prisoners have been sentenced.
- Sentenced?
- But there's no truth in it.
There was never a threat against the governor in Judah's mind.
Surely you must know he would never have done this.
In your heart, you must know it.
Drusus.
This man had better be kept here until we have time to question him.

In a few minutes, the consul's barge will be coming alongside.
Be ready to raise oars.
HORTATOR:
Raise oars!

[TRUMPETING]
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.
- How many rowers?
- Two hundred, consul.
- And reliefs?
- Of 30, every hour.
[MAN COUGHING]
This man is ill.
Replace him.
- Change him.
- Right, sir.
- This man has been giving you trouble?
- He's insubordinate, consul.
That will stop.
What service have you seen?
Forty-one.
A month's less a day in this ship.
You keep an exact account.
And before?
Three years in other ships.
Three years.
[BEN-HUR YELLS]
You have the spirit to fight back but the good sense to control it.
Your eyes are full of hate, 41.
That's good.
Hate keeps a man alive.
It gives him strength.
Now, listen to me, all of you.
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
So row well and live.
- Ship ready, consul.
- Strike oars.
HORTATOR:
Strike oars!
You know that a fleet of Macedonian galleys has been raiding Roman commerce.
The emperor has honored us with the task of seeking out and destroying them.

Why are you here?
I was ordered to report to you during my relief.
Oh, yes.
I'd forgotten.
You could have killed me as I lay there.
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?
I'm not ready to die.
What do you think will save you?
The God of my fathers.
Hmm.
Your God has forsaken you.
He has no more power than the images I pray to.
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.
I might.
Does that interest you, 41?
I can see that it does.
I'm a fighting man by profession, and in my leisure moments it amuses me to train fighting men.
I own some of the best gladiators and charioteers in Rome.
Would you like to become one of them?
To die as your slave?
Better than to live in chains below these decks.
I will not be here forever.
No?
What would you do if you escaped?
Two people were condemned with me, my mother and sister though they were innocent.
I won't rest...
Do not say that you were innocent.
- Would it do any good to say it again?
- No.
Consider my offer carefully.
You will never escape while we are victorious.
If we are not, you will sink with this ship, chained to your oar.
I cannot believe that God has let me live these three years to die chained to an oar.
It's a strange, stubborn faith you keep to believe that existence has a purpose.
A sane man would have learned to lose it long before this.
As you have.
What drove it out of you?
Go back to your oar, 41.
Consul, enemy sighted.
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.

[MUSIC AND CHEERING STOPS]
You have cleared the seaways of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.
This baton of victory has been nobly won.
[CROWD CHEERS]
This man riding beside you, who is he?
The man who saved me, divine emperor, to return and serve you.
Is that all you know about him?
No.
He was accused of an attack on the governor of Judea.
But he was innocent.
If not, there's a strange inconsistency in this man who tries to kill my governor, yet saves the life of my consul.
Come tomorrow.
We'll talk of it.
[CROWD CHEERS]
[BAND PLAYING TRIUMPHANT MUSIC]
We have all the information on this man a man of some influence in his own country.
His attack upon our governor is one upon the senate and the people of Rome.
I am convinced that no such attack was intended.
Consul, allow us to continue.
Allow us to be generous.
As a reward to you for your great victory we shall not send him back to the galleys.
We give him to you as your slave to do with him as you like.
Such is the will of the senate and the people of Rome.
[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]
[WOMEN YELLING]
[BAND PLAYING SOFT MUSIC]
Not long ago, I returned to Rome with a young man who had saved my life.
You all know him as the finest charioteer in Rome.
Five times, he's driven my horses to victory.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I know him as one who stands in the place of the son I lost.
I have the love and pride in a son's achievements which I thought I should never have again.
[MURMURING]
Nothing could make stronger the bond between us but tonight I wish to share it with you all.
The formalities of adoption have been completed.
Young Arrius is now the legal bearer of my name and the heir to my property.
[CROWD MURMURS]
This ring of my ancestors would have gone to my son.
So now it is yours.
It's a strange destiny that brought me to a new life a new home a new father.
It brought me here.
It may take me away.
But wherever I may be I shall always try to wear this ring as a son of Arrius should.
With gratitude and affection and with honor.
[CROWD CHEERING]
[SOFT MUSIC RESUMES]
I present my son to you.
My old friend Pontius Pilate, young Arrius.
Before you came to this city, my horses always won.
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.
Yes, but not swift enough to defeat you.
- Tell me, you come from Judea?
- Yes, sir.
I hear that the climate is difficult to live in.
Not for Judeans.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.
- Of Judea?
- Yes.
I asked for Alexandria.
But it seems the wilderness needs my particular talents.
The scorpions and holy prophets can't get on without me.
Lay the dust of Judea, at least for this evening.
Goats and Jehovah.
[ARRIUS CHUCKLES]
You're leaving.
I must.
It's a journey I can't keep you from.
Your eyes have never left it all these months.
I can recognize pain.
But still, my counsel is to wait.
Gratus is to be replaced.
The governorship goes to Pontius Pilate.
When?
Very soon.
It's very much to our purpose.
Nothing is to the purpose if, when I come back to Judea, I come too late.
That is the thought which has punished me every moment I've spent here.
Will Rome see you again?
Here is a part of my life which you have made for me.
I shall remember it.
Whoever the gods are, they take small interest in an old man's hopes.
They have their way.
Forgive me.
You're a stranger here.
Would you be from Nazareth?
Why do you ask?
I thought you might be the one...
The one that I have come back from my country to find.
He would be about your age.
Who?
When I find him I shall know him.
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.
SHEIK:
Hyah!
Hyah!
Sack of flesh without brains!
No!
No!
Not the whip!
That is my host.
SHEIK:
Gently!
Gently!
Fool!
Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood!
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run!
Go on!
SHEIK:
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!
Beautiful horses.
Now!
Now!
They are ready!
Let them go!
Watch.
They'll never hold the turn.
SHEIK:
No!
No!
Abadon, stop him!
Stop that whip!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill!
SHEIK:
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!
You think you can treat my horses like animals?
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!
Get off, idiot!
SHEIK:
Drive goats, not horses!
Now I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.
Hmm?
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.
Not a team?
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.
- Antares.
- The slow one?
SHEIK:
Uh-huh.
I think he should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?
In the circus in Rome.
You have driven in the great circus?
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.
No other animal has descended so in scale from the first innocent falling of the world.
[SHEIK CHUCKLES]
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.
Yes.
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.
Your coming here was so fit, so right.
We might have achieved wonders.
You have to go.
I make a journey which will not wait.
Well, then perhaps you will come back.
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.
I have no wives.
No wives at all?
I have six, no, seven.
BALTHASAR:
Ha, ha.
I've counted eight.
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.
- Someday, I hope to have one.
- One wife!
Ha, ha, one God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.
It is not generous.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
[BURPS]
- Was the food not to your liking?
- Indeed.
[BURPS]
Thank you.
Thank you.
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.
And now I must say good night to my beauties.
When they're ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.
- I'll make my farewells then.
- No, no, no, stay.
Stay and see them.
Come, my children.
Come.
Strangers make them shy.
Come.
Come, do not be afraid.
Come.
There, my children.
They are descended from the Arabians of the first Pharaohs and I have named them for the stars.
Come, Antares.
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.
[ANTARES WHINNIES]
What?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.
Come, Rigel.
We've both supped well, and the world is good.
[CHUCKLES]
There's my good Rigel.
Ah.
Yes, you are ready for sleep.
The day's work done for you, eh?
Ah.
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.
Good night.
Good night, my treasure.
Ah!
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.
No.
You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.
[CHUCKLES]
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.
You should see their mother, Mira.
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.
All right, all right.
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.
You must be strong and swift.
Go, my children.
Go.
When they reach Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams not to mention the champion of the East, Messala, with his black devils.
He stops at nothing to win.
- Messala?
In the circus?
- Yes.
You knew him?
I know him.
Perhaps without much liking.
Judah Ben-Hur, my people are praying for a man to drive their team to victory over Messala.
You could be that man, the one to stamp his arrogance into the sand.
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.
It's not possible.
That is a pity.
Think of it.
To break his pride to humble this tribune before the very people he has degraded.
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!
I know it is not possible.
Does it not delight your imagination?
Does it not answer your purpose?
I must deal with Messala in my own way.
And your way is to kill him.
I see this terrible thing in your eyes, Judah Ben-Hur.
But no matter what this man has done, you have no right to take his life.
He will be punished inevitably.
I don't believe in miracles.
But all life is a miracle.
Why will you not accept God's judgment?
You do not believe in miracles.
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness and a star led me to a village called Bethlehem where I found a newborn child in a manger.
And God lived in this child.
By now, he is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.
That is why I have returned here so that I may be at hand when he comes among us.
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.
Perhaps he's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.
Perhaps he is a shepherd a merchant, a fisherman.
But he lives and all our lives from now on will carry his mark.
There are many paths to God, my son.
I hope yours will not be too difficult.
I'm ready for sleep.
Balthasar is a good man but until all men are like him, we must keep our swords bright.
And our intention true.
So I must leave you.
One last thought.
There is no law in the arena.
Many are killed.
I hope to see you again.
MERCHANT:
Fine Damascus silk.
Fine Damascus silk.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Esther?
[ESTHER GASPS]
It's Judah.
[GASPS]
Judah.
- You are alive.
- Esther.
You are alive.
What are you doing here?
What has happened?
[ESTHER SOBBING]
Shh.
I'm here.
I'm with you.
Esther.
Where's your father?
Hmm?
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.
They tortured him.
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.
You never went back to Antioch?
No.
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.
Esther.
Where are my mother and sister?
SIMONIDES:
Esther.
Let me tell him first.
Father.
Father, something wonderful has happened.
- Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
- Judah.
He has come home.
He is here.
Judah.
Judah Ben-Hur.
My dear old friend.
Let me look at you.
Let me see you.
Yes, yes.
It is true.
Praise God for his mercy.
Where are they?
Since that terrible day there has been no word of them.
You should have been less loyal.
Do not pity me, Master Judah.
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.
We were released on the same day.
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.
Since then, I have been his tongue and he has been my legs.
Together, we make a considerable man.
Old friend.
She always said you would return.
She never gave up hope.
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.
I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.
But suppose that isn't possible.
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.
They could not make me tell them where it is.
It is there still to put power into our hands and buy death for the Romans.
That's not why I came back.
Judah, they are dead.
Four years.
No one could live so long in the dungeons.
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?
SIMONIDES:
Yes, it is true.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You have come back to us like a returning faith.
Judah, I should like to laugh again.
- Let us laugh.
- We will.
There will be joy again in this house.
We will celebrate among the dust.
[SOBBING]
I will take him.
We stood here before.
A long while ago.
Four years.
But now it seems as if only yesterday...
I was saying:
"If you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye."
"If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said."
I am not a bride.
Why did you never marry?
My father needed me.
And also...
It's still on my finger.
I said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.
It's become a part of my hand.
If Messala once knew you were here...
As he must.
He will know where they are.
And if you should find?
- If he should tell you they're dead...
- Then Messala will wish they were living.
I've seen too much of what hate can do.
My father is burned up with it.
But I've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater and love more powerful than hatred.
I believe it.
- Esther.
- Judah.
Stay alive.
Keep away from Messala.
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.
That time isn't yet come.
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.
This time you will be destroyed.
You'll die.
Tribune, compliments of Quintus Arrius.
He awaits your pleasure.
- Consul here?
- Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.
Thank him.
Bring him to me.
- I didn't know the consul had a son.
- He's a champion of the great circus.
Why is he here presenting me with gifts?
- Perhaps he'll race against you.
- Look.
It's magnificent.
And from a man I've never met.
You're wrong, Messala.
Judah.
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?
You were the magician, Messala.
You condemned me to the galleys.
When my ship was sunk, I saved the consul's life.
You know his seal?
Now I have come back as I swore I would.
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.
You suggest I use it on myself?
What has become of my mother and my sister?
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.
Find them, Messala.
Restore them to me, and I'll forget what I vowed with every stroke of that oar you chained me to.
I am not the governor of Judea.
I can do nothing without approval.
Then get it.
I will come back tomorrow.
Don't disappoint me, Messala.
What became of them?
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?
Go to the citadel, Drusus.
Find out.
- And if they're dead?
- They're dead!
"Miriam, wife.
Tirzah, daughter."
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?
East section lower level.
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.
PRISONER 1:
Water.
Water.
PRISONER 2:
Let me out!
PRISONER 3:
Hear us!
Hear us!
[POUNDING]
- How long since you've seen them?
- Never.
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.
The food disappears.
Lepers.
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.
Then we'll burn out the cell.
[COUGHING]
ESTHER:
Is someone there?
[RUSTLING]
There is someone there.
Who are you?
MIRIAM:
Don't come any closer.
Who are you?
Esther.
It's Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam?
MIRIAM:
Stay where you are.
You have come home.
MIRIAM:
Stand back, Esther.
We are lepers.
[GASPS]
Oh, Esther.
Tirzah.
Esther is Judah living?
Yes, he is alive.
He is here.
Where?
He is searching for you now.
I must find him and tell him.
MIRIAM:
No!
- Tell my father.
MIRIAM:
No.
Tell no one.
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.
We won't return.
But Judah has to be told.
MIRIAM:
No.
Please.
I couldn't see his face.
Is it changed?
No, he is not changed.
He...
He's not changed.
You love him, Esther.
Promise me on your love for him you will never tell him you've seen us.
Is he never to know?
Let him remember us as we were.
Promise me.
There's nothing else I can hope for.
Only this.
I promise you.
I am content.
Wait.
[CRIES]
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.
I pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.
He'll free them.
He wants to survive.
He cannot free them, Judah.
What do you mean?
- I saw them.
- You saw them?
Where?
When did you see them?
They were dead.
When?
When?
When?
In the prison.
When I was waiting for news of my father.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't tell you.
Nor even you, Father.
I was afraid that if you saw Messala...
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.
It's over now.
Over?
- Judah.
- Over?
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.
[SOBBING]
[MURMURING]
[MEN CHUCKLING]
SHEIK:
Gentlemen.
Officers.
Defenders of great Rome's imperium may I enter?
Certainly, sheik.
You do us an unexpected honor.
The noble tribune is most gracious.
And now, the question you're all asking yourselves:
Why am I here?
As you know, I am a gambling man.
The games approach.
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.
But I will back my own poor horses.
No limits?
MARIUS:
Mark me first!
- And me!
MATELLUS:
What odds?
- A moment, please my lords, protectors of the far flung marshes.
May I first, uh, sit down?
MARIUS:
Sit down.
Lie down.
How much will you wager?
- Yes, let's call his game.
SPINTHO:
Give the Arab a seat.
A bench, quickly.
Thank you.
- Now.
- One thousand denarii.
- Two thousand!
- Mark me!
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient.
There is time and money enough for all.
First, gentlemen, the odds.
The tribune has won many times.
The odds should be in the same measure.
Now, what is your pleasure, gentlemen?
MARIUS:
Two to one.
[SHEIK CHUCKLES]
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth where is the courage that made Rome master of the world?
I can get better odds on any street market.
MARIUS:
Three to one.
Let us not haggle.
Let us be fair.
In four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.
- In all truth...
- Just a moment.
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?
Oh.
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.
The Prince of Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur.
Prince of Hur?
[CHUCKLES]
- He was sent to the galleys years ago.
- He has returned.
Returned?
Impossible.
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.
Well?
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.
You, tribune will you give me four to one?
Four to one.
- Good.
- Bravo, Messala.
Four to one, sheik.
The difference between a Roman and a Jew.
Or an Arab.
[ROMANS LAUGH]
[CHUCKLES]
Bravely spoken.
Now we will settle the amount of our wager.
I will venture...
A thousand talents?
- A thousand talents?
- Yes, a thousand talents.
Of course, if it is too much...
A thousand talents it will be.
Agreed.
[MURMURING]
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.
You're good fellows.
If only men were this good.
Hey!
Remember, Altair nine times around the circus, huh?
Aldebaran.
Hey, ha, ha.
Rigel, did you hear?
Nine lives to live.
My swift fellow.
You must not win the race the first time around.
You win the last time around.
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.
Steady Antares.
Like a rock.
You will be our anchor.
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.
They have taken me into their family.
Rest well, my stars.
Tomorrow we go up to the city.
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it the news will scorch the streets of the whole Roman world.
Pontius Pilate here?
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.
You will make him see what men are born in this land.
I only know that I race against Messala.
ATTENDANT:
Look for the yoke.
Ease that strap.
BEN-HUR:
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.
Into your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as you will.
The Star of David.
To shine out for your people and my people together and blind the eyes of Rome.
[TRUMPETS PLAYING]
They are ready.
ATTENDANT:
Ready, off!
MAN:
Easy, girl, easy.
STARTER:
Number five.
Where is number five?
Whoa.
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.
Yes, this is the day.
SHEIK:
Judah!
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.
[TRUMPETS PLAYING]
Hail, Jupiter.
Give me victory.
[BRASS BAND PLAYING]
[CROWD CHEERING]
ATTENDANT:
Watch your line!
Keep your places!
MAN:
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.
Citizens I welcome you to these games in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.
We dedicate them to his glory and to the glory of Rome of which you are all part.
Let us honor those who race for us today.
They come here from Alexandria Messina Carthage Cyprus Rome Corinth Athens Phrygia and Judea.
[CROWD ROARS]
To the best of these, a crown of victory.
The race begins.
Hail, Caesar!
CROWD:
Hail, Caesar!
Oh, you dog!
Come, my children, come!
The Roman pig!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Steady!
Now, now!
[BAND PLAYING TRIUMPHANT MUSIC]
OFFICER:
Salute.
A great victory.
You are the people's one true god for the time being.
Permit us to worship.
I crown their god.
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.
A long life, young Arrius, and the good sense to live it.
[HEAVY BREATHING]
We cannot wait, tribune.
MESSALA:
He will come.
He will...
[COUGHS AND GASPS]
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.
He will come!
He will come.
I've sent for him, and he will come.
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.
Do you understand?
To hack the legs off me?
Not yet.
Not till I've seen him.
I don't receive him with half a body.
No.
No!
[MESSALA GRUNTING]
I told you, Drusus.
I told you.
Here he is.
Triumph c...
Triumph complete, Judah.
The race won.
The enemy destroyed.
I see no enemy.
What do you think you see?
The smashed body of a wretched animal?
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.
Let me help you.
[GROANS]
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.
Dead.
And the race over.
It isn't over, Judah.
They're not dead.
Where are they?
Look for them in the Valley of the Lepers if you can recognize them.
[BEN-HUR YELLS]
It goes on.
It goes on, Judah.
The race...
The race is not over.
Is there a way down here?
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.
Man.
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.
MAN:
There...
There are many women.
Of the family of Hur.
We have no names here.
For them?
- Why did you tell me they were dead?
- It was what they wanted.
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?
Not to see them?
They are coming.
Love them in the way they must need to be loved.
Not to look at them.
Let them be as if you had never come here.
Please!
Judah!
Is Judah well?
Is he happy?
ESTHER:
Yes, he is well.
Your mind can be at rest for him.
He is well, Miriam.
MIRIAM:
God be with you.
They have gone.
We can go back.
Go back to what?
Judah, they have one blessing left.
To think you remember them as they were and live your own life.
Forget what is here.
Forget?
It's as though they were alive in a grave.
- But what can you do?
- Undo what you've done.
How could you have suffered them to come here?
I must see them.
No, Judah, please!
Judah!
Think, Judah, think.
It would tear them apart if they see you.
Judah!
Judah.
He is here.
I have found him.
The child has become a man.
And the man, I know it now, is the son of God.
The promise is true.
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.
Life has been answered.
God has answered it.
Come.
Come with me.
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys thirst had nearly killed me.
A man gave me water to drink.
I went on living.
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.
No.
I am thirsty still.
Come and listen.
I have business with Rome.
You insist on death.
Goodbye, Judah.
You sent for me?
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.
- I honor him.
- As you may honor yourself.
You have been made a citizen of Rome.
Do you say nothing to this?
I have just come from the Valley of Stone where my mother and sister live what's left of their lives.
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.
I have heard this.
There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.
Where there is greatness, great government or power even great feeling or compassion error also is great.
We progress and mature by fault.
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.
There are other voices.
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place not to crucify yourself on a shadow such as old resentment or impossible loyalties.
Perfect freedom has no existence.
A grown man knows the world he lives in.
And for the present, the world is Rome.
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.
I am Judah Ben-Hur.
I cross this floor in spoken friendship as I would speak to Arrius.
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar ready to crush all those who challenge his authority.
There are too many small men of envy and ambition who try to disrupt the government of Rome.
You have become the victor and hero to those people.
They look to you, their one true god, as I called you.
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.
I am already part of this tragedy.
Return this to Arrius.
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you from personal disaster if you stay here.
You are too great a danger.
Leave Judea.
You have my word.
Judah!
Oh, Judah!
I was afraid you would never come back afraid of what would happen to you.
But I see you again.
Your father's waiting for me.
Where is he?
What do you mean to do?
Oh, Judah.
Rest, sleep.
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.
Peace?
Love and peace.
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?
Where do you see them?
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.
Balthasar's word.
He is more than Balthasar's word.
His voice traveled with such a still purpose.
It was more than a voice.
A man more than a man.
He said, "Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God."
Children of God?
In that dead valley where we left them?
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean until we have scoured off our bodies the crust and filth of being at the mercy of tyranny.
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.
- In blood?
- Yes, in blood!
I know there is a law in life.
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.
Death generates death as the vulture breeds the vulture.
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:
"Love your enemy.
Do good to those who despitefully use you."
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.
As you make us do now.
Are we to bear nothing together?
Even love?
I can hardly draw breath without feeling you in my heart.
But I know that everything I do from this moment will be as great a pain to you as you have ever suffered.
It is better not to love me.
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy giving evil for evil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.
It's as though you had become Messala.
I've lost you, Judah.
MIRIAM:
No further.
What are you doing here?
I was here last evening waiting for you.
I have waited all night.
What has happened?
Where is Tirzah?
Leave the food.
I am coming closer.
Don't be afraid.
- What are you doing?
- Don't be afraid.
I've heard him again, the man from Nazareth.
If ever words were from God, they are in everything he says.
I cannot bear that you should have never known this hand of quiet reaching towards us.
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find him there.
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find him.
[MIRIAM WHIMPERS]
Tirzah is dying.
Leave the food and go.
It's Judah.
Why did you tell him?
Yes, Judah, yes.
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.
Mother.
Wait, Mother, wait.
Let me talk with you.
MIRIAM:
Please.
No, no further.
Please.
No, Judah.
Son, no.
Mother, let me see Tirzah.
Tirzah is dying.
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know that life is everlasting and death is nothing to fear if you have faith.
I will take them to him.
[MIRIAM SHRIEKS]
No!
God, no!
[MIRIAM SOBBING]
No, no, dear son.
Mother where is Tirzah?
Judah, no.
You must not go to her, dear son.
Please.
Dear son.
I am afraid.
ESTHER:
No cause.
The world is more than we know.
[TIRZAH WHIMPERING]
Tirzah, it's Judah.
No.
No, Judah.
No, Judah.
No.
[TIRZAH SOBBING]
BEGGAR:
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
BEN-HUR:
Why are the streets deserted?
- They have gone to the trial.
- Alms for the blind?
- Trial?
Whose trial?
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.
- This cannot be true.
- Alms?
What has he done?
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.
Help for the blind.
WOMAN:
Look, lepers!
GIRL:
Lepers!
MAN 1:
Go away!
MAN 2:
Get away!
Stay away!
Go away!
[MURMURING]
Lepers!
Lepers!
How can this be?
I know this man.
Will someone help him?
TIRZAH:
Take pity on him.
WOMAN:
Have mercy.
Have mercy.
MIRIAM:
In his pain this look of peace.
Watch over them, Esther.
We must go back.
I brought you here to this when I hoped...
You haven't failed, Esther.
MAN:
Hail King of the Jews!
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.
He gave me water and a heart to live.
What has he done to merit this?
He has taken the world of our sins onto himself.
To this end he said he was born in that stable where I first saw him.
For this cause, he came into the world.
For this death?
This beginning.
I have lived too long.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
As though he were carrying in that cross the pain of the world.
So fearful, and yet why is it I'm not afraid anymore?
[THUNDER RUMBLES]
The shadow of a storm.
A strange darkness but still day.
[RUMBLING INTENSIFIES]
His life is over.
[WIND HOWLING]
[THUNDER CRASHING]
TIRZAH:
What is it?
This tearing.
I am in pain.
I feel it too.
Miriam.
I thought I...
Miriam.
Do you see your hand?
Tirzah.
Miriam.
Tirzah.
Almost at the moment he died I heard him say, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do."
- Even then.
- Even then.
And I felt his voice take the sword out of my hand.
BALTHASAR:
In the year of our Lord.(courtesy vijayvvb)..
...Judea, for nearly a century, had lain under the mastery of Rome.
In the seventh year of the reign of Augustus Caesar an imperial decree ordered every Judean each to return to his place of birth to be counted and taxed.
The converging ways of many of them led to their capital city, Jerusalem the troubled heart of their land.
The old city was dominated by the fortress of Antonia the seat of Roman power and by the great golden temple the outward sign of an inward and imperishable faith.
Even while they obeyed the will of Caesar the people clung proudly to their ancient heritage always remembering the promise of their prophets that one day there would be born among them a redeemer to bring them salvation and perfect freedom.
[MURMURING]
You'll be counted at Hebron.
- Name?
- Samuel.
- What city?
- Joppa.
- What family?
- Michael.
- Move on.
Move on.
- Yes.
- Name?
- Joseph.
- What city?
- Nazareth.
- What family?
- David of Bethlehem.
- And the woman?
- My wife.
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.
Come on, come on.
[OXEN BELLOWING]
[BABY CRYING]
[SHEEP BAAING]
[TRUMPETS]
What village is this?
Nazareth.
We should arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow night.
You're not watching the soldiers, Joseph?
We've seen Romans before.
Yes and we will see them again.
My table is not finished.
Where is your son?
- He's walking in the hills.
- Mm-hm.
He neglects his work, Joseph.
No.
Once, I reproached him with forgetting his work.
He said to me:
"I must be about my father's business."
Then why isn't he here, working?
He's working.
SEXTUS:
Trumpeters of the legion!
[TRUMPETING]
Welcome, Messala.
The command is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for relieving me.
Drusus when I was a boy, I dreamed of commanding this garrison.
Now the wheel has turned.
I am in command.
OFFICER:
Attention!
Aisle one, face right!
Forward!
I'd forgotten the heat.
If it were only the heat.
I lived here until I was 14.
Jerusalem was my home.
- My father was head of...
- Yes, I know.
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.
If there can be such a thing in this forsaken land.
If you want to rise, Sextus, do the difficult.
I asked to be sent here.
I think you'll find the people changed since you were a boy.
In what way?
Oh, won't pay their taxes, an irrational resentment of Rome....
There's nothing new in all that.
And then there's religion.
I tell you, they're drunk with religion.
They smash the statues of our gods, even those of the emperor.
Punish them.
We do.
When we can find them.
Find the leaders.
Oh, you don't know.
There's nothing you can put your finger on.
I tell you, there are strange forces at work here.
For instance, this "messiah" business...
I know.
There was one predicted when I was a boy.
A king of the Jews, who will lead them into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.
Makes your head spin.
There's a wild man in the desert named John who drowns people in water.
And a carpenter's son who does magic tricks. "Miracles" they call them.
There's always a rabble-rouser stirring up trouble.
No, no, no.
This man is different.
He teaches that God is near, in every man.
[MESSALA SCOFFS]
It's actually quite profound, some of it.
You've been too long away from Rome.
Go back, Sextus.
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea and forget that God is in every man.
- There is divinity in only one man.
- Yes, I know.
The emperor is displeased.
He wishes Judea made into a more obedient and disciplined province.
He has ordered me to restore order.
I intend to carry out his wishes.
But how?
You can break a man's skull, arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.
But how do you control what's up here?
How do you fight an idea?
Especially a new idea.
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.
I assume he has a name.
- He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
- Then treat him like one!
Tell him I will join him.
Yes, tribune.
Centurion!
This was his country before it was ours.
Don't forget that.
Yes, tribune.
Very wise.
This Ben-Hur is the richest man in Jerusalem.
And the head of one of the greatest families in Judea.
We were friends as boys.
We were like brothers.
Sextus you ask how to fight an idea.
Well, I'll tell you how.
With another idea.
I said I'd come back.
I never thought you would.
I'm so glad.
[BOTH LAUGH]
- Look at you.
- Look at you!
You've come back a tribune.
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.
We'll drink another now.
- Your sister and mother?
- They're fine.
They've talked of you ever since we knew you were coming.
- Is Tirzah married?
- No.
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.
She's been in love with you since she was 5.
I can't wait to see them.
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?
Or have you become too dignified?
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
- Down Eros, up Mars!
- Down Eros, up Mars!
MESSALA:
Where the beams cross?
BEN-HUR:
Good.
[BOTH LAUGH]
After all these years!
Still close.
In every way.
I hope so.
I know.
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew whose life you once saved.
The best thing I ever did.
Judah it will be very difficult to govern here.
I'm going to need help.
Your help.
Your advice.
- You want my advice?
- Yes, I do.
Withdraw your legions.
Give us our freedom.
Unfortunately, the emperor is devoted to his empire.
He's particularly fond of Judea.
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.
Is there anything so sad as unrequited love?
[MESSALA CHUCKLES]
My quarters.
Hmm.
A bit grim.
Not grim.
Austere.
Virtuous.
Roman.
I'm going to be second-in-command to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.
He's arriving in a few days with two more legions.
Then the rumors are true.
The emperor does not approve of your countrymen.
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.
But you and your family need have no concern.
I'm next in authority to the governor, and you're my friend.
- I'm a Jew.
- Ah, you are like a Roman!
What have you in common with the troublemaking rabble?
Rabble?
They're my people.
I'm one of them.
Be wise, Judah.
It's a Roman world.
If you want to live in it, you must become part of it.
You've changed.
I've grown up.
I've seen the world since I left Jerusalem.
I've seen Rome.
It's no accident that one small village on the Tiber was chosen to rule the world.
Your legions.
It wasn't just our legions.
Other countries have armies, fine armies.
I know, I fought them.
Oh, no.
No, it was fate that chose us to civilize the world.
And we have.
Our roads and ships connect every corner of the earth.
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.
I believe in the future of my people.
Of course you do.
And you can help them.
How?
You're an aristocrat.
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince among your people.
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.
They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.
Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.
It is worse than stupid, futile!
For it can end in only one way, extinction for your people!
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.
Then we're agreed!
Now, when can I come to see your family?
- We had hoped tomorrow.
- Good.
And now for our toast.
It's dreadful wine, by the way.
It's especially fermented for the Roman army.
[MESSALA CHUCKLES]
You're very cruel to your conquerors.
It's an insane world.
But in it there is one sanity:
The loyalty of old friends.
Judah, we must believe in one another.
Will you drink to that?
With all my heart.
Here it is, the place I've remembered.
The court where we played at changing the guard.
The roof where we'd throw pebbles at people in the street and then hide.
- We were rascals, weren't we?
- No, you were good boys.
I would have that time again.
And here it is.
Nothing has changed.
Except for the fountain.
- The old well would go dry, remember?
- Promptly, every summer.
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.
- He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
- No?
Of course he has.
He was a boy when he left us, now he's a man.
With great responsibilities.
Come.
The emperor builds and builds, turning brick to marble.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.
I've never seen anything like this before.
It's beautiful!
- Is it Roman?
- It's Libyan.
I was there last year.
A tremendous campaign.
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.
Or was, till we destroyed it.
Now it's nothing but ashes.
I'm boring you with soldier stories.
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.
Thank you for this.
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.
BEN-HUR:
What do you think of it?
MESSALA:
Magnificent.
It's Arabic.
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.
Let me try him sometime.
Whenever you like.
He's yours.
Do you mean you'll give me this?
Oh, Judah.
You are good.
It's going to be like old times, I know it.
Judah, tell me, did you think about what I said?
Yes.
Talked to a number of people already.
Spoken against violence, against incidents.
Most of the men agree with me.
Most?
Not all?
- No, not all.
- Who does not agree?
Well, the resentful, the impatient.
Who are they?
Yes, Judah.
Who are they?
Would I retain your friendship if I became an informer?
Telling the names of criminals is not informing.
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.
Patriots?
!
Judah.
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.
This is my great opportunity, and yours too.
If I bring order here, I can have any post I want.
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?
Rome!
Yes, perhaps at the side of Caesar himself.
I mean it.
It can happen and this is the moment.
I swear, this is the time.
The emperor is watching us, judging us.
All I need do is serve him.
And all you need do is help me serve him.
- You speak as if he were God.
- He is God.
The only God.
He is power, real power on earth, not...
Not that.
Help me, Judah.
I would do anything for you, Messala except betray my own people.
In the name of all the gods, what do the lives of a few Jews mean to you?
If I cannot persuade them, that does not mean I would help you murder them.
Besides, you must understand this, Messala.
I believe in the past and future of my people.
Future?
You are a conquered people.
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?
Joshua will not rise again to save you nor David.
There is only one reality in the world today.
Look to the West.
Don't be a fool!
Look to Rome!
Better a fool than a traitor or a killer.
- l am a soldier.
- Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.
- l warn you...
- No!
I warn you.
Rome is an affront to God.
Rome is strangling my people and my country, the whole earth!
But not forever.
And I tell you, the day Rome falls there will be a shout of freedom such as the world has never heard before.
Judah.
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.
You're either for me or against me.
If that is the choice then I am against you.
There they are.
Where's Messala?
- Where's...?
- He's gone.
Gone?
- But why?
- He couldn't stay.
- What happened?
- A new tribune must have many duties.
Come.
Let us have dinner.
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the world who bringeth to us bread from the earth.
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.
He wanted to use me to betray our people.
Judah.
[MURMURING]
[CAMEL BAYING]
- Master, the caravan from Antioch.
- Yes, Amrah, I saw.
Simonides.
- Welcome.
- Judah.
- Oh, welcome homecoming.
- Master.
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.
And for the master, Iberian wine.
Not to mention the best gift of all, your presence.
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.
- Caravans from Petra.
- Have all arrived.
- Good.
- Here is the accounting.
And what of Numidia?
The trade route is ours, guaranteed by treaty with the king.
Once a year, you bring your accounting.
And once a year, I find myself wealthier.
Yeah, but my greatest treasure is my steward.
SIMONIDES:
My life belongs to the House of Hur.
Nothing else exists for me, except my daughter.
- She must be a young woman by now.
- Yes, and your property.
She was born the daughter of your slave.
When I inherited you, I inherited a friend, not a slave.
Still, Esther has come with me from Antioch for your permission to marry.
It's granted.
I wish you the joy of many grandchildren.
SIMONIDES:
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.
With your permission, Esther wishes to speak to her master.
You're eager to marry, Esther?
It is my father's wish.
Your husband will be fortunate.
What is his name?
David, son of Mathias.
BEN-HUR:
Of what house?
- His own, master.
- He is a freeman.
Tell me more about him.
I have seen him only once.
He is a merchant, well-thought-of in Antioch.
He will pay for Esther's freedom.
Her freedom will be my wedding gift to Esther.
You are generous, master.
Do you love this man?
I will learn to love him.
You have my permission to marry.
We'll drink to your happiness.
And a safe return to Antioch.
BEN-HUR:
I disturbed you.
No.
What were you thinking?
I was saying goodbye to this city and this house.
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?
My father sometimes brought me here when I was little.
It was a house where I was always happy.
Except once.
When you and your friend, the Roman boy...
- Messala.
- Yes.
You had been out hunting and they brought you home injured.
I touched your face as you lay there and prayed to God, "Don't let this boy die."
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.
Yes, master.
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.
It's strange.
I hardly felt a slave.
And now I hardly feel free.
You know, in the old, wise days of Solomon if there was among his slaves some girl who filled his eyes he could choose her out from the rest and take her to him.
Wise days of Solomon.
Different days.
And long ago.
If you were not a bride I should kiss you goodbye.
If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said.
Your slave ring.
Fair exchange.
Freedom to you.
The ring to me.
You will wear it?
Until you meet the woman you will marry?
Until then.
[DRUMMING]
[TRUMPETING]
The gods favor my lord Gratus.
If it is the governor's pleasure, the wreath of office.
Thank you, tribune.
I see no delegation from the city.
- There will not be one, sir.
- No?
Jerusalem's welcome will not be a warm one.
But I pledge, my lord, it will be a quiet one.
Let us proceed.

There's Messala.
He saw you, Judah.
The new governor.

Judah!
Tirzah!
What is it?
What's happened?
OFFICER 4:
Open up in the name of Rome!
- l was watching the Romans...
- A tile fell and struck the governor.
- It wasn't my fault.
- They won't believe her.
She won't have to say anything.
You hear?
Tirzah, say nothing.
MAN:
Open the gates!
I'll speak to them.
OFFICER 1:

-Wait.
Let me tell you what happened.
OFFICER 2:

BEN-HUR:

-Judah!
BEN-HUR:
It was an accident.
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.
- This is the man, sir.
We saw him.
- It was an accident.
- Accident?
- l swear it.
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose.
It gave way.
Take him.
Take all of them.
MIRIAM:
He's telling the truth!
-It was me!
Let them go!
MIRIAM:
Judah!
CENTURION:
Attention!
BEN-HUR:
Messala.
In the name of God, tell them it's a mistake.
I leaned on the tile, and it broke loose.
It was an accident.
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!
MIRIAM:
Messala!
TIRZAH:
Messala.
Let the servants go.
Let them go.
Return to your ranks.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
- Come.
- Where?
Tirus.
Tirus?
I've had no trial.
I'm to die in the galleys without even a trial?
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!
Wait.
My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?
Tie his hands.
- At least tell me if they're safe.

You can go.
Go!
The door.
Where are my mother and sister?
Where are they?
Here, within these walls.
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.
Of course, they will be sentenced.
Is it possible, Messala?
Is it possible you could do this to us?
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?
You'll let them go.
You must.
You will gladly let them go!
Messala!
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not mad.
I'm not a murderer!
I know you're not.
You know?
You are evil.
No, Judah, I am not evil.
I wanted your help.
Now you've given it to me.
By making this example of you, I discourage treason.
By condemning without hesitation an old friend, I shall be feared.
But not my family.
Let them go.
Please.
- Messala, I beg you.
- Beg?
!
Didn't I beg you?
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.
Kill me, and your mother and sister will die today nailed to crosses in front of you!
Go on, Judah.
Kill me!
[GRUNTS]
May God grant me vengeance.
I will pray that you live till I return.
Return?
Take him.
OFFICER:
Sentries, salute.
The tribune will see you now.
Tribune, I'm steward of the House of Hur.
I remember you.
We were on our way to Antioch when we heard what had happened.
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done this thing.
You knew him, tribune.
Better than you.
Then there must be no doubt in your mind, the charge is groundless.
The prisoners have been sentenced.
- Sentenced?
- But there's no truth in it.
There was never a threat against the governor in Judah's mind.
Surely you must know he would never have done this.
In your heart, you must know it.
Drusus.
This man had better be kept here until we have time to question him.

In a few minutes, the consul's barge will be coming alongside.
Be ready to raise oars.
HORTATOR:
Raise oars!
Down oars!
[TRUMPETING]
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.
- How many rowers?
- Two hundred, consul.
- And reliefs?
- Of 30, every hour.
[MAN COUGHING]
This man is ill.
Replace him.
- Change him.
- Right, sir.
- This man has been giving you trouble?
- He's insubordinate, consul.
That will stop.
What service have you seen?
Forty-one.
A month's less a day in this ship.
You keep an exact account.
And before?
Three years in other ships.
Three years.
[BEN-HUR YELLS]
You have the spirit to fight back but the good sense to control it.
Your eyes are full of hate, 41.
That's good.
Hate keeps a man alive.
It gives him strength.
Now, listen to me, all of you.
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
So row well and live.
- Ship ready, consul.
- Strike oars.
HORTATOR:
Strike oars!
You know that a fleet of Macedonian galleys has been raiding Roman commerce.
The emperor has honored us with the task of seeking out and destroying them.

[HORTATOR DRUMMING NEARBY]
Why are you here?
I was ordered to report to you during my relief.
Oh, yes.
I'd forgotten.
You could have killed me as I lay there.
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?
I'm not ready to die.
What do you think will save you?
The God of my fathers.
Hmm.
Your God has forsaken you.
He has no more power than the images I pray to.
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.
I might.
Does that interest you, 41?
I can see that it does.
I'm a fighting man by profession, and in my leisure moments it amuses me to train fighting men.
I own some of the best gladiators and charioteers in Rome.
Would you like to become one of them?
To die as your slave?
Better than to live in chains below these decks.
I will not be here forever.
No?
What would you do if you escaped?
Two people were condemned with me, my mother and sister though they were innocent.
I won't rest...
Do not say that you were innocent.
- Would it do any good to say it again?
- No.
Consider my offer carefully.
You will never escape while we are victorious.
If we are not, you will sink with this ship, chained to your oar.
I cannot believe that God has let me live these three years to die chained to an oar.
It's a strange, stubborn faith you keep to believe that existence has a purpose.
A sane man would have learned to lose it long before this.
As you have.
What drove it out of you?
Go back to your oar, 41.
Consul, enemy sighted.
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.
OFFICER:

We had given up all hope for you.

You have cleared the seaways of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.
This baton of victory has been nobly won.
[CROWD CHEERS]
This man riding beside you, who is he?
The man who saved me, divine emperor, to return and serve you.
Is that all you know about him?
No.
He was accused of an attack on the governor of Judea.
But he was innocent.
If not, there's a strange inconsistency in this man who tries to kill my governor, yet saves the life of my consul.
Come tomorrow.
We'll talk of it.
[CROWD CHEERS]
[BAND PLAYING TRIUMPHANT MUSIC]
We have all the information on this man a man of some influence in his own country.
His attack upon our governor is one upon the senate and the people of Rome.
I am convinced that no such attack was intended.
Consul, allow us to continue.
Allow us to be generous.
As a reward to you for your great victory we shall not send him back to the galleys.
We give him to you as your slave to do with him as you like.
Such is the will of the senate and the people of Rome.
[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]
[WOMEN YELLING]
[BAND PLAYING SOFT MUSIC]
Not long ago, I returned to Rome with a young man who had saved my life.
You all know him as the finest charioteer in Rome.
Five times, he's driven my horses to victory.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I know him as one who stands in the place of the son I lost.
I have the love and pride in a son's achievements which I thought I should never have again.
[MURMURING]
Nothing could make stronger the bond between us but tonight I wish to share it with you all.
The formalities of adoption have been completed.
Young Arrius is now the legal bearer of my name and the heir to my property.
[CROWD MURMURS]
This ring of my ancestors would have gone to my son.
So now it is yours.
It's a strange destiny that brought me to a new life a new home a new father.
It brought me here.
It may take me away.
But wherever I may be I shall always try to wear this ring as a son of Arrius should.
With gratitude and affection and with honor.
[CROWD CHEERING]
[SOFT MUSIC RESUMES]
I present my son to you.
My old friend Pontius Pilate, young Arrius.
Before you came to this city, my horses always won.
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.
Yes, but not swift enough to defeat you.
- Tell me, you come from Judea?
- Yes, sir.
I hear that the climate is difficult to live in.
Not for Judeans.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.
- Of Judea?
- Yes.
I asked for Alexandria.
But it seems the wilderness needs my particular talents.
The scorpions and holy prophets can't get on without me.
Lay the dust of Judea, at least for this evening.
Goats and Jehovah.
[ARRIUS CHUCKLES]
You're leaving.
I must.
It's a journey I can't keep you from.
Your eyes have never left it all these months.
I can recognize pain.
But still, my counsel is to wait.
Gratus is to be replaced.
The governorship goes to Pontius Pilate.
When?
Very soon.
It's very much to our purpose.
Nothing is to the purpose if, when I come back to Judea, I come too late.
That is the thought which has punished me every moment I've spent here.
Will Rome see you again?
Here is a part of my life which you have made for me.
I shall remember it.
Whoever the gods are, they take small interest in an old man's hopes.
They have their way.
Forgive me.
You're a stranger here.
Would you be from Nazareth?
Why do you ask?
I thought you might be the one....
The one that I have come back from my country to find.
He would be about your age.
Who?
When I find him I shall know him.
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.
SHEIK:
Hyah!
Hyah!
Sack of flesh without brains!
No!
No!
Not the whip!
That is my host.
SHEIK:
Gently!
Gently!
Fool!
Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood!
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run!
Go on!
SHEIK:
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!
Beautiful horses.
Now!
Now!
They are ready!
Let them go!
Watch.
They'll never hold the turn.
SHEIK:
No!
No!
Abadon, stop him!
Stop that whip!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill...!
SHEIK:
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!
You think you can treat my horses like animals?
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!
Get off, idiot!
SHEIK:
Drive goats, not horses!
Now I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.
Hmm?
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.
Not a team?
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.
- Antares.
- The slow one?
SHEIK:
Uh-huh.
I think he should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?
In the circus in Rome.
You have driven in the great circus?
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.
No other animal has descended so in scale from the first innocent falling of the world.
[SHEIK CHUCKLES]
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.
Yes.
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.
Your coming here was so fit, so right.
We might have achieved wonders.
You have to go.
I make a journey which will not wait.
Well, then perhaps you will come back.
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.
I have no wives.
No wives at all?
I have six, no, seven.
BALTHASAR:
Ha, ha.
I've counted eight.
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.
- Someday, I hope to have one.
- One wife!
Ha, ha, one God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.
It is not generous.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
[BURPS]
- Was the food not to your liking?
- Indeed.
[BURPS]
Thank you.
Thank you.
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.
And now I must say good night to my beauties.
When they're ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.
- I'll make my farewells then.
- No, no, no, stay.
Stay and see them.
Come, my children.
Come.
Strangers make them shy.
Come.
Come, do not be afraid.
Come.
There, my children.
They are descended from the Arabians of the first Pharaohs and I have named them for the stars.
Come, Antares.
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.
[ANTARES WHINNIES]
What?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.
Come, Rigel.
We've both supped well, and the world is good.
[CHUCKLES]
There's my good Rigel.
Ah.
Yes, you are ready for sleep.
The day's work done for you, eh?
Ah.
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.
Good night.
Good night, my treasure.
Ah!
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.
No.
You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.
[CHUCKLES]
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.
You should see their mother, Mira.
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.
All right, all right.
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.
You must be strong and swift.
Go, my children.
Go.
When they reach Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams not to mention the champion of the East, Messala, with his black devils.
He stops at nothing to win.
- Messala?
In the circus?
- Yes.
You knew him?
I know him.
Perhaps without much liking.
Judah Ben-Hur, my people are praying for a man to drive their team to victory over Messala.
You could be that man, the one to stamp his arrogance into the sand.
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.
It's not possible.
That is a pity.
Think of it.
To break his pride to humble this tribune before the very people he has degraded.
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!
I know it is not possible.
Does it not delight your imagination?
Does it not answer your purpose?
I must deal with Messala in my own way.
And your way is to kill him.
I see this terrible thing in your eyes, Judah Ben-Hur.
But no matter what this man has done, you have no right to take his life.
He will be punished inevitably.
I don't believe in miracles.
But all life is a miracle.
Why will you not accept God's judgment?
You do not believe in miracles.
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness and a star led me to a village called Bethlehem where I found a newborn child in a manger.
And God lived in this child.
By now, he is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.
That is why I have returned here so that I may be at hand when he comes among us.
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.
Perhaps he's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.
Perhaps he is a shepherd a merchant, a fisherman.
But he lives and all our lives from now on will carry his mark.
There are many paths to God, my son.
I hope yours will not be too difficult.
I'm ready for sleep.
Balthasar is a good man but until all men are like him, we must keep our swords bright.
And our intention true.
So I must leave you.
One last thought.
There is no law in the arena.
Many are killed.
I hope to see you again.
MERCHANT:
Fine Damascus silk.
Fine Damascus silk.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Esther?
[ESTHER GASPS]
It's Judah.
[GASPS]
Judah.
- You are alive.
- Esther.
You are alive.
What are you doing here?
What has happened?
[ESTHER SOBBING]
Shh.
I'm here.
I'm with you.
Esther.
Where's your father?
Hmm?
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.
They tortured him.
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.
You never went back to Antioch?
No.
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.
Esther.
Esther.
Where are my mother and sister?
SIMONIDES:
Esther.
Let me tell him first.
Father.
Father, something wonderful has happened.
- Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
- Judah.
He has come home.
He is here.
Judah.
Judah Ben-Hur.
My dear old friend.
Let me look at you.
Let me see you.
Yes, yes.
It is true.
Praise God for his mercy.
Where are they?
Since that terrible day there has been no word of them.
You should have been less loyal.
Do not pity me, Master Judah.
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.
We were released on the same day.
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.
Since then, I have been his tongue and he has been my legs.
Together, we make a considerable man.
Old friend.
She always said you would return.
She never gave up hope.
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.
I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.
But suppose that isn't possible.
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.
They could not make me tell them where it is.
It is there still to put power into our hands and buy death for the Romans.
That's not why I came back.
Judah, they are dead.
Four years.
No one could live so long in the dungeons.
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?
SIMONIDES:
Yes, it is true.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You have come back to us like a returning faith.
Judah, I should like to laugh again.
- Let us laugh.
- We will.
There will be joy again in this house.
We will celebrate among the dust.
[SOBBING]
I will take him.
We stood here before.
A long while ago.
Four years.
But now it seems as if only yesterday....
I was saying:
"If you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye."
"If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said."
I am not a bride.
Why did you never marry?
My father needed me.
And also....
It's still on my finger.
I said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.
It's become a part of my hand.
If Messala once knew you were here....
As he must.
He will know where they are.
And if you should find...?
- If he should tell you they're dead...
- Then Messala will wish they were living.
I've seen too much of what hate can do.
My father is burned up with it.
But I've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater and love more powerful than hatred.
I believe it.
- Esther.
- Judah.
Stay alive.
Keep away from Messala.
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.
That time isn't yet come.
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.
This time you will be destroyed.
You'll die.
Tribune, compliments of Quintus Arrius.
He awaits your pleasure.
- Consul here?
- Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.
Thank him.
Bring him to me.
- l didn't know the consul had a son.
- He's a champion of the great circus.
Why is he here presenting me with gifts?
- Perhaps he'll race against you.
- Look.
It's magnificent.
And from a man I've never met.
You're wrong, Messala.
Judah.
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?
You were the magician, Messala.
You condemned me to the galleys.
When my ship was sunk, I saved the consul's life.
You know his seal?
Now I have come back as I swore I would.
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.
You suggest I use it on myself?
What has become of my mother and my sister?
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.
Find them, Messala.
Restore them to me, and I'll forget what I vowed with every stroke of that oar you chained me to.
I am not the governor of Judea.
I can do nothing without approval.
Then get it.
I will come back tomorrow.
Don't disappoint me, Messala.
What became of them?
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?
Go to the citadel, Drusus.
Find out.
- And if they're dead?
- They're dead!
"Miriam, wife.
Tirzah, daughter."
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?
East section lower level.
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.
PRISONER 1:
Water.
Water.
PRISONER 2:
Let me out!
PRISONER 3:
Hear us!
Hear us!
[POUNDING]
- How long since you've seen them?
- Never.
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.
The food disappears.
Lepers.
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.
Then we'll burn out the cell.
[COUGHING]
ESTHER:
Is someone there?
[RUSTLING]
There is someone there.
Who are you?
MIRIAM:
Don't come any closer.
Who are you?
Esther.
It's Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam?
MIRIAM:
Stay where you are.
You have come home.
MIRIAM:
Stand back, Esther.
We are lepers.
[GASPS]
Oh, Esther.
Tirzah.
Esther is Judah living?
Yes, he is alive.
He is here.
Where?
He is searching for you now.
I must find him and tell him.
MIRIAM:
No!
-Tell my father.
MIRIAM:
No.
Tell no one.
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.
We won't return.
But Judah has to be told.
MIRIAM:
No.
Please.
I couldn't see his face.
Is it changed?
No, he is not changed.
He....
He's not changed.
You love him, Esther.
Promise me on your love for him you will never tell him you've seen us.
Is he never to know?
Let him remember us as we were.
Promise me.
There's nothing else I can hope for.
Only this.
I promise you.
I am content.
Wait.
[CRIES]
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.
I pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.
He'll free them.
He wants to survive.
He cannot free them, Judah.
What do you mean?
- l saw them.
- You saw them?
Where?
When did you see them?
They were dead.
They were dead.
When?
When?
When?
In the prison.
When I was waiting for news of my father.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't tell you.
Nor even you, Father.
I was afraid that if you saw Messala....
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.
It's over now.
Over?
- Judah.
- Over?
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.
[SOBBING]
SHEIK:
Gentlemen.
Officers.
Defenders of great Rome's imperium may I enter?
Certainly, sheik.
You do us an unexpected honor.
The noble tribune is most gracious.
And now, the question you're all asking yourselves:
Why am I here?
As you know, I am a gambling man.
The games approach.
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.
But I will back my own poor horses.
No limits?
MARIUS:
Mark me first!
-And me!
MATELLUS:
What odds?
-A moment, please my lords, protectors of the far flung marshes.
May I first, uh, sit down?
MARIUS:
Sit down.
Lie down.
How much will you wager?
-Yes, let's call his game.
SPINTHO:
Give the Arab a seat.
A bench, quickly.
Thank you.
- Now.
- One thousand denarii.
- Two thousand!
- Mark me!
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient.
There is time and money enough for all.
First, gentlemen, the odds.
The tribune has won many times.
The odds should be in the same measure.
Now, what is your pleasure, gentlemen?
MARIUS:
Two to one.
[SHEIK CHUCKLES]
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth where is the courage that made Rome master of the world?
I can get better odds on any street market.
MARIUS:
Three to one.
Let us not haggle.
Let us be fair.
In four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.
- In all truth...
- Just a moment.
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?
Oh.
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.
The Prince of Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur.
Prince of Hur?
[CHUCKLES]
- He was sent to the galleys years ago.
- He has returned.
Returned?
Impossible.
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.
Well?
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.
You, tribune will you give me four to one?
Four to one.
- Good.
- Bravo, Messala.
Four to one, sheik.
The difference between a Roman and a Jew.
Or an Arab.
[ROMANS LAUGH]
[CHUCKLES]
Bravely spoken.
Now we will settle the amount of our wager.
I will venture....
A thousand talents?
- A thousand talents?
- Yes, a thousand talents.
Of course, if it is too much....
A thousand talents it will be.
Agreed.
[MURMURING]
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.
You're good fellows.
If only men were this good.
Hey!
Remember, Altair nine times around the circus, huh?
Aldebaran.
Hey, ha, ha.
Rigel, did you hear?
Nine lives to live.
My swift fellow.
You must not win the race the first time around.
You win the last time around.
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.
Steady Antares.
Like a rock.
You will be our anchor.
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.
They have taken me into their family.
Rest well, my stars.
Tomorrow we go up to the city.
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it the news will scorch the streets of the whole Roman world.
Pontius Pilate here?
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.
You will make him see what men are born in this land.
I only know that I race against Messala.
ATTENDANT:
Look for the yoke.
Ease that strap.
BEN-HUR:
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.
Into your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as you will.
The Star of David.
To shine out for your people and my people together and blind the eyes of Rome.
[TRUMPETS PLAYING]
They are ready.
ATTENDANT:
Ready, off!
MAN:
Easy, girl, easy.
STARTER:
Number five.
Where is number five?
Whoa.
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.
Yes, this is the day.
SHEIK:
Judah!
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.
[TRUMPETS PLAYING]
Hail, Jupiter.
Give me victory.
[BRASS BAND PLAYING]
[CROWD CHEERING]
ATTENDANT:
Watch your line!
Keep your places!
MAN:
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.
Citizens I welcome you to these games in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.
We dedicate them to his glory and to the glory of Rome of which you are all part.
Let us honor those who race for us today.
They come here from Alexandria Messina Carthage Cyprus Rome Corinth Athens Phrygia and Judea.
[CROWD ROARS]
To the best of these, a crown of victory.
The race begins.
Hail, Caesar!
CROWD:
Hail, Caesar!
Oh, you dog!
Come, my children, come!
The Roman pig!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Steady!
Now, now!
[BAND PLAYING TRIUMPHANT MUSIC]
OFFICER:
Salute.
A great victory.
You are the people's one true god for the time being.
Permit us to worship.
I crown their god.
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.
A long life, young Arrius, and the good sense to live it.
[HEAVY BREATHING]
We cannot wait, tribune.
MESSALA:
He will come.
He will...
[COUGHS AND GASPS]
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.
He will come!
He will come.
I've sent for him, and he will come.
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.
Do you understand?
To hack the legs off me?
Not yet.
Not till I've seen him.
I don't receive him with half a body.
No.
No!
[MESSALA GRUNTING]
I told you, Drusus.
I told you.
Here he is.
Triumph c...
Triumph complete, Judah.
The race won.
The enemy destroyed.
I see no enemy.
What do you think you see?
The smashed body of a wretched animal?
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.
Let me help you.
[GROANS]
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.
Dead.
And the race over.
It isn't over, Judah.
They're not dead.
Where are they?
Where are they?
Where are they?
Look for them in the Valley of the Lepers if you can recognize them.
[BEN-HUR YELLS]
It goes on.
It goes on, Judah.
The race....
The race is not over.
Is there a way down here?
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.
Man.
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.
MAN:
There...
There are many women.
Of the family of Hur.
We have no names here.
For them?
- Why did you tell me they were dead?
- It was what they wanted.
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?
Not to see them?
They are coming.
Love them in the way they must need to be loved.
Not to look at them.
Let them be as if you had never come here.
Please!
Judah!
Is Judah well?
Is he happy?
ESTHER:
Yes, he is well.
Your mind can be at rest for him.
He is well, Miriam.
MIRIAM:
God be with you.
They have gone.
We can go back.
Go back to what?
Judah, they have one blessing left.
To think you remember them as they were and live your own life.
Forget what is here.
Forget?
It's as though they were alive in a grave.
- But what can you do?
- Undo what you've done.
How could you have suffered them to come here?
I must see them.
No, Judah, please!
Judah!
Think, Judah, think.
It would tear them apart if they see you.
Judah!
Judah.
He is here.
I have found him.
The child has become a man.
And the man, I know it now, is the son of God.
The promise is true.
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.
Life has been answered.
God has answered it.
Come.
Come with me.
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys thirst had nearly killed me.
A man gave me water to drink.
I went on living.
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.
No.
I am thirsty still.
Come and listen.
I have business with Rome.
You insist on death.
Goodbye, Judah.
You sent for me?
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.
- l honor him.
- As you may honor yourself.
You have been made a citizen of Rome.
Do you say nothing to this?
I have just come from the Valley of Stone where my mother and sister live what's left of their lives.
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.
I have heard this.
There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.
Where there is greatness, great government or power even great feeling or compassion error also is great.
We progress and mature by fault.
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.
There are other voices.
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place not to crucify yourself on a shadow such as old resentment or impossible loyalties.
Perfect freedom has no existence.
A grown man knows the world he lives in.
And for the present, the world is Rome.
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.
I am Judah Ben-Hur.
I cross this floor in spoken friendship as I would speak to Arrius.
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar ready to crush all those who challenge his authority.
There are too many small men of envy and ambition who try to disrupt the government of Rome.
You have become the victor and hero to those people.
They look to you, their one true god, as I called you.
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.
I am already part of this tragedy.
Return this to Arrius.
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you from personal disaster if you stay here.
You are too great a danger.
Leave Judea.
You have my word.
Judah!
Oh, Judah!
I was afraid you would never come back afraid of what would happen to you.
But I see you again.
Your father's waiting for me.
Where is he?
What do you mean to do?
Oh, Judah.
Rest, sleep.
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.
Peace?
Love and peace.
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?
Where do you see them?
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.
Balthasar's word.
He is more than Balthasar's word.
His voice traveled with such a still purpose.
It was more than a voice.
A man more than a man.
He said, "Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God."
Children of God?
In that dead valley where we left them?
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean until we have scoured off our bodies the crust and filth of being at the mercy of tyranny.
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.
- In blood?
- Yes, in blood!
I know there is a law in life.
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.
Death generates death as the vulture breeds the vulture.
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:
"Love your enemy.
Do good to those who despitefully use you."
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.
As you make us do now.
Are we to bear nothing together?
Even love?
I can hardly draw breath without feeling you in my heart.
But I know that everything I do from this moment will be as great a pain to you as you have ever suffered.
It is better not to love me.
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy giving evil for evil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.
It's as though you had become Messala.
I've lost you, Judah.
MIRIAM:
No further.
What are you doing here?
I was here last evening waiting for you.
I have waited all night.
What has happened?
Where is Tirzah?
Leave the food.
I am coming closer.
Don't be afraid.
- What are you doing?
- Don't be afraid.
I've heard him again, the man from Nazareth.
If ever words were from God, they are in everything he says.
I cannot bear that you should have never known this hand of quiet reaching towards us.
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find him there.
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find him.
[MIRIAM WHIMPERS]
Tirzah is dying.
Leave the food and go.
It's Judah.
Why did you tell him?
Yes, Judah, yes.
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.
Mother.
Wait, Mother, wait.
Let me talk with you.
MIRIAM:
Please.
No, no further.
Please.
No, Judah.
Son, no.
Mother, let me see Tirzah.
Tirzah is dying.
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know that life is everlasting and death is nothing to fear if you have faith.
I will take them to him.
[MIRIAM SHRIEKS]
No!
God, no!
[MIRIAM SOBBING]
No, no, dear son.
Mother where is Tirzah?
Judah, no.
Judah, no.
You must not go to her, dear son.
Please.
Dear son.
I am afraid.
ESTHER:
No cause.
The world is more than we know.
[TIRZAH WHIMPERING]
Tirzah, it's Judah.
No.
No, Judah.
No, Judah.
No.
[TIRZAH SOBBING]
BEGGAR:
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
BEN-HUR:
Why are the streets deserted?
-They have gone to the trial.
- Alms for the blind?
- Trial?
Whose trial?
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.
- This cannot be true.
- Alms?
What has he done?
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.
Help for the blind.
WOMAN:
Look, lepers!
GIRL:
Lepers!
MAN 1:
Go away!
MAN 2:
Get away!
Stay away!
Go away!
[MURMURING]
Lepers!
Lepers!
How can this be?
I know this man.
Will someone help him?
TIRZAH:
Take pity on him.
WOMAN:
Have mercy.
Have mercy.
MIRIAM:
In his pain this look of peace.
Watch over them, Esther.
We must go back.
I brought you here to this when I hoped....
You haven't failed, Esther.
MAN:
Hail King of the Jews!
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.
He gave me water and a heart to live.
What has he done to merit this?
He has taken the world of our sins onto himself.
To this end he said he was born in that stable where I first saw him.
For this cause, he came into the world.
For this death?
This beginning.
I have lived too long.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
As though he were carrying in that cross the pain of the world.
So fearful, and yet why is it I'm not afraid anymore?
[THUNDER RUMBLES]
The shadow of a storm.
A strange darkness but still day.
[RUMBLING INTENSIFIES]
His life is over.
[WIND HOWLING]
[THUNDER CRASHING]
TIRZAH:
What is it?
This tearing.
I am in pain.
I feel it too.
Miriam.
I thought I....
Miriam.
Do you see your hand?
Tirzah.
Miriam.
Tirzah.
Almost at the moment he died I heard him say, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do."
- Even then.
- Even then.
And I felt his voice take the sword out of my hand.
[courtesy vijayvvb]
...Judea, for nearly a century, had lain under the mastery of Rome.
In the seventh year of the reign of Augustus Caesar an imperial decree ordered every Judean each to return to his place of birth to be counted and taxed.
Converging ways of many of them led to their capital city, Jerusalem the troubled heart of their land.
The old city was dominated by the fortress of Antonia the seat of Roman power and by the great golden temple the outward sign of an inward and imperishable faith.
Even while they obeyed the will of Caesar the people clung proudly to their ancient heritage always remembering the promise of their prophets that one day there would be born among them a redeemer to bring them salvation and perfect freedom.
You'll be counted at Hebron.
-Name?
-Samuel.
-What city?
-Joppa.
-What family?
-Michael.
-Move on.
Move on.
-Yes.
-Name?
-Joseph.
-What city?
-Nazareth.
-What family?
-David of Bethlehem.
And the woman?
My wife.
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.
Come on, come on.
What village is this?
Nazareth.
We should arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow night.
You're not watching the soldiers, Joseph?
We've seen Romans before.
Yes...
... andwewillsee themagain.
My table is not finished.
Where is your son?
He's walking in the hills.
He neglects his work, Joseph.
No.
Once, I reproached him with forgetting his work.
He said to me:
"I must be about my father's business. "
Then why isn't he here, working?
He's working.
Trumpeters of the legion!
Welcome, Messala.
The command is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for relieving me.
Drusus...
... whenI wasaboy ,Idreamed of commanding this garrison.
Now the wheel has turned.
I am in command.
Attention!
Aisle one, face right!
Forward!
I'd forgotten the heat.
If it were only the heat.
I lived here until I was 1 4.
Jerusalem was my home.
-My father was head of--
-Yes, I know.
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.
If there can be such a thing in this forsaken land.
If you want to rise, Sextus, do the difficult.
I asked to be sent here.
You'll find the people changed since you were a boy.
In what way?
Oh, won't pay their taxes, an irrational resentment of Rome... .
There's nothing new in all that.
And then there's religion.
I tell you, they're drunk with religion.
They smash the statues of our gods, even those of the emperor.
Punish them.
We do.
When we can find them.
Find the leaders.
You don't know.
There's nothing you can put your finger on.
There are strange forces at work here.
This "messiah" business--
I know.
There was one predicted when I was a boy.
A king of the Jews, who will lead them into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.
Makes your head spin.
There's a wild man in the desert named John...
... whodrownspeopleinwater.
And a carpenter's son who does magic tricks. "Miracles" they call them.
There's always a rabble-rouser stirring up trouble.
No, no, no.
This man is different.
He teaches that God is near, in every man.
It's actually quite profound, some of it.
You've been too long away from Rome.
Go back, Sextus.
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea...
... andforgetthat God is in every man.
-There is divinity in only one man.
-Yes, I know.
The emperor is displeased.
He wishes Judea made into a more obedient and disciplined province.
He's ordered me to restore order.
I shall carry out his wishes.
How?
You can break a man's skull, arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.
But how do you control this?
How do you fight an idea?
Especially a new idea.
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.
I assume he has a name.
-He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
-Then treat him like one!
Tell him I will join him.
Yes, tribune.
Centurion!
This was his country before it was ours.
Don't forget that.
Yes, tribune.
Very wise.
This Ben-Hur is the richest man in Jerusalem.
And the head of one of the greatest families in Judea.
We were friends as boys.
We were like brothers.
Sextus...
... youaskhowtofightanidea.
Well, I'll tell you how.
With another idea.
I said I'd come back.
I never thought you would.
I'm so glad.
-Look at you.
-Look at you!
You've come back a tribune.
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.
We'll drink another now.
-Your sister and mother?
-They're fine.
They've talked of you ever since we knew you were coming.
-Is Tirzah married?
-No.
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.
She's been in love with you since she was 5.
I can't wait to see them.
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?
Or have you become too dignified?
-Down Eros, up Mars!
-Down Eros, up Mars!
Where the beams cross?
Good.
After all these years!
Still close.
In every way.
I hope so.
I know.
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew...
... whoselifeyouoncesaved.
The best thing I ever did.
Judah...
... itwillbe verydifficult to govern here.
I'm going to need help.
Your help.
Your advice.
-You want my advice?
-Yes, I do.
Withdraw your legions.
Give us our freedom.
Unfortunately, the emperor is devoted to his empire.
He's particularly fond of Judea.
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.
Is there anything so sad as unrequited love?
My quarters.
A bit grim.
Not grim.
Austere.
Virtuous.
Roman.
I'm going to be second-in-command to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.
He's coming in a few days with more legions.
Then the rumors are true.
The emperor does not approve of your countrymen.
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.
But you and your family need have no concern.
I'm next in authority to the governor, and you're my friend.
-I'm a Jew.
-Ah, you are like a Roman!
What have you in common with the troublemaking rabble?
-They're my people.
I'm one of them.
-Be wise, Judah.
It's a Roman world.
If you want to live in it, you must become part of it.
You've changed.
I've grown up.
I've seen the world since I left Jerusalem.
I've seen Rome.
It's no accident that one small village on the Tiber...
... waschosento rulethe world.
Your legions.
It wasn't just our legions.
Other countries have armies, fine armies.
I know, I fought them.
Oh, no.
No, it was fate that chose us to civilize the world.
And we have.
Our roads and ships connect every corner of the earth.
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.
I believe in the future of my people.
Of course you do.
And you can help them.
How?
You're an aristocrat.
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince to your people.
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.
They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.
Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.
It is worse than stupid, futile!
For it can end in only one way, extinction for your people!
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.
Then we're agreed!
Now, when can I come to see your family?
-We had hoped tomorrow.
-Good.
And now for our toast.
It's dreadful wine, by the way.
It's especially fermented for the Roman army.
You're very cruel to your conquerors.
It's an insane world.
But in it there is one sanity:
The loyalty of old friends.
Judah, we must believe in one another.
Will you drink to that?
With all my heart.
Here it is, the place I've remembered.
The court where we played at changing the guard.
The roof where we'd throw pebbles at people in the street and then hide.
-We were rascals, weren't we?
-No, you were good boys.
I would have that time again.
And here it is.
Nothing has changed.
Except for the fountain.
-The old well would go dry, remember?
-Promptly, every summer.
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.
-He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
-No?
Of course he has.
He was a boy when he left us, now he's a man.
With great responsibilities.
Come.
The emperor builds and builds, turning brick to marble.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.
I've never seen anything like this before.
It's beautiful!
-Is it Roman?
-It's Libyan.
I was there last year.
A tremendous campaign.
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.
Or was, till we destroyed it.
Now it's nothing but ashes.
I'm boring you with soldier stories.
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.
Thank you for this.
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.
What do you think of it?
Magnificent.
It's Arabic.
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.
Let me try him sometime.
Whenever you like.
He's yours.
Do you mean you'll give me this?
Oh, Judah.
You are good.
It's going to be like old times, I know it.
Judah, tell me, did you...
... thinkaboutwhatIsaid ?
Yes.
Talked to a number of people already.
Spoken against violence, against incidents.
Most of the men agree with me.
Most?
Not all?
No, not all.
Who does not agree?
Well, the resentful, the impatient.
Who are they?
Yes, Judah.
Who are they?
Would I retain your friendship if I became an informer?
Telling the names of criminals is not informing.
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.
Patriots?
!
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.
This is my great opportunity, and yours too.
If I bring order here, I can have any post I want.
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?
Rome!
Yes, perhaps at the side of Caesar himself.
I mean it.
It can happen and this is the moment.
I swear, this is the time.
The emperor is watching us, judging us.
All I need do is serve him.
And all you need do is help me serve him.
-You speak as if he were God.
-He is God.
The only God.
He is power, real power on earth, not--
Not that.
Help me, Judah.
I would do anything for you, Messala...
... exceptbetraymy ownpeople.
In the name of all the gods, what do the lives of a few Jews mean to you?
If I cannot persuade them, that does not mean I would help you murder them.
Besides, you must understand this, Messala.
I believe in the past and future of my people.
Future?
You are a conquered people.
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?
Joshua will not rise again to save you nor David.
There is only one reality in the world today.
Look to the West.
Don't be a fool!
Look to Rome!
Better a fool than a traitor or a killer.
-I am a soldier.
-Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.
-I warn you--
-No!
I warn you.
Rome is an affront to God.
Rome is strangling my people and my country, the whole earth!
But not forever.
And I tell you, the day Rome falls there will be a shout of freedom...
... suchastheworld has never heard before.
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.
You're either for me or against me.
If that is the choice...
... thenI amagainstyou .
There they are.
Where's Messala?
-Where's--?
-He's gone.
Gone?
-But why?
-He couldn't stay.
-What happened?
-A new tribune must have many duties.
Come.
Let us have dinner.
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the world...
... whobringethto us bread from the earth.
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.
He wanted to use me to betray our people.
-Master, the caravan from Antioch.
-Yes, Amrah, I saw.
Simonides.
-Oh, welcome homecoming.
-Master.
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.
And for the master, lberian wine.
Not to mention the best gift of all, your presence.
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.
-Caravans from Petra.
-Have all arrived.
-Good.
-Here is the accounting.
And what of Numidia?
The trade route is ours, guaranteed by treaty with the king.
Once a year, you bring your accounting.
And once a year, I find myself wealthier.
Yeah, but my greatest treasure is my steward.
My life belongs to the House of Hur.
Nothing else exists for me, except my daughter.
-She must be a young woman by now.
-Yes, and your property.
She was born the daughter of your slave.
When I inherited you, I inherited a friend, not a slave.
Still, Esther has come with me from Antioch for your permission to marry.
It's granted.
I wish you the joy of many grandchildren.
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.
With your permission, Esther wishes to speak to her master.
You're eager to marry, Esther?
It is my father's wish.
Your husband will be fortunate.
What is his name?
David, son of Mathias.
Of what house?
-His own, master.
-He is a freeman.
Tell me more about him.
I have seen him only once.
He is a merchant, well-thought-of in Antioch.
He will pay for Esther's freedom.
Her freedom will be my wedding gift to Esther.
You are generous, master.
Do you love this man?
I will learn to love him.
You have my permission to marry.
We'll drink to your happiness.
And a safe return to Antioch.
I disturbed you.
No.
What were you thinking?
I was saying goodbye...
... tothiscity...
... andthishouse.
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?
My father sometimes brought me here...
... whenI waslittle.
It was a house where I was always happy.
Except once.
When you and your friend, the Roman boy--
-Messala.
-Yes.
You had been out hunting...
... andtheybroughtyou homeinjured.
I touched your face as you lay there...
... andprayedto God, "Don't let this boy die. "
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.
Yes, master.
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.
It's strange.
I hardly felt a slave.
And now...
... Ihardlyfeelfree.
You know, in the old, wise days of Solomon...
... iftherewasamonghisslaves...
... somegirlwhofilledhiseyes...
... hecouldchooseher out from the rest...
... andtakehertohim.
Wise days of Solomon.
Different days.
And long ago.
If you were not a bride...
... Ishouldkissyou goodbye.
If I were not a bride...
... therewouldbe no goodbyes to be said.
Your slave ring.
Fair exchange.
Freedom to you.
The ring to me.
You will wear it?
Until you meet the woman you will marry?
Until then.
The gods favor my lord Gratus.
If it is the governor's pleasure, the wreath of office.
Thank you, tribune.
I see no delegation from the city.
-There will not be one, sir.
-No?
Jerusalem's welcome will not be a warm one.
But I pledge, my lord, it will be a quiet one.
Let us proceed.
There's Messala.
He saw you, Judah.
The new governor.
Stand back!
-Stand back.
-You, come!
Had to be the Jews!
Open up in the name of the divine emperor!
Judah!
Tirzah!
What is it?
What's happened?
Open up in the name of the law!
-I was watching the--
-A tile fell and struck the governor.
-It wasn't my fault.
-They won't believe her.
She won't have to say anything.
You hear?
Tirzah, say nothing.
Open the gates!
I'll speak to them.
-Arrest him!
-Let me tell you what happened.
-Hold those women.
-Stop them!
It was an accident.
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.
-This is the man, sir.
We saw him.
-It was an accident.
-Accident?
-I swear it.
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose.
It gave way.
Take him.
Take all of them.
-He's telling the truth!
-It was me!
Let them go!
Attention!
Messala.
In the name of God, tell them it's a mistake.
I leaned on the tile, and it broke loose.
It was an accident.
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!
Let the servants go.
Let them go.
Return to your ranks.
Come.
Where?
Tirus.
Tirus?
I've had no trial.
I'm to die in the galleys without even a trial?
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!
Wait.
My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?
Tie his hands.
-At least tell me if they're safe.
-I can tell you nothing.
Get along.
Keep moving.
Jailer!
Guard, in there!
Up the stairs!
Jailer!
Jailer!
To the right.
-Wait!
-Send them out.
Go!
The door.
Where are my mother and sister?
Where are they?
Here, within these walls.
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.
Of course, they will be sentenced.
Is it possible?
Is it possible you could do this to us?
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?
You will let them go.
You will gladly let them go!
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not a murderer!
I know you're not.
You know?
You are evil.
No, Judah, I am not evil.
I wanted your help.
Now you've given it to me.
By making this example of you, I discourage treason.
By condemning without hesitation an old friend, I shall be feared.
But not my family.
Let them go.
Please.
-Messala, I beg you.
-Beg?
!
Didn't I beg you?
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.
Kill me, and your mother and sister will die...
... nailedtocrossesinfrontofyou !
Go on, Judah.
Kill me!
May God grant me vengeance.
I will pray that you live till I return.
Return?
Take him.
Sentries, salute.
The tribune will see you now.
Tribune, I'm steward of the House of Hur.
I remember you.
We were on our way to Antioch when we heard what had happened.
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done this thing.
You knew him, tribune.
Better than you.
Then there must be no doubt in your mind, the charge is groundless.
The prisoners have been sentenced.
-Sentenced?
-But there's no truth in it.
There was never a threat against the governor in Judah's mind.
Surely you must know he would never have done this.
In your heart, you must know it.
Drusus.
This man had better be kept here until we can question him.
Hold!
Water for the soldiers.
Soldiers first!
Get away from that well.
No water for them!
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!
Come on, you!
Water for the horses!
-Water.
Water.
-Soldiers first!
Here.
Wait.
No water for him.
God...
... helpme.
You!
I said no water for him!
All right, on your feet, all of you!
Get them on their feet!
Back in line, you dog!
On your feet!
Get them going!
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!
Forward, you dogs!
Soon, the counselor's barge will be coming alongside.
Be ready to raise oars.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.
-How many rowers?
-Two hundred, consul.
-And reliefs?
-Of 30, every hour.
This man is ill.
Replace him.
-Change him.
-Right, sir.
-This man's been giving you trouble?
-He's insubordinate, consul.
That will stop.
What service have you seen?
Forty-one.
A month's less a day in this ship.
You keep an exact account.
And before?
Three years in other ships.
Three years.
You have the spirit to fight back...
... butthegoodsensetocontrolit.
Your eyes are full of hate, 41 .
That's good.
Hate keeps a man alive.
It gives him strength.
Now, listen to me, all of you.
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
So row well...
... andlive.
-Ship ready, consul.
-Strike oars.
Strike oars!
You know a fleet of Macedonian galleys...
... hasbeenraidingRomancommerce.
The emperor has honored us with the task...
... ofseekingoutand destroyingthem .
Battle speed, hortator.
Battle speed!
Attack speed.
Attack speed!
Ramming speed.
Ramming speed!
Rest.
Halt!
Rest!
Why are you here?
I was ordered to report to you during my relief.
Oh, yes.
I'd forgotten.
You could have killed me as I lay there.
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?
I'm not ready to die.
What do you think will save you?
The God of my fathers.
Your God has forsaken you.
He has no more power than the images I pray to.
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.
I might.
Does that interest you, 41 ?
I can see that it does.
I'm a fighting man by profession, and in my leisure moments...
... itamusesme to trainfightingmen.
I own some of the best gladiators and charioteers in Rome.
Would you like to become one of them?
To die as your slave?
Better than to live in chains below these decks.
I will not be here forever.
No?
What would you do if you escaped?
Two people were condemned with me, my mother and sister...
... thoughtheywereinnocent.
I won't rest--
Do not say that you were innocent.
-Would it do any good to say it again?
-No.
Consider my offer carefully.
You will never escape while we are victorious.
If we are not, you will sink with this ship, chained to your oar.
I cannot believe that God has let me live these years...
... todiechainedtoanoar.
It's a strange, stubborn faith you keep...
... tobelievethat existence has a purpose.
A sane man would have learned to lose it long before this.
As you have.
What drove it out of you?
Go back to your oar, 41 .
Consul, enemy sighted.
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.
All the watch to battle posts.
-Stand by to load.
-Make ready to fire.
Hurry, quick!
Hurry up with that resin.
Get some more ammunition.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
Chain rowers!
Guard.
Unlock 41 .
No!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
41 , why did he do that?
I don't know.
Once before, a man helped me.
I didn't know why then.
Normal speed!
Number 1 , flame.
Fire.
Fire!
Fire!
Hold withdrawal on command.
Lift oars!
Raise!
Withdraw!
Steersman, right.
Extend oars!
Fire!
-Watch out!
-Fire!
Steersman, ram course!
Order below!
-Ramming speed!
-Ramming speed!
Consul, barge on ramming course.
We're going to be rammed!
We're going to be rammed!
Why did you save me?
Why did you have me unchained?
What is your name, 41 ?
Judah Ben-Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur...
... letmedie.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
Row well and live.
Is the sail square?
I can't tell.
Better for us both if it's the enemy.
My death.
Your freedom.
It's a Roman sail.
Face rear!
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.
Water.
The fleet, all lost?
Five galleys.
-And the battle?
-The battle was won.
You have a victory.
-It was a victory?
-Complete.
In His eagerness to save you...
... yourGodhasalsosaved the Roman fleet.
Hail Arrius!
Right oars!
You have cleared the seaways of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.
This baton of victory has been nobly won.
This man riding beside you, who is he?
The man who saved me, divine emperor, to return and serve you.
Is that all you know about him?
No.
He was accused of an attack on the governor of Judea.
But he was innocent.
If not, there's a strange inconsistency in this man...
... whotriesto killmygovernor, yet saves the life of my consul.
Come tomorrow.
We'll talk of it.
We have all the information on this man...
... amanof someinfluence in his own country.
His attack upon our governor is one upon the senate and the people of Rome.
I am convinced that no such attack was intended.
Consul, allow us to continue.
Allow us to be generous.
As a reward to you for your great victory...
... weshallnotsendhimbackto the galleys.
Take him as your slave.
Such is the will of the senate...
... andthepeopleofRome .
Not long ago, I returned to Rome...
... witha youngman who had saved my life.
You all know him as the finest charioteer in Rome.
Five times, he's driven my horses to victory.
I know him as one who stands in the place of the son I lost.
I have the love and pride in a son's achievements...
... whichI thought I should never have again.
Nothing could make stronger our bond...
... buttonightIwish to share it with you all.
The formalities of adoption have been completed.
Young Arrius is now the legal bearer of my name...
... andtheheirtomyproperty.
This ring of my ancestors...
... wouldhavegonetomyson.
So now it is yours.
It's a strange destiny that brought me to a new life...
... anewhome...
... anewfather.
It brought me here.
It may take me away.
But wherever I may be...
... Ishallalwaystry towear this ring as a son of Arrius should.
With gratitude and affection...
... andwithhonor.
My old friend Pontius Pilate, young Arrius.
Before you came to this city, my horses always won.
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.
Yes, but not swift enough to defeat you.
-Tell me, you come from Judea?
-Yes, sir.
I hear that the climate is difficult to live in.
Not for Judeans.
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.
-Of Judea?
-Yes.
I asked for Alexandria.
But it seems the wilderness needs my particular talents.
The scorpions and holy prophets can't get on without me.
Lay the dust of Judea, at least for this evening.
Goats and Jehovah.
You're leaving.
I must.
It's a journey I can't keep you from.
Your eyes have never left it all these months.
I can recognize pain.
But still, my counsel is to wait.
Gratus is to be replaced.
The governorship goes to Pontius Pilate.
When?
Very soon.
It's very much to our purpose.
Nothing is to the purpose if, when I come back to Judea, I come too late.
That is the thought which has punished me every moment I've spent here.
Will Rome see you again?
Here is a part of my life which you have made for me.
I shall remember it.
Whoever the gods are, they take small interest in an old man's hopes.
They have their way.
Forgive me.
You're a stranger here.
Would you be from Nazareth?
Why do you ask?
I thought...
... youmightbe theone--
The one that I have come back from my country to find.
He would be about your age.
Who?
When I find Him...
... IshallknowHim .
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.
Sack of flesh without brains!
No!
No!
Not the whip!
That is my host.
Gently!
Gently!
Fool!
Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood.
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run!
Go on!
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!
Beautiful horses.
Now!
Now!
They are ready!
Let them go!
Watch.
They'll never hold the turn.
No!
No!
Abadon, stop him!
Stop that whip!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill--!
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!
You think you can treat my horses like animals?
!
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!
Get off, idiot!
Drive goats, not horses!
I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.
Not a team?
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.
-Antares.
-The slow one?
He should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?
In the circus in Rome.
You have driven in the great circus?
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.
No other animal has descended so in scale...
... fromthefirstinnocentfalling of the world.
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.
Yes.
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.
Your coming here was so fit, so right.
We might have achieved wonders!
You have to go.
I make a journey which will not wait.
Ah, well, then perhaps you will come back.
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.
I have no wives.
No wives at all?
I have six, no, seven.
I've counted eight.
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.
-Someday, I hope to have one.
-One wife!
One God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.
It is not generous.
-Was the food not to your liking?
-Indeed.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.
And now I must say good night to my beauties.
When ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.
-I'll make my farewells then.
-No, no, no, stay.
Stay and see them.
Come, my children.
Come.
Strangers make them shy.
Come.
Come, do not be afraid.
Come.
There, my children.
They are descended from the Arabians of the Pharaohs...
... andI havenamedthem for the stars.
Come, Antares.
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.
What?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.
Come, Rigel.
We've both supped well, and the world is good.
There's my good Rigel.
Yes, you are ready for sleep.
The day's work done for you, eh?
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.
Good night.
Good night, my treasure.
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.
No.
You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.
You should see their mother, Mira.
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.
All right, all right.
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.
You must be strong and swift.
Go, my children.
Go.
At Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams...
... andthechampionoftheEast, Messala, with his black devils.
He stops at nothing to win.
-Messala?
ln the circus?
-Yes.
You knew him?
I know him.
Perhaps without much liking.
My people are praying for a man...
... todrivetheirteam to victory over Messala.
You could be that man, the one...
... tostamphisarrogance into the sand.
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them...
... onewhowillrulethem with love .
For him, they'd outrace the wind.
It's not possible.
That is a pity.
Think of it.
To break his pride...
... tohumblethistribunebefore the very people he has degraded.
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!
I know it is not possible.
Does it not delight your imagination?
Does it not answer your purpose?
I must deal with Messala in my own way.
And your way is to kill him.
I see this terrible thing in your eyes.
But no matter what this man has done, you have no right to kill him.
He will be punished inevitably.
I don't believe in miracles.
But all life is a miracle.
Why will you not accept God's judgment?
You do not believe in miracles.
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness...
... anda starledme to a village called Bethlehem...
... whereI foundanewbornchild in a manger.
And God lived in this child.
By now, He is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.
That is why I have returned here...
... sothatImay beathand when He comes among us.
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.
Perhaps He's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.
Perhaps He is a shepherd...
... amerchant,afisherman.
But He lives...
... andallourlivesfrom nowon will carry His mark.
There are many paths to God, my son.
I hope yours will not be too difficult.
I'm ready for sleep.
Balthasar is a good man...
... butuntilallmen are likehim, we must keep our swords bright.
And our intention true.
So I must leave you.
One last thought.
There is no law in the arena.
Many are killed.
I hope to see you again.
Fine Damascus silk.
Fine Damascus silk.
Esther?
It's Judah.
You are alive.
You are alive.
What are you doing here?
What has happened?
I'm here.
I'm with you.
Where's your father?
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.
They tortured him.
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.
You never went back to Antioch?
No.
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.
Where are my mother and sister?
Let me tell him first.
Father.
Father, something wonderful has happened.
Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
He has come home.
He is here.
Judah.
Judah Ben-Hur.
My dear old friend.
Let me look at you.
Let me see you.
Yes, yes.
It is true.
Praise God for His mercy.
Where are they?
Since that terrible day...
... therehasbeennoword ofthem.
You should have been less loyal.
Do not pity me, Master Judah.
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.
We were released on the same day.
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.
Since then, I have been his tongue...
... andhehasbeenmylegs.
Together, we make a considerable man.
Old friend.
She always said you would return.
She never gave up hope.
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.
I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.
But suppose that isn't possible.
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.
They could not make me tell them where it is.
It is there still...
... toputpowerintoourhands and buy death for the Romans.
That's not why I came back.
Judah, they are dead.
Four years.
No one could live so long in the dungeons.
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?
Yes, it is true.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You have come back to us like a returning faith.
Judah, I should like to laugh again.
-Let us laugh.
-We will.
There will be joy again in this house.
We will celebrate among the dust.
I will take him.
We stood here before.
A long while ago.
Four years.
But now it seems as if...
... onlyyesterday... .
I was saying:
"If you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye. "
"If I were not a bride...
... therewouldbe no goodbyes to be said. "
I am not a bride.
Why did you never marry?
My father needed me.
And also... .
It's still on my finger.
I said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.
It's become a part of my hand.
If Messala once knew you were here... .
As he must.
He will know where they are.
And if you should find... .
-If he says they're dead--
-Messala will wish they were living.
I've seen too much of what hate can do.
My father is burned up with it.
But I've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater...
... andlovemorepowerfulthan hatred.
I believe it.
-Esther.
-Judah.
Stay alive.
Keep away from Messala.
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.
That time isn't yet come.
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.
This time you will be destroyed.
You'll die.
-Consul here?
-Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.
Thank him.
Bring him to me.
-I didn't know the consul had a son.
-He's a champion of the great circus.
Why is he presenting me with gifts?
-Perhaps he'll race against you.
-Look.
It's magnificent.
And from a man I've never met.
You're wrong, Messala.
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?
You were the magician, Messala.
You condemned me to the galleys.
When my ship was sunk, I saved the consul's life.
You know his seal?
Now I have come back...
... asI sworeIwould.
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.
You suggest I use it on myself?
What has become of my mother and my sister?
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.
Find them, Messala.
Restore them to me, and I'll forget what I vowed...
... witheverystrokeofthat oar you chained me to.
I am not the governor.
I can do nothing without approval.
Then get it.
I will come back tomorrow.
Don't disappoint me, Messala.
What became of them?
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?
Go to the citadel, Drusus.
Find out.
-And if they're dead?
-They're dead!
"Miriam, wife.
Tirzah, daughter. "
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?
E section...
... lowerlevel.
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.
Water.
Water.
Let me out!
-How long since you've seen them?
-Never.
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.
The food disappears.
Lepers.
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.
Then we'll burn out the cell.
Is someone there?
There is someone there.
Who are you?
Don't come any closer.
Who are you?
Esther.
It's Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam?
Stay where you are.
You have come home.
Stand back, Esther.
We are lepers.
Oh, Esther.
Tirzah.
Esther...
... isJudahliving?
Yes, he is alive.
He is here.
Where?
He is searching for you now.
I must find him and tell him.
-No!
-Tell my father.
No.
Tell no one.
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.
We won't return.
Judah has to be told.
No.
Please.
I couldn't see his face.
Is it changed?
No, he is not changed.
He's not changed.
You love him, Esther.
Promise me...
... onyourlovefor him ...
... youwillnevertellhim you've seen us.
Is he never to know?
Let him remember us as we were.
Promise me.
There's nothing else I can hope for.
Only this.
I promise.
I am content.
Wait.
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.
I pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.
He'll free them.
He wants to survive.
He cannot free them, Judah.
What do you mean?
I saw them.
You saw them?
Where?
When did you see them?
They were dead.
They were dead.
When?
When?
When?
!
In the prison.
When I was waiting for news of my father.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't tell you.
Nor even you, Father.
I was afraid that if you saw Messala... .
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.
It's over now.
Over?
-Judah.
-Over?
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.
Gentlemen.
Officers.
Defenders of great Rome's imperium...
... mayI enter?
Certainly, sheik.
You do us an unexpected honor.
The noble tribune is most gracious.
And now...
... thequestionyou'reasking:
Why am I here?
As you know, I am a gambling man.
The games approach.
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.
I will back my own poor horses.
No limits?
-Mark me first!
-And me!
-What odds?
-A moment, please...
... mylords,protectors of the far flung marshes.
May I first sit down?
Sit.
How much will you wager?
-Yes, let's call his game.
-Give the Arab a seat.
A bench, quickly.
Thank you.
-Now.
-1 000 denarii.
-2000!
-Mark me!
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient.
There is time.
First gentlemen, the odds.
The tribune has won many times.
The odds should be in the same measure.
What is your pleasure, gentlemen?
Two to one.
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth...
... whereisthecourage that made Rome master of the world?
I can get better odds on any street market.
Three to one.
Let us not haggle.
Let us be fair.
In four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.
-In all truth--
-Just a moment.
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.
The Prince of Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur.
Prince of Hur?
-He was sent to the galleys years ago.
-He has returned.
Returned?
lmpossible.
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.
Well?
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.
You, tribune...
... willyougivemefour toone?
Four to one.
Good.
Four to one, sheik.
The difference between a Roman and a Jew.
Or an Arab.
Bravely spoken.
Now we will settle the amount of our wager.
I will venture... .
A thousand talents?
-A thousand talents?
-Yes, a thousand talents.
Of course, if it is too much... .
A thousand talents it will be.
Agreed.
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.
You're good fellows.
If only men were this good.
Remember, Altair...
... ninetimesaroundthe circus.
Aldebaran.
Rigel, did you hear?
Nine lives to live.
My swift fellow.
You must not win the race the first time around.
You win the last time around.
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.
Steady Antares.
Like a rock.
You will be our anchor.
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.
They have taken me into their family.
Rest well, my stars.
Tomorrow we go up to the city.
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it...
... thenewswillscorchthestreets of the Roman world.
Pontius Pilate here?
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.
You will make him see what men are born in this land.
I only know that I race against Messala.
Look for the yoke.
Ease that strap.
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.
Into Your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as You will.
The Star of David.
To shine out for your people and my people together...
... andblindtheeyesofRome.
They are ready.
Easy, girl, easy.
Number five.
Where is number five?
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.
Yes, this is the day.
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.
Hail, Jupiter.
Give me victory.
Watch your line!
Keep your places!
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.
Citizens...
... Iwelcomeyoutothesegames in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.
We dedicate them to his glory...
... andtothegloryofRome...
... ofwhichyouare all part.
Let us honor those who race for us today.
They come here from Alexandria...
... Messina...
... Carthage...
... Cyprus...
... Rome...
... Corinth...
... Athens...
... Phrygia...
... andJudea.
To the best of these, a crown of victory.
The race begins.
Hail, Caesar!
Come, my children, come!
The Roman pig!
Salute.
A great victory.
You are the people's one true god...
... forthetimebeing.
Permit us to worship.
I crown their god.
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.
A long life, young Arrius and the good sense to live it.
We cannot wait, tribune.
He will come.
He will--
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.
He will come!
He will come.
I've sent for him, and he will come.
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.
Do you understand?
To hack the legs off me?
Not yet.
Not till I've seen him.
I don't receive him with half a body.
No!
I told you, Drusus.
I told you.
Here he is.
Triumph complete, Judah.
The race won.
The enemy destroyed.
I see no enemy.
What do you think you see?
The smashed body of a wretched animal?
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.
Let me help you.
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.
Dead.
And the race over.
It isn't over, Judah.
They're not dead.
Where are they?
Where are they?
Look for them...
... intheValleyoftheLepers...
... ifyoucanrecognizethem .
It goes on.
It goes on, Judah.
The race... .
The race is not over.
Is there a way down here?
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.
Man.
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.
There are many women.
Of the family of Hur.
We have no names here.
For them?
-Why did you say they were dead?
-It was what they wanted.
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?
Not to see them?
They are coming.
Love them in the way they must need to be loved.
Not to look at them.
Let them be as if you had never come here.
Please!
Is Judah well?
Is he happy?
Yes, he is well.
Your mind can be at rest for him.
He is well, Miriam.
God be with you.
They have gone.
We can go back.
Go back to what?
Judah, they have one blessing left.
To think you remember them as they were...
... andliveyourown life.
Forget what is here.
Forget?
It's as though they're alive in a grave.
-But what can you do?
-Undo what you've done.
How could you have suffered them to come here?
I must see them.
No, Judah, please!
Judah!
Think, Judah, think.
It would tear them apart if they see you.
He is here.
I have found Him.
The child has become a man.
And the man, I know it now, is the Son of God.
The promise is true.
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.
Life has been answered.
God has answered it.
Come.
Come with me.
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys...
... thirsthadnearlykilledme.
A man gave me water to drink.
I went on living.
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.
No.
I am thirsty still.
Come and listen.
I have business with Rome.
You insist on death.
Goodbye, Judah.
You sent for me?
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.
-I honor him.
-As you may honor yourself.
You have been made a citizen of Rome.
Do you say nothing to this?
I have just come from the Valley of Stone...
... wheremymotherand sisterlive what's left of their lives.
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.
I have heard this.
There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.
Where there is greatness, great government or power...
... evengreatfeelingorcompassion...
... erroralsois great.
We progress and mature by fault.
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.
There are other voices.
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place...
... nottocrucifyyourself on a shadow such as old resentment...
... orimpossibleloyalties.
Perfect freedom has no existence.
A grown man knows the world he lives in.
And for the present, the world is Rome.
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.
I am Judah Ben-Hur.
I cross this floor in spoken friendship...
... asI wouldspeaktoArrius.
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar...
... readytocrushthose who challenge his authority.
There are too many men of envy and ambition...
... whotryto disrupt the government of Rome.
You have become the victor and hero to those people.
They look to you, their one true god, as I call you.
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.
I am already part of this tragedy.
Return this to Arrius.
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you...
... frompersonaldisaster if you stay here.
You are too great a danger.
Leave Judea.
You have my word.
I was afraid you would never come back...
... afraidofwhatwouldhappentoyou .
But I see you again.
Your father's waiting for me.
Where is he?
What do you mean to do?
Rest, sleep.
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.
Peace?
Love and peace.
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?
Where do you see them?
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.
Balthasar's word.
He is more than Balthasar's word.
His voiced traveled with such a still purpose.
It was more than a voice.
A man more than a man.
He said, "Blessed are the merciful...
... fortheyshallobtainmercy.
Blessed are the peacemakers...
... fortheyshallbecalled the children of God. "
Children of God?
In that dead valley where we left them?
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean...
... untilwehavescouredoff our bodies the crust and filth...
... ofbeingat themercyoftyranny.
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.
-In blood?
-Yes, in blood!
I know there is a law in life.
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.
Death generates death...
... asthevulturebreedsthevulture.
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:
"Love your enemy.
Do good to those who despitefully use you. "
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.
As you make us do now.
Are we to bear nothing together?
Even love?
I can hardly draw breath...
... withoutfeelingyouinmyheart .
But I know...
... thateverythingIdo from this moment...
... bearsgreaterpain than you have ever suffered.
It is better not to love me.
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy...
... givingevilforevil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.
It's as though you had become Messala.
I've lost you, Judah.
No further.
What are you doing here?
I was here last evening waiting for you.
I have waited all night.
What has happened?
Where is Tirzah?
Leave the food.
I am coming closer.
Don't be afraid.
-What are you doing?
-Don't be afraid.
I've heard Him again, the man from Nazareth.
If ever words were from God, they are in everything He says.
I cannot bear that you should have never known...
... thishandof quiet reaching towards us.
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find Him there.
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find Him.
Tirzah is dying.
Leave the food and go.
It's Judah.
Why did you tell him?
Yes, Judah, yes.
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.
Mother.
Wait, Mother, wait.
Let me talk with you.
Please.
No, no further.
Please.
No, Judah.
Son, no.
Mother, let me see Tirzah.
Tirzah is dying.
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know...
... thatlifeis everlasting...
... anddeathis nothingtofear if you have faith.
I will take them to Him.
No!
God, no!
No, no, dear son.
Mother...
... whereisTirzah?
Judah, no.
Judah, no.
You must not go to her, dear son.
Please.
Dear son.
I am afraid.
No cause.
The world is more than we know.
Tirzah, it's Judah.
No, Judah.
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
-Why are the streets deserted?
-They have gone to the trial.
Trial?
Whose trial?
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.
-This cannot be true.
-Alms?
What has he done?
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.
Help for the blind.
-Look, lepers!
-Lepers!
Get away!
Stay away!
Go away!
Lepers!
Lepers!
How can this be?
I know this man.
Will someone help Him?
Take pity on Him.
Have mercy.
In His pain...
... thislookof peace.
Watch over them, Esther.
We must go back.
I brought you here to this...
... whenI hoped... .
You haven't failed, Esther.
Hail King of the Jews!
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.
He gave me water...
... anda heartto live.
What has He done to merit this?
He has taken the world of our sins onto Himself.
To this end He said He was born...
... inthatstable...
... whereI firstsawHim .
For this cause, He came into the world.
For this death?
This beginning.
I have lived too long.
As though He were carrying in that cross...
... thepainof theworld.
So fearful, and yet why is it...
... I'mnotafraidanymore?
The shadow of a storm.
A strange darkness...
... butstillday.
His life is over.
What is it?
This tearing.
I am in pain.
I feel it too.
Do you see your hand?
Almost at the moment He died...
... IheardHimsay , "Father, forgive them...
... fortheyknownot whatthey do."
Even then.
Even then.
And I felt His voice take the sword out of my hand.
BALTHASAR:
In the year of our Lord Judea, for nearly a century, had lain under the mastery of Rome.
In the seventh year of the reign of Augustus Caesar an imperial decree ordered every Judean each to return to his place of birth to be counted and taxed.
The converging ways of many of them led to their capital city, Jerusalem the troubled heart of their land.
The old city was dominated by the fortress of Antonia the seat of Roman power and by the great golden temple the outward sign of an inward and imperishable faith.
Even while they obeyed the will of Caesar the people clung proudly to their ancient heritage always remembering the promise of their prophets that one day there would be born among them a redeemer to bring them salvation and perfect freedom.
[MURMURING]
You'll be counted at Hebron.
- Name?
- Samuel.
- What city?
- Joppa.
- What family?
- Michael.
- Move on.
Move on.
- Yes.
- Name?
- Joseph.
- What city?
- Nazareth.
- What family?
- David of Bethlehem.
- And the woman?
- My wife.
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.
Come on, come on.
[OXEN BELLOWING]
[BABY CRYING]
[SHEEP BAAING]
[TRUMPETS]
What village is this?
Nazareth.
We should arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow night.
You're not watching the soldiers, Joseph?
We've seen Romans before.
Yes and we will see them again.
My table is not finished.
Where is your son?
- He's walking in the hills.
- Mm-hm.
He neglects his work, Joseph.
No.
Once, I reproached him with forgetting his work.
He said to me:
"I must be about my father's business."
Then why isn't he here, working?
He's working.
SEXTUS:
Trumpeters of the legion!
[TRUMPETING]
Welcome, Messala.
The command is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for relieving me.
Drusus when I was a boy, I dreamed of commanding this garrison.
Now the wheel has turned.
I am in command.
OFFICER:
Attention!
Aisle one, face right!
Forward!
I'd forgotten the heat.
If it were only the heat.
I lived here until I was 14.
Jerusalem was my home.
- My father was head of...
- Yes, I know.
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.
If there can be such a thing in this forsaken land.
If you want to rise, Sextus, do the difficult.
I asked to be sent here.
I think you'll find the people changed since you were a boy.
In what way?
Oh, won't pay their taxes, an irrational resentment of Rome...
There's nothing new in all that.
And then there's religion.
I tell you, they're drunk with religion.
They smash the statues of our gods, even those of the emperor.
Punish them.
We do.
When we can find them.
Find the leaders.
Oh, you don't know.
There's nothing you can put your finger on.
I tell you, there are strange forces at work here.
For instance, this "messiah" business...
I know.
There was one predicted when I was a boy.
A king of the Jews, who will lead them into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.
Makes your head spin.
There's a wild man in the desert named John who drowns people in water.
And a carpenter's son who does magic tricks. "Miracles" they call them.
There's always a rabble-rouser stirring up trouble.
No, no, no.
This man is different.
He teaches that God is near, in every man.
[MESSALA SCOFFS]
It's actually quite profound, some of it.
You've been too long away from Rome.
Go back, Sextus.
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea and forget that God is in every man.
- There is divinity in only one man.
- Yes, I know.
The emperor is displeased.
He wishes Judea made into a more obedient and disciplined province.
He has ordered me to restore order.
I intend to carry out his wishes.
But how?
You can break a man's skull, arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.
But how do you control what's up here?
How do you fight an idea?
Especially a new idea.
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.
I assume he has a name.
- He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
- Then treat him like one!
Tell him I will join him.
Yes, tribune.
Centurion!
This was his country before it was ours.
Don't forget that.
Yes, tribune.
Very wise.
This Ben-Hur is the richest man in Jerusalem.
And the head of one of the greatest families in Judea.
We were friends as boys.
We were like brothers.
Sextus you ask how to fight an idea.
Well, I'll tell you how.
With another idea.
I said I'd come back.
I never thought you would.
I'm so glad.
[BOTH LAUGH]
- Look at you.
- Look at you!
You've come back a tribune.
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.
We'll drink another now.
- Your sister and mother?
How're they?
- They're fine.
They've talked of you ever since we knew you were coming.
- Is Tirzah married?
- No.
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.
She's been in love with you since she was 5.
I can't wait to see them.
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?
Or have you become too dignified?
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
- Down Eros, up Mars!
- Down Eros, up Mars!
MESSALA:
Where the beams cross?
BEN-HUR:
Good.
[BOTH LAUGH]
After all these years!
Still close.
In every way.
I hope so.
I know.
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew whose life you once saved.
The best thing I ever did.
Judah it will be very difficult to govern here.
I'm going to need help.
Your help.
Your advice.
- You want my advice?
- Yes, I do.
Withdraw your legions.
Give us our freedom.
Unfortunately, the emperor is devoted to his empire.
He's particularly fond of Judea.
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.
Is there anything so sad as unrequited love?
[MESSALA CHUCKLES]
My quarters.
Hmm.
A bit grim.
Not grim.
Austere.
Virtuous.
Roman.
I'm going to be second-in-command to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.
He's arriving in a few days with two more legions.
Then the rumors are true.
The emperor does not approve of your countrymen.
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.
But you and your family need have no concern.
I'm next in authority to the governor, and you're my friend.
- I'm a Jew.
- Ah, you are like a Roman!
What have you in common with the troublemaking rabble?
Rabble?
They're my people.
I'm one of them.
Be wise, Judah.
It's a Roman world.
If you want to live in it, you must become part of it.
You've changed.
I've grown up.
I've seen the world since I left Jerusalem.
I've seen Rome.
It's no accident that one small village on the Tiber was chosen to rule the world.
Your legions.
It wasn't just our legions.
Other countries have armies, fine armies.
I know, I fought them.
Oh, no.
No, it was fate that chose us to civilize the world.
And we have.
Our roads and ships connect every corner of the earth.
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.
I believe in the future of my people.
Of course you do.
And you can help them.
How?
You're an aristocrat.
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince among your people.
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.
They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.
Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.
It is worse than stupid, futile!
For it can end in only one way, extinction for your people!
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.
Then we're agreed!
Now, when can I come to see your family?
- We had hoped tomorrow.
- Good.
And now for our toast.
It's dreadful wine, by the way.
It's especially fermented for the Roman army.
[MESSALA CHUCKLES]
You're very cruel to your conquerors.
It's an insane world.
But in it there is one sanity:
The loyalty of old friends.
Judah, we must believe in one another.
Will you drink to that?
With all my heart.
Here it is, the place I've remembered.
The court where we played at changing the guard.
The roof where we'd throw pebbles at people in the street and then hide.
- We were rascals, weren't we?
- No, you were good boys.
I would have that time again.
And here it is.
Nothing has changed.
Except for the fountain.
- The old well would go dry, remember?
- Promptly, every summer.
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.
- He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
- No?
Of course he has.
He was a boy when he left us, now he's a man.
With great responsibilities.
Come.
The emperor builds and builds, turning brick to marble.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.
I've never seen anything like this before.
It's beautiful!
- Is it Roman?
- It's Libyan.
I was there last year.
A tremendous campaign.
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.
Or was, till we destroyed it.
Now it's nothing but ashes.
I'm boring you with soldier stories.
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.
Thank you for this.
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.
BEN-HUR:
What do you think of it?
MESSALA:
Magnificent.
It's Arabic.
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.
Let me try him sometime.
Whenever you like.
He's yours.
Do you mean you'll give me this?
Oh, Judah.
You are good.
It's going to be like old times, I know it.
Judah, tell me, did you think about what I said?
Yes.
Talked to a number of people already.
Spoken against violence, against incidents.
Most of the men agree with me.
Most?
Not all?
- No, not all.
- Who does not agree?
Well, the resentful, the impatient.
Who are they?
Yes, Judah.
Who are they?
Would I retain your friendship if I became an informer?
Telling the names of criminals is not informing.
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.
Patriots?
!
Judah.
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.
This is my great opportunity, and yours too.
If I bring order here, I can have any post I want.
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?
Rome!
Yes, perhaps at the side of Caesar himself.
I mean it.
It can happen and this is the moment.
I swear, this is the time.
The emperor is watching us, judging us.
All I need do is serve him.
And all you need do is help me serve him.
- You speak as if he were God.
- He is God.
The only God.
He is power, real power on earth, not...
Not that.
Help me, Judah.
I would do anything for you, Messala except betray my own people.
In the name of all the gods, what do the lives of a few Jews mean to you?
If I cannot persuade them, that does not mean I would help you murder them.
Besides, you must understand this, Messala.
I believe in the past and future of my people.
Future?
You are a conquered people.
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?
Joshua will not rise again to save you nor David.
There is only one reality in the world today.
Look to the West.
Don't be a fool!
Look to Rome!
Better a fool than a traitor or a killer.
- I am a soldier.
- Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.
- I warn you...
- No!
I warn you.
Rome is an affront to God.
Rome is strangling my people and my country, the whole earth!
But not forever.
And I tell you, the day Rome falls there will be a shout of freedom such as the world has never heard before.
Judah.
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.
You're either for me or against me.
If that is the choice then I am against you.
There they are.
Where's Messala?
- Where's?
- He's gone.
Gone?
- But why?
- He couldn't stay.
- What happened?
- A new tribune must have many duties.
Come.
Let us have dinner.
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the world who bringeth to us bread from the earth.
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.
He wanted to use me to betray our people.
Judah.
[MURMURING]
[CAMEL BAYING]
- Master, the caravan from Antioch.
- Yes, Amrah, I saw.
Simonides.
- Welcome.
- Judah.
- Oh, welcome homecoming.
- Master.
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.
And for the master, lberian wine.
Not to mention the best gift of all, your presence.
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.
- Caravans from Petra.
- Have all arrived.
- Good.
- Here is the accounting.
And what of Numidia?
The trade route is ours, guaranteed by treaty with the king.
Once a year, you bring your accounting.
And once a year, I find myself wealthier.
Yeah, but my greatest treasure is my steward.
SIMONIDES:
My life belongs to the House of Hur.
Nothing else exists for me, except my daughter.
- She must be a young woman by now.
- Yes, and your property.
She was born the daughter of your slave.
When I inherited you, I inherited a friend, not a slave.
Still, Esther has come with me from Antioch for your permission to marry.
It's granted.
I wish you the joy of many grandchildren.
SIMONIDES:
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.
With your permission, Esther wishes to speak to her master.
You're eager to marry, Esther?
It is my father's wish.
Your husband will be fortunate.
What is his name?
David, son of Mathias.
BEN-HUR:
Of what house?
- His own, master.
- He is a freeman.
Tell me more about him.
I have seen him only once.
He is a merchant, well-thought-of in Antioch.
He will pay for Esther's freedom.
Her freedom will be my wedding gift to Esther.
You are generous, master.
Do you love this man?
I will learn to love him.
You have my permission to marry.
We'll drink to your happiness.
And a safe return to Antioch.
BEN-HUR:
I disturbed you.
No.
What were you thinking?
I was saying goodbye to this city and this house.
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?
My father sometimes brought me here when I was little.
It was a house where I was always happy.
Except once.
When you and your friend, the Roman boy...
- Messala.
- Yes.
You had been out hunting and they brought you home injured.
I touched your face as you lay there and prayed to God, "Don't let this boy die."
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.
Yes, master.
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.
It's strange.
I hardly felt a slave.
And now I hardly feel free.
You know, in the old, wise days of Solomon if there was among his slaves some girl who filled his eyes he could choose her out from the rest and take her to him.
Wise days of Solomon.
Different days.
And long ago.
If you were not a bride I should kiss you goodbye.
If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said.
Your slave ring.
Fair exchange.
Freedom to you.
The ring to me.
You will wear it?
Until you meet the woman you will marry?
Until then.
[DRUMMING]
[TRUMPETING]
The gods favor my lord Gratus.
If it is the governor's pleasure, the wreath of office.
Thank you, tribune.
I see no delegation from the city.
- There will not be one, sir.
- No?
Jerusalem's welcome will not be a warm one.
But I pledge, my lord, it will be a quiet one.
Let us proceed.
[CHILDREN SHOUTING]
There's Messala.
He saw you, Judah.
The new governor.

OFFICER 3:
Open up in the name of the divine emperor!
Judah!
Tirzah!
What is it?
What's happened?
OFFICER 4:
Open up in the name of Rome!
- I was watching the Romans...
- A tile fell and struck the governor.
- It wasn't my fault.
- They won't believe her.
She won't have to say anything.
You hear?
Tirzah, say nothing.
MAN:
Open the gates!
I'll speak to them.
OFFICER 1:
Arrest him!
- Wait.
Let me tell you what happened.
OFFICER 2:
Hold those women.
BEN-HUR:
Not them!
- Judah!
BEN-HUR:
It was an accident.
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.
- This is the man, sir.
We saw him.
- It was an accident.
- Accident?
- I swear it.
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose.
It gave way.
Take him.
Take all of them.
MIRIAM:
He's telling the truth!
- It was me!
Let them go!
MIRIAM:
Judah!
CENTURION:
Attention!
BEN-HUR:
Messala.
In the name of God, tell them it's a mistake.
I leaned on the tile, and it broke loose.
It was an accident.
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!
MIRIAM:
Messala!
TIRZAH:
Messala.
Let the servants go.
Let them go.
Return to your ranks.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
- Come.
- Where?
Tirus.
Tirus?
I've had no trial.
I'm to die in the galleys without even a trial?
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!
Wait.
My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?
Tie his hands.
- At least tell me if they're safe.
- I can tell you nothing.

Send them out.
You can go.
Go!
The door.
Where are my mother and sister?
Where are they?
Here, within these walls.
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.
Of course, they will be sentenced.
Is it possible, Messala?
Is it possible you could do this to us?
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?
You'll let them go.
You must.
You will gladly let them go!
Messala!
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not mad.
I'm not a murderer!
I know you're not.
You know?
You are evil.
No, Judah, I am not evil.
I wanted your help.
Now you've given it to me.
By making this example of you, I discourage treason.
By condemning without hesitation an old friend, I shall be feared.
But not my family.
Let them go.
Please.
- Messala, I beg you.
- Beg?
!
Didn't I beg you?
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.
Kill me, and your mother and sister will die today nailed to crosses in front of you!
Go on, Judah.
Kill me!
[GRUNTS]
May God grant me vengeance.
I will pray that you live till I return.
Return?
Take him.
OFFICER:
Sentries, salute.
The tribune will see you now.
Tribune, I'm steward of the House of Hur.
I remember you.
We were on our way to Antioch when we heard what had happened.
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done this thing.
You knew him, tribune.
Better than you.
Then there must be no doubt in your mind, the charge is groundless.
The prisoners have been sentenced.
- Sentenced?
- But there's no truth in it.
There was never a threat against the governor in Judah's mind.
Surely you must know he would never have done this.
In your heart, you must know it.
Drusus.
This man had better be kept here until we have time to question him.
DECURION:
Hold!

DECURION:

I said no water for him!
All right, on your feet, all of you!
Get them on their feet!
Back in line, you dog!
On your feet!
Get them going!
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!
Forward, you dogs!
In a few minutes, the consul's barge will be coming alongside.
Be ready to raise oars.
HORTATOR:
Raise oars!
Down oars!
[TRUMPETING]
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.
- How many rowers?
- Two hundred, consul.
- And reliefs?
- Of 30, every hour.
[MAN COUGHING]
This man is ill.
Replace him.
- Change him.
- Right, sir.
- This man has been giving you trouble?
- He's insubordinate, consul.
That will stop.
What service have you seen?
Forty-one.
A month's less a day in this ship.
You keep an exact account.
And before?
Three years in other ships.
Three years.
[BEN-HUR YELLS]
You have the spirit to fight back but the good sense to control it.
Your eyes are full of hate, 41.
That's good.
Hate keeps a man alive.
It gives him strength.
Now, listen to me, all of you.
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
So row well and live.
- Ship ready, consul.
- Strike oars.
HORTATOR:
Strike oars!
You know that a fleet of Macedonian galleys has been raiding Roman commerce.
The emperor has honored us with the task of seeking out and destroying them.

[HORTATOR DRUMMING NEARBY]
Why are you here?
I was ordered to report to you during my relief.
Oh, yes.
I'd forgotten.
You could have killed me as I lay there.
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?
I'm not ready to die.
What do you think will save you?
The God of my fathers.
Hmm.
Your God has forsaken you.
He has no more power than the images I pray to.
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.
I might.
Does that interest you, 41?
I can see that it does.
I'm a fighting man by profession, and in my leisure moments it amuses me to train fighting men.
I own some of the best gladiators and charioteers in Rome.
Would you like to become one of them?
To die as your slave?
Better than to live in chains below these decks.
I will not be here forever.
No?
What would you do if you escaped?
Two people were condemned with me, my mother and sister though they were innocent.
I won't rest...
Do not say that you were innocent.
- Would it do any good to say it again?
- No.
Consider my offer carefully.
You will never escape while we are victorious.
If we are not, you will sink with this ship, chained to your oar.
I cannot believe that God has let me live these three years to die chained to an oar.
It's a strange, stubborn faith you keep to believe that existence has a purpose.
A sane man would have learned to lose it long before this.
As you have.
What drove it out of you?
Go back to your oar, 41.
Consul, enemy sighted.
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.
OFFICER:

You have cleared the seaways of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.
This baton of victory has been nobly won.
[CROWD CHEERS]
This man riding beside you, who is he?
The man who saved me, divine emperor, to return and serve you.
Is that all you know about him?
No.
He was accused of an attack on the governor of Judea.
But he was innocent.
If not, there's a strange inconsistency in this man who tries to kill my governor, yet saves the life of my consul.
Come tomorrow.
We'll talk of it.
[CROWD CHEERS]
[BAND PLAYING TRIUMPHANT MUSIC]
We have all the information on this man a man of some influence in his own country.
His attack upon our governor is one upon the senate and the people of Rome.
I am convinced that no such attack was intended.
Consul, allow us to continue.
Allow us to be generous.
As a reward to you for your great victory we shall not send him back to the galleys.
We give him to you as your slave to do with him as you like.
Such is the will of the senate and the people of Rome.
[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]
[WOMEN YELLING]
[BAND PLAYING SOFT MUSIC]
Not long ago, I returned to Rome with a young man who had saved my life.
You all know him as the finest charioteer in Rome.
Five times, he's driven my horses to victory.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I know him as one who stands in the place of the son I lost.
I have the love and pride in a son's achievements which I thought I should never have again.
[MURMURING]
Nothing could make stronger the bond between us but tonight I wish to share it with you all.
The formalities of adoption have been completed.
Young Arrius is now the legal bearer of my name and the heir to my property.
[CROWD MURMURS]
This ring of my ancestors would have gone to my son.
So now it is yours.
It's a strange destiny that brought me to a new life a new home a new father.
It brought me here.
It may take me away.
But wherever I may be I shall always try to wear this ring as a son of Arrius should.
With gratitude and affection and with honor.
[CROWD CHEERING]
[SOFT MUSIC RESUMES]
I present my son to you.
My old friend Pontius Pilate, young Arrius.
Before you came to this city, my horses always won.
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.
Yes, but not swift enough to defeat you.
- Tell me, you come from Judea?
- Yes, sir.
I hear that the climate is difficult to live in.
Not for Judeans.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.
- Of Judea?
- Yes.
I asked for Alexandria.
But it seems the wilderness needs my particular talents.
The scorpions and holy prophets can't get on without me.
Lay the dust of Judea, at least for this evening.
Goats and Jehovah.
[ARRIUS CHUCKLES]
You're leaving.
I must.
It's a journey I can't keep you from.
Your eyes have never left it all these months.
I can recognize pain.
But still, my counsel is to wait.
Gratus is to be replaced.
The governorship goes to Pontius Pilate.
When?
Very soon.
It's very much to our purpose.
Nothing is to the purpose if, when I come back to Judea, I come too late.
That is the thought which has punished me every moment I've spent here.
Will Rome see you again?
Here is a part of my life which you have made for me.
I shall remember it.
Whoever the gods are, they take small interest in an old man's hopes.
They have their way.
Forgive me.
You're a stranger here.
Would you be from Nazareth?
Why do you ask?
I thought you might be the one...
The one that I have come back from my country to find.
He would be about your age.
Who?
When I find him I shall know him.
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.
SHEIK:
Hyah!
Hyah!
Sack of flesh without brains!
No!
No!
Not the whip!
That is my host.
SHEIK:

Gently!
Fool!
Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood!
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run!
Go on!
SHEIK:
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!
Beautiful horses.
Now!
Now!
They are ready!
Let them go!
Watch.
They'll never hold the turn.
SHEIK:
No!
No!
Abadon, stop him!
Stop that whip!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill!
SHEIK:
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!
You think you can treat my horses like animals?
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!
Get off, idiot!
SHEIK:
Drive goats, not horses!
Now I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.
Hmm?
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.
Not a team?
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.
- Antares.
- The slow one?
SHEIK:
Uh-huh.
I think he should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?
In the circus in Rome.
You have driven in the great circus?
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.
No other animal has descended so in scale from the first innocent falling of the world.
[SHEIK CHUCKLES]
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.
Yes.
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.
Your coming here was so fit, so right.
We might have achieved wonders.
You have to go.
I make a journey which will not wait.
Well, then perhaps you will come back.
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.
I have no wives.
No wives at all?
I have six, no, seven.
BALTHASAR:
Ha, ha.
I've counted eight.
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.
- Someday, I hope to have one.
- One wife!
Ha, ha, one God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.
It is not generous.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
[BURPS]
- Was the food not to your liking?
- Indeed.
[BURPS]
Thank you.
Thank you.
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.
And now I must say good night to my beauties.
When they're ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.
- I'll make my farewells then.
- No, no, no, stay.
Stay and see them.
Come, my children.
Come.
Strangers make them shy.
Come.
Come, do not be afraid.
Come.
There, my children.
They are descended from the Arabians of the first Pharaohs and I have named them for the stars.
Come, Antares.
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.
[ANTARES WHINNIES]
What?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.
Come, Rigel.
We've both supped well, and the world is good.
[CHUCKLES]
There's my good Rigel.
Ah.
Yes, you are ready for sleep.
The day's work done for you, eh?
Ah.
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.
Good night.
Good night, my treasure.
Ah!
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.
No.
You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.
[CHUCKLES]
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.
You should see their mother, Mira.
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.
All right, all right.
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.
You must be strong and swift.
Go, my children.
Go.
When they reach Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams not to mention the champion of the East, Messala, with his black devils.
He stops at nothing to win.
- Messala?
In the circus?
- Yes.
You knew him?
I know him.
Perhaps without much liking.
Judah Ben-Hur, my people are praying for a man to drive their team to victory over Messala.
You could be that man, the one to stamp his arrogance into the sand.
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.
It's not possible.
That is a pity.
Think of it.
To break his pride to humble this tribune before the very people he has degraded.
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!
I know it is not possible.
Does it not delight your imagination?
Does it not answer your purpose?
I must deal with Messala in my own way.
And your way is to kill him.
I see this terrible thing in your eyes, Judah Ben-Hur.
But no matter what this man has done, you have no right to take his life.
He will be punished inevitably.
I don't believe in miracles.
But all life is a miracle.
Why will you not accept God's judgment?
You do not believe in miracles.
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness and a star led me to a village called Bethlehem where I found a newborn child in a manger.
And God lived in this child.
By now, he is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.
That is why I have returned here so that I may be at hand when he comes among us.
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.
Perhaps he's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.
Perhaps he is a shepherd a merchant, a fisherman.
But he lives and all our lives from now on will carry his mark.
There are many paths to God, my son.
I hope yours will not be too difficult.
I'm ready for sleep.
Balthasar is a good man but until all men are like him, we must keep our swords bright.
And our intention true.
So I must leave you.
One last thought.
There is no law in the arena.
Many are killed.
I hope to see you again.
MERCHANT:
Fine Damascus silk.
Fine Damascus silk.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Esther?
[ESTHER GASPS]
It's Judah.
[GASPS]
Judah.
- You are alive.
- Esther.
You are alive.
What are you doing here?
What has happened?
[ESTHER SOBBING]
Shh.
I'm here.
I'm with you.
Esther.
Where's your father?
Hmm?
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.
They tortured him.
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.
You never went back to Antioch?
No.
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.
Esther.
Where are my mother and sister?
SIMONIDES:
Esther.
Let me tell him first.
Father.
Father, something wonderful has happened.
- Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
- Judah.
He has come home.
He is here.
Judah.
Judah Ben-Hur.
My dear old friend.
Let me look at you.
Let me see you.
Yes, yes.
It is true.
Praise God for his mercy.
Where are they?
Since that terrible day there has been no word of them.
You should have been less loyal.
Do not pity me, Master Judah.
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.
We were released on the same day.
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.
Since then, I have been his tongue and he has been my legs.
Together, we make a considerable man.
Old friend.
She always said you would return.
She never gave up hope.
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.
I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.
But suppose that isn't possible.
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.
They could not make me tell them where it is.
It is there still to put power into our hands and buy death for the Romans.
That's not why I came back.
Judah, they are dead.
Four years.
No one could live so long in the dungeons.
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?
SIMONIDES:
Yes, it is true.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You have come back to us like a returning faith.
Judah, I should like to laugh again.
- Let us laugh.
- We will.
There will be joy again in this house.
We will celebrate among the dust.
[SOBBING]
I will take him.
We stood here before.
A long while ago.
Four years.
But now it seems as if only yesterday...
I was saying:
"If you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye."
"If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said."
I am not a bride.
Why did you never marry?
My father needed me.
And also...
It's still on my finger.
I said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.
It's become a part of my hand.
If Messala once knew you were here...
As he must.
He will know where they are.
And if you should find?
- If he should tell you they're dead...
- Then Messala will wish they were living.
I've seen too much of what hate can do.
My father is burned up with it.
But I've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater and love more powerful than hatred.
I believe it.
- Esther.
- Judah.
Stay alive.
Keep away from Messala.
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.
That time isn't yet come.
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.
This time you will be destroyed.
You'll die.
Tribune, compliments of Quintus Arrius.
He awaits your pleasure.
- Consul here?
- Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.
Thank him.
Bring him to me.
- I didn't know the consul had a son.
- He's a champion of the great circus.
Why is he here presenting me with gifts?
- Perhaps he'll race against you.
- Look.
It's magnificent.
And from a man I've never met.
You're wrong, Messala.
Judah.
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?
You were the magician, Messala.
You condemned me to the galleys.
When my ship was sunk, I saved the consul's life.
You know his seal?
Now I have come back as I swore I would.
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.
You suggest I use it on myself?
What has become of my mother and my sister?
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.
Find them, Messala.
Restore them to me, and I'll forget what I vowed with every stroke of that oar you chained me to.
I am not the governor of Judea.
I can do nothing without approval.
Then get it.
I will come back tomorrow.
Don't disappoint me, Messala.
What became of them?
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?
Go to the citadel, Drusus.
Find out.
- And if they're dead?
- They're dead!
"Miriam, wife.
Tirzah, daughter."
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?
East section lower level.
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.
PRISONER 1:
Water.
Water.
PRISONER 2:
Let me out!
PRISONER 3:
Hear us!
Hear us!
[POUNDING]
- How long since you've seen them?
- Never.
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.
The food disappears.
Lepers.
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.
Then we'll burn out the cell.
[COUGHING]
ESTHER:
Is someone there?
[RUSTLING]
There is someone there.
Who are you?
MIRIAM:
Don't come any closer.
Who are you?
Esther.
It's Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam?
MIRIAM:
Stay where you are.
You have come home.
MIRIAM:
Stand back, Esther.
We are lepers.
[GASPS]
Oh, Esther.
Tirzah.
Esther is Judah living?
Yes, he is alive.
He is here.
Where?
He is searching for you now.
I must find him and tell him.
MIRIAM:
No!
- Tell my father.
MIRIAM:
No.
Tell no one.
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.
We won't return.
But Judah has to be told.
MIRIAM:
No.
Please.
I couldn't see his face.
Is it changed?
No, he is not changed.
He...
He's not changed.
You love him, Esther.
Promise me on your love for him you will never tell him you've seen us.
Is he never to know?
Let him remember us as we were.
Promise me.
There's nothing else I can hope for.
Only this.
I promise you.
I am content.
Wait.
[CRIES]
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.
I pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.
He'll free them.
He wants to survive.
He cannot free them, Judah.
What do you mean?
- I saw them.
- You saw them?
Where?
When did you see them?
They were dead.
When?
When?
When?
In the prison.
When I was waiting for news of my father.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't tell you.
Nor even you, Father.
I was afraid that if you saw Messala...
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.
It's over now.
Over?
- Judah.
- Over?
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.
[SOBBING]
[MURMURING]
[MEN CHUCKLING]
SHEIK:
Gentlemen.
Officers.
Defenders of great Rome's imperium may I enter?
Certainly, sheik.
You do us an unexpected honor.
The noble tribune is most gracious.
And now, the question you're all asking yourselves:
Why am I here?
As you know, I am a gambling man.
The games approach.
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.
But I will back my own poor horses.
No limits?
MARIUS:
Mark me first!
- And me!
MATELLUS:
What odds?
- A moment, please my lords, protectors of the far flung marshes.
May I first, uh, sit down?
MARIUS:
Sit down.
Lie down.
How much will you wager?
- Yes, let's call his game.
SPINTHO:
Give the Arab a seat.
A bench, quickly.
Thank you.
- Now.
- One thousand denarii.
- Two thousand!
- Mark me!
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient.
There is time and money enough for all.
First, gentlemen, the odds.
The tribune has won many times.
The odds should be in the same measure.
Now, what is your pleasure, gentlemen?
MARIUS:
Two to one.
[SHEIK CHUCKLES]
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth where is the courage that made Rome master of the world?
I can get better odds on any street market.
MARIUS:
Three to one.
Let us not haggle.
Let us be fair.
In four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.
- In all truth...
- Just a moment.
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?
Oh.
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.
The Prince of Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur.
Prince of Hur?
[CHUCKLES]
- He was sent to the galleys years ago.
- He has returned.
Returned?
Impossible.
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.
Well?
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.
You, tribune will you give me four to one?
Four to one.
- Good.
- Bravo, Messala.
Four to one, sheik.
The difference between a Roman and a Jew.
Or an Arab.
[ROMANS LAUGH]
[CHUCKLES]
Bravely spoken.
Now we will settle the amount of our wager.
I will venture...
A thousand talents?
- A thousand talents?
- Yes, a thousand talents.
Of course, if it is too much...
A thousand talents it will be.
Agreed.
[MURMURING]
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.
You're good fellows.
If only men were this good.
Hey!
Remember, Altair nine times around the circus, huh?
Aldebaran.
Hey, ha, ha.
Rigel, did you hear?
Nine lives to live.
My swift fellow.
You must not win the race the first time around.
You win the last time around.
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.
Steady Antares.
Like a rock.
You will be our anchor.
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.
They have taken me into their family.
Rest well, my stars.
Tomorrow we go up to the city.
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it the news will scorch the streets of the whole Roman world.
Pontius Pilate here?
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.
You will make him see what men are born in this land.
I only know that I race against Messala.
ATTENDANT:
Look for the yoke.
Ease that strap.
BEN-HUR:
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.
Into your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as you will.
The Star of David.
To shine out for your people and my people together and blind the eyes of Rome.
[TRUMPETS PLAYING]
They are ready.
ATTENDANT:
Ready, off!
MAN:
Easy, girl, easy.
STARTER:
Number five.
Where is number five?
Whoa.
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.
Yes, this is the day.
SHEIK:
Judah!
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.
[TRUMPETS PLAYING]
Hail, Jupiter.
Give me victory.
[BRASS BAND PLAYING]
[CROWD CHEERING]
ATTENDANT:
Watch your line!
Keep your places!
MAN:
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.
Citizens I welcome you to these games in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.
We dedicate them to his glory and to the glory of Rome of which you are all part.
Let us honor those who race for us today.
They come here from Alexandria Messina Carthage Cyprus Rome Corinth Athens Phrygia and Judea.
[CROWD ROARS]
To the best of these, a crown of victory.
The race begins.
Hail, Caesar!
CROWD:
Hail, Caesar!
Oh, you dog!
Come, my children, come!
The Roman pig!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Steady!
Now, now!
[BAND PLAYING TRIUMPHANT MUSIC]
OFFICER:
Salute.
A great victory.
You are the people's one true god for the time being.
Permit us to worship.
I crown their god.
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.
A long life, young Arrius, and the good sense to live it.
[HEAVY BREATHING]
We cannot wait, tribune.
MESSALA:
He will come.
He will...
[COUGHS AND GASPS]
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.
He will come!
He will come.
I've sent for him, and he will come.
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.
Do you understand?
To hack the legs off me?
Not yet.
Not till I've seen him.
I don't receive him with half a body.
No.
No!
[MESSALA GRUNTING]
I told you, Drusus.
I told you.
Here he is.
Triumph c...
Triumph complete, Judah.
The race won.
The enemy destroyed.
I see no enemy.
What do you think you see?
The smashed body of a wretched animal?
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.
Let me help you.
[GROANS]
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.
Dead.
And the race over.
It isn't over, Judah.
They're not dead.
Where are they?
Look for them in the Valley of the Lepers if you can recognize them.
[BEN-HUR YELLS]
It goes on.
It goes on, Judah.
The race...
The race is not over.
Is there a way down here?
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.
Man.
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.
MAN:
There...
There are many women.
Of the family of Hur.
We have no names here.
For them?
- Why did you tell me they were dead?
- It was what they wanted.
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?
Not to see them?
They are coming.
Love them in the way they must need to be loved.
Not to look at them.
Let them be as if you had never come here.
Please!
Judah!
Is Judah well?
Is he happy?
ESTHER:
Yes, he is well.
Your mind can be at rest for him.
He is well, Miriam.
MIRIAM:
God be with you.
They have gone.
We can go back.
Go back to what?
Judah, they have one blessing left.
To think you remember them as they were and live your own life.
Forget what is here.
Forget?
It's as though they were alive in a grave.
- But what can you do?
- Undo what you've done.
How could you have suffered them to come here?
I must see them.
No, Judah, please!
Judah!
Think, Judah, think.
It would tear them apart if they see you.
Judah!
Judah.
He is here.
I have found him.
The child has become a man.
And the man, I know it now, is the son of God.
The promise is true.
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.
Life has been answered.
God has answered it.
Come.
Come with me.
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys thirst had nearly killed me.
A man gave me water to drink.
I went on living.
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.
No.
I am thirsty still.
Come and listen.
I have business with Rome.
You insist on death.
Goodbye, Judah.
You sent for me?
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.
- I honor him.
- As you may honor yourself.
You have been made a citizen of Rome.
Do you say nothing to this?
I have just come from the Valley of Stone where my mother and sister live what's left of their lives.
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.
I have heard this.
There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.
Where there is greatness, great government or power even great feeling or compassion error also is great.
We progress and mature by fault.
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.
There are other voices.
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place not to crucify yourself on a shadow such as old resentment or impossible loyalties.
Perfect freedom has no existence.
A grown man knows the world he lives in.
And for the present, the world is Rome.
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.
I am Judah Ben-Hur.
I cross this floor in spoken friendship as I would speak to Arrius.
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar ready to crush all those who challenge his authority.
There are too many small men of envy and ambition who try to disrupt the government of Rome.
You have become the victor and hero to those people.
They look to you, their one true god, as I called you.
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.
I am already part of this tragedy.
Return this to Arrius.
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you from personal disaster if you stay here.
You are too great a danger.
Leave Judea.
You have my word.
Judah!
Oh, Judah!
I was afraid you would never come back afraid of what would happen to you.
But I see you again.
Your father's waiting for me.
Where is he?
What do you mean to do?
Oh, Judah.
Rest, sleep.
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.
Peace?
Love and peace.
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?
Where do you see them?
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.
Balthasar's word.
He is more than Balthasar's word.
His voice traveled with such a still purpose.
It was more than a voice.
A man more than a man.
He said, "Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God."
Children of God?
In that dead valley where we left them?
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean until we have scoured off our bodies the crust and filth of being at the mercy of tyranny.
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.
- In blood?
- Yes, in blood!
I know there is a law in life.
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.
Death generates death as the vulture breeds the vulture.
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:
"Love your enemy.
Do good to those who despitefully use you."
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.
As you make us do now.
Are we to bear nothing together?
Even love?
I can hardly draw breath without feeling you in my heart.
But I know that everything I do from this moment will be as great a pain to you as you have ever suffered.
It is better not to love me.
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy giving evil for evil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.
It's as though you had become Messala.
I've lost you, Judah.
MIRIAM:
No further.
What are you doing here?
I was here last evening waiting for you.
I have waited all night.
What has happened?
Where is Tirzah?
Leave the food.
I am coming closer.
Don't be afraid.
- What are you doing?
- Don't be afraid.
I've heard him again, the man from Nazareth.
If ever words were from God, they are in everything he says.
I cannot bear that you should have never known this hand of quiet reaching towards us.
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find him there.
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find him.
[MIRIAM WHIMPERS]
Tirzah is dying.
Leave the food and go.
It's Judah.
Why did you tell him?
Yes, Judah, yes.
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.
Mother.
Wait, Mother, wait.
Let me talk with you.
MIRIAM:
Please.
No, no further.
Please.
No, Judah.
Son, no.
Mother, let me see Tirzah.
Tirzah is dying.
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know that life is everlasting and death is nothing to fear if you have faith.
I will take them to him.
[MIRIAM SHRIEKS]
No!
God, no!
[MIRIAM SOBBING]
No, no, dear son.
Mother where is Tirzah?
Judah, no.
You must not go to her, dear son.
Please.
Dear son.
I am afraid.
ESTHER:
No cause.
The world is more than we know.
[TIRZAH WHIMPERING]
Tirzah, it's Judah.
No.
No, Judah.
No, Judah.
No.
[TIRZAH SOBBING]
BEGGAR:
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
BEN-HUR:
Why are the streets deserted?
- They have gone to the trial.
- Alms for the blind?
- Trial?
Whose trial?
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.
- This cannot be true.
- Alms?
What has he done?
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.
Help for the blind.
WOMAN:
Look, lepers!
GIRL:
Lepers!
MAN 1:
Go away!
MAN 2:
Get away!
Stay away!
Go away!
[MURMURING]
Lepers!
Lepers!
How can this be?
I know this man.
Will someone help him?
TIRZAH:
Take pity on him.
WOMAN:
Have mercy.
Have mercy.
MIRIAM:
In his pain this look of peace.
Watch over them, Esther.
We must go back.
I brought you here to this when I hoped...
You haven't failed, Esther.
MAN:
Hail King of the Jews!
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.
He gave me water and a heart to live.
What has he done to merit this?
He has taken the world of our sins onto himself.
To this end he said he was born in that stable where I first saw him.
For this cause, he came into the world.
For this death?
This beginning.
I have lived too long.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
As though he were carrying in that cross the pain of the world.
So fearful, and yet why is it I'm not afraid anymore?
[THUNDER RUMBLES]
The shadow of a storm.
A strange darkness but still day.
[RUMBLING INTENSIFIES]
His life is over.
[WIND HOWLING]
[THUNDER CRASHING]
TIRZAH:
What is it?
This tearing.
I am in pain.
I feel it too.
Miriam.
I thought I...
Miriam.
Do you see your hand?
Tirzah.
Miriam.
Tirzah.
Almost at the moment he died I heard him say, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do."
- Even then.
- Even then.
And I felt his voice take the sword out of my hand.

Editat de B L I Z Z A R D cu Subtitle Workshop 2.03 pt. 23,976 frame-uri.
In the year of our Lord Judea, for nearly a century, had lain under the mastery of Rome.
In the seventh year of the reign of Augustus Caesar an imperial decree ordered every Judean each to return to his place of birth to be counted and taxed.
Converging ways of many of them led to their capital city, Jerusalem the troubled heart of their land.
The old city was dominated by the fortress of Antonia the seat of Roman power and by the great golden temple the outward sign of an inward and imperishable faith.
Even while they obeyed the will of Caesar the people clung proudly to their ancient heritage always remembering the promise of their prophets that one day there would be born among them a redeemer to bring them salvation and perfect freedom.
You'll be counted at Hebron.
- Name?
- Samuel.
- What city?
- Joppa.
- What family?
- Michael.
- Move on.
Move on.
- Yes.
- Name?
- Joseph.
- What city?
- Nazareth.
- What family?
- David of Bethlehem.
And the woman?
My wife.
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.
Come on, come on.
What village is this?
Nazareth.
We should arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow night.
You're not watching the soldiers, Joseph?
We've seen Romans before.
Yes and we will see them again.
My table is not finished.
Where is your son?
He's walking in the hills.
He neglects his work, Joseph.
No.
Once, I reproached him with forgetting his work.
He said to me:
"I must be about my father's business."
Then why isn't he here, working?
He's working.
Trumpeters of the legion!
Welcome, Messala.
The command is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for relieving me.
Drusus when I was a boy, I dreamed of commanding this garrison.
Now the wheel has turned.
I am in command.
Attention!
Aisle one, face right!
Forward!
I'd forgotten the heat.
If it were only the heat.
I lived here until I was 14.
Jerusalem was my home.
- My father was head of...
- Yes, I know.
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.
If there can be such a thing in this forsaken land.
If you want to rise, Sextus, do the difficult.
I asked to be sent here.
You'll find the people changed since you were a boy.
In what way?
Oh, won't pay their taxes, an irrational resentment of Rome...
There's nothing new in all that.
And then there's religion.
I tell you, they're drunk with religion.
They smash the statues of our gods, even those of the emperor.
Punish them.
We do.
When we can find them.
Find the leaders.
You don't know.
There's nothing you can put your finger on.
There are strange forces at work here.
This "messiah" business...
I know.
There was one predicted when I was a boy.
A king of the Jews, who will lead them into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.
Makes your head spin.
There's a wild man in the desert named John who drowns people in water.
And a carpenter's son who does magic tricks. "Miracles" they call them.
There's always a rabble-rouser stirring up trouble.
No, no, no.
This man is different.
He teaches that God is near, in every man.
It's actually quite profound, some of it.
You've been too long away from Rome.
Go back, Sextus.
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea and forget that God is in every man.
- There is divinity in only one man.
- Yes, I know.
The emperor is displeased.
He wishes Judea made into a more obedient and disciplined province.
He's ordered me to restore order.
I shall carry out his wishes.
How?
You can break a man's skull, arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.
But how do you control this?
How do you fight an idea?
Especially a new idea.
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.
I assume he has a name.
- He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
- Then treat him like one!
Tell him I will join him.
Yes, tribune.
Centurion!
This was his country before it was ours.
Don't forget that.
Yes, tribune.
Very wise.
This Ben-Hur is the richest man in Jerusalem.
And the head of one of the greatest families in Judea.
We were friends as boys.
We were like brothers.
Sextus you ask how to fight an idea.
Well, I'll tell you how.
With another idea.
I said I'd come back.
I never thought you would.
I'm so glad.
- Look at you.
- Look at you!
You've come back a tribune.
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.
We'll drink another now.
- Your sister and mother?
- They're fine.
They've talked of you ever since we knew you were coming.
- Is Tirzah married?
- No.
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.
She's been in love with you since she was 5.
I can't wait to see them.
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?
Or have you become too dignified?
- Down Eros, up Mars!
- Down Eros, up Mars!
Where the beams cross?
Good.
After all these years!
Still close.
In every way.
I hope so.
I know.
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew whose life you once saved.
The best thing I ever did.
Judah it will be very difficult to govern here.
I'm going to need help.
Your help.
Your advice.
- You want my advice?
- Yes, I do.
Withdraw your legions.
Give us our freedom.
Unfortunately, the emperor is devoted to his empire.
He's particularly fond of Judea.
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.
Is there anything so sad as unrequited love?
My quarters.
A bit grim.
Not grim.
Austere.
Virtuous.
Roman.
I'm going to be second-in-command to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.
He's coming in a few days with more legions.
Then the rumors are true.
The emperor does not approve of your countrymen.
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.
But you and your family need have no concern.
I'm next in authority to the governor, and you're my friend.
- I'm a Jew.
- Ah, you are like a Roman!
What have you in common with the troublemaking rabble?
- They're my people.
I'm one of them.
- Be wise, Judah.
It's a Roman world.
If you want to live in it, you must become part of it.
You've changed.
I've grown up.
I've seen the world since I left Jerusalem.
I've seen Rome.
It's no accident that one small village on the Tiber was chosen to rule the world.
Your legions.
It wasn't just our legions.
Other countries have armies, fine armies.
I know, I fought them.
Oh, no.
No, it was fate that chose us to civilize the world.
And we have.
Our roads and ships connect every corner of the earth.
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.
I believe in the future of my people.
Of course you do.
And you can help them.
How?
You're an aristocrat.
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince to your people.
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.
They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.
Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.
It is worse than stupid, futile!
For it can end in only one way, extinction for your people!
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.
Then we're agreed!
Now, when can I come to see your family?
- We had hoped tomorrow.
- Good.
And now for our toast.
It's dreadful wine, by the way.
It's especially fermented for the Roman army.
You're very cruel to your conquerors.
It's an insane world.
But in it there is one sanity:
The loyalty of old friends.
Judah, we must believe in one another.
Will you drink to that?
With all my heart.
Here it is, the place I've remembered.
The court where we played at changing the guard.
The roof where we'd throw pebbles at people in the street and then hide.
- We were rascals, weren't we?
- No, you were good boys.
I would have that time again.
And here it is.
Nothing has changed.
Except for the fountain.
- The old well would go dry, remember?
- Promptly, every summer.
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.
- He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
- No?
Of course he has.
He was a boy when he left us, now he's a man.
With great responsibilities.
Come.
The emperor builds and builds, turning brick to marble.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.
I've never seen anything like this before.
It's beautiful!
- Is it Roman?
- It's Libyan.
I was there last year.
A tremendous campaign.
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.
Or was, till we destroyed it.
Now it's nothing but ashes.
I'm boring you with soldier stories.
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.
Thank you for this.
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.
What do you think of it?
Magnificent.
It's Arabic.
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.
Let me try him sometime.
Whenever you like.
He's yours.
Do you mean you'll give me this?
Oh, Judah.
You are good.
It's going to be like old times, I know it.
Judah, tell me, did you think about what I said?
Yes.
Talked to a number of people already.
Spoken against violence, against incidents.
Most of the men agree with me.
Most?
Not all?
No, not all.
Who does not agree?
Well, the resentful, the impatient.
Who are they?
Yes, Judah.
Who are they?
Would I retain your friendship if I became an informer?
Telling the names of criminals is not informing.
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.
Patriots?
!
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.
This is my great opportunity, and yours too.
If I bring order here, I can have any post I want.
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?
Rome!
Yes, perhaps at the side of Caesar himself.
I mean it.
It can happen and this is the moment.
I swear, this is the time.
The emperor is watching us, judging us.
All I need do is serve him.
And all you need do is help me serve him.
- You speak as if he were God.
- He is God.
The only God.
He is power, real power on earth, not...
Not that.
Help me, Judah.
I would do anything for you, Messala except betray my own people.
In the name of all the gods, what do the lives of a few Jews mean to you?
If I cannot persuade them, that does not mean I would help you murder them.
Besides, you must understand this, Messala.
I believe in the past and future of my people.
Future?
You are a conquered people.
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?
Joshua will not rise again to save you nor David.
There is only one reality in the world today.
Look to the West.
Don't be a fool!
Look to Rome!
Better a fool than a traitor or a killer.
- I am a soldier.
- Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.
- I warn you...
- No!
I warn you.
Rome is an affront to God.
Rome is strangling my people and my country, the whole earth!
But not forever.
And I tell you, the day Rome falls there will be a shout of freedom such as the world has never heard before.
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.
You're either for me or against me.
If that is the choice then I am against you.
There they are.
Where's Messala?
- Where's...?
- He's gone.
Gone?
- But why?
- He couldn't stay.
- What happened?
- A new tribune must have many duties.
Come.
Let us have dinner.
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the world who bringeth to us bread from the earth.
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.
He wanted to use me to betray our people.
- Master, the caravan from Antioch.
- Yes, Amrah, I saw.
Simonides.
- Oh, welcome homecoming.
- Master.
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.
And for the master, lberian wine.
Not to mention the best gift of all, your presence.
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.
- Caravans from Petra.
- Have all arrived.
- Good.
- Here is the accounting.
And what of Numidia?
The trade route is ours, guaranteed by treaty with the king.
Once a year, you bring your accounting.
And once a year, I find myself wealthier.
Yeah, but my greatest treasure is my steward.
My life belongs to the House of Hur.
Nothing else exists for me, except my daughter.
- She must be a young woman by now.
- Yes, and your property.
She was born the daughter of your slave.
When I inherited you, I inherited a friend, not a slave.
Still, Esther has come with me from Antioch for your permission to marry.
It's granted.
I wish you the joy of many grandchildren.
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.
With your permission, Esther wishes to speak to her master.
You're eager to marry, Esther?
It is my father's wish.
Your husband will be fortunate.
What is his name?
David, son of Mathias.
Of what house?
- His own, master.
- He is a freeman.
Tell me more about him.
I have seen him only once.
He is a merchant, well-thought-of in Antioch.
He will pay for Esther's freedom.
Her freedom will be my wedding gift to Esther.
You are generous, master.
Do you love this man?
I will learn to love him.
You have my permission to marry.
We'll drink to your happiness.
And a safe return to Antioch.
I disturbed you.
No.
What were you thinking?
I was saying goodbye to this city and this house.
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?
My father sometimes brought me here when I was little.
It was a house where I was always happy.
Except once.
When you and your friend, the Roman boy...
- Messala.
- Yes.
You had been out hunting and they brought you home injured.
I touched your face as you lay there and prayed to God, "Don't let this boy die."
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.
Yes, master.
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.
It's strange.
I hardly felt a slave.
And now I hardly feel free.
You know, in the old, wise days of Solomon if there was among his slaves some girl who filled his eyes he could choose her out from the rest and take her to him.
Wise days of Solomon.
Different days.
And long ago.
If you were not a bride I should kiss you goodbye.
If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said.
Your slave ring.
Fair exchange.
Freedom to you.
The ring to me.
You will wear it?
Until you meet the woman you will marry?
Until then.
The gods favor my lord Gratus.
If it is the governor's pleasure, the wreath of office.
Thank you, tribune.
I see no delegation from the city.
- There will not be one, sir.
- No?
Jerusalem's welcome will not be a warm one.
But I pledge, my lord, it will be a quiet one.
Let us proceed.
There's Messala.
He saw you, Judah.
The new governor.
Stand back!
- Stand back.
- You, come!
Had to be the Jews!
Open up in the name of the divine emperor!
Judah!
Tirzah!
What is it?
What's happened?
Open up in the name of the law!
- I was watching the...
- A tile fell and struck the governor.
- It wasn't my fault.
- They won't believe her.
She won't have to say anything.
You hear?
Tirzah, say nothing.
Open the gates!
I'll speak to them.
- Arrest him!
- Let me tell you what happened.
- Hold those women.
- Stop them!
It was an accident.
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.
- This is the man, sir.
We saw him.
- It was an accident.
- Accident?
- I swear it.
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose.
It gave way.
Take him.
Take all of them.
- He's telling the truth!
- It was me!
Let them go!
Attention!
Messala.
In the name of God, tell them it's a mistake.
I leaned on the tile, and it broke loose.
It was an accident.
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!
Let the servants go.
Let them go.
Return to your ranks.
Come.
Where?
Tirus.
Tirus?
I've had no trial.
I'm to die in the galleys without even a trial?
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!
Wait.
My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?
Tie his hands.
- At least tell me if they're safe.
- I can tell you nothing.
Get along.
Keep moving.
Jailer!
Guard, in there!
Up the stairs!
Jailer!
Jailer!
To the right.
- Wait!
- Send them out.
Go!
The door.
Where are my mother and sister?
Where are they?
Here, within these walls.
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.
Of course, they will be sentenced.
Is it possible?
Is it possible you could do this to us?
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?
You will let them go.
You will gladly let them go!
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not a murderer!
I know you're not.
You know?
You are evil.
No, Judah, I am not evil.
I wanted your help.
Now you've given it to me.
By making this example of you, I discourage treason.
By condemning without hesitation an old friend, I shall be feared.
But not my family.
Let them go.
Please.
- Messala, I beg you.
- Beg?
!
Didn't I beg you?
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.
Kill me, and your mother and sister will die nailed to crosses in front of you!
Go on, Judah.
Kill me!
May God grant me vengeance.
I will pray that you live till I return.
Return?
Take him.
Sentries, salute.
The tribune will see you now.
Tribune, I'm steward of the House of Hur.
I remember you.
We were on our way to Antioch when we heard what had happened.
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done this thing.
You knew him, tribune.
Better than you.
Then there must be no doubt in your mind, the charge is groundless.
The prisoners have been sentenced.
- Sentenced?
- But there's no truth in it.
There was never a threat against the governor in Judah's mind.
Surely you must know he would never have done this.
In your heart, you must know it.
Drusus.
This man had better be kept here until we can question him.
Hold!
Water for the soldiers.
Soldiers first!
Get away from that well.
No water for them!
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!
Come on, you!
Water for the horses!
- Water.
Water.
- Soldiers first!
Here.
Wait.
No water for him.
God help me.
You!
I said no water for him!
All right, on your feet, all of you!
Get them on their feet!
Back in line, you dog!
On your feet!
Get them going!
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!
Forward, you dogs!
Soon, the counselor's barge will be coming alongside.
Be ready to raise oars.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.
- How many rowers?
- Two hundred, consul.
- And reliefs?
- Of 30, every hour.
This man is ill.
Replace him.
- Change him.
- Right, sir.
- This man's been giving you trouble?
- He's insubordinate, consul.
That will stop.
What service have you seen?
Forty-one.
A month's less a day in this ship.
You keep an exact account.
And before?
Three years in other ships.
Three years.
You have the spirit to fight back but the good sense to control it.
Your eyes are full of hate, 41.
That's good.
Hate keeps a man alive.
It gives him strength.
Now, listen to me, all of you.
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
So row well and live.
- Ship ready, consul.
- Strike oars.
Strike oars!
You know a fleet of Macedonian galleys has been raiding Roman commerce.
The emperor has honored us with the task of seeking out and destroying them.
Battle speed, hortator.
Battle speed!
Attack speed.
Attack speed!
Ramming speed.
Ramming speed!
Rest.
Halt!
Rest!
Why are you here?
I was ordered to report to you during my relief.
Oh, yes.
I'd forgotten.
You could have killed me as I lay there.
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?
I'm not ready to die.
What do you think will save you?
The God of my fathers.
Your God has forsaken you.
He has no more power than the images I pray to.
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.
I might.
Does that interest you, 41?
I can see that it does.
I'm a fighting man by profession, and in my leisure moments it amuses me to train fighting men.
I own some of the best gladiators and charioteers in Rome.
Would you like to become one of them?
To die as your slave?
Better than to live in chains below these decks.
I will not be here forever.
No?
What would you do if you escaped?
Two people were condemned with me, my mother and sister though they were innocent.
I won't rest...
Do not say that you were innocent.
- Would it do any good to say it again?
- No.
Consider my offer carefully.
You will never escape while we are victorious.
If we are not, you will sink with this ship, chained to your oar.
I cannot believe that God has let me live these years to die chained to an oar.
It's a strange, stubborn faith you keep to believe that existence has a purpose.
A sane man would have learned to lose it long before this.
As you have.
What drove it out of you?
Go back to your oar, 41.
Consul, enemy sighted.
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.
All the watch to battle posts.
- Stand by to load.
- Make ready to fire.
Hurry, quick!
Hurry up with that resin.
Get some more ammunition.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
Chain rowers!
Guard.
Unlock 41.
No!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
41, why did he do that?
I don't know.
Once before, a man helped me.
I didn't know why then.
Normal speed!
Number 1, flame.
Fire.
Fire!
Fire!
Hold withdrawal on command.
Lift oars!
Raise!
Withdraw!
Steersman, right.
Extend oars!
Fire!
- Watch out!
- Fire!
Steersman, ram course!
Order below!
- Ramming speed!
- Ramming speed!
Consul, barge on ramming course.
We're going to be rammed!
We're going to be rammed!
Why did you save me?
Why did you have me unchained?
What is your name, 41?
Judah Ben-Hur. ...let me die.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
Row well and live.
Is the sail square?
I can't tell.
Better for us both if it's the enemy.
My death.
Your freedom.
It's a Roman sail.
Face rear!
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.
Water.
The fleet, all lost?
Five galleys.
- And the battle?
- The battle was won.
You have a victory.
- It was a victory?
- Complete.
In His eagerness to save you your God has also saved the Roman fleet.
Hail Arrius!
Right oars!
You have cleared the seaways of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.
This baton of victory has been nobly won.
This man riding beside you, who is he?
The man who saved me, divine emperor, to return and serve you.
Is that all you know about him?
No.
He was accused of an attack on the governor of Judea.
But he was innocent.
If not, there's a strange inconsistency in this man who tries to kill my governor, yet saves the life of my consul.
Come tomorrow.
We'll talk of it.
We have all the information on this man a man of some influence in his own country.
His attack upon our governor is one upon the senate and the people of Rome.
I am convinced that no such attack was intended.
Consul, allow us to continue.
Allow us to be generous.
As a reward to you for your great victory we shall not send him back to the galleys.
Take him as your slave.
Such is the will of the senate and the people of Rome.
Not long ago, I returned to Rome with a young man who had saved my life.
You all know him as the finest charioteer in Rome.
Five times, he's driven my horses to victory.
I know him as one who stands in the place of the son I lost.
I have the love and pride in a son's achievements which I thought I should never have again.
Nothing could make stronger our bond but tonight I wish to share it with you all.
The formalities of adoption have been completed.
Young Arrius is now the legal bearer of my name and the heir to my property.
This ring of my ancestors would have gone to my son.
So now it is yours.
It's a strange destiny that brought me to a new life a new home a new father.
It brought me here.
It may take me away.
But wherever I may be I shall always try to wear this ring as a son of Arrius should.
With gratitude and affection and with honor.
My old friend Pontius Pilate, young Arrius.
Before you came to this city, my horses always won.
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.
Yes, but not swift enough to defeat you.
- Tell me, you come from Judea?
- Yes, sir.
I hear that the climate is difficult to live in.
Not for Judeans.
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.
- Of Judea?
- Yes.
I asked for Alexandria.
But it seems the wilderness needs my particular talents.
The scorpions and holy prophets can't get on without me.
Lay the dust of Judea, at least for this evening.
Goats and Jehovah.
You're leaving.
I must.
It's a journey I can't keep you from.
Your eyes have never left it all these months.
I can recognize pain.
But still, my counsel is to wait.
Gratus is to be replaced.
The governorship goes to Pontius Pilate.
When?
Very soon.
It's very much to our purpose.
Nothing is to the purpose if, when I come back to Judea, I come too late.
That is the thought which has punished me every moment I've spent here.
Will Rome see you again?
Here is a part of my life which you have made for me.
I shall remember it.
Whoever the gods are, they take small interest in an old man's hopes.
They have their way.
Forgive me.
You're a stranger here.
Would you be from Nazareth?
Why do you ask?
I thought you might be the one...
The one that I have come back from my country to find.
He would be about your age.
Who?
When I find Him I shall know Him.
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.
Sack of flesh without brains!
No!
No!
Not the whip!
That is my host.
Gently!
Gently!
Fool!
Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood.
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run!
Go on!
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!
Beautiful horses.
Now!
Now!
They are ready!
Let them go!
Watch.
They'll never hold the turn.
No!
No!
Abadon, stop him!
Stop that whip!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill...!
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!
You think you can treat my horses like animals?
!
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!
Get off, idiot!
Drive goats, not horses!
I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.
Not a team?
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.
- Antares.
- The slow one?
He should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?
In the circus in Rome.
You have driven in the great circus?
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.
No other animal has descended so in scale from the first innocent falling of the world.
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.
Yes.
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.
Your coming here was so fit, so right.
We might have achieved wonders!
You have to go.
I make a journey which will not wait.
Ah, well, then perhaps you will come back.
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.
I have no wives.
No wives at all?
I have six, no, seven.
I've counted eight.
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.
- Someday, I hope to have one.
- One wife!
One God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.
It is not generous.
- Was the food not to your liking?
- Indeed.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.
And now I must say good night to my beauties.
When ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.
- I'll make my farewells then.
- No, no, no, stay.
Stay and see them.
Come, my children.
Come.
Strangers make them shy.
Come.
Come, do not be afraid.
Come.
There, my children.
They are descended from the Arabians of the Pharaohs and I have named them for the stars.
Come, Antares.
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.
What?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.
Come, Rigel.
We've both supped well, and the world is good.
There's my good Rigel.
Yes, you are ready for sleep.
The day's work done for you, eh?
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.
Good night.
Good night, my treasure.
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.
No.
You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.
You should see their mother, Mira.
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.
All right, all right.
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.
You must be strong and swift.
Go, my children.
Go.
At Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams and the champion of the East, Messala, with his black devils.
He stops at nothing to win.
- Messala?
In the circus?
- Yes.
You knew him?
I know him.
Perhaps without much liking.
My people are praying for a man to drive their team to victory over Messala.
You could be that man, the one to stamp his arrogance into the sand.
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.
It's not possible.
That is a pity.
Think of it.
To break his pride to humble this tribune before the very people he has degraded.
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!
I know it is not possible.
Does it not delight your imagination?
Does it not answer your purpose?
I must deal with Messala in my own way.
And your way is to kill him.
I see this terrible thing in your eyes.
But no matter what this man has done, you have no right to kill him.
He will be punished inevitably.
I don't believe in miracles.
But all life is a miracle.
Why will you not accept God's judgment?
You do not believe in miracles.
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness and a star led me to a village called Bethlehem where I found a newborn child in a manger.
And God lived in this child.
By now, He is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.
That is why I have returned here so that I may be at hand when He comes among us.
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.
Perhaps He's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.
Perhaps He is a shepherd a merchant, a fisherman.
But He lives and all our lives from now on will carry His mark.
There are many paths to God, my son.
I hope yours will not be too difficult.
I'm ready for sleep.
Balthasar is a good man but until all men are like him, we must keep our swords bright.
And our intention true.
So I must leave you.
One last thought.
There is no law in the arena.
Many are killed.
I hope to see you again.
Fine Damascus silk.
Fine Damascus silk.
Esther?
It's Judah.
You are alive.
You are alive.
What are you doing here?
What has happened?
I'm here.
I'm with you.
Where's your father?
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.
They tortured him.
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.
You never went back to Antioch?
No.
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.
Where are my mother and sister?
Let me tell him first.
Father.
Father, something wonderful has happened.
Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
He has come home.
He is here.
Judah.
Judah Ben-Hur.
My dear old friend.
Let me look at you.
Let me see you.
Yes, yes.
It is true.
Praise God for His mercy.
Where are they?
Since that terrible day there has been no word of them.
You should have been less loyal.
Do not pity me, Master Judah.
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.
We were released on the same day.
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.
Since then, I have been his tongue and he has been my legs.
Together, we make a considerable man.
Old friend.
She always said you would return.
She never gave up hope.
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.
I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.
But suppose that isn't possible.
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.
They could not make me tell them where it is.
It is there still to put power into our hands and buy death for the Romans.
That's not why I came back.
Judah, they are dead.
Four years.
No one could live so long in the dungeons.
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?
Yes, it is true.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You have come back to us like a returning faith.
Judah, I should like to laugh again.
- Let us laugh.
- We will.
There will be joy again in this house.
We will celebrate among the dust.
I will take him.
We stood here before.
A long while ago.
Four years.
But now it seems as if only yesterday...
I was saying:
"If you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye."
"If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said."
I am not a bride.
Why did you never marry?
My father needed me.
And also...
It's still on my finger.
I said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.
It's become a part of my hand.
If Messala once knew you were here...
As he must.
He will know where they are.
And if you should find...?
- If he says they're dead...
- Messala will wish they were living.
I've seen too much of what hate can do.
My father is burned up with it.
But I've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater and love more powerful than hatred.
I believe it.
- Esther.
- Judah.
Stay alive.
Keep away from Messala.
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.
That time isn't yet come.
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.
This time you will be destroyed.
You'll die.
Tribune, compliments of Quintus Arrius.
He awaits your pleasure.
- Consul here?
- Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.
Thank him.
Bring him to me.
- I didn't know the consul had a son.
- He's a champion of the great circus.
Why is he presenting me with gifts?
- Perhaps he'll race against you.
- Look.
It's magnificent.
And from a man I've never met.
You're wrong, Messala.
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?
You were the magician, Messala.
You condemned me to the galleys.
When my ship was sunk, I saved the consul's life.
You know his seal?
Now I have come back as I swore I would.
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.
You suggest I use it on myself?
What has become of my mother and my sister?
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.
Find them, Messala.
Restore them to me, and I'll forget what I vowed with every stroke of that oar you chained me to.
I am not the governor.
I can do nothing without approval.
Then get it.
I will come back tomorrow.
Don't disappoint me, Messala.
What became of them?
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?
Go to the citadel, Drusus.
Find out.
- And if they're dead?
- They're dead!
"Miriam, wife.
Tirzah, daughter."
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?
E section lower level.
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.
Water.
Water.
Let me out!
- How long since you've seen them?
- Never.
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.
The food disappears.
Lepers.
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.
Then we'll burn out the cell.
Is someone there?
There is someone there.
Who are you?
Don't come any closer.
Who are you?
Esther.
It's Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam?
Stay where you are.
You have come home.
Stand back, Esther.
We are lepers.
Oh, Esther.
Tirzah.
Esther is Judah living?
Yes, he is alive.
He is here.
Where?
He is searching for you now.
I must find him and tell him.
- No!
- Tell my father.
No.
Tell no one.
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.
We won't return.
Judah has to be told.
No.
Please.
I couldn't see his face.
Is it changed?
No, he is not changed.
He's not changed.
You love him, Esther.
Promise me on your love for him you will never tell him you've seen us.
Is he never to know?
Let him remember us as we were.
Promise me.
There's nothing else I can hope for.
Only this.
I promise.
I am content.
Wait.
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.
I pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.
He'll free them.
He wants to survive.
He cannot free them, Judah.
What do you mean?
I saw them.
You saw them?
Where?
When did you see them?
They were dead.
They were dead.
When?
When?
When?
!
In the prison.
When I was waiting for news of my father.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't tell you.
Nor even you, Father.
I was afraid that if you saw Messala...
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.
It's over now.
Over?
- Judah.
- Over?
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.
Gentlemen.
Officers.
Defenders of great Rome's imperium may I enter?
Certainly, sheik.
You do us an unexpected honor.
The noble tribune is most gracious.
And now the question you're asking:
Why am I here?
As you know, I am a gambling man.
The games approach.
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.
I will back my own poor horses.
No limits?
- Mark me first!
- And me!
- What odds?
- A moment, please my lords, protectors of the far flung marshes.
May I first sit down?
Sit.
How much will you wager?
- Yes, let's call his game.
- Give the Arab a seat.
A bench, quickly.
Thank you.
- Now.
- 1000 denarii.
- 2000!
- Mark me!
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient.
There is time.
First gentlemen, the odds.
The tribune has won many times.
The odds should be in the same measure.
What is your pleasure, gentlemen?
Two to one.
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth where is the courage that made Rome master of the world?
I can get better odds on any street market.
Three to one.
Let us not haggle.
Let us be fair.
In four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.
- In all truth...
- Just a moment.
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.
The Prince of Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur.
Prince of Hur?
- He was sent to the galleys years ago.
- He has returned.
Returned?
Impossible.
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.
Well?
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.
You, tribune will you give me four to one?
Four to one.
Good.
Four to one, sheik.
The difference between a Roman and a Jew.
Or an Arab.
Bravely spoken.
Now we will settle the amount of our wager.
I will venture...
A thousand talents?
- A thousand talents?
- Yes, a thousand talents.
Of course, if it is too much...
A thousand talents it will be.
Agreed.
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.
You're good fellows.
If only men were this good.
Remember, Altair nine times around the circus.
Aldebaran.
Rigel, did you hear?
Nine lives to live.
My swift fellow.
You must not win the race the first time around.
You win the last time around.
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.
Steady Antares.
Like a rock.
You will be our anchor.
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.
They have taken me into their family.
Rest well, my stars.
Tomorrow we go up to the city.
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it the news will scorch the streets of the Roman world.
Pontius Pilate here?
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.
You will make him see what men are born in this land.
I only know that I race against Messala.
Look for the yoke.
Ease that strap.
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.
Into Your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as You will.
The Star of David.
To shine out for your people and my people together and blind the eyes of Rome.
They are ready.
Easy, girl, easy.
Number five.
Where is number five?
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.
Yes, this is the day.
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.
Hail, Jupiter.
Give me victory.
Watch your line!
Keep your places!
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.
Citizens I welcome you to these games in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.
We dedicate them to his glory and to the glory of Rome of which you are all part.
Let us honor those who race for us today.
They come here from Alexandria Messina Carthage Cyprus Rome Corinth Athens Phrygia and Judea.
To the best of these, a crown of victory.
The race begins.
Hail, Caesar!
Come, my children, come!
The Roman pig!
Salute.
A great victory.
You are the people's one true god for the time being.
Permit us to worship.
I crown their god.
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.
A long life, young Arrius and the good sense to live it.
We cannot wait, tribune.
He will come.
He will...
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.
He will come!
He will come.
I've sent for him, and he will come.
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.
Do you understand?
To hack the legs off me?
Not yet.
Not till I've seen him.
I don't receive him with half a body.
No!
I told you, Drusus.
I told you.
Here he is.
Triumph complete, Judah.
The race won.
The enemy destroyed.
I see no enemy.
What do you think you see?
The smashed body of a wretched animal?
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.
Let me help you.
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.
Dead.
And the race over.
It isn't over, Judah.
They're not dead.
Where are they?
Where are they?
Look for them in the Valley of the Lepers if you can recognize them.
It goes on.
It goes on, Judah.
The race...
The race is not over.
Is there a way down here?
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.
Man.
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.
There are many women.
Of the family of Hur.
We have no names here.
For them?
- Why did you say they were dead?
- It was what they wanted.
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?
Not to see them?
They are coming.
Love them in the way they must need to be loved.
Not to look at them.
Let them be as if you had never come here.
Please!
Is Judah well?
Is he happy?
Yes, he is well.
Your mind can be at rest for him.
He is well, Miriam.
God be with you.
They have gone.
We can go back.
Go back to what?
Judah, they have one blessing left.
To think you remember them as they were and live your own life.
Forget what is here.
Forget?
It's as though they're alive in a grave.
- But what can you do?
- Undo what you've done.
How could you have suffered them to come here?
I must see them.
No, Judah, please!
Judah!
Think, Judah, think.
It would tear them apart if they see you.
He is here.
I have found Him.
The child has become a man.
And the man, I know it now, is the Son of God.
The promise is true.
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.
Life has been answered.
God has answered it.
Come.
Come with me.
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys thirst had nearly killed me.
A man gave me water to drink.
I went on living.
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.
No.
I am thirsty still.
Come and listen.
I have business with Rome.
You insist on death.
Goodbye, Judah.
You sent for me?
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.
- I honor him.
- As you may honor yourself.
You have been made a citizen of Rome.
Do you say nothing to this?
I have just come from the Valley of Stone where my mother and sister live what's left of their lives.
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.
I have heard this.
There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.
Where there is greatness, great government or power even great feeling or compassion error also is great.
We progress and mature by fault.
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.
There are other voices.
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place not to crucify yourself on a shadow such as old resentment or impossible loyalties.
Perfect freedom has no existence.
A grown man knows the world he lives in.
And for the present, the world is Rome.
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.
I am Judah Ben-Hur.
I cross this floor in spoken friendship as I would speak to Arrius.
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar ready to crush those who challenge his authority.
There are too many men of envy and ambition who try to disrupt the government of Rome.
You have become the victor and hero to those people.
They look to you, their one true god, as I call you.
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.
I am already part of this tragedy.
Return this to Arrius.
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you from personal disaster if you stay here.
You are too great a danger.
Leave Judea.
You have my word.
I was afraid you would never come back afraid of what would happen to you.
But I see you again.
Your father's waiting for me.
Where is he?
What do you mean to do?
Rest, sleep.
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.
Peace?
Love and peace.
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?
Where do you see them?
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.
Balthasar's word.
He is more than Balthasar's word.
His voiced traveled with such a still purpose.
It was more than a voice.
A man more than a man.
He said, "Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy."
"Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God."
Children of God?
In that dead valley where we left them?
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean until we have scoured off our bodies the crust and filth of being at the mercy of tyranny.
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.
- In blood?
- Yes, in blood!
I know there is a law in life.
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.
Death generates death as the vulture breeds the vulture.
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:
"Love your enemy."
"Do good to those who despitefully use you."
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.
As you make us do now.
Are we to bear nothing together?
Even love?
I can hardly draw breath without feeling you in my heart.
But I know that everything I do from this moment bears greater pain than you have ever suffered.
It is better not to love me.
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy giving evil for evil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.
It's as though you had become Messala.
I've lost you, Judah.
No further.
What are you doing here?
I was here last evening waiting for you.
I have waited all night.
What has happened?
Where is Tirzah?
Leave the food.
I am coming closer.
Don't be afraid.
- What are you doing?
- Don't be afraid.
I've heard Him again, the man from Nazareth.
If ever words were from God, they are in everything He says.
I cannot bear that you should have never known this hand of quiet reaching towards us.
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find Him there.
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find Him.
Tirzah is dying.
Leave the food and go.
It's Judah.
Why did you tell him?
Yes, Judah, yes.
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.
Mother.
Wait, Mother, wait.
Let me talk with you.
Please.
No, no further.
Please.
No, Judah.
Son, no.
Mother, let me see Tirzah.
Tirzah is dying.
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know that life is everlasting and death is nothing to fear if you have faith.
I will take them to Him.
No!
God, no!
No, no, dear son.
Mother where is Tirzah?
Judah, no.
Judah, no.
You must not go to her, dear son.
Please.
Dear son.
I am afraid.
No cause.
The world is more than we know.
Tirzah, it's Judah.
No, Judah.
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
- Why are the streets deserted?
- They have gone to the trial.
Trial?
Whose trial?
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.
- This cannot be true.
- Alms?
What has he done?
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.
Help for the blind.
- Look, lepers!
- Lepers!
Get away!
Stay away!
Go away!
Lepers!
Lepers!
How can this be?
I know this man.
Will someone help Him?
Take pity on Him.
Have mercy.
In His pain this look of peace.
Watch over them, Esther.
We must go back.
I brought you here to this when I hoped...
You haven't failed, Esther.
Hail King of the Jews!
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.
He gave me water and a heart to live.
What has He done to merit this?
He has taken the world of our sins onto Himself.
To this end He said He was born in that stable where I first saw Him.
For this cause, He came into the world.
For this death?
This beginning.
I have lived too long.
As though He were carrying in that cross the pain of the world.
So fearful, and yet why is it I'm not afraid anymore?
The shadow of a storm.
A strange darkness but still day.
His life is over.
What is it?
This tearing.
I am in pain.
I feel it too.
Do you see your hand?
Almost at the moment He died I heard Him say, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do."
Even then.
Even then.
And I felt His voice take the sword out of my hand.
B L I Z Z A R D
In the year of our Lord Judea, for nearly a century, had lain under the mastery of Rome.
In the seventh year of the reign of Augustus Caesar an imperial decree ordered every Judean each to return to his place of birth to be counted and taxed.
Converging ways of many of them led to their capital city, Jerusalem the troubled heart of their land.
The old city was dominated by the fortress of Antonia the seat of Roman power and by the great golden temple the outward sign of an inward and imperishable faith.
Even while they obeyed the will of Caesar the people clung proudly to their ancient heritage always remembering the promise of their prophets that one day there would be born among them a redeemer to bring them salvation and perfect freedom.
You'll be counted at Hebron.
- Name?
- Samuel.
- What city?
- Joppa.
- What family?
- Michael.
- Move on.
Move on.
- Yes.
- Name?
- Joseph.
- What city?
- Nazareth.
- What family?
- David of Bethlehem.
And the woman?
My wife.
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.
Come on, come on.
What village is this?
Nazareth.
We should arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow night.
You're not watching the soldiers, Joseph?
We've seen Romans before.
Yes and we will see them again.
My table is not finished.
Where is your son?
He's walking in the hills.
He neglects his work, Joseph.
No.
Once, I reproached him with forgetting his work.
He said to me:
"I must be about my father's business."
Then why isn't he here, working?
He's working.
Trumpeters of the legion!
Welcome, Messala.
The command is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for relieving me.
Drusus when I was a boy, I dreamed of commanding this garrison.
Now the wheel has turned.
I am in command.
Attention!
Aisle one, face right!
Forward!
I'd forgotten the heat.
If it were only the heat.
I lived here until I was 14.
Jerusalem was my home.
- My father was head of...
- Yes, I know.
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.
If there can be such a thing in this forsaken land.
If you want to rise, Sextus, do the difficult.
I asked to be sent here.
You'll find the people changed since you were a boy.
In what way?
Oh, won't pay their taxes, an irrational resentment of Rome...
There's nothing new in all that.
And then there's religion.
I tell you, they're drunk with religion.
They smash the statues of our gods, even those of the emperor.
Punish them.
We do.
When we can find them.
Find the leaders.
You don't know.
There's nothing you can put your finger on.
There are strange forces at work here.
This "messiah" business...
I know.
There was one predicted when I was a boy.
A king of the Jews, who will lead them into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.
Makes your head spin.
There's a wild man in the desert named John who drowns people in water.
And a carpenter's son who does magic tricks. "Miracles" they call them.
There's always a rabble-rouser stirring up trouble.
No, no, no.
This man is different.
He teaches that God is near, in every man.
It's actually quite profound, some of it.
You've been too long away from Rome.
Go back, Sextus.
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea and forget that God is in every man.
- There is divinity in only one man.
- Yes, I know.
The emperor is displeased.
He wishes Judea made into a more obedient and disciplined province.
He's ordered me to restore order.
I shall carry out his wishes.
How?
You can break a man's skull, arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.
But how do you control this?
How do you fight an idea?
Especially a new idea.
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.
I assume he has a name.
- He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
- Then treat him like one!
Tell him I will join him.
Yes, tribune.
Centurion!
This was his country before it was ours.
Don't forget that.
Yes, tribune.
Very wise.
This Ben-Hur is the richest man in Jerusalem.
And the head of one of the greatest families in Judea.
We were friends as boys.
We were like brothers.
Sextus you ask how to fight an idea.
Well, I'll tell you how.
With another idea.
I said I'd come back.
I never thought you would.
I'm so glad.
- Look at you.
- Look at you!
You've come back a tribune.
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.
We'll drink another now.
- Your sister and mother?
- They're fine.
They've talked of you ever since we knew you were coming.
- Is Tirzah married?
- No.
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.
She's been in love with you since she was 5.
I can't wait to see them.
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?
Or have you become too dignified?
- Down Eros, up Mars!
- Down Eros, up Mars!
Where the beams cross?
Good.
After all these years!
Still close.
In every way.
I hope so.
I know.
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew whose life you once saved.
The best thing I ever did.
Judah it will be very difficult to govern here.
I'm going to need help.
Your help.
Your advice.
- You want my advice?
- Yes, I do.
Withdraw your legions.
Give us our freedom.
Unfortunately, the emperor is devoted to his empire.
He's particularly fond of Judea.
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.
Is there anything so sad as unrequited love?
My quarters.
A bit grim.
Not grim.
Austere.
Virtuous.
Roman.
I'm going to be second-in-command to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.
He's coming in a few days with more legions.
Then the rumors are true.
The emperor does not approve of your countrymen.
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.
But you and your family need have no concern.
I'm next in authority to the governor, and you're my friend.
- I'm a Jew.
- Ah, you are like a Roman!
What have you in common with the troublemaking rabble?
- They're my people.
I'm one of them.
- Be wise, Judah.
It's a Roman world.
If you want to live in it, you must become part of it.
You've changed.
I've grown up.
I've seen the world since I left Jerusalem.
I've seen Rome.
It's no accident that one small village on the Tiber was chosen to rule the world.
Your legions.
It wasn't just our legions.
Other countries have armies, fine armies.
I know, I fought them.
Oh, no.
No, it was fate that chose us to civilize the world.
And we have.
Our roads and ships connect every corner of the earth.
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.
I believe in the future of my people.
Of course you do.
And you can help them.
How?
You're an aristocrat.
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince to your people.
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.
They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.
Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.
It is worse than stupid, futile!
For it can end in only one way, extinction for your people!
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.
Then we're agreed!
Now, when can I come to see your family?
- We had hoped tomorrow.
- Good.
And now for our toast.
It's dreadful wine, by the way.
It's especially fermented for the Roman army.
You're very cruel to your conquerors.
It's an insane world.
But in it there is one sanity:
The loyalty of old friends.
Judah, we must believe in one another.
Will you drink to that?
With all my heart.
Here it is, the place I've remembered.
The court where we played at changing the guard.
The roof where we'd throw pebbles at people in the street and then hide.
- We were rascals, weren't we?
- No, you were good boys.
I would have that time again.
And here it is.
Nothing has changed.
Except for the fountain.
- The old well would go dry, remember?
- Promptly, every summer.
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.
- He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
- No?
Of course he has.
He was a boy when he left us, now he's a man.
With great responsibilities.
Come.
The emperor builds and builds, turning brick to marble.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.
I've never seen anything like this before.
It's beautiful!
- Is it Roman?
- It's Libyan.
I was there last year.
A tremendous campaign.
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.
Or was, till we destroyed it.
Now it's nothing but ashes.
I'm boring you with soldier stories.
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.
Thank you for this.
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.
What do you think of it?
Magnificent.
It's Arabic.
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.
Let me try him sometime.
Whenever you like.
He's yours.
Do you mean you'll give me this?
Oh, Judah.
You are good.
It's going to be like old times, I know it.
Judah, tell me, did you think about what I said?
Yes.
Talked to a number of people already.
Spoken against violence, against incidents.
Most of the men agree with me.
Most?
Not all?
No, not all.
Who does not agree?
Well, the resentful, the impatient.
Who are they?
Yes, Judah.
Who are they?
Would I retain your friendship if I became an informer?
Telling the names of criminals is not informing.
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.
Patriots?
!
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.
This is my great opportunity, and yours too.
If I bring order here, I can have any post I want.
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?
Rome!
Yes, perhaps at the side of Caesar himself.
I mean it.
It can happen and this is the moment.
I swear, this is the time.
The emperor is watching us, judging us.
All I need do is serve him.
And all you need do is help me serve him.
- You speak as if he were God.
- He is God.
The only God.
He is power, real power on earth, not...
Not that.
Help me, Judah.
I would do anything for you, Messala except betray my own people.
In the name of all the gods, what do the lives of a few Jews mean to you?
If I cannot persuade them, that does not mean I would help you murder them.
Besides, you must understand this, Messala.
I believe in the past and future of my people.
Future?
You are a conquered people.
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?
Joshua will not rise again to save you nor David.
There is only one reality in the world today.
Look to the West.
Don't be a fool!
Look to Rome!
Better a fool than a traitor or a killer.
- I am a soldier.
- Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.
- I warn you...
- No!
I warn you.
Rome is an affront to God.
Rome is strangling my people and my country, the whole earth!
But not forever.
And I tell you, the day Rome falls there will be a shout of freedom such as the world has never heard before.
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.
You're either for me or against me.
If that is the choice then I am against you.
There they are.
Where's Messala?
- Where's...?
- He's gone.
Gone?
- But why?
- He couldn't stay.
- What happened?
- A new tribune must have many duties.
Come.
Let us have dinner.
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the world who bringeth to us bread from the earth.
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.
He wanted to use me to betray our people.
- Master, the caravan from Antioch.
- Yes, Amrah, I saw.
Simonides.
- Oh, welcome homecoming.
- Master.
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.
And for the master, Iberian wine.
Not to mention the best gift of all, your presence.
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.
- Caravans from Petra.
- Have all arrived.
- Good.
- Here is the accounting.
And what of Numidia?
The trade route is ours, guaranteed by treaty with the king.
Once a year, you bring your accounting.
And once a year, I find myself wealthier.
Yeah, but my greatest treasure is my steward.
My life belongs to the House of Hur.
Nothing else exists for me, except my daughter.
- She must be a young woman by now.
- Yes, and your property.
She was born the daughter of your slave.
When I inherited you, I inherited a friend, not a slave.
Still, Esther has come with me from Antioch for your permission to marry.
It's granted.
I wish you the joy of many grandchildren.
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.
With your permission, Esther wishes to speak to her master.
You're eager to marry, Esther?
It is my father's wish.
Your husband will be fortunate.
What is his name?
David, son of Mathias.
Of what house?
- His own, master.
- He is a freeman.
Tell me more about him.
I have seen him only once.
He is a merchant, well-thought-of in Antioch.
He will pay for Esther's freedom.
Her freedom will be my wedding gift to Esther.
You are generous, master.
Do you love this man?
I will learn to love him.
You have my permission to marry.
We'll drink to your happiness.
And a safe return to Antioch.
I disturbed you.
No.
What were you thinking?
I was saying goodbye to this city and this house.
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?
My father sometimes brought me here when I was little.
It was a house where I was always happy.
Except once.
When you and your friend, the Roman boy...
- Messala.
- Yes.
You had been out hunting and they brought you home injured.
I touched your face as you lay there and prayed to God, "Don't let this boy die."
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.
Yes, master.
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.
It's strange.
I hardly felt a slave.
And now I hardly feel free.
You know, in the old, wise days of Solomon if there was among his slaves some girl who filled his eyes he could choose her out from the rest and take her to him.
Wise days of Solomon.
Different days.
And long ago.
If you were not a bride I should kiss you goodbye.
If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said.
Your slave ring.
Fair exchange.
Freedom to you.
The ring to me.
You will wear it?
Until you meet the woman you will marry?
Until then.
The gods favor my lord Gratus.
If it is the governor's pleasure, the wreath of office.
Thank you, tribune.
I see no delegation from the city.
- There will not be one, sir.
- No?
Jerusalem's welcome will not be a warm one.
But I pledge, my lord, it will be a quiet one.
Let us proceed.
There's Messala.
He saw you, Judah.
The new governor.
Stand back!
- Stand back.
- You, come!
Had to be the Jews!
Open up in the name of the divine emperor!
Judah!
Tirzah!
What is it?
What's happened?
Open up in the name of the law!
- I was watching the...
- A tile fell and struck the governor.
- It wasn't my fault.
- They won't believe her.
She won't have to say anything.
You hear?
Tirzah, say nothing.
Open the gates!
I'll speak to them.
- Arrest him!
- Let me tell you what happened.
- Hold those women.
- Stop them!
It was an accident.
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.
- This is the man, sir.
We saw him.
- It was an accident.
- Accident?
- I swear it.
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose.
It gave way.
Take him.
Take all of them.
- He's telling the truth!
- It was me!
Let them go!
Attention!
Messala.
In the name of God, tell them it's a mistake.
I leaned on the tile, and it broke loose.
It was an accident.
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!
Let the servants go.
Let them go.
Return to your ranks.
Come.
Where?
Tirus.
Tirus?
I've had no trial.
I'm to die in the galleys without even a trial?
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!
Wait.
My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?
Tie his hands.
- At least tell me if they're safe.
- I can tell you nothing.
Get along.
Keep moving.
Jailer!
Guard, in there!
Up the stairs!
Jailer!
Jailer!
To the right.
- Wait!
- Send them out.
Go!
The door.
Where are my mother and sister?
Where are they?
Here, within these walls.
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.
Of course, they will be sentenced.
Is it possible?
Is it possible you could do this to us?
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?
You will let them go.
You will gladly let them go!
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not a murderer!
I know you're not.
You know?
You are evil.
No, Judah, I am not evil.
I wanted your help.
Now you've given it to me.
By making this example of you, I discourage treason.
By condemning without hesitation an old friend, I shall be feared.
But not my family.
Let them go.
Please.
- Messala, I beg you.
- Beg?
!
Didn't I beg you?
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.
Kill me, and your mother and sister will die nailed to crosses in front of you!
Go on, Judah.
Kill me!
May God grant me vengeance.
I will pray that you live till I return.
Return?
Take him.
Sentries, salute.
The tribune will see you now.
Tribune, I'm steward of the House of Hur.
I remember you.
We were on our way to Antioch when we heard what had happened.
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done this thing.
You knew him, tribune.
Better than you.
Then there must be no doubt in your mind, the charge is groundless.
The prisoners have been sentenced.
- Sentenced?
- But there's no truth in it.
There was never a threat against the governor in Judah's mind.
Surely you must know he would never have done this.
In your heart, you must know it.
Drusus.
This man had better be kept here until we can question him.
Hold!
Water for the soldiers.
Soldiers first!
Get away from that well.
No water for them!
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!
Come on, you!
Water for the horses!
- Water.
Water.
- Soldiers first!
Here.
Wait.
No water for him.
God help me.
You!
I said no water for him!
All right, on your feet, all of you!
Get them on their feet!
Back in line, you dog!
On your feet!
Get them going!
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!
Forward, you dogs!
Soon, the counselor's barge will be coming alongside.
Be ready to raise oars.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.
- How many rowers?
- Two hundred, consul.
- And reliefs?
- Of 30, every hour.
This man is ill.
Replace him.
- Change him.
- Right, sir.
- This man's been giving you trouble?
- He's insubordinate, consul.
That will stop.
What service have you seen?
Forty-one.
A month's less a day in this ship.
You keep an exact account.
And before?
Three years in other ships.
Three years.
You have the spirit to fight back but the good sense to control it.
Your eyes are full of hate, 41.
That's good.
Hate keeps a man alive.
It gives him strength.
Now, listen to me, all of you.
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
So row well and live.
- Ship ready, consul.
- Strike oars.
Strike oars!
You know a fleet of Macedonian galleys has been raiding Roman commerce.
The emperor has honored us with the task of seeking out and destroying them.
Battle speed, hortator.
Battle speed!
Attack speed.
Attack speed!
Ramming speed.
Ramming speed!
Rest.
Halt!
Rest!
Why are you here?
I was ordered to report to you during my relief.
Oh, yes.
I'd forgotten.
You could have killed me as I lay there.
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?
I'm not ready to die.
What do you think will save you?
The God of my fathers.
Your God has forsaken you.
He has no more power than the images I pray to.
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.
I might.
Does that interest you, 41?
I can see that it does.
I'm a fighting man by profession, and in my leisure moments it amuses me to train fighting men.
I own some of the best gladiators and charioteers in Rome.
Would you like to become one of them?
To die as your slave?
Better than to live in chains below these decks.
I will not be here forever.
No?
What would you do if you escaped?
Two people were condemned with me, my mother and sister though they were innocent.
I won't rest...
Do not say that you were innocent.
- Would it do any good to say it again?
- No.
Consider my offer carefully.
You will never escape while we are victorious.
If we are not, you will sink with this ship, chained to your oar.
I cannot believe that God has let me live these years to die chained to an oar.
It's a strange, stubborn faith you keep to believe that existence has a purpose.
A sane man would have learned to lose it long before this.
As you have.
What drove it out of you?
Go back to your oar, 41.
Consul, enemy sighted.
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.
All the watch to battle posts.
- Stand by to load.
- Make ready to fire.
Hurry, quick!
Hurry up with that resin.
Get some more ammunition.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
Chain rowers!
Guard.
Unlock 41.
No!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
41, why did he do that?
I don't know.
Once before, a man helped me.
I didn't know why then.
Normal speed!
Number 1, flame.
Fire.
Fire!
Fire!
Hold withdrawal on command.
Lift oars!
Raise!
Withdraw!
Steersman, right.
Extend oars!
Fire!
- Watch out!
- Fire!
Steersman, ram course!
Order below!
- Ramming speed!
- Ramming speed!
Consul, barge on ramming course.
We're going to be rammed!
We're going to be rammed!
Why did you save me?
Why did you have me unchained?
What is your name, 41?
Judah Ben-Hur. ...let me die.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
Row well and live.
Is the sail square?
I can't tell.
Better for us both if it's the enemy.
My death.
Your freedom.
It's a Roman sail.
Face rear!
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.
Water.
The fleet, all lost?
Five galleys.
- And the battle?
- The battle was won.
You have a victory.
- It was a victory?
- Complete.
In His eagerness to save you your God has also saved the Roman fleet.
Hail Arrius!
Right oars!
You have cleared the seaways of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.
This baton of victory has been nobly won.
This man riding beside you, who is he?
The man who saved me, divine emperor, to return and serve you.
Is that all you know about him?
No.
He was accused of an attack on the governor of Judea.
But he was innocent.
If not, there's a strange inconsistency in this man who tries to kill my governor, yet saves the life of my consul.
Come tomorrow.
We'll talk of it.
We have all the information on this man a man of some influence in his own country.
His attack upon our governor is one upon the senate and the people of Rome.
I am convinced that no such attack was intended.
Consul, allow us to continue.
Allow us to be generous.
As a reward to you for your great victory we shall not send him back to the galleys.
Take him as your slave.
Such is the will of the senate and the people of Rome.
Not long ago, I returned to Rome with a young man who had saved my life.
You all know him as the finest charioteer in Rome.
Five times, he's driven my horses to victory.
I know him as one who stands in the place of the son I lost.
I have the love and pride in a son's achievements which I thought I should never have again.
Nothing could make stronger our bond but tonight I wish to share it with you all.
The formalities of adoption have been completed.
Young Arrius is now the legal bearer of my name and the heir to my property.
This ring of my ancestors would have gone to my son.
So now it is yours.
It's a strange destiny that brought me to a new life a new home a new father.
It brought me here.
It may take me away.
But wherever I may be I shall always try to wear this ring as a son of Arrius should.
With gratitude and affection and with honor.
My old friend Pontius Pilate, young Arrius.
Before you came to this city, my horses always won.
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.
Yes, but not swift enough to defeat you.
- Tell me, you come from Judea?
- Yes, sir.
I hear that the climate is difficult to live in.
Not for Judeans.
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.
- Of Judea?
- Yes.
I asked for Alexandria.
But it seems the wilderness needs my particular talents.
The scorpions and holy prophets can't get on without me.
Lay the dust of Judea, at least for this evening.
Goats and Jehovah.
You're leaving.
I must.
It's a journey I can't keep you from.
Your eyes have never left it all these months.
I can recognize pain.
But still, my counsel is to wait.
Gratus is to be replaced.
The governorship goes to Pontius Pilate.
When?
Very soon.
It's very much to our purpose.
Nothing is to the purpose if, when I come back to Judea, I come too late.
That is the thought which has punished me every moment I've spent here.
Will Rome see you again?
Here is a part of my life which you have made for me.
I shall remember it.
Whoever the gods are, they take small interest in an old man's hopes.
They have their way.
Forgive me.
You're a stranger here.
Would you be from Nazareth?
Why do you ask?
I thought you might be the one...
The one that I have come back from my country to find.
He would be about your age.
Who?
When I find Him I shall know Him.
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.
Sack of flesh without brains!
No!
No!
Not the whip!
That is my host.
Gently!
Gently!
Fool!
Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood.
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run!
Go on!
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!
Beautiful horses.
Now!
Now!
They are ready!
Let them go!
Watch.
They'll never hold the turn.
No!
No!
Abadon, stop him!
Stop that whip!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill...!
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!
You think you can treat my horses like animals?
!
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!
Get off, idiot!
Drive goats, not horses!
I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.
Not a team?
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.
- Antares.
- The slow one?
He should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?
In the circus in Rome.
You have driven in the great circus?
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.
No other animal has descended so in scale from the first innocent falling of the world.
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.
Yes.
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.
Your coming here was so fit, so right.
We might have achieved wonders!
You have to go.
I make a journey which will not wait.
Ah, well, then perhaps you will come back.
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.
I have no wives.
No wives at all?
I have six, no, seven.
I've counted eight.
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.
- Someday, I hope to have one.
- One wife!
One God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.
It is not generous.
- Was the food not to your liking?
- Indeed.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.
And now I must say good night to my beauties.
When ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.
- I'll make my farewells then.
- No, no, no, stay.
Stay and see them.
Come, my children.
Come.
Strangers make them shy.
Come.
Come, do not be afraid.
Come.
There, my children.
They are descended from the Arabians of the Pharaohs and I have named them for the stars.
Come, Antares.
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.
What?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.
Come, Rigel.
We've both supped well, and the world is good.
There's my good Rigel.
Yes, you are ready for sleep.
The day's work done for you, eh?
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.
Good night.
Good night, my treasure.
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.
No.
You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.
You should see their mother, Mira.
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.
All right, all right.
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.
You must be strong and swift.
Go, my children.
Go.
At Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams and the champion of the East, Messala, with his black devils.
He stops at nothing to win.
- Messala?
In the circus?
- Yes.
You knew him?
I know him.
Perhaps without much liking.
My people are praying for a man to drive their team to victory over Messala.
You could be that man, the one to stamp his arrogance into the sand.
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.
It's not possible.
That is a pity.
Think of it.
To break his pride to humble this tribune before the very people he has degraded.
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!
I know it is not possible.
Does it not delight your imagination?
Does it not answer your purpose?
I must deal with Messala in my own way.
And your way is to kill him.
I see this terrible thing in your eyes.
But no matter what this man has done, you have no right to kill him.
He will be punished inevitably.
I don't believe in miracles.
But all life is a miracle.
Why will you not accept God's judgment?
You do not believe in miracles.
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness and a star led me to a village called Bethlehem where I found a newborn child in a manger.
And God lived in this child.
By now, He is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.
That is why I have returned here so that I may be at hand when He comes among us.
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.
Perhaps He's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.
Perhaps He is a shepherd a merchant, a fisherman.
But He lives and all our lives from now on will carry His mark.
There are many paths to God, my son.
I hope yours will not be too difficult.
I'm ready for sleep.
Balthasar is a good man but until all men are like him, we must keep our swords bright.
And our intention true.
So I must leave you.
One last thought.
There is no law in the arena.
Many are killed.
I hope to see you again.
Fine Damascus silk.
Fine Damascus silk.
Esther?
It's Judah.
You are alive.
You are alive.
What are you doing here?
What has happened?
I'm here.
I'm with you.
Where's your father?
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.
They tortured him.
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.
You never went back to Antioch?
No.
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.
Where are my mother and sister?
Let me tell him first.
Father.
Father, something wonderful has happened.
Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
He has come home.
He is here.
Judah.
Judah Ben-Hur.
My dear old friend.
Let me look at you.
Let me see you.
Yes, yes.
It is true.
Praise God for His mercy.
Where are they?
Since that terrible day there has been no word of them.
You should have been less loyal.
Do not pity me, Master Judah.
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.
We were released on the same day.
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.
Since then, I have been his tongue and he has been my legs.
Together, we make a considerable man.
Old friend.
She always said you would return.
She never gave up hope.
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.
I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.
But suppose that isn't possible.
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.
They could not make me tell them where it is.
It is there still to put power into our hands and buy death for the Romans.
That's not why I came back.
Judah, they are dead.
Four years.
No one could live so long in the dungeons.
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?
Yes, it is true.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You have come back to us like a returning faith.
Judah, I should like to laugh again.
- Let us laugh.
- We will.
There will be joy again in this house.
We will celebrate among the dust.
I will take him.
We stood here before.
A long while ago.
Four years.
But now it seems as if only yesterday...
I was saying:
"If you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye."
"If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said."
I am not a bride.
Why did you never marry?
My father needed me.
And also...
It's still on my finger.
I said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.
It's become a part of my hand.
If Messala once knew you were here...
As he must.
He will know where they are.
And if you should find...?
- If he says they're dead...
- Messala will wish they were living.
I've seen too much of what hate can do.
My father is burned up with it.
But I've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater and love more powerful than hatred.
I believe it.
- Esther.
- Judah.
Stay alive.
Keep away from Messala.
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.
That time isn't yet come.
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.
This time you will be destroyed.
You'll die.
Tribune, compliments of Quintus Arrius.
He awaits your pleasure.
- Consul here?
- Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.
Thank him.
Bring him to me.
- I didn't know the consul had a son.
- He's a champion of the great circus.
Why is he presenting me with gifts?
- Perhaps he'll race against you.
- Look.
It's magnificent.
And from a man I've never met.
You're wrong, Messala.
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?
You were the magician, Messala.
You condemned me to the galleys.
When my ship was sunk, I saved the consul's life.
You know his seal?
Now I have come back as I swore I would.
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.
You suggest I use it on myself?
What has become of my mother and my sister?
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.
Find them, Messala.
Restore them to me, and I'll forget what I vowed with every stroke of that oar you chained me to.
I am not the governor.
I can do nothing without approval.
Then get it.
I will come back tomorrow.
Don't disappoint me, Messala.
What became of them?
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?
Go to the citadel, Drusus.
Find out.
- And if they're dead?
- They're dead!
"Miriam, wife.
Tirzah, daughter."
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?
E section lower level.
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.
Water.
Water.
Let me out!
- How long since you've seen them?
- Never.
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.
The food disappears.
Lepers.
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.
Then we'll burn out the cell.
Is someone there?
There is someone there.
Who are you?
Don't come any closer.
Who are you?
Esther.
It's Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam?
Stay where you are.
You have come home.
Stand back, Esther.
We are lepers.
Oh, Esther.
Tirzah.
Esther is Judah living?
Yes, he is alive.
He is here.
Where?
He is searching for you now.
I must find him and tell him.
- No!
- Tell my father.
No.
Tell no one.
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.
We won't return.
Judah has to be told.
No.
Please.
I couldn't see his face.
Is it changed?
No, he is not changed.
He's not changed.
You love him, Esther.
Promise me on your love for him you will never tell him you've seen us.
Is he never to know?
Let him remember us as we were.
Promise me.
There's nothing else I can hope for.
Only this.
I promise.
I am content.
Wait.
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.
I pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.
He'll free them.
He wants to survive.
He cannot free them, Judah.
What do you mean?
I saw them.
You saw them?
Where?
When did you see them?
They were dead.
They were dead.
When?
When?
When?
!
In the prison.
When I was waiting for news of my father.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't tell you.
Nor even you, Father.
I was afraid that if you saw Messala...
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.
It's over now.
Over?
- Judah.
- Over?
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.
Gentlemen.
Officers.
Defenders of great Rome's Imperium may I enter?
Certainly, sheik.
You do us an unexpected honor.
The noble tribune is most gracious.
And now the question you're asking:
Why am I here?
As you know, I am a gambling man.
The games approach.
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.
I will back my own poor horses.
No limits?
- Mark me first!
- And me!
- What odds?
- A moment, please my lords, protectors of the far flung marshes.
May I first sit down?
Sit.
How much will you wager?
- Yes, let's call his game.
- Give the Arab a seat.
A bench, quickly.
Thank you.
- Now.
- 1000 denarii.
- 2000!
- Mark me!
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient.
There is time.
First gentlemen, the odds.
The tribune has won many times.
The odds should be in the same measure.
What is your pleasure, gentlemen?
Two to one.
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth where is the courage that made Rome master of the world?
I can get better odds on any street market.
Three to one.
Let us not haggle.
Let us be fair.
In four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.
- In all truth...
- Just a moment.
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.
The Prince of Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur.
Prince of Hur?
- He was sent to the galleys years ago.
- He has returned.
Returned?
Impossible.
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.
Well?
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.
You, tribune will you give me four to one?
Four to one.
Good.
Four to one, sheik.
The difference between a Roman and a Jew.
Or an Arab.
Bravely spoken.
Now we will settle the amount of our wager.
I will venture...
A thousand talents?
- A thousand talents?
- Yes, a thousand talents.
Of course, if it is too much...
A thousand talents it will be.
Agreed.
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.
You're good fellows.
If only men were this good.
Remember, Altair nine times around the circus.
Aldebaran.
Rigel, did you hear?
Nine lives to live.
My swift fellow.
You must not win the race the first time around.
You win the last time around.
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.
Steady Antares.
Like a rock.
You will be our anchor.
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.
They have taken me into their family.
Rest well, my stars.
Tomorrow we go up to the city.
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it the news will scorch the streets of the Roman world.
Pontius Pilate here?
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.
You will make him see what men are born in this land.
I only know that I race against Messala.
Look for the yoke.
Ease that strap.
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.
Into Your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as You will.
The Star of David.
To shine out for your people and my people together and blind the eyes of Rome.
They are ready.
Easy, girl, easy.
Number five.
Where is number five?
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.
Yes, this is the day.
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.
Hail, Jupiter.
Give me victory.
Watch your line!
Keep your places!
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.
Citizens I welcome you to these games in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.
We dedicate them to his glory and to the glory of Rome of which you are all part.
Let us honor those who race for us today.
They come here from Alexandria Messina Carthage Cyprus Rome Corinth Athens Phrygia and Judea.
To the best of these, a crown of victory.
The race begins.
Hail, Caesar!
Come, my children, come!
The Roman pig!
Salute.
A great victory.
You are the people's one true god for the time being.
Permit us to worship.
I crown their god.
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.
A long life, young Arrius and the good sense to live it.
We cannot wait, tribune.
He will come.
He will...
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.
He will come!
He will come.
I've sent for him, and he will come.
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.
Do you understand?
To hack the legs off me?
Not yet.
Not till I've seen him.
I don't receive him with half a body.
No!
I told you, Drusus.
I told you.
Here he is.
Triumph complete, Judah.
The race won.
The enemy destroyed.
I see no enemy.
What do you think you see?
The smashed body of a wretched animal?
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.
Let me help you.
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.
Dead.
And the race over.
It isn't over, Judah.
They're not dead.
Where are they?
Where are they?
Look for them in the Valley of the Lepers if you can recognize them.
It goes on.
It goes on, Judah.
The race...
The race is not over.
Is there a way down here?
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.
Man.
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.
There are many women.
Of the family of Hur.
We have no names here.
For them?
- Why did you say they were dead?
- It was what they wanted.
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?
Not to see them?
They are coming.
Love them in the way they must need to be loved.
Not to look at them.
Let them be as if you had never come here.
Please!
Is Judah well?
Is he happy?
Yes, he is well.
Your mind can be at rest for him.
He is well, Miriam.
God be with you.
They have gone.
We can go back.
Go back to what?
Judah, they have one blessing left.
To think you remember them as they were and live your own life.
Forget what is here.
Forget?
It's as though they're alive in a grave.
- But what can you do?
- Undo what you've done.
How could you have suffered them to come here?
I must see them.
No, Judah, please!
Judah!
Think, Judah, think.
It would tear them apart if they see you.
He is here.
I have found Him.
The child has become a man.
And the man, I know it now, is the Son of God.
The promise is true.
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.
Life has been answered.
God has answered it.
Come.
Come with me.
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys thirst had nearly killed me.
A man gave me water to drink.
I went on living.
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.
No.
I am thirsty still.
Come and listen.
I have business with Rome.
You insist on death.
Goodbye, Judah.
You sent for me?
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.
- I honor him.
- As you may honor yourself.
You have been made a citizen of Rome.
Do you say nothing to this?
I have just come from the Valley of Stone where my mother and sister live what's left of their lives.
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.
I have heard this.
There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.
Where there is greatness, great government or power even great feeling or compassion error also is great.
We progress and mature by fault.
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.
There are other voices.
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place not to crucify yourself on a shadow such as old resentment or impossible loyalties.
Perfect freedom has no existence.
A grown man knows the world he lives in.
And for the present, the world is Rome.
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.
I am Judah Ben-Hur.
I cross this floor in spoken friendship as I would speak to Arrius.
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar ready to crush those who challenge his authority.
There are too many men of envy and ambition who try to disrupt the government of Rome.
You have become the victor and hero to those people.
They look to you, their one true god, as I call you.
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.
I am already part of this tragedy.
Return this to Arrius.
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you from personal disaster if you stay here.
You are too great a danger.
Leave Judea.
You have my word.
I was afraid you would never come back afraid of what would happen to you.
But I see you again.
Your father's waiting for me.
Where is he?
What do you mean to do?
Rest, sleep.
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.
Peace?
Love and peace.
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?
Where do you see them?
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.
Balthasar's word.
He is more than Balthasar's word.
His voiced traveled with such a still purpose.
It was more than a voice.
A man more than a man.
He said, " Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God."
Children of God?
In that dead valley where we left them?
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean until we have scoured off our bodies the crust and filth of being at the mercy of tyranny.
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.
- In blood?
- Yes, in blood!
I know there is a law in life.
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.
Death generates death as the vulture breeds the vulture.
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:
"Love your enemy.
Do good to those who despitefully use you."
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.
As you make us do now.
Are we to bear nothing together?
Even love?
I can hardly draw breath without feeling you in my heart.
But I know that everything I do from this moment bears greater pain than you have ever suffered.
It is better not to love me.
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy giving evil for evil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.
It's as though you had become Messala.
I've lost you, Judah.
No further.
What are you doing here?
I was here last evening waiting for you.
I have waited all night.
What has happened?
Where is Tirzah?
Leave the food.
I am coming closer.
Don't be afraid.
- What are you doing?
- Don't be afraid.
I've heard Him again, the man from Nazareth.
If ever words were from God, they are in everything He says.
I cannot bear that you should have never known this hand of quiet reaching towards us.
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find Him there.
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find Him.
Tirzah is dying.
Leave the food and go.
It's Judah.
Why did you tell him?
Yes, Judah, yes.
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.
Mother.
Wait, Mother, wait.
Let me talk with you.
Please.
No, no further.
Please.
No, Judah.
Son, no.
Mother, let me see Tirzah.
Tirzah is dying.
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know that life is everlasting and death is nothing to fear if you have faith.
I will take them to Him.
No!
God, no!
No, no, dear son.
Mother where is Tirzah?
Judah, no.
Judah, no.
You must not go to her, dear son.
Please.
Dear son.
I am afraid.
No cause.
The world is more than we know.
Tirzah, it's Judah.
No, Judah.
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
- Why are the streets deserted?
- They have gone to the trial.
Trial?
Whose trial?
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.
- This cannot be true.
- Alms?
What has he done?
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.
Help for the blind.
- Look, lepers!
- Lepers!
Get away!
Stay away!
Go away!
Lepers!
Lepers!
How can this be?
I know this man.
Will someone help Him?
Take pity on Him.
Have mercy.
In His pain this look of peace.
Watch over them, Esther.
We must go back.
I brought you here to this when I hoped...
You haven't failed, Esther.
Hail King of the Jews!
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.
He gave me water and a heart to live.
What has He done to merit this?
He has taken the world of our sins onto Himself.
To this end He said He was born in that stable where I first saw Him.
For this cause, He came into the world.
For this death?
This beginning.
I have lived too long.
As though He were carrying in that cross the pain of the world.
So fearful, and yet why is it I'm not afraid anymore?
The shadow of a storm.
A strange darkness but still day.
His life is over.
What is it?
This tearing.
I am in pain.
I feel it too.
Do you see your hand?
Almost at the moment He died I heard Him say, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do."
Even then.
Even then.
And I felt His voice take the sword out of my hand.

In the year of our Lord Judea, for nearly a century, had lain under the mastery of Rome.
In the seventh year of the reign ofAugustus Caesar an imperial decree ordered every Judean each to return to his place of birth to be counted and taxed.
Converging ways of many of them led to their capital city, Jerusalem the troubled heart of their land.
The old city was dominated by the fortress ofAntonia the seat of Roman power and by the great golden temple the outward sign of an inward and imperishable faith.
Even while they obeyed the will of Caesar the people clung proudly to their ancient heritage always remembering the promise of their prophets that one day there would be born among them a redeemer to bring them salvation and perfect freedom.
You'll be counted at Hebron.
-Name?
-Samuel.
-What city?
-Joppa.

Move on.

-Nazareth.
-What family?
-David of Bethlehem.
And the woman?
My wife.
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.
Come on, come on.
What village is this?
Nazareth.
We should arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow night.
You're not watching the soldiers, Joseph?
We've seen Romans before.
Yes...
... andwewillsee themagain.
My table is not finished.
Where is your son?
He's walking in the hills.
He neglects his work, Joseph.
No.
Once, I reproached him with forgetting his work.
He said to me:
"I must be about my father's business. "
Then why isn't he here, working?
He's working.
Trumpeters of the legion!
Welcome, Messala.
The command is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for relieving me.
Drusus...
... whenI wasaboy ,Idreamed of commanding this garrison.
Now the wheel has turned.
I am in command.
Attention!
Aisle one, face right!
Forward!
I'd forgotten the heat.
If it were only the heat.
I lived here until I was 1 4.
Jerusalem was my home.
-My father was head of--
-Yes, I know.
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.
If there can be such a thing in this forsaken land.
If you want to rise, Sextus, do the difficult.
I asked to be sent here.
You'll find the people changed since you were a boy.
In what way?
Oh, won't pay their taxes, an irrational resentment of Rome... .
There's nothing new in all that.
And then there's religion.
I tell you, they're drunk with religion.
They smash the statues of our gods, even those of the emperor.
Punish them.
We do.
When we can find them.
Find the leaders.
You don't know.
There's nothing you can put your finger on.
There are strange forces at work here.
This "messiah" business--
I know.
There was one predicted when I was a boy.
A king of the Jews, who will lead them into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.
Makes your head spin.
There's a wild man in the desert named John...
... whodrownspeopleinwater.
And a carpenter's son who does magic tricks. "Miracles" they call them.
There's always a rabble-rouser stirring up trouble.
No, no, no.
This man is different.
He teaches that God is near, in every man.
It's actually quite profound, some of it.
You've been too long away from Rome.
Go back, Sextus.
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea...
... andforgetthat God is in every man.
-There is divinity in only one man.
-Yes, I know.
The emperor is displeased.
He wishes Judea made into a more obedient and disciplined province.
He's ordered me to restore order.
I shall carry out his wishes.
How?
You can break a man's skull, arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.
But how do you control this?
How do you fight an idea?
Especially a new idea.
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.
I assume he has a name.
-He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
-Then treat him like one!
Tell him I will join him.
Yes, tribune.
Centurion!
This was his country before it was ours.
Don't forget that.
Yes, tribune.
Very wise.
This Ben-Hur is the richest man in Jerusalem.
And the head of one of the greatest families in Judea.
We were friends as boys.
We were like brothers.
Sextus...
... youaskhowtofightanidea.
Well, I'll tell you how.
With another idea.
I said I'd come back.
I never thought you would.
I'm so glad.
-Look at you.
-Look at you!
You've come back a tribune.
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.
We'll drink another now.
-Your sister and mother?
-They're fine.
They've talked of you ever since we knew you were coming.
-Is Tirzah married?
-No.
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.
She's been in love with you since she was 5.
I can't wait to see them.
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?
Or have you become too dignified?
-Down Eros, up Mars!
-Down Eros, up Mars!
Where the beams cross?
Good.
After all these years!
Still close.
In every way.
I hope so.
I know.
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew...
... whoselifeyouoncesaved.
The best thing I ever did.
Judah...
... itwillbe verydifficult to govern here.
I'm going to need help.
Your help.
Your advice.
-You want my advice?
-Yes, I do.
Withdraw your legions.
Give us our freedom.
Unfortunately, the emperor is devoted to his empire.
He's particularly fond of Judea.
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.
Is there anything so sad as unrequited love?
My quarters.
A bit grim.
Not grim.
Austere.
Virtuous.
Roman.
I'm going to be second-in-command to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.
He's coming in a few days with more legions.
Then the rumors are true.
The emperor does not approve of your countrymen.
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.
But you and your family need have no concern.
I'm next in authority to the governor, and you're my friend.
-I'm a Jew.
-Ah, you are like a Roman!
What have you in common with the troublemaking rabble?
-They're my people.
I'm one of them.
-Be wise, Judah.
It's a Roman world.
If you want to live in it, you must become part of it.
You've changed.
I've grown up.
I've seen the world since I left Jerusalem.
I've seen Rome.
It's no accident that one small village on the Tiber...
... waschosento rulethe world.
Your legions.
It wasn't just our legions.
Other countries have armies, fine armies.
I know, I fought them.
Oh, no.
No, it was fate that chose us to civilize the world.
And we have.
Our roads and ships connect every corner of the earth.
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.
I believe in the future of my people.
Of course you do.
And you can help them.
How?
You're an aristocrat.
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince to your people.
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.
They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.
Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.
It is worse than stupid, futile!
For it can end in only one way, extinction for your people!
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.
Then we're agreed!
Now, when can I come to see your family?
-We had hoped tomorrow.
-Good.
And now for our toast.
It's dreadful wine, by the way.
It's especially fermented for the Roman army.
You're very cruel to your conquerors.
It's an insane world.
But in it there is one sanity:
The loyalty of old friends.
Judah, we must believe in one another.
Will you drink to that?
With all my heart.
Here it is, the place I've remembered.
The court where we played at changing the guard.
The roof where we'd throw pebbles at people in the street and then hide.
-We were rascals, weren't we?
-No, you were good boys.
I would have that time again.
And here it is.
Nothing has changed.
Except for the fountain.
-The old well would go dry, remember?
-Promptly, every summer.
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.
-He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
-No?
Of course he has.
He was a boy when he left us, now he's a man.
With great responsibilities.
Come.
The emperor builds and builds, turning brick to marble.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.
I've never seen anything like this before.
It's beautiful!
-Is it Roman?
-It's Libyan.
I was there last year.
A tremendous campaign.
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.
Or was, till we destroyed it.
Now it's nothing but ashes.
I'm boring you with soldier stories.
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.
Thank you for this.
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.
What do you think of it?
Magnificent.
It's Arabic.
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.
Let me try him sometime.
Whenever you like.
He's yours.
Do you mean you'll give me this?
Oh, Judah.
You are good.
It's going to be like old times, I know it.
Judah, tell me, did you...
... thinkaboutwhatIsaid ?
Yes.
Talked to a number of people already.
Spoken against violence, against incidents.
Most of the men agree with me.
Most?
Not all?
No, not all.
Who does not agree?
Well, the resentful, the impatient.
Who are they?
Yes, Judah.
Who are they?
Would I retain your friendship if I became an informer?
Telling the names of criminals is not informing.
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.
Patriots?
!
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.
This is my great opportunity, and yours too.
If I bring order here, I can have any post I want.
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?
Rome!
Yes, perhaps at the side of Caesar himself.
I mean it.
It can happen and this is the moment.
I swear, this is the time.
The emperor is watching us, judging us.
All I need do is serve him.
And all you need do is help me serve him.
-You speak as if he were God.
-He is God.
The only God.
He is power, real power on earth, not--
Not that.
Help me, Judah.
I would do anything for you, Messala...
... exceptbetraymy ownpeople.
In the name of all the gods, what do the lives of a few Jews mean to you?
If I cannot persuade them, that does not mean I would help you murder them.
Besides, you must understand this, Messala.
I believe in the past and future of my people.
Future?
You are a conquered people.
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?
Joshua will not rise again to save you nor David.
There is only one reality in the world today.
Look to the West.
Don't be a fool!
Look to Rome!
Better a fool than a traitor or a killer.
-I am a soldier.
-Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.
-I warn you--
-No!
I warn you.
Rome is an affront to God.
Rome is strangling my people and my country, the whole earth!
But not forever.
And I tell you, the day Rome falls there will be a shout of freedom...
... suchastheworld has never heard before.
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.
You're either for me or against me.
If that is the choice...
... thenI amagainstyou .
There they are.
Where's Messala?
-Where's--?
-He's gone.
Gone?
-But why?
-He couldn't stay.
-What happened?
-A new tribune must have many duties.
Come.
Let us have dinner.
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the world...
... whobringethto us bread from the earth.
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.
He wanted to use me to betray our people.
-Master, the caravan from Antioch.
-Yes, Amrah, I saw.
Simonides.
-Oh, welcome homecoming.
-Master.
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.
And for the master, lberian wine.
Not to mention the best gift of all, your presence.
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.
-Caravans from Petra.
-Have all arrived.
-Good.
-Here is the accounting.
And what of Numidia?
The trade route is ours, guaranteed by treaty with the king.
Once a year, you bring your accounting.
And once a year, I find myself wealthier.
Yeah, but my greatest treasure is my steward.
My life belongs to the House of Hur.
Nothing else exists for me, except my daughter.
-She must be a young woman by now.
-Yes, and your property.
She was born the daughter of your slave.
When I inherited you, I inherited a friend, not a slave.
Still, Esther has come with me from Antioch for your permission to marry.
It's granted.
I wish you the joy of many grandchildren.
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.
With your permission, Esther wishes to speak to her master.
You're eager to marry, Esther?
It is my father's wish.
Your husband will be fortunate.
What is his name?
David, son of Mathias.
Of what house?
-His own, master.
-He is a freeman.
Tell me more about him.
I have seen him only once.
He is a merchant, well-thought-of in Antioch.
He will pay for Esther's freedom.
Her freedom will be my wedding gift to Esther.
You are generous, master.
Do you love this man?
I will learn to love him.
You have my permission to marry.
We'll drink to your happiness.
And a safe return to Antioch.
I disturbed you.
No.
What were you thinking?
I was saying goodbye...
... tothiscity...
... andthishouse.
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?
My father sometimes brought me here...
... whenI waslittle.
It was a house where I was always happy.
Except once.
When you and your friend, the Roman boy--
-Messala.
-Yes.
You had been out hunting...
... andtheybroughtyou homeinjured.
I touched your face as you lay there...
... andprayedto God, "Don't let this boy die. "
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.
Yes, master.
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.
It's strange.
I hardly felt a slave.
And now...
... Ihardlyfeelfree.
You know, in the old, wise days of Solomon...
... iftherewasamonghisslaves...
... somegirlwhofilledhiseyes...
... hecouldchooseher out from the rest...
... andtakehertohim.
Wise days of Solomon.
Different days.
And long ago.
If you were not a bride...
... Ishouldkissyou goodbye.
If I were not a bride...
... therewouldbe no goodbyes to be said.
Your slave ring.
Fair exchange.
Freedom to you.
The ring to me.
You will wear it?
Until you meet the woman you will marry?
Until then.
The gods favor my lord Gratus.
If it is the governor's pleasure, the wreath of office.
Thank you, tribune.
I see no delegation from the city.
-There will not be one, sir.
-No?
Jerusalem's welcome will not be a warm one.
But I pledge, my lord, it will be a quiet one.
Let us proceed.
There's Messala.
He saw you, Judah.
The new governor.
Stand back!
-Stand back.
-You, come!
Had to be the Jews!
Open up in the name of the divine emperor!
Judah!
Tirzah!
What is it?
What's happened?
Open up in the name of the law!
-I was watching the--
-A tile fell and struck the governor.
-It wasn't my fault.
-They won't believe her.
She won't have to say anything.
You hear?
Tirzah, say nothing.
Open the gates!
I'll speak to them.
-Arrest him!
-Let me tell you what happened.
-Hold those women.
-Stop them!
It was an accident.
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.
-This is the man, sir.
We saw him.
-It was an accident.
-Accident?
-I swear it.
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose.
It gave way.
Take him.
Take all of them.
-He's telling the truth!
-It was me!
Let them go!
Attention!
Messala.
In the name of God, tell them it's a mistake.
I leaned on the tile, and it broke loose.
It was an accident.
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!
Let the servants go.
Let them go.
Return to your ranks.
Come.
Where?
Tirus.
Tirus?
I've had no trial.
I'm to die in the galleys without even a trial?
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!
Wait.
My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?
Tie his hands.
-At least tell me if they're safe.
-I can tell you nothing.
Get along.
Keep moving.
Jailer!
Guard, in there!
Up the stairs!
Jailer!
Jailer!
To the right.
-Wait!
-Send them out.
Go!
The door.
Where are my mother and sister?
Where are they?
Here, within these walls.
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.
Of course, they will be sentenced.
Is it possible?
Is it possible you could do this to us?
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?
You will let them go.
You will gladly let them go!
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not a murderer!
I know you're not.
You know?
You are evil.
No, Judah, I am not evil.
I wanted your help.
Now you've given it to me.
By making this example of you, I discourage treason.
By condemning without hesitation an old friend, I shall be feared.
But not my family.
Let them go.
Please.
-Messala, I beg you.
-Beg?
!
Didn't I beg you?
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.
Kill me, and your mother and sister will die...
... nailedtocrossesinfrontofyou !
Go on, Judah.
Kill me!
May God grant me vengeance.
I will pray that you live till I return.
Return?
Take him.
Sentries, salute.
The tribune will see you now.
Tribune, I'm steward of the House of Hur.
I remember you.
We were on our way to Antioch when we heard what had happened.
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done this thing.
You knew him, tribune.
Better than you.
Then there must be no doubt in your mind, the charge is groundless.
The prisoners have been sentenced.
-Sentenced?
-But there's no truth in it.
There was never a threat against the governor in Judah's mind.
Surely you must know he would never have done this.
In your heart, you must know it.
Drusus.
This man had better be kept here until we can question him.
Hold!
Water for the soldiers.
Soldiers first!
Get away from that well.
No water for them!
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!
Come on, you!
Water for the horses!
-Water.
Water.
-Soldiers first!
Here.
Wait.
No water for him.
God...
... helpme.
You!
I said no water for him!
All right, on your feet, all of you!
Get them on their feet!
Back in line, you dog!
On your feet!
Get them going!
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!
Forward, you dogs!
Soon, the counselor's barge will be coming alongside.
Be ready to raise oars.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.
-How many rowers?
-Two hundred, consul.
-And reliefs?
-Of 30, every hour.
This man is ill.
Replace him.
-Change him.
-Right, sir.
-This man's been giving you trouble?
-He's insubordinate, consul.
That will stop.
What service have you seen?
Forty-one.
A month's less a day in this ship.
You keep an exact account.
And before?
Three years in other ships.
Three years.
You have the spirit to fight back...
... butthegoodsensetocontrolit.
Your eyes are full of hate, 41 .
That's good.
Hate keeps a man alive.
It gives him strength.
Now, listen to me, all of you.
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
So row well...
... andlive.
-Ship ready, consul.
-Strike oars.
Strike oars!
You know a fleet of Macedonian galleys...
... hasbeenraidingRomancommerce.
The emperor has honored us with the task...
... ofseekingoutand destroyingthem .
Battle speed, hortator.
Battle speed!
Attack speed.
Attack speed!
Ramming speed.
Ramming speed!
Rest.
Halt!
Rest!
Why are you here?
I was ordered to report to you during my relief.
Oh, yes.
I'd forgotten.
You could have killed me as I lay there.
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?
I'm not ready to die.
What do you think will save you?
The God of my fathers.
Your God has forsaken you.
He has no more power than the images I pray to.
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.
I might.
Does that interest you, 41 ?
I can see that it does.
I'm a fighting man by profession, and in my leisure moments...
... itamusesme to trainfightingmen.
I own some of the best gladiators and charioteers in Rome.
Would you like to become one of them?
To die as your slave?
Better than to live in chains below these decks.
I will not be here forever.
No?
What would you do if you escaped?
Two people were condemned with me, my mother and sister...
... thoughtheywereinnocent.
I won't rest--
Do not say that you were innocent.
-Would it do any good to say it again?
-No.
Consider my offer carefully.
You will never escape while we are victorious.
If we are not, you will sink with this ship, chained to your oar.
I cannot believe that God has let me live these years...
... todiechainedtoanoar.
It's a strange, stubborn faith you keep...
... tobelievethat existence has a purpose.
A sane man would have learned to lose it long before this.
As you have.
What drove it out of you?
Go back to your oar, 41 .
Consul, enemy sighted.
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.
All the watch to battle posts.
-Stand by to load.
-Make ready to fire.
Hurry, quick!
Hurry up with that resin.
Get some more ammunition.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
Chain rowers!
Guard.
Unlock 41 .
No!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
41 , why did he do that?
I don't know.
Once before, a man helped me.
I didn't know why then.
Normal speed!
Number 1 , flame.
Fire.
Fire!
Fire!
Hold withdrawal on command.
Lift oars!
Raise!
Withdraw!
Steersman, right.
Extend oars!
Fire!
-Watch out!
-Fire!
Steersman, ram course!
Order below!
-Ramming speed!
-Ramming speed!
Consul, barge on ramming course.
We're going to be rammed!
We're going to be rammed!
Why did you save me?
Why did you have me unchained?
What is your name, 41 ?
Judah Ben-Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur...
... letmedie.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
Row well and live.
Is the sail square?
I can't tell.
Better for us both if it's the enemy.
My death.
Your freedom.
It's a Roman sail.
Face rear!
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.
Water.
The fleet, all lost?
Five galleys.
-And the battle?
-The battle was won.
You have a victory.
-It was a victory?
-Complete.
In His eagerness to save you...
... yourGodhasalsosaved the Roman fleet.
Hail Arrius!
Right oars!
You have cleared the seaways of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.
This baton of victory has been nobly won.
This man riding beside you, who is he?
The man who saved me, divine emperor, to return and serve you.
Is that all you know about him?
No.
He was accused of an attack on the governor of Judea.
But he was innocent.
If not, there's a strange inconsistency in this man...
... whotriesto killmygovernor, yet saves the life of my consul.
Come tomorrow.
We'll talk of it.
We have all the information on this man...
... amanof someinfluence in his own country.
His attack upon our governor is one upon the senate and the people of Rome.
I am convinced that no such attack was intended.
Consul, allow us to continue.
Allow us to be generous.
As a reward to you for your great victory...
... weshallnotsendhimbackto the galleys.
Take him as your slave.
Such is the will of the senate...
... andthepeopleofRome .
Not long ago, I returned to Rome...
... witha youngman who had saved my life.
You all know him as the finest charioteer in Rome.
Five times, he's driven my horses to victory.
I know him as one who stands in the place of the son I lost.
I have the love and pride in a son's achievements...
... whichI thought I should never have again.
Nothing could make stronger our bond...
... buttonightIwish to share it with you all.
The formalities of adoption have been completed.
Young Arrius is now the legal bearer of my name...
... andtheheirtomyproperty.
This ring of my ancestors...
... wouldhavegonetomyson.
So now it is yours.
It's a strange destiny that brought me to a new life...
... anewhome...
... anewfather.
It brought me here.
It may take me away.
But wherever I may be...
... Ishallalwaystry towear this ring as a son of Arrius should.
With gratitude and affection...
... andwithhonor.
My old friend Pontius Pilate, young Arrius.
Before you came to this city, my horses always won.
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.
Yes, but not swift enough to defeat you.
-Tell me, you come from Judea?
-Yes, sir.
I hear that the climate is difficult to live in.
Not for Judeans.
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.
-Of Judea?
-Yes.
I asked for Alexandria.
But it seems the wilderness needs my particular talents.
The scorpions and holy prophets can't get on without me.
Lay the dust of Judea, at least for this evening.
Goats and Jehovah.
You're leaving.
I must.
It's a journey I can't keep you from.
Your eyes have never left it all these months.
I can recognize pain.
But still, my counsel is to wait.
Gratus is to be replaced.
The governorship goes to Pontius Pilate.
When?
Very soon.
It's very much to our purpose.
Nothing is to the purpose if, when I come back to Judea, I come too late.
That is the thought which has punished me every moment I've spent here.
Will Rome see you again?
Here is a part of my life which you have made for me.
I shall remember it.
Whoever the gods are, they take small interest in an old man's hopes.
They have their way.
Forgive me.
You're a stranger here.
Would you be from Nazareth?
Why do you ask?
I thought...
... youmightbe theone--
The one that I have come back from my country to find.
He would be about your age.
Who?
When I find Him...
... IshallknowHim .
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.
Sack of flesh without brains!
No!
No!
Not the whip!
That is my host.
Gently!
Gently!
Fool!
Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood.
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run!
Go on!
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!
Beautiful horses.
Now!
Now!
They are ready!
Let them go!
Watch.
They'll never hold the turn.
No!
No!
Abadon, stop him!
Stop that whip!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill--!
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!
You think you can treat my horses like animals?
!
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!
Get off, idiot!
Drive goats, not horses!
I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.
Not a team?
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.
-Antares.
-The slow one?
He should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?
In the circus in Rome.
You have driven in the great circus?
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.
No other animal has descended so in scale...
... fromthefirstinnocentfalling of the world.
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.
Yes.
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.
Your coming here was so fit, so right.
We might have achieved wonders!
You have to go.
I make a journey which will not wait.
Ah, well, then perhaps you will come back.
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.
I have no wives.
No wives at all?
I have six, no, seven.
I've counted eight.
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.
-Someday, I hope to have one.
-One wife!
One God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.
It is not generous.
-Was the food not to your liking?
-Indeed.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.
And now I must say good night to my beauties.
When ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.
-I'll make my farewells then.
-No, no, no, stay.
Stay and see them.
Come, my children.
Come.
Strangers make them shy.
Come.
Come, do not be afraid.
Come.
There, my children.
They are descended from the Arabians of the Pharaohs...
... andI havenamedthem for the stars.
Come, Antares.
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.
What?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.
Come, Rigel.
We've both supped well, and the world is good.
There's my good Rigel.
Yes, you are ready for sleep.
The day's work done for you, eh?
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.
Good night.
Good night, my treasure.
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.
No.
You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.
You should see their mother, Mira.
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.
All right, all right.
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.
You must be strong and swift.
Go, my children.
Go.
At Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams...
... andthechampionoftheEast, Messala, with his black devils.
He stops at nothing to win.
-Messala?
ln the circus?
-Yes.
You knew him?
I know him.
Perhaps without much liking.
My people are praying for a man...
... todrivetheirteam to victory over Messala.
You could be that man, the one...
... tostamphisarrogance into the sand.
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them...
... onewhowillrulethem with love .
For him, they'd outrace the wind.
It's not possible.
That is a pity.
Think of it.
To break his pride...
... tohumblethistribunebefore the very people he has degraded.
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!
I know it is not possible.
Does it not delight your imagination?
Does it not answer your purpose?
I must deal with Messala in my own way.
And your way is to kill him.
I see this terrible thing in your eyes.
But no matter what this man has done, you have no right to kill him.
He will be punished inevitably.
I don't believe in miracles.
But all life is a miracle.
Why will you not accept God's judgment?
You do not believe in miracles.
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness...
... anda starledme to a village called Bethlehem...
... whereI foundanewbornchild in a manger.
And God lived in this child.
By now, He is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.
That is why I have returned here...
... sothatImay beathand when He comes among us.
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.
Perhaps He's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.
Perhaps He is a shepherd...
... amerchant,afisherman.
But He lives...
... andallourlivesfrom nowon will carry His mark.
There are many paths to God, my son.
I hope yours will not be too difficult.
I'm ready for sleep.
Balthasar is a good man...
... butuntilallmen are likehim, we must keep our swords bright.
And our intention true.
So I must leave you.
One last thought.
There is no law in the arena.
Many are killed.
I hope to see you again.
Fine Damascus silk.
Fine Damascus silk.
Esther?
It's Judah.
You are alive.
You are alive.
What are you doing here?
What has happened?
I'm here.
I'm with you.
Where's your father?
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.
They tortured him.
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.
You never went back to Antioch?
No.
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.
Where are my mother and sister?
Let me tell him first.
Father.
Father, something wonderful has happened.
Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
He has come home.
He is here.
Judah.
Judah Ben-Hur.
My dear old friend.
Let me look at you.
Let me see you.
Yes, yes.
It is true.
Praise God for His mercy.
Where are they?
Since that terrible day...
... therehasbeennoword ofthem.
You should have been less loyal.
Do not pity me, Master Judah.
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.
We were released on the same day.
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.
Since then, I have been his tongue...
... andhehasbeenmylegs.
Together, we make a considerable man.
Old friend.
She always said you would return.
She never gave up hope.
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.
I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.
But suppose that isn't possible.
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.
They could not make me tell them where it is.
It is there still...
... toputpowerintoourhands and buy death for the Romans.
That's not why I came back.
Judah, they are dead.
Four years.
No one could live so long in the dungeons.
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?
Yes, it is true.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You have come back to us like a returning faith.
Judah, I should like to laugh again.
-Let us laugh.
-We will.
There will be joy again in this house.
We will celebrate among the dust.
I will take him.
We stood here before.
A long while ago.
Four years.
But now it seems as if...
... onlyyesterday... .
I was saying:
"If you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye. "
"If I were not a bride...
... therewouldbe no goodbyes to be said. "
I am not a bride.
Why did you never marry?
My father needed me.
And also... .
It's still on my finger.
I said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.
It's become a part of my hand.
If Messala once knew you were here... .
As he must.
He will know where they are.
And if you should find... ?
-If he says they're dead--
-Messala will wish they were living.
I've seen too much of what hate can do.
My father is burned up with it.
But I've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater...
... andlovemorepowerfulthan hatred.
I believe it.
-Esther.
-Judah.
Stay alive.
Keep away from Messala.
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.
That time isn't yet come.
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.
This time you will be destroyed.
You'll die.
Tribune, compliments of Quintus Arrius.
He awaits your pleasure.
-Consul here?
-Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.
Thank him.
Bring him to me.
-I didn't know the consul had a son.
-He's a champion of the great circus.
Why is he presenting me with gifts?
-Perhaps he'll race against you.
-Look.
It's magnificent.
And from a man I've never met.
You're wrong, Messala.
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?
You were the magician, Messala.
You condemned me to the galleys.
When my ship was sunk, I saved the consul's life.
You know his seal?
Now I have come back...
... asI sworeIwould.
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.
You suggest I use it on myself?
What has become of my mother and my sister?
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.
Find them, Messala.
Restore them to me, and I'll forget what I vowed...
... witheverystrokeofthat oar you chained me to.
I am not the governor.
I can do nothing without approval.
Then get it.
I will come back tomorrow.
Don't disappoint me, Messala.
What became of them?
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?
Go to the citadel, Drusus.
Find out.
-And if they're dead?
-They're dead!
"Miriam, wife.
Tirzah, daughter. "
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?
E section...
... lowerlevel.
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.
Water.
Water.
Let me out!
-How long since you've seen them?
-Never.
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.
The food disappears.
Lepers.
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.
Then we'll burn out the cell.
Is someone there?
There is someone there.
Who are you?
Don't come any closer.
Who are you?
Esther.
It's Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam?
Stay where you are.
You have come home.
Stand back, Esther.
We are lepers.
Oh, Esther.
Tirzah.
Esther...
... isJudahliving?
Yes, he is alive.
He is here.
Where?
He is searching for you now.
I must find him and tell him.
-No!
-Tell my father.
No.
Tell no one.
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.
We won't return.
Judah has to be told.
No.
Please.
I couldn't see his face.
Is it changed?
No, he is not changed.
He's not changed.
You love him, Esther.
Promise me...
... onyourlovefor him ...
... youwillnevertellhim you've seen us.
Is he never to know?
Let him remember us as we were.
Promise me.
There's nothing else I can hope for.
Only this.
I promise.
I am content.
Wait.
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.
I pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.
He'll free them.
He wants to survive.
He cannot free them, Judah.
What do you mean?
I saw them.
You saw them?
Where?
When did you see them?
They were dead.
They were dead.
When?
When?
When?
!
In the prison.
When I was waiting for news of my father.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't tell you.
Nor even you, Father.
I was afraid that if you saw Messala... .
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.
It's over now.
Over?
-Judah.
-Over?
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.
Gentlemen.
Officers.
Defenders of great Rome's imperium...
... mayI enter?
Certainly, sheik.
You do us an unexpected honor.
The noble tribune is most gracious.
And now...
... thequestionyou'reasking:
Why am I here?
As you know, I am a gambling man.
The games approach.
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.
I will back my own poor horses.
No limits?
-Mark me first!
-And me!
-What odds?
-A moment, please...
... mylords,protectors of the far flung marshes.
May I first sit down?
Sit.
How much will you wager?
-Yes, let's call his game.
-Give the Arab a seat.
A bench, quickly.
Thank you.
-Now.
-1 000 denarii.
-2000!
-Mark me!
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient.
There is time.
First gentlemen, the odds.
The tribune has won many times.
The odds should be in the same measure.
What is your pleasure, gentlemen?
Two to one.
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth...
... whereisthecourage that made Rome master of the world?
I can get better odds on any street market.
Three to one.
Let us not haggle.
Let us be fair.
In four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.
-In all truth--
-Just a moment.
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.
The Prince of Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur.
Prince of Hur?
-He was sent to the galleys years ago.
-He has returned.
Returned?
lmpossible.
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.
Well?
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.
You, tribune...
... willyougivemefour toone?
Four to one.
Good.
Four to one, sheik.
The difference between a Roman and a Jew.
Or an Arab.
Bravely spoken.
Now we will settle the amount of our wager.
I will venture... .
A thousand talents?
-A thousand talents?
-Yes, a thousand talents.
Of course, if it is too much... .
A thousand talents it will be.
Agreed.
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.
You're good fellows.
If only men were this good.
Remember, Altair...
... ninetimesaroundthe circus.
Aldebaran.
Rigel, did you hear?
Nine lives to live.
My swift fellow.
You must not win the race the first time around.
You win the last time around.
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.
Steady Antares.
Like a rock.
You will be our anchor.
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.
They have taken me into their family.
Rest well, my stars.
Tomorrow we go up to the city.
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it...
... thenewswillscorchthestreets of the Roman world.
Pontius Pilate here?
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.
You will make him see what men are born in this land.
I only know that I race against Messala.
Look for the yoke.
Ease that strap.
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.
Into Your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as You will.
The Star of David.
To shine out for your people and my people together...
... andblindtheeyesofRome.
They are ready.
Easy, girl, easy.
Number five.
Where is number five?
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.
Yes, this is the day.
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.
Hail, Jupiter.
Give me victory.
Watch your line!
Keep your places!
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.
Citizens...
... Iwelcomeyoutothesegames in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.
We dedicate them to his glory...
... andtothegloryofRome...
... ofwhichyouare all part.
Let us honor those who race for us today.
They come here from Alexandria...
... Messina...
... Carthage...
... Cyprus...
... Rome...
... Corinth...
... Athens...
... Phrygia...
... andJudea.
To the best of these, a crown of victory.
The race begins.
Hail, Caesar!
Come, my children, come!
The Roman pig!
Salute.
A great victory.
You are the people's one true god...
... forthetimebeing.
Permit us to worship.
I crown their god.
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.
A long life, young Arrius and the good sense to live it.
We cannot wait, tribune.
He will come.
He will--
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.
He will come!
He will come.
I've sent for him, and he will come.
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.
Do you understand?
To hack the legs off me?
Not yet.
Not till I've seen him.
I don't receive him with half a body.
No!
I told you, Drusus.
I told you.
Here he is.
Triumph complete, Judah.
The race won.
The enemy destroyed.
I see no enemy.
What do you think you see?
The smashed body of a wretched animal?
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.
Let me help you.
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.
Dead.
And the race over.
It isn't over, Judah.
They're not dead.
Where are they?
Where are they?
Look for them...
... intheValleyoftheLepers...
... ifyoucanrecognizethem .
It goes on.
It goes on, Judah.
The race... .
The race is not over.
Is there a way down here?
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.
Man.
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.
There are many women.
Of the family of Hur.
We have no names here.
For them?
-Why did you say they were dead?
-It was what they wanted.
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?
Not to see them?
They are coming.
Love them in the way they must need to be loved.
Not to look at them.
Let them be as if you had never come here.
Please!
Is Judah well?
Is he happy?
Yes, he is well.
Your mind can be at rest for him.
He is well, Miriam.
God be with you.
They have gone.
We can go back.
Go back to what?
Judah, they have one blessing left.
To think you remember them as they were...
... andliveyourown life.
Forget what is here.
Forget?
It's as though they're alive in a grave.
-But what can you do?
-Undo what you've done.
How could you have suffered them to come here?
I must see them.
No, Judah, please!
Judah!
Think, Judah, think.
It would tear them apart if they see you.
He is here.
I have found Him.
The child has become a man.
And the man, I know it now, is the Son of God.
The promise is true.
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.
Life has been answered.
God has answered it.
Come.
Come with me.
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys...
... thirsthadnearlykilledme.
A man gave me water to drink.
I went on living.
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.
No.
I am thirsty still.
Come and listen.
I have business with Rome.
You insist on death.
Goodbye, Judah.
You sent for me?
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.
-I honor him.
-As you may honor yourself.
You have been made a citizen of Rome.
Do you say nothing to this?
I have just come from the Valley of Stone...
... wheremymotherand sisterlive what's left of their lives.
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.
I have heard this.
There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.
Where there is greatness, great government or power...
... evengreatfeelingorcompassion...
... erroralsois great.
We progress and mature by fault.
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.
There are other voices.
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place...
... nottocrucifyyourself on a shadow such as old resentment...
... orimpossibleloyalties.
Perfect freedom has no existence.
A grown man knows the world he lives in.
And for the present, the world is Rome.
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.
I am Judah Ben-Hur.
I cross this floor in spoken friendship...
... asI wouldspeaktoArrius.
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar...
... readytocrushthose who challenge his authority.
There are too many men of envy and ambition...
... whotryto disrupt the government of Rome.
You have become the victor and hero to those people.
They look to you, their one true god, as I call you.
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.
I am already part of this tragedy.
Return this to Arrius.
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you...
... frompersonaldisaster if you stay here.
You are too great a danger.
Leave Judea.
You have my word.
I was afraid you would never come back...
... afraidofwhatwouldhappentoyou .
But I see you again.
Your father's waiting for me.
Where is he?
What do you mean to do?
Rest, sleep.
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.
Peace?
Love and peace.
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?
Where do you see them?
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.
Balthasar's word.
He is more than Balthasar's word.
His voiced traveled with such a still purpose.
It was more than a voice.
A man more than a man.
He said, "Blessed are the merciful...
... fortheyshallobtainmercy.
Blessed are the peacemakers...
... fortheyshallbecalled the children of God. "
Children of God?
In that dead valley where we left them?
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean...
... untilwehavescouredoff our bodies the crust and filth...
... ofbeingat themercyoftyranny.
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.
-In blood?
-Yes, in blood!
I know there is a law in life.
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.
Death generates death...
... asthevulturebreedsthevulture.
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:
"Love your enemy.
Do good to those who despitefully use you. "
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.
As you make us do now.
Are we to bear nothing together?
Even love?
I can hardly draw breath...
... withoutfeelingyouinmyheart .
But I know...
... thateverythingIdo from this moment...
... bearsgreaterpain than you have ever suffered.
It is better not to love me.
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy...
... givingevilforevil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.
It's as though you had become Messala.
I've lost you, Judah.
No further.
What are you doing here?
I was here last evening waiting for you.
I have waited all night.
What has happened?
Where is Tirzah?
Leave the food.
I am coming closer.
Don't be afraid.
-What are you doing?
-Don't be afraid.
I've heard Him again, the man from Nazareth.
If ever words were from God, they are in everything He says.
I cannot bear that you should have never known...
... thishandof quiet reaching towards us.
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find Him there.
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find Him.
Tirzah is dying.
Leave the food and go.
It's Judah.
Why did you tell him?
Yes, Judah, yes.
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.
Mother.
Wait, Mother, wait.
Let me talk with you.
Please.
No, no further.
Please.
No, Judah.
Son, no.
Mother, let me see Tirzah.
Tirzah is dying.
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know...
... thatlifeis everlasting...
... anddeathis nothingtofear if you have faith.
I will take them to Him.
No!
God, no!
No, no, dear son.
Mother...
... whereisTirzah?
Judah, no.
Judah, no.
You must not go to her, dear son.
Please.
Dear son.
I am afraid.
No cause.
The world is more than we know.
Tirzah, it's Judah.
No, Judah.
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
-Why are the streets deserted?
-They have gone to the trial.
Trial?
Whose trial?
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.
-This cannot be true.
-Alms?
What has he done?
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.
Help for the blind.
-Look, lepers!
-Lepers!
Get away!
Stay away!
Go away!
Lepers!
Lepers!
How can this be?
I know this man.
Will someone help Him?
Take pity on Him.
Have mercy.
In His pain...
... thislookof peace.
Watch over them, Esther.
We must go back.
I brought you here to this...
... whenI hoped... .
You haven't failed, Esther.
Hail King of the Jews!
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.
He gave me water...
... anda heartto live.
What has He done to merit this?
He has taken the world of our sins onto Himself.
To this end He said He was born...
... inthatstable...
... whereI firstsawHim .
For this cause, He came into the world.
For this death?
This beginning.
I have lived too long.
As though He were carrying in that cross...
... thepainof theworld.
So fearful, and yet why is it...
... I'mnotafraidanymore?
The shadow of a storm.
A strange darkness...
... butstillday.
His life is over.
What is it?
This tearing.
I am in pain.
I feel it too.
Do you see your hand?
Almost at the moment He died...
... IheardHimsay , "Father, forgive them...
... fortheyknownot whatthey do."
Even then.
Even then.
And I felt His voice take the sword out of my hand.
In the year of our Lord Judea, for nearly a century, had lain under the mastery of Rome.
In the seventh year of the reign of Augustus Caesar an imperial decree ordered every Judean each to return to his place of birth to be counted and taxed.
Converging ways of many of them led to their capital city, Jerusalem the troubled heart of their land.
The old city was dominated by the fortress of Antonia the seat of Roman power and by the great golden temple the outward sign of an inward and imperishable faith.
Even while they obeyed the will of Caesar the people clung proudly to their ancient heritage always remembering the promise of their prophets that one day there would be born among them a redeemer to bring them salvation and perfect freedom.
You'll be counted at Hebron.
- Name?
- Samuel.
- What city?
- Joppa.
- What family?
- Michael.
- Move on.
Move on.
- Yes.
- Name?
- Joseph.
- What city?
- Nazareth.
- What family?
- David of Bethlehem.
And the woman?
My wife.
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.
Come on, come on.
What village is this?
Nazareth.
We should arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow night.
You're not watching the soldiers, Joseph?
We've seen Romans before.
Yes and we will see them again.
My table is not finished.
Where is your son?
He's walking in the hills.
He neglects his work, Joseph.
No.
Once, I reproached him with forgetting his work.
He said to me:
"I must be about my father's business."
Then why isn't he here, working?
He's working.
Trumpeters of the legion!
Welcome, Messala.
The command is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for relieving me.
Drusus when I was a boy, I dreamed of commanding this garrison.
Now the wheel has turned.
I am in command.
Attention!
Aisle one, face right!
Forward!
I'd forgotten the heat.
If it were only the heat.
I lived here until I was 14.
Jerusalem was my home.
- My father was head of...
- Yes, I know.
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.
If there can be such a thing in this forsaken land.
If you want to rise, Sextus, do the difficult.
I asked to be sent here.
You'll find the people changed since you were a boy.
In what way?
Oh, won't pay their taxes, an irrational resentment of Rome...
There's nothing new in all that.
And then there's religion.
I tell you, they're drunk with religion.
They smash the statues of our gods, even those of the emperor.
Punish them.
We do.
When we can find them.
Find the leaders.
You don't know.
There's nothing you can put your finger on.
There are strange forces at work here.
This "messiah" business...
I know.
There was one predicted when I was a boy.
A king of the Jews, who will lead them into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.
Makes your head spin.
There's a wild man in the desert named John who drowns people in water.
And a carpenter's son who does magic tricks. "Miracles" they call them.
There's always a rabble-rouser stirring up trouble.
No, no, no.
This man is different.
He teaches that God is near, in every man.
It's actually quite profound, some of it.
You've been too long away from Rome.
Go back, Sextus.
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea and forget that God is in every man.
- There is divinity in only one man.
- Yes, I know.
The emperor is displeased.
He wishes Judea made into a more obedient and disciplined province.
He's ordered me to restore order.
I shall carry out his wishes.
How?
You can break a man's skull, arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.
But how do you control this?
How do you fight an idea?
Especially a new idea.
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.
I assume he has a name.
- He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
- Then treat him like one!
Tell him I will join him.
Yes, tribune.
Centurion!
This was his country before it was ours.
Don't forget that.
Yes, tribune.
Very wise.
This Ben-Hur is the richest man in Jerusalem.
And the head of one of the greatest families in Judea.
We were friends as boys.
We were like brothers.
Sextus you ask how to fight an idea.
Well, I'll tell you how.
With another idea.
I said I'd come back.
I never thought you would.
I'm so glad.
- Look at you.
- Look at you!
You've come back a tribune.
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.
We'll drink another now.
- Your sister and mother?
- They're fine.
They've talked of you ever since we knew you were coming.
- ls Tirzah married?
- No.
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.
She's been in love with you since she was 5.
I can't wait to see them.
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?
Or have you become too dignified?
- Down Eros, up Mars!
- Down Eros, up Mars!
Where the beams cross?
Good.
After all these years!
Still close.
In every way.
I hope so.
I know.
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew whose life you once saved.
The best thing I ever did.
Judah it will be very difficult to govern here.
I'm going to need help.
Your help.
Your advice.
- You want my advice?
- Yes, I do.
Withdraw your legions.
Give us our freedom.
Unfortunately, the emperor is devoted to his empire.
He's particularly fond of Judea.
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.
My quarters.
A bit grim.
Not grim.
Austere.
Virtuous.
Roman.
I'm going to be second-in-command to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.
He's coming in a few days with more legions.
Then the rumors are true.
The emperor does not approve of your countrymen.
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.
But you and your family need have no concern.
I'm next in authority to the governor, and you're my friend.
- I'm a Jew.
- Ah, you are like a Roman!
What have you in common with the troublemaking rabble?
- They're my people.
I'm one of them.
- Be wise, Judah.
It's a Roman world.
If you want to live in it, you must become part of it.
You've changed.
I've grown up.
I've seen the world since I left Jerusalem.
I've seen Rome.
It's no accident that one small village on the Tiber was chosen to rule the world.
Your legions.
It wasn't just our legions.
Other countries have armies, fine armies.
I know, I fought them.
Oh, no.
No, it was fate that chose us to civilize the world.
And we have.
Our roads and ships connect every corner of the earth.
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.
I believe in the future of my people.
Of course you do.
And you can help them.
How?
You're an aristocrat.
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince to your people.
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.
They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.
Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.
It is worse than stupid, futile!
For it can end in only one way, extinction for your people!
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.
Then we're agreed!
Now, when can I come to see your family?
- We had hoped tomorrow.
- Good.
And now for our toast.
It's dreadful wine, by the way.
It's especially fermented for the Roman army.
You're very cruel to your conquerors.
It's an insane world.
But in it there is one sanity:
The loyalty of old friends.
Judah, we must believe in one another.
Will you drink to that?
With all my heart.
Here it is, the place I've remembered.
The court where we played at changing the guard.
The roof where we'd throw pebbles at people in the street and then hide.
- We were rascals, weren't we?
- No, you were good boys.
I would have that time again.
And here it is.
Nothing has changed.
Except for the fountain.
- The old well would go dry, remember?
- Promptly, every summer.
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.
- He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
- No?
Of course he has.
He was a boy when he left us, now he's a man.
With great responsibilities.
Come.
The emperor builds and builds, turning brick to marble.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.
I've never seen anything like this before.
It's beautiful!
- ls it Roman?
- It's Libyan.
I was there last year.
A tremendous campaign.
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.
Or was, till we destroyed it.
Now it's nothing but ashes.
I'm boring you with soldier stories.
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.
Thank you for this.
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.
What do you think of it?
Magnificent.
It's Arabic.
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.
Let me try him sometime.
Whenever you like.
He's yours.
Do you mean you'll give me this?
Oh, Judah.
You are good.
It's going to be like old times, I know it.
Judah, tell me, did you think about what I said?
Yes.
Talked to a number of people already.
Spoken against violence, against incidents.
Most of the men agree with me.
Most?
Not all?
No, not all.
Who does not agree?
Well, the resenttul, the impatient.
Who are they?
Yes, Judah.
Who are they?
Would I retain your friendship if I became an informer?
Telling the names of criminals is not informing.
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.
Patriots?
!
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.
This is my great opportunity, and yours too.
If I bring order here, I can have any post I want.
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?
Rome!
Yes, perhaps at the side of Caesar himself.
I mean it.
It can happen and this is the moment.
I swear, this is the time.
The emperor is watching us, judging us.
All I need do is serve him.
And all you need do is help me serve him.
- You speak as if he were God.
- He is God.
The only God.
He is power, real power on earth, not...
Not that.
Help me, Judah.
I would do anything for you, Messala except betray my own people.
In the name of all the gods, what do the lives of a few Jews mean to you?
If I cannot persuade them, that does not mean I would help you murder them.
Besides, you must understand this, Messala.
I believe in the past and future of my people.
Future?
You are a conquered people.
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?
Joshua will not rise again to save you nor David.
There is only one reality in the world today.
Look to the West.
Don't be a fool!
Look to Rome!
Better a fool than a traitor or a killer.
- I am a soldier.
- Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.
- I warn you...
- No!
I warn you.
Rome is an affront to God.
Rome is strangling my people and my country, the whole earth!
But not forever.
And I tell you, the day Rome falls there will be a shout of freedom such as the world has never heard before.
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.
You're either for me or against me.
If that is the choice then I am against you.
There they are.
Where's Messala?
- Where's...?
- He's gone.
Gone?
- But why?
- He couldn't stay.
- What happened?
- A new tribune must have many duties.
Come.
Let us have dinner.
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, lKing of the world who bringeth to us bread from the earth.
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.
He wanted to use me to betray our people.
- Master, the caravan from Antioch.
- Yes, Amrah, I saw.
Simonides.
Welcome.
- Oh, welcome homecoming.
- Master.
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.
And for the master, lberian wine.
Not to mention the best gift of all, your presence.
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.
- Caravans from Petra.
- Have all arrived.
- Good.
- Here is the accounting.
And what of Numidia?
The trade route is ours, guaranteed by treaty with the king.
Once a year, you bring your accounting.
And once a year, I find myself wealthier.
Yeah, but my greatest treasure is my steward.
My life belongs to the House of Hur.
Nothing else exists for me, except my daughter.
- She must be a young woman by now.
- Yes, and your property.
She was born the daughter of your slave.
When I inherited you, I inherited a friend, not a slave.
Still, Esther has come with me from Antioch for your permission to marry.
It's granted.
I wish you the joy of many grandchildren.
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.
With your permission, Esther wishes to speak to her master.
You're eager to marry, Esther?
It is my father's wish.
Your husband will be fortunate.
What is his name?
David, son of Mathias.
Of what house?
- His own, master.
- He is a freeman.
Tell me more about him.
I have seen him only once.
He is a merchant, well-thought-of in Antioch.
He will pay for Esther's freedom.
Her freedom will be my wedding gift to Esther.
You are generous, master.
Do you love this man?
I will learn to love him.
You have my permission to marry.
We'll drink to your happiness.
And a safe return to Antioch.
I disturbed you.
No.
What were you thinking?
I was saying goodbye to this city and this house.
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?
My father sometimes brought me here when I was little.
It was a house where I was always happy.
Except once.
When you and your friend, the Roman boy...
- Messala.
- Yes.
You had been out hunting and they brought you home injured.
I touched your face as you lay there and prayed to God, "Don't let this boy die."
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.
Yes, master.
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.
It's strange.
I hardly felt a slave.
And now I hardly feel free.
You know, in the old, wise days of Solomon if there was among his slaves some girl who filled his eyes he could choose her out from the rest and take her to him.
Wise days of Solomon.
Different days.
And long ago.
If you were not a bride I should kiss you goodbye.
If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said.
Your slave ring.
Fair exchange.
Freedom to you.
The ring to me.
You will wear it?
Until you meet the woman you will marry?
Yes.
Until then.
The gods favor my lord Gratus.
If it is the governor's pleasure, the wreath of office.
Thank you, tribune.
I see no delegation from the city.
- There will not be one, sir.
- No?
Jerusalem's welcome will not be a warm one.
But I pledge, my lord, it will be a quiet one.
Let us proceed.
There's Messala.
He saw you, Judah.
The new governor.
Stand back!
- Stand back.
- You, come!
Had to be the Jews!
Open up in the name of the divine emperor!
Judah!
Tirzah!
What is it?
What's happened?
Open up in the name of the law!
- I was watching the...
- A tile fell and struck the governor.
- It wasn't my fault.
- They won't believe her.
She won't have to say anything.
You hear?
Tirzah, say nothing.
Open the gates!
I'll speak to them.
- Arrest him!
- Let me tell you what happened.
- Hold those women.
- Stop them!
It was an accident.
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.
- This is the man, sir.
We saw him.
- It was an accident.
- Accident?
- I swear it.
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose.
It gave way.
Take him.
Take all of them.
- He's telling the truth!
- It was me!
Let them go!
Attention!
Messala.
In the name of God, tell them it's a mistake.
I leaned on the tile, and it broke loose.
It was an accident.
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!
Let the servants go.
Let them go.
Return to your ranks.
Come.
Where?
Tirus.
Tirus?
I've had no trial.
I'm to die in the galleys without even a trial?
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!
Wait.
My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?
Tie his hands.
- At least tell me if they're safe.
- I can tell you nothing.
Get along. lKeep moving.
Jailer!
Guard, in there!
Up the stairs!
Jailer!
Jailer!
To the right.
- Wait!
- Send them out.
Send them out.
Go!
The door.
Where are my mother and sister?
Where are they?
Here, within these walls.
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.
Of course, they will be sentenced.
ls it possible?
ls it possible you could do this to us?
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?
You will let them go.
You will gladly let them go!
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not a murderer!
I know you're not.
You know?
You are evil.
No, Judah, I am not evil.
I wanted your help.
Now you've given it to me.
By making this example of you, I discourage treason.
By condemning without hesitation an old friend, I shall be feared.
But not my family.
Let them go.
Please.
- Messala, I beg you.
- Beg?
!
Didn't I beg you?
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.
Kill me, and your mother and sister will die nailed to crosses in front of you!
Go on, Judah.
Kill me!
May God grant me vengeance.
I will pray that you live till I return.
Return?
Take him.
Sentries, salute.
The tribune will see you now.
Tribune, I'm steward of the House of Hur.
I remember you.
We were on our way to Antioch when we heard what had happened.
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done this thing.
You knew him, tribune.
Better than you.
Then there must be no doubt in your mind, the charge is groundless.
The prisoners have been sentenced.
- Sentenced?
- But there's no truth in it.
There was never a threat against the governor in Judah's mind.
Surely you must know he would never have done this.
In your heart, you must know it.
Drusus.
This man had better be kept here until we can question him.
Hold!
Water for the soldiers.
Soldiers first!
Get away from that well.
No water for them!
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!
Come on, you!
Water for the horses!
- Water.
Water.
- Soldiers first!
Here.
Wait.
No water for him.
God help me.
You!
I said no water for him!
All right, on your feet, all of you!
Get them on their feet!
Back in line, you dog!
On your feet!
Get them going!
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!
Forward, you dogs!
Soon, the counselor's barge will be coming alongside.
Be ready to raise oars.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.
- How many rowers?
- Two hundred, consul.
- And reliefs?
- Of 30, every hour.
This man is ill.
Replace him.
- Change him.
- Right, sir.
- This man's been giving you trouble?
- He's insubordinate, consul.
That will stop.
What service have you seen?
Forty-one.
A month's less a day in this ship.
You keep an exact account.
And before?
Three years in other ships.
Three years.
You have the spirit to fight back but the good sense to control it.
Your eyes are full of hate, 41 .
That's good.
Hate keeps a man alive.
It gives him strength.
Now, listen to me, all of you.
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
So row well and live.
- Ship ready, consul.
- Strike oars.
Strike oars!
You know a fleet of Macedonian galleys has been raiding Roman commerce.
The emperor has honored us with the task of seeking out and destroying them.
Battle speed, hortator.
Battle speed!
Attack speed.
Attack speed!
Ramming speed.
Ramming speed!
Rest.
Halt!
Rest!
Why are you here?
I was ordered to report to you during my relief.
Oh, yes.
I'd forgotten.
You could have killed me as I lay there.
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?
I'm not ready to die.
What do you think will save you?
The God of my fathers.
Your God has forsaken you.
He has no more power than the images I pray to.
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.
I might.
Does that interest you, 4 1?
I can see that it does.
I'm a fighting man by profession, and in my leisure moments it amuses me to train fighting men.
I own some of the best gladiators and charioteers in Rome.
Would you like to become one of them?
To die as your slave?
Better than to live in chains below these decks.
I will not be here forever.
No?
What would you do if you escaped?
Two people were condemned with me, my mother and sister though they were innocent.
I won't rest...
Do not say that you were innocent.
- Would it do any good to say it again?
- No.
Consider my offer carefully.
You will never escape while we are victorious.
If we are not, you will sink with this ship, chained to your oar.
I cannot believe that God has let me live these years to die chained to an oar.
It's a strange, stubborn faith you keep to believe that existence has a purpose.
A sane man would have learned to lose it long before this.
As you have.
What drove it out of you?
Go back to your oar, 4 1 .
Consul, enemy sighted.
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.
All the watch to battle posts.
- Stand by to load.
- Make ready to fire.
Hurry, quick!
Hurry up with that resin.
Get some more ammunition.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
Chain rowers!
Guard.
Unlock 41.
No!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
41, why did he do that?
I don't know.
Once before, a man helped me.
I didn't know why then.
Normal speed!
Number 1, flame.
Fire.
Fire!
Fire!
Hold withdrawal on command.
Lift oars!
Raise!
Withdraw!
Steersman, right.
Extend oars!
Fire!
- Watch out!
- Fire!
Steersman, ram course!
Order below!
Ramming speed!
Consul, barge on ramming course.
We're going to be rammed!
We're going to be rammed!
Why did you save me?
Why did you have me unchained?
What is your name, 41?
Judah Ben-Hur. ...let me die.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
Row well and live.
ls the sail square?
I can't tell.
Better for us both if it's the enemy.
My death.
Your freedom.
It's a Roman sail.
Face rear!
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.
Water.
The fleet, all lost?
Five galleys.
- And the battle?
- The battle was won.
You have a victory.
- It was a victory?
- Complete.
In His eagerness to save you your God has also saved the Roman fleet.
Hail Arrius!
Right oars!
You have cleared the seaways of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.
This baton of victory has been nobly won.
This man riding beside you, who is he?
The man who saved me, divine emperor, to return and serve you.
ls that all you know about him?
No.
He was accused of an attack on the governor of Judea.
But he was innocent.
If not, there's a strange inconsistency in this man who tries to kill my governor, yet saves the life of my consul.
Come tomorrow.
We'll talk of it.
We have all the information on this man a man of some influence in his own country.
His attack upon our governor is one upon the senate and the people of Rome.
I am convinced that no such attack was intended.
Consul, allow us to continue.
Allow us to be generous.
As a reward to you for your great victory we shall not send him back to the galleys.
We give him to you as your slave.
Such is the will of the senate and the people of Rome.
Not long ago, I returned to Rome with a young man who had saved my life.
You all know him as the finest charioteer in Rome.
Five times, he's driven my horses to victory.
I know him as one who stands in the place of the son I lost.
I have the love and pride in a son's achievements which I thought I should never have again.
Nothing could make stronger our bond but tonight I wish to share it with you all.
The formalities of adoption have been completed.
Young Arrius is now the legal bearer of my name and the heir to my property.
This ring of my ancestors would have gone to my son.
So now it is yours.
It's a strange destiny that brought me to a new life a new home a new father.
It brought me here.
It may take me away.
But wherever I may be I shall always try to wear this ring as a son of Arrius should.
With gratitude and affection and with honor.
My old friend Pontius Pilate, young Arrius.
Before you came to this city, my horses always won.
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.
Yes, but not swift enough to defeat you.
- Tell me, you come from Judea?
- Yes, sir.
I hear that the climate is difficult to live in.
Not for Judeans.
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.
- Of Judea?
- Yes.
I asked for Alexandria.
But it seems the wilderness needs my particular talents.
The scorpions and holy prophets can't get on without me.
Lay the dust of Judea, at least for this evening.
Goats and Jehovah.
You're leaving.
I must.
It's a journey I can't keep you from.
Your eyes have never left it all these months.
I can recognize pain.
But still, my counsel is to wait.
Gratus is to be replaced.
The governorship goes to Pontius Pilate.
When?
Very soon.
It's very much to our purpose.
Nothing is to the purpose if, when I come back to Judea, I come too late.
That is the thought which has punished me every moment I've spent here.
Will Rome see you again?
Here is a part of my life which you have made for me.
I shall remember it.
Whoever the gods are, they take small interest in an old man's hopes.
They have their way.
Forgive me.
You're a stranger here.
Would you be from Nazareth?
Why do you ask?
I thought you might be the one...
The one that I have come back from my country to find.
He would be about your age.
Who?
When I find Him I shall know Him.
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.
Sack of flesh without brains!
No!
No!
Not the whip!
That is my host.
Gently!
Gently!
Fool!
Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood.
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run!
Go on!
Ikeep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!
Beautiful horses.
Now!
Now!
They are ready!
Let them go!
Watch.
They'll never hold the turn.
No!
No!
Abadon, stop him!
Stop that whip!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill...!
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!
You think you can treat my horses like animals?
!
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!
Get off, idiot!
Drive goats, not horses!
I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.
Not a team?
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.
- Antares.
- The slow one?
He should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?
In the circus in Rome.
You have driven in the great circus?
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.
No other animal has descended so in scale from the first innocent falling of the world.
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.
Yes.
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.
Your coming here was so fit, so right.
We might have achieved wonders!
You have to go.
I make a journey which will not wait.
Ah, well, then perhaps you will come back.
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.
I have no wives.
No wives at all?
I have six, no, seven.
I've counted eight.
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.
- Someday, I hope to have one.
- One wife!
One God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.
It is not generous.
- Was the food not to your liking?
- indeed.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.
And now I must say good night to my beauties.
When ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.
- I'll make my farewells then.
- No, no, no, stay.
Stay and see them.
Come, my children.
Come.
Strangers make them shy.
Come.
Come, do not be afraid.
Come.
There, my children.
They are descended from the Arabians of the Pharaohs and I have named them for the stars.
Come, Antares.
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.
What?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.
Come, Rigel.
We've both supped well, and the world is good.
There's my good Rigel.
Yes, you are ready for sleep.
The day's work done for you, eh?
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.
Good night.
Good night, my treasure.
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.
No.
You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.
You should see their mother, Mira.
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.
All right, all right.
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.
You must be strong and swift.
Go, my children.
Go.
At Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams and the champion of the East, Messala, with his black devils.
He stops at nothing to win.
- Messala?
In the circus?
- Yes.
You knew him?
I know him.
Perhaps without much liking.
My people are praying for a man to drive their team to victory over Messala.
You could be that man, the one to stamp his arrogance into the sand.
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.
It's not possible.
That is a pity.
Think of it.
To break his pride to humble this tribune before the very people he has degraded.
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!
I know it is not possible.
Does it not delight your imagination?
Does it not answer your purpose?
I must deal with Messala in my own way.
And your way is to kill him.
I see this terrible thing in your eyes.
But no matter what this man has done, you have no right to kill him.
He will be punished inevitably.
I don't believe in miracles.
But all life is a miracle.
Why will you not accept God's judgment?
You do not believe in miracles.
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness and a star led me to a village called Bethlehem where I found a newborn child in a manger.
And God lived in this child.
By now, He is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.
That is why I have returned here so that I may be at hand when He comes among us.
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.
Perhaps He's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.
Perhaps He is a shepherd a merchant, a fisherman.
But He lives and all our lives from now on will carry His mark.
There are many paths to God, my son.
I hope yours will not be too difficult.
I'm ready for sleep.
Balthasar is a good man but until all men are like him, we must keep our swords bright.
And our intention true.
So I must leave you.
One last thought.
There is no law in the arena.
Many are killed.
I hope to see you again.
Fine Damascus silk.
Fine Damascus silk.
Esther?
It's Judah.
You are alive.
You are alive.
What are you doing here?
What has happened?
I'm here.
I'm with you.
Where's your father?
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.
They tortured him.
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.
You never went back to Antioch?
No.
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.
Where are my mother and sister?
Let me tell him first.
Father.
Father, something wonderful has happened.
Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
He has come home.
He is here.
Judah.
Judah Ben-Hur.
My dear old friend.
Let me look at you.
Let me see you.
Yes, yes.
It is true.
Praise God for His mercy.
Where are they?
Since that terrible day there has been no word of them.
You should have been less loyal.
Do not pity me, Master Judah.
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.
We were released on the same day.
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.
Since then, I have been his tongue and he has been my legs.
Together, we make a considerable man.
Old friend.
She always said you would return.
She never gave up hope.
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.
I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.
But suppose that isn't possible.
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.
They could not make me tell them where it is.
It is there still to put power into our hands and buy death for the Romans.
That's not why I came back.
Judah, they are dead.
Four years.
No one could live so long in the dungeons.
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?
Yes, it is true.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You have come back to us like a returning faith.
Judah, I should like to laugh again.
- Let us laugh.
- We will.
There will be joy again in this house.
We will celebrate among the dust.
I will take him.
We stood here before.
A long while ago.
Four years.
But now it seems as if only yesterday...
I was saying:
"If you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye."
"If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said."
I am not a bride.
Why did you never marry?
My father needed me.
And also...
It's still on my finger.
I said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.
It's become a part of my hand.
If Messala once knew you were here...
As he must.
He will know where they are.
And if you should find...?
- Lf he says they're dead...
- Messala will wish they were living.
I've seen too much of what hate can do.
My father is burned up with it.
But I've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater and love more powerful than hatred.
I believe it.
- Esther.
- Judah.
Stay alive.
Ikeep away from Messala.
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.
That time isn't yet come.
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.
This time you will be destroyed.
You'll die.
Tribune, compliments of Quintus Arrius.
He await's your pleasure.
- Consul here?
- Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.
Thank him.
Bring him to me.
- I didn't know the consul had a son.
- He's a champion of the great circus.
- Why is he presenting me with gifts?
- Perhaps he'll race against you.
Look.
It's magnificent.
And from a man I've never met.
You're wrong, Messala.
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?
You were the magician, Messala.
You condemned me to the galleys.
When my ship was sunk, I saved the consul's life.
You know his seal?
Now I have come back as I swore I would.
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.
You suggest I use it on myself?
What has become of my mother and my sister?
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.
Find them, Messala.
Restore them to me, and I'll forget what I vowed with every stroke of that oar you chained me to.
I am not the governor.
I can do nothing without approval.
Then get it.
I will come back tomorrow.
Don't disappoint me, Messala.
What became of them?
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?
Go to the citadel, Drusus.
Find out.
- And if they're dead?
- They're dead!
"Miriam, wife.
Tirzah, daughter."
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?
E section lower level.
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.
Water.
Water.
Let me out!
- How long since you've seen them?
- Never.
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.
The food disappears.
Lepers.
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.
Then we'll burn out the cell.
ls someone there?
There is someone there.
Who are you?
Don't come any closer.
Who are you?
Esther.
It's Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam?
Stay where you are.
You have come home.
Stand back, Esther.
We are lepers.
Oh, Esther.
Tirzah.
Esther is Judah living?
Yes, he is alive.
He is here.
Where?
He is searching for you now.
I must find him and tell him.
- No!
- Tell my father.
No.
Tell no one.
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.
We won't return.
Judah has to be told.
No.
Please.
I couldn't see his face.
ls it changed?
No, he is not changed.
He's not changed.
You love him, Esther.
Promise me on your love for him you will never tell him you've seen us.
ls he never to know?
Let him remember us as we were.
Promise me.
There's nothing else I can hope for.
Only this.
I promise.
I am content.
Wait.
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.
I pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.
He'll free them.
He wants to survive.
He cannot free them, Judah.
What do you mean?
I saw them.
You saw them?
Where?
When did you see them?
They were dead.
They were dead.
When?
When?
When?
!
In the prison.
When I was waiting for news of my father.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't tell you.
Nor even you, Father.
I was afraid that if you saw Messala...
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.
It's over now.
Over?
- Judah.
- Over?
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.
Gentlemen.
Officers.
Defenders of great Rome's imperium may I enter?
Certainly, sheik.
You do us an unexpected honor.
The noble tribune is most gracious.
And now the question you're asking:
Why am I here?
As you know, I am a gambling man.
The games approach.
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.
I will back my own poor horses.
No limit's?
- Mark me first!
- And me!
- What odds?
- A moment, please my lords, protectors of the far flung marshes.
May I first sit down?
Sit.
How much will you wager?
- Yes, let's call his game.
- Give the Arab a seat.
A bench, quickly.
Thank you.
- Now.
- 1000 denarii.
- 2000!
- Mark me!
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient.
There is time.
First gentlemen, the odds.
The tribune has won many times.
The odds should be in the same measure.
What is your pleasure, gentlemen?
Two to one.
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth where is the courage that made Rome master of the world?
I can get better odds on any street market.
Three to one.
Let us not haggle.
Let us be fair.
In four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.
- In all truth...
- Just a moment.
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.
The Prince of Hur.
Judah Ben Hur.
Prince of Hur?
- He was sent to the galleys years ago.
- He has returned.
Returned?
Lmpossible.
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.
Well?
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.
You, tribune will you give me four to one?
Four to one.
Good.
Four to one, sheik.
The difference between a Roman and a Jew.
Or an Arab.
Bravely spoken.
Now we will settle the amount of our wager.
I will venture...
A thousand talents?
- A thousand talents?
- Yes, a thousand talents.
Of course, if it is too much...
A thousand talents it will be.
Agreed.
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.
You're good fellows.
If only men were this good.
Remember, Altair nine times around the circus.
Aldebaran.
Rigel, did you hear?
Nine lives to live.
My swift fellow.
You must not win the race the first time around.
You win the last time around.
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.
Steady Antares.
Like a rock.
You will be our anchor.
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.
They have taken me into their family.
Rest well, my stars.
Tomorrow we go up to the city.
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it the news will scorch the streets of the Roman world.
Pontius Pilate here?
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.
You will make him see what men are born in this land.
I only know that I race against Messala.
Look for the yoke.
Ease that strap.
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.
into Your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as You will.
The Star of David.
To shine out for your people and my people together and blind the eyes of Rome.
They are ready.
Easy, girl, easy.
Number five.
Where is number five?
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.
Yes, this is the day.
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.
Hail, Jupiter.
Give me victory.
Watch your line!
Ikeep your places!
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.
Citizens I welcome you to these games in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.
We dedicate them to his glory and to the glory of Rome of which you are all part.
Let us honor those who race for us today.
They come here from Alexandria Messina Carthage Cyprus Rome Corinth Athens Phrygia and Judea.
To the best of these, a crown of victory.
The race begins.
Hail, Caesar!
Come, my children, come!
The Roman pig!
Salute.
A great victory.
You are the people's one true god for the time being.
Permit us to worship.
I crown their god.
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.
A long life, young Arrius and the good sense to live it.
We cannot wait, tribune.
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.
He will come!
He will come.
I've sent for him, and he will come.
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.
Do you understand?
To hack the legs off me?
Not yet.
Not till I've seen him.
I don't receive him with half a body.
No!
I told you, Drusus.
I told you.
Here he is.
Triumph complete, Judah.
The race won.
The enemy destroyed.
I see no enemy.
What do you think you see?
The smashed body of a wretched animal?
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.
Let me help you.
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.
Dead.
And the race over.
It isn't over, Judah.
They're not dead.
Where are they?
Where are they?
Look for them in the Valley of the Lepers if you can recognize them.
It goes on.
It goes on, Judah.
The race...
The race is not over.
ls there a way down here?
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.
Man.
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.
There are many women.
Of the family of Hur.
We have no names here.
For them?
- Why did you say they were dead?
- It was what they wanted.
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?
Not to see them?
They are coming.
Love them in the way they must need to be loved.
Not to look at them.
Let them be as if you had never come here.
Please!
ls Judah well?
ls he happy?
Yes, he is well.
Your mind can be at rest for him.
He is well, Miriam.
God be with you.
They have gone.
We can go back.
Go back to what?
Judah, they have one blessing left.
To think you remember them as they were and live your own life.
Forget what is here.
Forget?
It's as though they're alive in a grave.
- But what can you do?
- Undo what you've done.
How could you have suffered them to come here?
I must see them.
No, Judah, please!
Judah!
Think, Judah, think.
It would tear them apart if they see you.
He is here.
I have found Him.
The child has become a man.
And the man, I know it now, is the Son of God.
The promise is true.
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.
Life has been answered.
God has answered it.
Come.
Come with me.
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys thirst had nearly killed me.
A man gave me water to drink.
I went on living.
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.
No.
I am thirsty still.
Come and listen.
I have business with Rome.
You insist on death.
Goodbye, Judah.
You sent for me?
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.
- I honor him.
- As you may honor yourself.
You have been made a citizen of Rome.
Do you say nothing to this?
I have just come from the Valley of Stone where my mother and sister live what's left of their lives.
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.
I have heard this.
There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.
Messala is dead.
What he did has had it's way with him.
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.
Where there is greatness, great government or power even great feeling or compassion error also is great.
We progress and mature by fault.
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.
There are other voices.
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place not to crucify yourself on a shadow such as old resentment or impossible loyalties.
Perfect freedom has no existence.
A grown man knows the world he lives in.
And for the present, the world is Rome.
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.
I am Judah Ben-Hur.
I cross this floor in spoken friendship as I would speak to Arrius.
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar ready to crush those who challenge his authority.
There are too many men of envy and ambition who try to disrupt the government of Rome.
You have become the victor and hero to those people.
They look to you, their one true god, as I call you.
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.
I am already part of this tragedy.
Return this to Arrius.
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you from personal disaster if you stay here.
You are too great a danger.
Leave Judea.
You have my word.
I was afraid you would never come back afraid of what would happen to you.
But I see you again.
Your father's waiting for me.
Where is he?
What do you mean to do?
Rest, sleep.
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.
Peace?
Love and peace.
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?
Where do you see them?
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.
Balthasar's word.
He is more than Balthasar's word.
His voiced traveled with such a still purpose.
It was more than a voice.
A man more than a man.
He said, 'Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God.'
Children of God?
In that dead valley where we left them?
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean until we have scoured off our bodies the crust and filth of being at the mercy of tyranny.
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.
- In blood?
- Yes, in blood!
I know there is a law in life.
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.
Death generates death as the vulture breeds the vulture.
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:
'Love your enemy.
Do good to those who despitefully use you.'
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.
As you make us do now.
Are we to bear nothing together?
Even love?
I can hardly draw breath without feeling you in my heart.
But I know that everything I do from this moment bears greater pain than you have ever suffered.
It is better not to love me.
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy giving evil for evil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.
It's as though you had become Messala.
I've lost you, Judah.
No further.
What are you doing here?
I was here last evening waiting for you.
I have waited all night.
What has happened?
Where is Tirzah?
Leave the food.
I am coming closer.
Don't be afraid.
- What are you doing?
- Don't be afraid.
I've heard Him again, the man from Nazareth.
If ever words were from God, they are in everything He says.
I cannot bear that you should have never known this hand of quiet reaching towards us.
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find Him there.
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find Him.
Tirzah is dying.
Leave the food and go.
It's Judah.
Why did you tell him?
Yes, Judah, yes.
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.
Mother.
Wait, Mother, wait.
Let me talk with you.
Please.
No, no further.
Please.
No, Judah.
Son, no.
Mother, let me see Tirzah.
Tirzah is dying.
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know that life is everlasting and death is nothing to fear if you have faith.
I will take them to Him.
No!
God, no!
No, no, dear son.
Mother where is Tirzah?
Judah, no.
Judah, no.
You must not go to her, dear son.
Please.
Dear son.
I am afraid.
No cause.
The world is more than we know.
Tirzah, it's Judah.
No, Judah.
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
- Why are the streets deserted?
- They have gone to the trial.
Trial?
Whose trial?
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.
- This cannot be true.
- Alms?
What has he done?
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.
Help for the blind.
- Look, lepers!
- Lepers!
Get away!
Stay away!
Go away!
Lepers!
Lepers!
How can this be?
I know this man.
Will someone help Him?
Take pity on Him.
Have mercy.
In His pain this look of peace.
Watch over them, Esther.
We must go back.
I brought you here to this when I hoped...
You haven't failed, Esther.
Hail King of the Jews!
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.
He gave me water and a heart to live.
What has He done to merit this?
He has taken the world of our sins onto Himself.
To this end He said He was born in that stable where I first saw Him.
For this cause, He came into the world.
For this death?
This beginning.
I have lived too long.
As though He were carrying in that cross the pain of the world.
So fearful, and yet why is it I'm not afraid anymore?
The shadow of a storm.
A strange darkness but still day.
His life is over.
What is it?
This tearing.
I am in pain.
I feel it too.
Do you see your hand?
Almost at the moment He died I heard Him say, 'Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.'
Even then.
Even then.
And I felt His voice take the sword out of my hand.

*** Xenzai[NEF] ***
In the year of our Lord Judea, for nearly a century, had lain under the mastery of Rome.
In the seventh year of the reign ofAugustus Caesar an imperial decree ordered every Judean each to return to his place of birth to be counted and taxed.
Converging ways of many of them led to their capital city, Jerusalem the troubled heart of their land.
The old city was dominated by the fortress ofAntonia the seat of Roman power and by the great golden temple the outward sign of an inward and imperishable faith.
Even while they obeyed the will of Caesar the people clung proudly to their ancient heritage always remembering the promise of their prophets that one day there would be born among them a redeemer to bring them salvation and perfect freedom.
You'll be counted at Hebron.
-Name?
-Samuel.
-What city?
-Joppa.
-What family?
-Michael.
-Move on.
Move on.
-Yes.
-Name?
-Joseph.
-What city?
-Nazareth.
-What family?
-David of Bethlehem.
And the woman?
My wife.
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.
Come on, come on.
What village is this?
Nazareth.
We should arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow night.
You're not watching the soldiers, Joseph?
We've seen Romans before.
Yes...
... andwewillsee themagain.
My table is not finished.
Where is your son?
He's walking in the hills.
He neglects his work, Joseph.
No.
Once, I reproached him with forgetting his work.
He said to me:
"I must be about my father's business. "
Then why isn't he here, working?
He's working.
Trumpeters of the legion!
Welcome, Messala.
The command is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for relieving me.
Drusus...
... whenI wasaboy ,Idreamed of commanding this garrison.
Now the wheel has turned.
I am in command.
Attention!
Aisle one, face right!
Forward!
I'd forgotten the heat.
If it were only the heat.
I lived here until I was 1 4.
Jerusalem was my home.
-My father was head of--
-Yes, I know.
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.
If there can be such a thing in this forsaken land.
If you want to rise, Sextus, do the difficult.
I asked to be sent here.
You'll find the people changed since you were a boy.
In what way?
Oh, won't pay their taxes, an irrational resentment of Rome... .
There's nothing new in all that.
And then there's religion.
I tell you, they're drunk with religion.
They smash the statues of our gods, even those of the emperor.
Punish them.
We do.
When we can find them.
Find the leaders.
You don't know.
There's nothing you can put your finger on.
There are strange forces at work here.
This "messiah" business--
I know.
There was one predicted when I was a boy.
A king of the Jews, who will lead them into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.
Makes your head spin.
There's a wild man in the desert named John...
... whodrownspeopleinwater.
And a carpenter's son who does magic tricks. "Miracles" they call them.
There's always a rabble-rouser stirring up trouble.
No, no, no.
This man is different.
He teaches that God is near, in every man.
It's actually quite profound, some of it.
You've been too long away from Rome.
Go back, Sextus.
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea...
... andforgetthat God is in every man.
-There is divinity in only one man.
-Yes, I know.
The emperor is displeased.
He wishes Judea made into a more obedient and disciplined province.
He's ordered me to restore order.
I shall carry out his wishes.
How?
You can break a man's skull, arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.
But how do you control this?
How do you fight an idea?
Especially a new idea.
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.
I assume he has a name.
-He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
-Then treat him like one!
Tell him I will join him.
Yes, tribune.
Centurion!
This was his country before it was ours.
Don't forget that.
Yes, tribune.
Very wise.
This Ben-Hur is the richest man in Jerusalem.
And the head of one of the greatest families in Judea.
We were friends as boys.
We were like brothers.
Sextus...
... youaskhowtofightanidea.
Well, I'll tell you how.
With another idea.
I said I'd come back.
I never thought you would.
I'm so glad.
-Look at you.
-Look at you!
You've come back a tribune.
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.
We'll drink another now.
-Your sister and mother?
-They're fine.
They've talked of you ever since we knew you were coming.
-Is Tirzah married?
-No.
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.
She's been in love with you since she was 5.
I can't wait to see them.
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?
Or have you become too dignified?
-Down Eros, up Mars!
-Down Eros, up Mars!
Where the beams cross?
Good.
After all these years!
Still close.
In every way.
I hope so.
I know.
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew...
... whoselifeyouoncesaved.
The best thing I ever did.
Judah...
... itwillbe verydifficult to govern here.
I'm going to need help.
Your help.
Your advice.
-You want my advice?
-Yes, I do.
Withdraw your legions.
Give us our freedom.
Unfortunately, the emperor is devoted to his empire.
He's particularly fond of Judea.
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.
Is there anything so sad as unrequited love?
My quarters.
A bit grim.
Not grim.
Austere.
Virtuous.
Roman.
I'm going to be second-in-command to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.
He's coming in a few days with more legions.
Then the rumors are true.
The emperor does not approve of your countrymen.
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.
But you and your family need have no concern.
I'm next in authority to the governor, and you're my friend.
-I'm a Jew.
-Ah, you are like a Roman!
What have you in common with the troublemaking rabble?
-They're my people.
I'm one of them.
-Be wise, Judah.
It's a Roman world.
If you want to live in it, you must become part of it.
You've changed.
I've grown up.
I've seen the world since I left Jerusalem.
I've seen Rome.
It's no accident that one small village on the Tiber...
... waschosento rulethe world.
Your legions.
It wasn't just our legions.
Other countries have armies, fine armies.
I know, I fought them.
Oh, no.
No, it was fate that chose us to civilize the world.
And we have.
Our roads and ships connect every corner of the earth.
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.
I believe in the future of my people.
Of course you do.
And you can help them.
How?
You're an aristocrat.
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince to your people.
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.
They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.
Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.
It is worse than stupid, futile!
For it can end in only one way, extinction for your people!
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.
Then we're agreed!
Now, when can I come to see your family?
-We had hoped tomorrow.
-Good.
And now for our toast.
It's dreadful wine, by the way.
It's especially fermented for the Roman army.
You're very cruel to your conquerors.
It's an insane world.
But in it there is one sanity:
The loyalty of old friends.
Judah, we must believe in one another.
Will you drink to that?
With all my heart.
Here it is, the place I've remembered.
The court where we played at changing the guard.
The roof where we'd throw pebbles at people in the street and then hide.
-We were rascals, weren't we?
-No, you were good boys.
I would have that time again.
And here it is.
Nothing has changed.
Except for the fountain.
-The old well would go dry, remember?
-Promptly, every summer.
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.
-He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
-No?
Of course he has.
He was a boy when he left us, now he's a man.
With great responsibilities.
Come.
The emperor builds and builds, turning brick to marble.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.
I've never seen anything like this before.
It's beautiful!
-Is it Roman?
-It's Libyan.
I was there last year.
A tremendous campaign.
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.
Or was, till we destroyed it.
Now it's nothing but ashes.
I'm boring you with soldier stories.
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.
Thank you for this.
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.
What do you think of it?
Magnificent.
It's Arabic.
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.
Let me try him sometime.
Whenever you like.
He's yours.
Do you mean you'll give me this?
Oh, Judah.
You are good.
It's going to be like old times, I know it.
Judah, tell me, did you...
... thinkaboutwhatIsaid ?
Yes.
Talked to a number of people already.
Spoken against violence, against incidents.
Most of the men agree with me.
Most?
Not all?
No, not all.
Who does not agree?
Well, the resentful, the impatient.
Who are they?
Yes, Judah.
Who are they?
Would I retain your friendship if I became an informer?
Telling the names of criminals is not informing.
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.
Patriots?
!
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.
This is my great opportunity, and yours too.
If I bring order here, I can have any post I want.
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?
Rome!
Yes, perhaps at the side of Caesar himself.
I mean it.
It can happen and this is the moment.
I swear, this is the time.
The emperor is watching us, judging us.
All I need do is serve him.
And all you need do is help me serve him.
-You speak as if he were God.
-He is God.
The only God.
He is power, real power on earth, not--
Not that.
Help me, Judah.
I would do anything for you, Messala...
... exceptbetraymy ownpeople.
In the name of all the gods, what do the lives of a few Jews mean to you?
If I cannot persuade them, that does not mean I would help you murder them.
Besides, you must understand this, Messala.
I believe in the past and future of my people.
Future?
You are a conquered people.
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?
Joshua will not rise again to save you nor David.
There is only one reality in the world today.
Look to the West.
Don't be a fool!
Look to Rome!
Better a fool than a traitor or a killer.
-I am a soldier.
-Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.
-I warn you--
-No!
I warn you.
Rome is an affront to God.
Rome is strangling my people and my country, the whole earth!
But not forever.
And I tell you, the day Rome falls there will be a shout of freedom...
... suchastheworld has never heard before.
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.
You're either for me or against me.
If that is the choice...
... thenI amagainstyou .
There they are.
Where's Messala?
-Where's--?
-He's gone.
Gone?
-But why?
-He couldn't stay.
-What happened?
-A new tribune must have many duties.
Come.
Let us have dinner.
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the world...
... whobringethto us bread from the earth.
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.
He wanted to use me to betray our people.
-Master, the caravan from Antioch.
-Yes, Amrah, I saw.
Simonides.
-Oh, welcome homecoming.
-Master.
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.
And for the master, lberian wine.
Not to mention the best gift of all, your presence.
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.
-Caravans from Petra.
-Have all arrived.
-Good.
-Here is the accounting.
And what of Numidia?
The trade route is ours, guaranteed by treaty with the king.
Once a year, you bring your accounting.
And once a year, I find myself wealthier.
Yeah, but my greatest treasure is my steward.
My life belongs to the House of Hur.
Nothing else exists for me, except my daughter.
-She must be a young woman by now.
-Yes, and your property.
She was born the daughter of your slave.
When I inherited you, I inherited a friend, not a slave.
Still, Esther has come with me from Antioch for your permission to marry.
It's granted.
I wish you the joy of many grandchildren.
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.
With your permission, Esther wishes to speak to her master.
You're eager to marry, Esther?
It is my father's wish.
Your husband will be fortunate.
What is his name?
David, son of Mathias.
Of what house?
-His own, master.
-He is a freeman.
Tell me more about him.
I have seen him only once.
He is a merchant, well-thought-of in Antioch.
He will pay for Esther's freedom.
Her freedom will be my wedding gift to Esther.
You are generous, master.
Do you love this man?
I will learn to love him.
You have my permission to marry.
We'll drink to your happiness.
And a safe return to Antioch.
I disturbed you.
No.
What were you thinking?
I was saying goodbye...
... tothiscity...
... andthishouse.
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?
My father sometimes brought me here...
... whenI waslittle.
It was a house where I was always happy.
Except once.
When you and your friend, the Roman boy--
-Messala.
-Yes.
You had been out hunting...
... andtheybroughtyou homeinjured.
I touched your face as you lay there...
... andprayedto God, "Don't let this boy die. "
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.
Yes, master.
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.
It's strange.
I hardly felt a slave.
And now...
... Ihardlyfeelfree.
You know, in the old, wise days of Solomon...
... iftherewasamonghisslaves...
... somegirlwhofilledhiseyes...
... hecouldchooseher out from the rest...
... andtakehertohim.
Wise days of Solomon.
Different days.
And long ago.
If you were not a bride...
... Ishouldkissyou goodbye.
If I were not a bride...
... therewouldbe no goodbyes to be said.
Your slave ring.
Fair exchange.
Freedom to you.
The ring to me.
You will wear it?
Until you meet the woman you will marry?
Until then.
The gods favor my lord Gratus.
If it is the governor's pleasure, the wreath of office.
Thank you, tribune.
I see no delegation from the city.
-There will not be one, sir.
-No?
Jerusalem's welcome will not be a warm one.
But I pledge, my lord, it will be a quiet one.
Let us proceed.
There's Messala.
He saw you, Judah.
The new governor.
Stand back!
-Stand back.
-You, come!
Had to be the Jews!
Open up in the name of the divine emperor!
Judah!
Tirzah!
What is it?
What's happened?
Open up in the name of the law!
-I was watching the--
-A tile fell and struck the governor.
-It wasn't my fault.
-They won't believe her.
She won't have to say anything.
You hear?
Tirzah, say nothing.
Open the gates!
I'll speak to them.
-Arrest him!
-Let me tell you what happened.
-Hold those women.
-Stop them!
It was an accident.
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.
-This is the man, sir.
We saw him.
-It was an accident.
-Accident?
-I swear it.
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose.
It gave way.
Take him.
Take all of them.
-He's telling the truth!
-It was me!
Let them go!
Attention!
Messala.
In the name of God, tell them it's a mistake.
I leaned on the tile, and it broke loose.
It was an accident.
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!
Let the servants go.
Let them go.
Return to your ranks.
Come.
Where?
Tirus.
Tirus?
I've had no trial.
I'm to die in the galleys without even a trial?
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!
Wait.
My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?
Tie his hands.
-At least tell me if they're safe.
-I can tell you nothing.
Get along.
Keep moving.
Jailer!
Guard, in there!
Up the stairs!
Jailer!
Jailer!
To the right.
-Wait!
-Send them out.
Go!
The door.
Where are my mother and sister?
Where are they?
Here, within these walls.
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.
Of course, they will be sentenced.
Is it possible?
Is it possible you could do this to us?
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?
You will let them go.
You will gladly let them go!
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not a murderer!
I know you're not.
You know?
You are evil.
No, Judah, I am not evil.
I wanted your help.
Now you've given it to me.
By making this example of you, I discourage treason.
By condemning without hesitation an old friend, I shall be feared.
But not my family.
Let them go.
Please.
-Messala, I beg you.
-Beg?
!
Didn't I beg you?
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.
Kill me, and your mother and sister will die...
... nailedtocrossesinfrontofyou !
Go on, Judah.
Kill me!
May God grant me vengeance.
I will pray that you live till I return.
Return?
Take him.
Sentries, salute.
The tribune will see you now.
Tribune, I'm steward of the House of Hur.
I remember you.
We were on our way to Antioch when we heard what had happened.
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done this thing.
You knew him, tribune.
Better than you.
Then there must be no doubt in your mind, the charge is groundless.
The prisoners have been sentenced.
-Sentenced?
-But there's no truth in it.
There was never a threat against the governor in Judah's mind.
Surely you must know he would never have done this.
In your heart, you must know it.
Drusus.
This man had better be kept here until we can question him.
Hold!
Water for the soldiers.
Soldiers first!
Get away from that well.
No water for them!
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!
Come on, you!
Water for the horses!
-Water.
Water.
-Soldiers first!
Here.
Wait.
No water for him.
God...
... helpme.
You!
I said no water for him!
All right, on your feet, all of you!
Get them on their feet!
Back in line, you dog!
On your feet!
Get them going!
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!
Forward, you dogs!
Soon, the counselor's barge will be coming alongside.
Be ready to raise oars.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.
-How many rowers?
-Two hundred, consul.
-And reliefs?
-Of 30, every hour.
This man is ill.
Replace him.
-Change him.
-Right, sir.
-This man's been giving you trouble?
-He's insubordinate, consul.
That will stop.
What service have you seen?
Forty-one.
A month's less a day in this ship.
You keep an exact account.
And before?
Three years in other ships.
Three years.
You have the spirit to fight back...
... butthegoodsensetocontrolit.
Your eyes are full of hate, 41 .
That's good.
Hate keeps a man alive.
It gives him strength.
Now, listen to me, all of you.
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
So row well...
... andlive.
-Ship ready, consul.
-Strike oars.
Strike oars!
You know a fleet of Macedonian galleys...
... hasbeenraidingRomancommerce.
The emperor has honored us with the task...
... ofseekingoutand destroyingthem .
Battle speed, hortator.
Battle speed!
Attack speed.
Attack speed!
Ramming speed.
Ramming speed!
Rest.
Halt!
Rest!
Why are you here?
I was ordered to report to you during my relief.
Oh, yes.
I'd forgotten.
You could have killed me as I lay there.
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?
I'm not ready to die.
What do you think will save you?
The God of my fathers.
Your God has forsaken you.
He has no more power than the images I pray to.
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.
I might.
Does that interest you, 41 ?
I can see that it does.
I'm a fighting man by profession, and in my leisure moments...
... itamusesme to trainfightingmen.
I own some of the best gladiators and charioteers in Rome.
Would you like to become one of them?
To die as your slave?
Better than to live in chains below these decks.
I will not be here forever.
No?
What would you do if you escaped?
Two people were condemned with me, my mother and sister...
... thoughtheywereinnocent.
I won't rest--
Do not say that you were innocent.
-Would it do any good to say it again?
-No.
Consider my offer carefully.
You will never escape while we are victorious.
If we are not, you will sink with this ship, chained to your oar.
I cannot believe that God has let me live these years...
... todiechainedtoanoar.
It's a strange, stubborn faith you keep...
... tobelievethat existence has a purpose.
A sane man would have learned to lose it long before this.
As you have.
What drove it out of you?
Go back to your oar, 41 .
Consul, enemy sighted.
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.
All the watch to battle posts.
-Stand by to load.
-Make ready to fire.
Hurry, quick!
Hurry up with that resin.
Get some more ammunition.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
Chain rowers!
Guard.
Unlock 41 .
No!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
41 , why did he do that?
I don't know.
Once before, a man helped me.
I didn't know why then.
Normal speed!
Number 1 , flame.
Fire.
Fire!
Fire!
Hold withdrawal on command.
Lift oars!
Raise!
Withdraw!
Steersman, right.
Extend oars!
Fire!
-Watch out!
-Fire!
Steersman, ram course!
Order below!
-Ramming speed!
-Ramming speed!
Consul, barge on ramming course.
We're going to be rammed!
We're going to be rammed!
Why did you save me?
Why did you have me unchained?
What is your name, 41 ?
Judah Ben-Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur...
... letmedie.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
Row well and live.
Is the sail square?
I can't tell.
Better for us both if it's the enemy.
My death.
Your freedom.
It's a Roman sail.
Face rear!
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.
Water.
The fleet, all lost?
Five galleys.
-And the battle?
-The battle was won.
You have a victory.
-It was a victory?
-Complete.
In His eagerness to save you...
... yourGodhasalsosaved the Roman fleet.
Hail Arrius!
Right oars!
You have cleared the seaways of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.
This baton of victory has been nobly won.
This man riding beside you, who is he?
The man who saved me, divine emperor, to return and serve you.
Is that all you know about him?
No.
He was accused of an attack on the governor of Judea.
But he was innocent.
If not, there's a strange inconsistency in this man...
... whotriesto killmygovernor, yet saves the life of my consul.
Come tomorrow.
We'll talk of it.
We have all the information on this man...
... amanof someinfluence in his own country.
His attack upon our governor is one upon the senate and the people of Rome.
I am convinced that no such attack was intended.
Consul, allow us to continue.
Allow us to be generous.
As a reward to you for your great victory...
... weshallnotsendhimbackto the galleys.
Take him as your slave.
Such is the will of the senate...
... andthepeopleofRome .
Not long ago, I returned to Rome...
... witha youngman who had saved my life.
You all know him as the finest charioteer in Rome.
Five times, he's driven my horses to victory.
I know him as one who stands in the place of the son I lost.
I have the love and pride in a son's achievements...
... whichI thought I should never have again.
Nothing could make stronger our bond...
... buttonightIwish to share it with you all.
The formalities of adoption have been completed.
Young Arrius is now the legal bearer of my name...
... andtheheirtomyproperty.
This ring of my ancestors...
... wouldhavegonetomyson.
So now it is yours.
It's a strange destiny that brought me to a new life...
... anewhome...
... anewfather.
It brought me here.
It may take me away.
But wherever I may be...
... Ishallalwaystry towear this ring as a son of Arrius should.
With gratitude and affection...
... andwithhonor.
My old friend Pontius Pilate, young Arrius.
Before you came to this city, my horses always won.
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.
Yes, but not swift enough to defeat you.
-Tell me, you come from Judea?
-Yes, sir.
I hear that the climate is difficult to live in.
Not for Judeans.
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.
-Of Judea?
-Yes.
I asked for Alexandria.
But it seems the wilderness needs my particular talents.
The scorpions and holy prophets can't get on without me.
Lay the dust of Judea, at least for this evening.
Goats and Jehovah.
You're leaving.
I must.
It's a journey I can't keep you from.
Your eyes have never left it all these months.
I can recognize pain.
But still, my counsel is to wait.
Gratus is to be replaced.
The governorship goes to Pontius Pilate.
When?
Very soon.
It's very much to our purpose.
Nothing is to the purpose if, when I come back to Judea, I come too late.
That is the thought which has punished me every moment I've spent here.
Will Rome see you again?
Here is a part of my life which you have made for me.
I shall remember it.
Whoever the gods are, they take small interest in an old man's hopes.
They have their way.
Forgive me.
You're a stranger here.
Would you be from Nazareth?
Why do you ask?
I thought...
... youmightbe theone--
The one that I have come back from my country to find.
He would be about your age.
Who?
When I find Him...
... IshallknowHim .
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.
Sack of flesh without brains!
No!
No!
Not the whip!
That is my host.
Gently!
Gently!
Fool!
Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood.
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run!
Go on!
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!
Beautiful horses.
Now!
Now!
They are ready!
Let them go!
Watch.
They'll never hold the turn.
No!
No!
Abadon, stop him!
Stop that whip!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill--!
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!
You think you can treat my horses like animals?
!
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!
Get off, idiot!
Drive goats, not horses!
I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.
Not a team?
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.
-Antares.
-The slow one?
He should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?
In the circus in Rome.
You have driven in the great circus?
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.
No other animal has descended so in scale...
... fromthefirstinnocentfalling of the world.
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.
Yes.
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.
Your coming here was so fit, so right.
We might have achieved wonders!
You have to go.
I make a journey which will not wait.
Ah, well, then perhaps you will come back.
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.
I have no wives.
No wives at all?
I have six, no, seven.
I've counted eight.
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.
-Someday, I hope to have one.
-One wife!
One God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.
It is not generous.
-Was the food not to your liking?
-Indeed.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.
And now I must say good night to my beauties.
When ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.
-I'll make my farewells then.
-No, no, no, stay.
Stay and see them.
Come, my children.
Come.
Strangers make them shy.
Come.
Come, do not be afraid.
Come.
There, my children.
They are descended from the Arabians of the Pharaohs...
... andI havenamedthem for the stars.
Come, Antares.
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.
What?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.
Come, Rigel.
We've both supped well, and the world is good.
There's my good Rigel.
Yes, you are ready for sleep.
The day's work done for you, eh?
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.
Good night.
Good night, my treasure.
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.
No.
You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.
You should see their mother, Mira.
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.
All right, all right.
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.
You must be strong and swift.
Go, my children.
Go.
At Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams...
... andthechampionoftheEast, Messala, with his black devils.
He stops at nothing to win.
-Messala?
ln the circus?
-Yes.
You knew him?
I know him.
Perhaps without much liking.
My people are praying for a man...
... todrivetheirteam to victory over Messala.
You could be that man, the one...
... tostamphisarrogance into the sand.
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them...
... onewhowillrulethem with love .
For him, they'd outrace the wind.
It's not possible.
That is a pity.
Think of it.
To break his pride...
... tohumblethistribunebefore the very people he has degraded.
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!
I know it is not possible.
Does it not delight your imagination?
Does it not answer your purpose?
I must deal with Messala in my own way.
And your way is to kill him.
I see this terrible thing in your eyes.
But no matter what this man has done, you have no right to kill him.
He will be punished inevitably.
I don't believe in miracles.
But all life is a miracle.
Why will you not accept God's judgment?
You do not believe in miracles.
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness...
... anda starledme to a village called Bethlehem...
... whereI foundanewbornchild in a manger.
And God lived in this child.
By now, He is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.
That is why I have returned here...
... sothatImay beathand when He comes among us.
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.
Perhaps He's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.
Perhaps He is a shepherd...
... amerchant,afisherman.
But He lives...
... andallourlivesfrom nowon will carry His mark.
There are many paths to God, my son.
I hope yours will not be too difficult.
I'm ready for sleep.
Balthasar is a good man...
... butuntilallmen are likehim, we must keep our swords bright.
And our intention true.
So I must leave you.
One last thought.
There is no law in the arena.
Many are killed.
I hope to see you again.
Fine Damascus silk.
Fine Damascus silk.
Esther?
It's Judah.
You are alive.
You are alive.
What are you doing here?
What has happened?
I'm here.
I'm with you.
Where's your father?
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.
They tortured him.
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.
You never went back to Antioch?
No.
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.
Where are my mother and sister?
Let me tell him first.
Father.
Father, something wonderful has happened.
Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
He has come home.
He is here.
Judah.
Judah Ben-Hur.
My dear old friend.
Let me look at you.
Let me see you.
Yes, yes.
It is true.
Praise God for His mercy.
Where are they?
Since that terrible day...
... therehasbeennoword ofthem.
You should have been less loyal.
Do not pity me, Master Judah.
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.
We were released on the same day.
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.
Since then, I have been his tongue...
... andhehasbeenmylegs.
Together, we make a considerable man.
Old friend.
She always said you would return.
She never gave up hope.
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.
I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.
But suppose that isn't possible.
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.
They could not make me tell them where it is.
It is there still...
... toputpowerintoourhands and buy death for the Romans.
That's not why I came back.
Judah, they are dead.
Four years.
No one could live so long in the dungeons.
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?
Yes, it is true.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You have come back to us like a returning faith.
Judah, I should like to laugh again.
-Let us laugh.
-We will.
There will be joy again in this house.
We will celebrate among the dust.
I will take him.
We stood here before.
A long while ago.
Four years.
But now it seems as if...
... onlyyesterday... .
I was saying:
"If you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye. "
"If I were not a bride...
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.

But now it seems as if...

I was saying:
"If you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye. "
"If I were not a bride...
... therewouldbe no goodbyes to be said. "
I am not a bride.
Why did you never marry?
My father needed me.
And also... .
It's still on my finger.
I said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.
It's become a part of my hand.
If Messala once knew you were here... .
As he must.
He will know where they are.
And if you should find... ?
-If he says they're dead--
-Messala will wish they were living.
I've seen too much of what hate can do.
My father is burned up with it.
But I've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater...
... andlovemorepowerfulthan hatred.
I believe it.
-Esther.
-Judah.
Stay alive.
Keep away from Messala.
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.
That time isn't yet come.
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.
This time you will be destroyed.
You'll die.
Tribune, compliments of Quintus Arrius.
He awaits your pleasure.
-Consul here?
-Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.
Thank him.
Bring him to me.
-I didn't know the consul had a son.
-He's a champion of the great circus.
Why is he presenting me with gifts?
-Perhaps he'll race against you.
-Look.
It's magnificent.
And from a man I've never met.
You're wrong, Messala.
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?
You were the magician, Messala.
You condemned me to the galleys.
When my ship was sunk, I saved the consul's life.
You know his seal?
Now I have come back...
... asI sworeIwould.
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.
You suggest I use it on myself?
What has become of my mother and my sister?
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.
Find them, Messala.
Restore them to me, and I'll forget what I vowed...
... witheverystrokeofthat oar you chained me to.
I am not the governor.
I can do nothing without approval.
Then get it.
I will come back tomorrow.
Don't disappoint me, Messala.
What became of them?
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?
Go to the citadel, Drusus.
Find out.
-And if they're dead?
-They're dead!
"Miriam, wife.
Tirzah, daughter. "
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?
E section...
... lowerlevel.
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.
Water.
Water.
Let me out!
-How long since you've seen them?
-Never.
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.
The food disappears.
Lepers.
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.
Then we'll burn out the cell.
Is someone there?
There is someone there.
Who are you?
Don't come any closer.
Who are you?
Esther.
It's Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam?
Stay where you are.
You have come home.
Stand back, Esther.
We are lepers.
Oh, Esther.
Tirzah.
Esther...
... isJudahliving?
Yes, he is alive.
He is here.
Where?
He is searching for you now.
I must find him and tell him.
-No!
-Tell my father.
No.
Tell no one.
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.
We won't return.
Judah has to be told.
No.
Please.
I couldn't see his face.
Is it changed?
No, he is not changed.
He's not changed.
You love him, Esther.
Promise me...
... onyourlovefor him ...
... youwillnevertellhim you've seen us.
Is he never to know?
Let him remember us as we were.
Promise me.
There's nothing else I can hope for.
Only this.
I promise.
I am content.
Wait.
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.
I pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.
He'll free them.
He wants to survive.
He cannot free them, Judah.
What do you mean?
I saw them.
You saw them?
Where?
When did you see them?
They were dead.
They were dead.
When?
When?
When?
!
In the prison.
When I was waiting for news of my father.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't tell you.
Nor even you, Father.
I was afraid that if you saw Messala... .
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.
It's over now.
Over?
-Judah.
-Over?
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.
Gentlemen.
Officers.
Defenders of great Rome's imperium...
... mayI enter?
Certainly, sheik.
You do us an unexpected honor.
The noble tribune is most gracious.
And now...
... thequestionyou'reasking:
Why am I here?
As you know, I am a gambling man.
The games approach.
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.
I will back my own poor horses.
No limits?
-Mark me first!
-And me!
-What odds?
-A moment, please...
... mylords,protectors of the far flung marshes.
May I first sit down?
Sit.
How much will you wager?
-Yes, let's call his game.
-Give the Arab a seat.
A bench, quickly.
Thank you.
-Now.
-1 000 denarii.
-2000!
-Mark me!
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient.
There is time.
First gentlemen, the odds.
The tribune has won many times.
The odds should be in the same measure.
What is your pleasure, gentlemen?
Two to one.
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth...
... whereisthecourage that made Rome master of the world?
I can get better odds on any street market.
Three to one.
Let us not haggle.
Let us be fair.
In four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.
-In all truth--
-Just a moment.
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.
The Prince of Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur.
Prince of Hur?
-He was sent to the galleys years ago.
-He has returned.
Returned?
lmpossible.
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.
Well?
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.
You, tribune...
... willyougivemefour toone?
Four to one.
Good.
Four to one, sheik.
The difference between a Roman and a Jew.
Or an Arab.
Bravely spoken.
Now we will settle the amount of our wager.
I will venture... .
A thousand talents?
-A thousand talents?
-Yes, a thousand talents.
Of course, if it is too much... .
A thousand talents it will be.
Agreed.
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.
You're good fellows.
If only men were this good.
Remember, Altair...
... ninetimesaroundthe circus.
Aldebaran.
Rigel, did you hear?
Nine lives to live.
My swift fellow.
You must not win the race the first time around.
You win the last time around.
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.
Steady Antares.
Like a rock.
You will be our anchor.
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.
They have taken me into their family.
Rest well, my stars.
Tomorrow we go up to the city.
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it...
... thenewswillscorchthestreets of the Roman world.
Pontius Pilate here?
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.
You will make him see what men are born in this land.
I only know that I race against Messala.
Look for the yoke.
Ease that strap.
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.
Into Your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as You will.
The Star of David.
To shine out for your people and my people together...
... andblindtheeyesofRome.
They are ready.
Easy, girl, easy.
Number five.
Where is number five?
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.
Yes, this is the day.
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.
Hail, Jupiter.
Give me victory.
Watch your line!
Keep your places!
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.
Citizens...
... Iwelcomeyoutothesegames in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.
We dedicate them to his glory...
... andtothegloryofRome...
... ofwhichyouare all part.
Let us honor those who race for us today.
They come here from Alexandria...
... Messina...
... Carthage...
... Cyprus...
... Rome...
... Corinth...
... Athens...
... Phrygia...
... andJudea.
To the best of these, a crown of victory.
The race begins.
Hail, Caesar!
Come, my children, come!
The Roman pig!
Salute.
A great victory.
You are the people's one true god...
... forthetimebeing.
Permit us to worship.
I crown their god.
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.
A long life, young Arrius and the good sense to live it.
We cannot wait, tribune.
He will come.
He will--
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.
He will come!
He will come.
I've sent for him, and he will come.
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.
Do you understand?
To hack the legs off me?
Not yet.
Not till I've seen him.
I don't receive him with half a body.
No!
I told you, Drusus.
I told you.
Here he is.
Triumph complete, Judah.
The race won.
The enemy destroyed.
I see no enemy.
What do you think you see?
The smashed body of a wretched animal?
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.
Let me help you.
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.
Dead.
And the race over.
It isn't over, Judah.
They're not dead.
Where are they?
Where are they?
Look for them...
... intheValleyoftheLepers...
... ifyoucanrecognizethem .
It goes on.
It goes on, Judah.
The race... .
The race is not over.
Is there a way down here?
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.
Man.
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.
There are many women.
Of the family of Hur.
We have no names here.
For them?
-Why did you say they were dead?
-It was what they wanted.
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?
Not to see them?
They are coming.
Love them in the way they must need to be loved.
Not to look at them.
Let them be as if you had never come here.
Please!
Is Judah well?
Is he happy?
Yes, he is well.
Your mind can be at rest for him.
He is well, Miriam.
God be with you.
They have gone.
We can go back.
Go back to what?
Judah, they have one blessing left.
To think you remember them as they were...
... andliveyourown life.
Forget what is here.
Forget?
It's as though they're alive in a grave.
-But what can you do?
-Undo what you've done.
How could you have suffered them to come here?
I must see them.
No, Judah, please!
Judah!
Think, Judah, think.
It would tear them apart if they see you.
He is here.
I have found Him.
The child has become a man.
And the man, I know it now, is the Son of God.
The promise is true.
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.
Life has been answered.
God has answered it.
Come.
Come with me.
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys...
... thirsthadnearlykilledme.
A man gave me water to drink.
I went on living.
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.
No.
I am thirsty still.
Come and listen.
I have business with Rome.
You insist on death.
Goodbye, Judah.
You sent for me?
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.
-I honor him.
-As you may honor yourself.
You have been made a citizen of Rome.
Do you say nothing to this?
I have just come from the Valley of Stone...
... wheremymotherand sisterlive what's left of their lives.
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.
I have heard this.
There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.
Where there is greatness, great government or power...
... evengreatfeelingorcompassion...
... erroralsois great.
We progress and mature by fault.
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.
There are other voices.
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place...
... nottocrucifyyourself on a shadow such as old resentment...
... orimpossibleloyalties.
Perfect freedom has no existence.
A grown man knows the world he lives in.
And for the present, the world is Rome.
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.
I am Judah Ben-Hur.
I cross this floor in spoken friendship...
... asI wouldspeaktoArrius.
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar...
... readytocrushthose who challenge his authority.
There are too many men of envy and ambition...
... whotryto disrupt the government of Rome.
You have become the victor and hero to those people.
They look to you, their one true god, as I call you.
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.
I am already part of this tragedy.
Return this to Arrius.
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you...
... frompersonaldisaster if you stay here.
You are too great a danger.
Leave Judea.
You have my word.
I was afraid you would never come back...
... afraidofwhatwouldhappentoyou .
But I see you again.
Your father's waiting for me.
Where is he?
What do you mean to do?
Rest, sleep.
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.
Peace?
Love and peace.
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?
Where do you see them?
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.
Balthasar's word.
He is more than Balthasar's word.
His voiced traveled with such a still purpose.
It was more than a voice.
A man more than a man.
He said, "Blessed are the merciful...
... fortheyshallobtainmercy.
Blessed are the peacemakers...
... fortheyshallbecalled the children of God. "
Children of God?
In that dead valley where we left them?
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean...
... untilwehavescouredoff our bodies the crust and filth...
... ofbeingat themercyoftyranny.
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.
-In blood?
-Yes, in blood!
I know there is a law in life.
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.
Death generates death...
... asthevulturebreedsthevulture.
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:
"Love your enemy.
Do good to those who despitefully use you. "
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.
As you make us do now.
Are we to bear nothing together?
Even love?
I can hardly draw breath...
... withoutfeelingyouinmyheart .
But I know...
... thateverythingIdo from this moment...
... bearsgreaterpain than you have ever suffered.
It is better not to love me.
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy...
... givingevilforevil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.
It's as though you had become Messala.
I've lost you, Judah.
No further.
What are you doing here?
I was here last evening waiting for you.
I have waited all night.
What has happened?
Where is Tirzah?
Leave the food.
I am coming closer.
Don't be afraid.
-What are you doing?
-Don't be afraid.
I've heard Him again, the man from Nazareth.
If ever words were from God, they are in everything He says.
I cannot bear that you should have never known...
... thishandof quiet reaching towards us.
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find Him there.
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find Him.
Tirzah is dying.
Leave the food and go.
It's Judah.
Why did you tell him?
Yes, Judah, yes.
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.
Mother.
Wait, Mother, wait.
Let me talk with you.
Please.
No, no further.
Please.
No, Judah.
Son, no.
Mother, let me see Tirzah.
Tirzah is dying.
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know...
... thatlifeis everlasting...
... anddeathis nothingtofear if you have faith.
I will take them to Him.
No!
God, no!
No, no, dear son.
Mother...
... whereisTirzah?
Judah, no.
Judah, no.
You must not go to her, dear son.
Please.
Dear son.
I am afraid.
No cause.
The world is more than we know.
Tirzah, it's Judah.
No, Judah.
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
-Why are the streets deserted?
-They have gone to the trial.
Trial?
Whose trial?
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.
-This cannot be true.
-Alms?
What has he done?
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.
Help for the blind.
-Look, lepers!
-Lepers!
Get away!
Stay away!
Go away!
Lepers!
Lepers!
How can this be?
I know this man.
Will someone help Him?
Take pity on Him.
Have mercy.
In His pain...
... thislookof peace.
Watch over them, Esther.
We must go back.
I brought you here to this...
... whenI hoped... .
You haven't failed, Esther.
Hail King of the Jews!
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.
He gave me water...
... anda heartto live.
What has He done to merit this?
He has taken the world of our sins onto Himself.
To this end He said He was born...
... inthatstable...
... whereI firstsawHim .
For this cause, He came into the world.
For this death?
This beginning.
I have lived too long.
As though He were carrying in that cross...
... thepainof theworld.
So fearful, and yet why is it...
... I'mnotafraidanymore?
The shadow of a storm.
A strange darkness...
... butstillday.
His life is over.
What is it?
This tearing.
I am in pain.
I feel it too.
Do you see your hand?
Almost at the moment He died...
... IheardHimsay , "Father, forgive them...
... fortheyknownot whatthey do."
Even then.
Even then.
And I felt His voice take the sword out of my hand.
In the year of our Lord Judea, for nearly a century, had lain under the mastery of Rome.
In the seventh year of the reign of Augustus Caesar an imperial decree ordered every Judean each to return to his place of birth to be counted and taxed.
Converging ways of many of them led to their capital city, Jerusalem the troubled heart of their land.
The old city was dominated by the fortress of Antonia the seat of Roman power and by the great golden temple the outward sign of an inward and imperishable faith.
Even while they obeyed the will of Caesar the people clung proudly to their ancient heritage always remembering the promise of their prophets that one day there would be born among them a redeemer to bring them salvation and perfect freedom.
You'll be counted at Hebron.
- Name?
- Samuel.
- What city?
- Joppa.
- What family?
- Michael.
- Move on.
Move on.
- Yes.
- Name?
- Joseph.
- What city?
- Nazareth.
- What family?
- David of Bethlehem.
And the woman?
My wife.
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.
Come on, come on.
What village is this?
Nazareth.
We should arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow night.
You're not watching the soldiers, Joseph?
We've seen Romans before.
Yes and we will see them again.
My table is not finished.
Where is your son?
He's walking in the hills.
He neglects his work, Joseph.
No.
Once, I reproached him with forgetting his work.
He said to me:
"I must be about my father's business."
Then why isn't he here, working?
He's working.
Trumpeters of the legion!
Welcome, Messala.
The command is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for relieving me.
Drusus when I was a boy, I dreamed of commanding this garrison.
Now the wheel has turned.
I am in command.
Attention!
Aisle one, face right!
Forward!
I'd forgotten the heat.
If it were only the heat.
I lived here until I was 14.
Jerusalem was my home.
- My father was head of...
- Yes, I know.
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.
If there can be such a thing in this forsaken land.
If you want to rise, Sextus, do the difficult.
I asked to be sent here.
You'll find the people changed since you were a boy.
In what way?
Oh, won't pay their taxes, an irrational resentment of Rome...
There's nothing new in all that.
And then there's religion.
I tell you, they're drunk with religion.
They smash the statues of our gods, even those of the emperor.
Punish them.
We do.
When we can find them.
Find the leaders.
You don't know.
There's nothing you can put your finger on.
There are strange forces at work here.
This "messiah" business...
I know.
There was one predicted when I was a boy.
A king of the Jews, who will lead them into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.
Makes your head spin.
There's a wild man in the desert named John who drowns people in water.
And a carpenter's son who does magic tricks. "Miracles" they call them.
There's always a rabble-rouser stirring up trouble.
No, no, no.
This man is different.
He teaches that God is near, in every man.
It's actually quite profound, some of it.
You've been too long away from Rome.
Go back, Sextus.
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea and forget that God is in every man.
- There is divinity in only one man.
- Yes, I know.
The emperor is displeased.
He wishes Judea made into a more obedient and disciplined province.
He's ordered me to restore order.
I shall carry out his wishes.
How?
You can break a man's skull, arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.
But how do you control this?
How do you fight an idea?
Especially a new idea.
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.
I assume he has a name.
- He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
- Then treat him like one!
Tell him I will join him.
Yes, tribune.
Centurion!
This was his country before it was ours.
Don't forget that.
Yes, tribune.
Very wise.
This Ben-Hur is the richest man in Jerusalem.
And the head of one of the greatest families in Judea.
We were friends as boys.
We were like brothers.
Sextus you ask how to fight an idea.
Well, I'll tell you how.
With another idea.
I said I'd come back.
I never thought you would.
I'm so glad.
- Look at you.
- Look at you!
You've come back a tribune.
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.
We'll drink another now.
- Your sister and mother?
- They're fine.
They've talked of you ever since we knew you were coming.
- Is Tirzah married?
- No.
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.
She's been in love with you since she was 5.
I can't wait to see them.
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?
Or have you become too dignified?
- Down Eros, up Mars!
- Down Eros, up Mars!
Where the beams cross?
Good.
After all these years!
Still close.
In every way.
I hope so.
I know.
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew whose life you once saved.
The best thing I ever did.
Judah it will be very difficult to govern here.
I'm going to need help.
Your help.
Your advice.
- You want my advice?
- Yes, I do.
Withdraw your legions.
Give us our freedom.
Unfortunately, the emperor is devoted to his empire.
He's particularly fond of Judea.
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.
Is there anything so sad as unrequited love?
My quarters.
A bit grim.
Not grim.
Austere.
Virtuous.
Roman.
I'm going to be second-in-command to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.
He's coming in a few days with more legions.
Then the rumors are true.
The emperor does not approve of your countrymen.
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.
But you and your family need have no concern.
I'm next in authority to the governor, and you're my friend.
- I'm a Jew.
- Ah, you are like a Roman!
What have you in common with the troublemaking rabble?
- They're my people.
I'm one of them.
- Be wise, Judah.
It's a Roman world.
If you want to live in it, you must become part of it.
You've changed.
I've grown up.
I've seen the world since I left Jerusalem.
I've seen Rome.
It's no accident that one small village on the Tiber was chosen to rule the world.
Your legions.
It wasn't just our legions.
Other countries have armies, fine armies.
I know, I fought them.
Oh, no.
No, it was fate that chose us to civilize the world.
And we have.
Our roads and ships connect every corner of the earth.
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.
I believe in the future of my people.
Of course you do.
And you can help them.
How?
You're an aristocrat.
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince to your people.
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.
They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.
Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.
It is worse than stupid, futile!
For it can end in only one way, extinction for your people!
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.
Then we're agreed!
Now, when can I come to see your family?
- We had hoped tomorrow.
- Good.
And now for our toast.
It's dreadful wine, by the way.
It's especially fermented for the Roman army.
You're very cruel to your conquerors.
It's an insane world.
But in it there is one sanity:
The loyalty of old friends.
Judah, we must believe in one another.
Will you drink to that?
With all my heart.
Here it is, the place I've remembered.
The court where we played at changing the guard.
The roof where we'd throw pebbles at people in the street and then hide.
- We were rascals, weren't we?
- No, you were good boys.
I would have that time again.
And here it is.
Nothing has changed.
Except for the fountain.
- The old well would go dry, remember?
- Promptly, every summer.
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.
- He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
- No?
Of course he has.
He was a boy when he left us, now he's a man.
With great responsibilities.
Come.
The emperor builds and builds, turning brick to marble.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.
I've never seen anything like this before.
It's beautiful!
- Is it Roman?
- It's Libyan.
I was there last year.
A tremendous campaign.
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.
Or was, till we destroyed it.
Now it's nothing but ashes.
I'm boring you with soldier stories.
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.
Thank you for this.
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.
What do you think of it?
Magnificent.
It's Arabic.
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.
Let me try him sometime.
Whenever you like.
He's yours.
Do you mean you'll give me this?
Oh, Judah.
You are good.
It's going to be like old times, I know it.
Judah, tell me, did you think about what I said?
Yes.
Talked to a number of people already.
Spoken against violence, against incidents.
Most of the men agree with me.
Most?
Not all?
No, not all.
Who does not agree?
Well, the resentful, the impatient.
Who are they?
Yes, Judah.
Who are they?
Would I retain your friendship if I became an informer?
Telling the names of criminals is not informing.
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.
Patriots?
!
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.
This is my great opportunity, and yours too.
If I bring order here, I can have any post I want.
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?
Rome!
Yes, perhaps at the side of Caesar himself.
I mean it.
It can happen and this is the moment.
I swear, this is the time.
The emperor is watching us, judging us.
All I need do is serve him.
And all you need do is help me serve him.
- You speak as if he were God.
- He is God.
The only God.
He is power, real power on earth, not...
Not that.
Help me, Judah.
I would do anything for you, Messala except betray my own people.
In the name of all the gods, what do the lives of a few Jews mean to you?
If I cannot persuade them, that does not mean I would help you murder them.
Besides, you must understand this, Messala.
I believe in the past and future of my people.
Future?
You are a conquered people.
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?
Joshua will not rise again to save you nor David.
There is only one reality in the world today.
Look to the West.
Don't be a fool!
Look to Rome!
Better a fool than a traitor or a killer.
- I am a soldier.
- Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.
- I warn you...
- No!
I warn you.
Rome is an affront to God.
Rome is strangling my people and my country, the whole earth!
But not forever.
And I tell you, the day Rome falls there will be a shout of freedom such as the world has never heard before.
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.
You're either for me or against me.
If that is the choice then I am against you.
There they are.
Where's Messala?
- Where's...?
- He's gone.
Gone?
- But why?
- He couldn't stay.
- What happened?
- A new tribune must have many duties.
Come.
Let us have dinner.
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the world who bringeth to us bread from the earth.
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.
He wanted to use me to betray our people.
- Master, the caravan from Antioch.
- Yes, Amrah, I saw.
Simonides.
- Oh, welcome homecoming.
- Master.
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.
And for the master, lberian wine.
Not to mention the best gift of all, your presence.
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.
- Caravans from Petra.
- Have all arrived.
- Good.
- Here is the accounting.
And what of Numidia?
The trade route is ours, guaranteed by treaty with the king.
Once a year, you bring your accounting.
And once a year, I find myself wealthier.
Yeah, but my greatest treasure is my steward.
My life belongs to the House of Hur.
Nothing else exists for me, except my daughter.
- She must be a young woman by now.
- Yes, and your property.
She was born the daughter of your slave.
When I inherited you, I inherited a friend, not a slave.
Still, Esther has come with me from Antioch for your permission to marry.
It's granted.
I wish you the joy of many grandchildren.
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.
With your permission, Esther wishes to speak to her master.
You're eager to marry, Esther?
It is my father's wish.
Your husband will be fortunate.
What is his name?
David, son of Mathias.
Of what house?
- His own, master.
- He is a freeman.
Tell me more about him.
I have seen him only once.
He is a merchant, well-thought-of in Antioch.
He will pay for Esther's freedom.
Her freedom will be my wedding gift to Esther.
You are generous, master.
Do you love this man?
I will learn to love him.
You have my permission to marry.
We'll drink to your happiness.
And a safe return to Antioch.
I disturbed you.
No.
What were you thinking?
I was saying goodbye to this city and this house.
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?
My father sometimes brought me here when I was little.
It was a house where I was always happy.
Except once.
When you and your friend, the Roman boy...
- Messala.
- Yes.
You had been out hunting and they brought you home injured.
I touched your face as you lay there and prayed to God, "Don't let this boy die."
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.
Yes, master.
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.
It's strange.
I hardly felt a slave.
And now I hardly feel free.
You know, in the old, wise days of Solomon if there was among his slaves some girl who filled his eyes he could choose her out from the rest and take her to him.
Wise days of Solomon.
Different days.
And long ago.
If you were not a bride I should kiss you goodbye.
If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said.
Your slave ring.
Fair exchange.
Freedom to you.
The ring to me.
You will wear it?
Until you meet the woman you will marry?
Until then.
The gods favor my lord Gratus.
If it is the governor's pleasure, the wreath of office.
Thank you, tribune.
I see no delegation from the city.
- There will not be one, sir.
- No?
Jerusalem's welcome will not be a warm one.
But I pledge, my lord, it will be a quiet one.
Let us proceed.
There's Messala.
He saw you, Judah.
The new governor.
Stand back!
- Stand back.
- You, come!
Had to be the Jews!
Open up in the name of the divine emperor!
Judah!
Tirzah!
What is it?
What's happened?
Open up in the name of the law!
- I was watching the...
- A tile fell and struck the governor.
- It wasn't my fault.
- They won't believe her.
She won't have to say anything.
You hear?
Tirzah, say nothing.
Open the gates!
I'll speak to them.
- Arrest him!
- Let me tell you what happened.
- Hold those women.
- Stop them!
It was an accident.
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.
- This is the man, sir.
We saw him.
- It was an accident.
- Accident?
- I swear it.
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose.
It gave way.
Take him.
Take all of them.
- He's telling the truth!
- It was me!
Let them go!
Attention!
Messala.
In the name of God, tell them it's a mistake.
I leaned on the tile, and it broke loose.
It was an accident.
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!
Let the servants go.
Let them go.
Return to your ranks.
Come.
Where?
Tirus.
Tirus?
I've had no trial.
I'm to die in the galleys without even a trial?
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!
Wait.
My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?
Tie his hands.
- At least tell me if they're safe.
- I can tell you nothing.
Get along.
Keep moving.
Jailer!
Guard, in there!
Up the stairs!
Jailer!
Jailer!
To the right.
- Wait!
- Send them out.
Go!
The door.
Where are my mother and sister?
Where are they?
Here, within these walls.
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.
Of course, they will be sentenced.
Is it possible?
Is it possible you could do this to us?
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?
You will let them go.
You will gladly let them go!
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not a murderer!
I know you're not.
You know?
You are evil.
No, Judah, I am not evil.
I wanted your help.
Now you've given it to me.
By making this example of you, I discourage treason.
By condemning without hesitation an old friend, I shall be feared.
But not my family.
Let them go.
Please.
- Messala, I beg you.
- Beg?
!
Didn't I beg you?
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.
Kill me, and your mother and sister will die nailed to crosses in front of you!
Go on, Judah.
Kill me!
May God grant me vengeance.
I will pray that you live till I return.
Return?
Take him.
Sentries, salute.
The tribune will see you now.
Tribune, I'm steward of the House of Hur.
I remember you.
We were on our way to Antioch when we heard what had happened.
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done this thing.
You knew him, tribune.
Better than you.
Then there must be no doubt in your mind, the charge is groundless.
The prisoners have been sentenced.
- Sentenced?
- But there's no truth in it.
There was never a threat against the governor in Judah's mind.
Surely you must know he would never have done this.
In your heart, you must know it.
Drusus.
This man had better be kept here until we can question him.
Hold!
Water for the soldiers.
Soldiers first!
Get away from that well.
No water for them!
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!
Come on, you!
Water for the horses!
- Water.
Water.
- Soldiers first!
Here.
Wait.
No water for him.
God help me.
You!
I said no water for him!
All right, on your feet, all of you!
Get them on their feet!
Back in line, you dog!
On your feet!
Get them going!
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!
Forward, you dogs!
Soon, the counselor's barge will be coming alongside.
Be ready to raise oars.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.
- How many rowers?
- Two hundred, consul.
- And reliefs?
- Of 30, every hour.
This man is ill.
Replace him.
- Change him.
- Right, sir.
- This man's been giving you trouble?
- He's insubordinate, consul.
That will stop.
What service have you seen?
Forty-one.
A month's less a day in this ship.
You keep an exact account.
And before?
Three years in other ships.
Three years.
You have the spirit to fight back but the good sense to control it.
Your eyes are full of hate, 41.
That's good.
Hate keeps a man alive.
It gives him strength.
Now, listen to me, all of you.
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
So row well and live.
- Ship ready, consul.
- Strike oars.
Strike oars!
You know a fleet of Macedonian galleys has been raiding Roman commerce.
The emperor has honored us with the task of seeking out and destroying them.
Battle speed, hortator.
Battle speed!
Attack speed.
Attack speed!
Ramming speed.
Ramming speed!
Rest.
Halt!
Rest!
Why are you here?
I was ordered to report to you during my relief.
Oh, yes.
I'd forgotten.
You could have killed me as I lay there.
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?
I'm not ready to die.
What do you think will save you?
The God of my fathers.
Your God has forsaken you.
He has no more power than the images I pray to.
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.
I might.
Does that interest you, 41?
I can see that it does.
I'm a fighting man by profession, and in my leisure moments it amuses me to train fighting men.
I own some of the best gladiators and charioteers in Rome.
Would you like to become one of them?
To die as your slave?
Better than to live in chains below these decks.
I will not be here forever.
No?
What would you do if you escaped?
Two people were condemned with me, my mother and sister though they were innocent.
I won't rest...
Do not say that you were innocent.
- Would it do any good to say it again?
- No.
Consider my offer carefully.
You will never escape while we are victorious.
If we are not, you will sink with this ship, chained to your oar.
I cannot believe that God has let me live these years to die chained to an oar.
It's a strange, stubborn faith you keep to believe that existence has a purpose.
A sane man would have learned to lose it long before this.
As you have.
What drove it out of you?
Go back to your oar, 41.
Consul, enemy sighted.
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.
All the watch to battle posts.
- Stand by to load.
- Make ready to fire.
Hurry, quick!
Hurry up with that resin.
Get some more ammunition.
Raise oars!
Down oars!
Chain rowers!
Guard.
Unlock 41.
No!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
41, why did he do that?
I don't know.
Once before, a man helped me.
I didn't know why then.
Normal speed!
Number 1, flame.
Fire.
Fire!
Fire!
Hold withdrawal on command.
Lift oars!
Raise!
Withdraw!
Steersman, right.
Extend oars!
Fire!
- Watch out!
- Fire!
Steersman, ram course!
Order below!
- Ramming speed!
- Ramming speed!
Consul, barge on ramming course.
We're going to be rammed!
We're going to be rammed!
Why did you save me?
Why did you have me unchained?
What is your name, 41?
Judah Ben-Hur. ...let me die.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.
Row well and live.
Is the sail square?
I can't tell.
Better for us both if it's the enemy.
My death.
Your freedom.
It's a Roman sail.
Face rear!
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.
Water.
The fleet, all lost?
Five galleys.
- And the battle?
- The battle was won.
You have a victory.
- It was a victory?
- Complete.
In His eagerness to save you your God has also saved the Roman fleet.
Hail Arrius!
Right oars!
You have cleared the seaways of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.
This baton of victory has been nobly won.
This man riding beside you, who is he?
The man who saved me, divine emperor, to return and serve you.
Is that all you know about him?
No.
He was accused of an attack on the governor of Judea.
But he was innocent.
If not, there's a strange inconsistency in this man who tries to kill my governor, yet saves the life of my consul.
Come tomorrow.
We'll talk of it.
We have all the information on this man a man of some influence in his own country.
His attack upon our governor is one upon the senate and the people of Rome.
I am convinced that no such attack was intended.
Consul, allow us to continue.
Allow us to be generous.
As a reward to you for your great victory we shall not send him back to the galleys.
Take him as your slave.
Such is the will of the senate and the people of Rome.
Not long ago, I returned to Rome with a young man who had saved my life.
You all know him as the finest charioteer in Rome.
Five times, he's driven my horses to victory.
I know him as one who stands in the place of the son I lost.
I have the love and pride in a son's achievements which I thought I should never have again.
Nothing could make stronger our bond but tonight I wish to share it with you all.
The formalities of adoption have been completed.
Young Arrius is now the legal bearer of my name and the heir to my property.
This ring of my ancestors would have gone to my son.
So now it is yours.
It's a strange destiny that brought me to a new life a new home a new father.
It brought me here.
It may take me away.
But wherever I may be I shall always try to wear this ring as a son of Arrius should.
With gratitude and affection and with honor.
My old friend Pontius Pilate, young Arrius.
Before you came to this city, my horses always won.
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.
Yes, but not swift enough to defeat you.
- Tell me, you come from Judea?
- Yes, sir.
I hear that the climate is difficult to live in.
Not for Judeans.
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.
- Of Judea?
- Yes.
I asked for Alexandria.
But it seems the wilderness needs my particular talents.
The scorpions and holy prophets can't get on without me.
Lay the dust of Judea, at least for this evening.
Goats and Jehovah.
You're leaving.
I must.
It's a journey I can't keep you from.
Your eyes have never left it all these months.
I can recognize pain.
But still, my counsel is to wait.
Gratus is to be replaced.
The governorship goes to Pontius Pilate.
When?
Very soon.
It's very much to our purpose.
Nothing is to the purpose if, when I come back to Judea, I come too late.
That is the thought which has punished me every moment I've spent here.
Will Rome see you again?
Here is a part of my life which you have made for me.
I shall remember it.
Whoever the gods are, they take small interest in an old man's hopes.
They have their way.
Forgive me.
You're a stranger here.
Would you be from Nazareth?
Why do you ask?
I thought you might be the one...
The one that I have come back from my country to find.
He would be about your age.
Who?
When I find Him I shall know Him.
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.
Sack of flesh without brains!
No!
No!
Not the whip!
That is my host.
Gently!
Gently!
Fool!
Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood.
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run!
Go on!
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!
Beautiful horses.
Now!
Now!
They are ready!
Let them go!
Watch.
They'll never hold the turn.
No!
No!
Abadon, stop him!
Stop that whip!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill...!
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!
You think you can treat my horses like animals?
!
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!
Get off, idiot!
Drive goats, not horses!
I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.
Not a team?
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.
- Antares.
- The slow one?
He should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?
In the circus in Rome.
You have driven in the great circus?
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.
No other animal has descended so in scale from the first innocent falling of the world.
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.
Yes.
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.
Your coming here was so fit, so right.
We might have achieved wonders!
You have to go.
I make a journey which will not wait.
Ah, well, then perhaps you will come back.
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.
I have no wives.
No wives at all?
I have six, no, seven.
I've counted eight.
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.
- Someday, I hope to have one.
- One wife!
One God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.
It is not generous.
- Was the food not to your liking?
- Indeed.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.
And now I must say good night to my beauties.
When ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.
- I'll make my farewells then.
- No, no, no, stay.
Stay and see them.
Come, my children.
Come.
Strangers make them shy.
Come.
Come, do not be afraid.
Come.
There, my children.
They are descended from the Arabians of the Pharaohs and I have named them for the stars.
Come, Antares.
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.
What?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.
Come, Rigel.
We've both supped well, and the world is good.
There's my good Rigel.
Yes, you are ready for sleep.
The day's work done for you, eh?
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.
Good night.
Good night, my treasure.
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.
No.
You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.
You should see their mother, Mira.
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.
All right, all right.
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.
You must be strong and swift.
Go, my children.
Go.
At Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams and the champion of the East, Messala, with his black devils.
He stops at nothing to win.
- Messala?
In the circus?
- Yes.
You knew him?
I know him.
Perhaps without much liking.
My people are praying for a man to drive their team to victory over Messala.
You could be that man, the one to stamp his arrogance into the sand.
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.
It's not possible.
That is a pity.
Think of it.
To break his pride to humble this tribune before the very people he has degraded.
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!
I know it is not possible.
Does it not delight your imagination?
Does it not answer your purpose?
I must deal with Messala in my own way.
And your way is to kill him.
I see this terrible thing in your eyes.
But no matter what this man has done, you have no right to kill him.
He will be punished inevitably.
I don't believe in miracles.
But all life is a miracle.
Why will you not accept God's judgment?
You do not believe in miracles.
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness and a star led me to a village called Bethlehem where I found a newborn child in a manger.
And God lived in this child.
By now, He is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.
That is why I have returned here so that I may be at hand when He comes among us.
He is near.
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.
Perhaps He's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.
Perhaps He is a shepherd a merchant, a fisherman.
But He lives and all our lives from now on will carry His mark.
There are many paths to God, my son.
I hope yours will not be too difficult.
I'm ready for sleep.
Balthasar is a good man but until all men are like him, we must keep our swords bright.
And our intention true.
So I must leave you.
One last thought.
There is no law in the arena.
Many are killed.
I hope to see you again.
Fine Damascus silk.
Fine Damascus silk.
Esther?
It's Judah.
You are alive.
You are alive.
What are you doing here?
What has happened?
I'm here.
I'm with you.
Where's your father?
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.
They tortured him.
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.
You never went back to Antioch?
No.
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.
Where are my mother and sister?
Let me tell him first.
Father.
Father, something wonderful has happened.
Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
He has come home.
He is here.
Judah.
Judah Ben-Hur.
My dear old friend.
Let me look at you.
Let me see you.
Yes, yes.
It is true.
Praise God for His mercy.
Where are they?
Since that terrible day there has been no word of them.
You should have been less loyal.
Do not pity me, Master Judah.
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.
We were released on the same day.
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.
Since then, I have been his tongue and he has been my legs.
Together, we make a considerable man.
Old friend.
She always said you would return.
She never gave up hope.
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.
I see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.
But suppose that isn't possible.
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.
They could not make me tell them where it is.
It is there still to put power into our hands and buy death for the Romans.
That's not why I came back.
Judah, they are dead.
Four years.
No one could live so long in the dungeons.
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?
Yes, it is true.
Judah Ben-Hur.
You have come back to us like a returning faith.
Judah, I should like to laugh again.
- Let us laugh.
- We will.
There will be joy again in this house.
We will celebrate among the dust.
I will take him.
We stood here before.
A long while ago.
Four years.
But now it seems as if only yesterday...
I was saying:
"If you were not a bride, I should kiss you goodbye."
"If I were not a bride there would be no goodbyes to be said."
I am not a bride.
Why did you never marry?
My father needed me.
And also...
It's still on my finger.
I said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.
It's become a part of my hand.
If Messala once knew you were here...
As he must.
He will know where they are.
And if you should find...?
- If he says they're dead...
- Messala will wish they were living.
I've seen too much of what hate can do.
My father is burned up with it.
But I've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater and love more powerful than hatred.
I believe it.
- Esther.
- Judah.
Stay alive.
Keep away from Messala.
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.
That time isn't yet come.
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.
This time you will be destroyed.
You'll die.
Tribune, compliments of Quintus Arrius.
He awaits your pleasure.
- Consul here?
- Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.
Thank him.
Bring him to me.
- I didn't know the consul had a son.
- He's a champion of the great circus.
Why is he presenting me with gifts?
- Perhaps he'll race against you.
- Look.
It's magnificent.
And from a man I've never met.
You're wrong, Messala.
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?
You were the magician, Messala.
You condemned me to the galleys.
When my ship was sunk, I saved the consul's life.
You know his seal?
Now I have come back as I swore I would.
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.
You suggest I use it on myself?
What has become of my mother and my sister?
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.
Find them, Messala.
Restore them to me, and I'll forget what I vowed with every stroke of that oar you chained me to.
I am not the governor.
I can do nothing without approval.
Then get it.
I will come back tomorrow.
Don't disappoint me, Messala.
What became of them?
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?
Go to the citadel, Drusus.
Find out.
- And if they're dead?
- They're dead!
"Miriam, wife.
Tirzah, daughter."
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?
E section lower level.
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.
Water.
Water.
Let me out!
- How long since you've seen them?
- Never.
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.
The food disappears.
Lepers.
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.
Then we'll burn out the cell.
Is someone there?
There is someone there.
Who are you?
Don't come any closer.
Who are you?
Esther.
It's Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam?
Stay where you are.
You have come home.
Stand back, Esther.
We are lepers.
Oh, Esther.
Tirzah.
Esther is Judah living?
Yes, he is alive.
He is here.
Where?
He is searching for you now.
I must find him and tell him.
- No!
- Tell my father.
No.
Tell no one.
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.
We won't return.
Judah has to be told.
No.
Please.
I couldn't see his face.
Is it changed?
No, he is not changed.
He's not changed.
You love him, Esther.
Promise me on your love for him you will never tell him you've seen us.
Is he never to know?
Let him remember us as we were.
Promise me.
There's nothing else I can hope for.
Only this.
I promise.
I am content.
Wait.
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.
I pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.
He'll free them.
He wants to survive.
He cannot free them, Judah.
What do you mean?
I saw them.
You saw them?
Where?
When did you see them?
They were dead.
They were dead.
When?
When?
When?
!
In the prison.
When I was waiting for news of my father.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't tell you.
Nor even you, Father.
I was afraid that if you saw Messala...
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.
It's over now.
Over?
- Judah.
- Over?
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.
Gentlemen.
Officers.
Defenders of great Rome's imperium may I enter?
Certainly, sheik.
You do us an unexpected honor.
The noble tribune is most gracious.
And now the question you're asking:
Why am I here?
As you know, I am a gambling man.
The games approach.
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.
I will back my own poor horses.
No limits?
- Mark me first!
- And me!
- What odds?
- A moment, please my lords, protectors of the far flung marshes.
May I first sit down?
Sit.
How much will you wager?
- Yes, let's call his game.
- Give the Arab a seat.
A bench, quickly.
Thank you.
- Now.
- 1000 denarii.
- 2000!
- Mark me!
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient.
There is time.
First gentlemen, the odds.
The tribune has won many times.
The odds should be in the same measure.
What is your pleasure, gentlemen?
Two to one.
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth where is the courage that made Rome master of the world?
I can get better odds on any street market.
Three to one.
Let us not haggle.
Let us be fair.
In four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.
- In all truth...
- Just a moment.
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.
The Prince of Hur.
Judah Ben-Hur.
Prince of Hur?
- He was sent to the galleys years ago.
- He has returned.
Returned?
Lmpossible.
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.
Well?
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.
You, tribune will you give me four to one?
Four to one.
Good.
Four to one, sheik.
The difference between a Roman and a Jew.
Or an Arab.
Bravely spoken.
Now we will settle the amount of our wager.
I will venture...
A thousand talents?
- A thousand talents?
- Yes, a thousand talents.
Of course, if it is too much...
A thousand talents it will be.
Agreed.
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.
You're good fellows.
If only men were this good.
Remember, Altair nine times around the circus.
Aldebaran.
Rigel, did you hear?
Nine lives to live.
My swift fellow.
You must not win the race the first time around.
You win the last time around.
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.
Steady Antares.
Like a rock.
You will be our anchor.
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.
They have taken me into their family.
Rest well, my stars.
Tomorrow we go up to the city.
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it the news will scorch the streets of the Roman world.
Pontius Pilate here?
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.
You will make him see what men are born in this land.
I only know that I race against Messala.
Look for the yoke.
Ease that strap.
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.
Into Your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as You will.
The Star of David.
To shine out for your people and my people together and blind the eyes of Rome.
They are ready.
Easy, girl, easy.
Number five.
Where is number five?
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.
Yes, this is the day.
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.
Hail, Jupiter.
Give me victory.
Watch your line!
Keep your places!
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.
Citizens I welcome you to these games in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.
We dedicate them to his glory and to the glory of Rome of which you are all part.
Let us honor those who race for us today.
They come here from Alexandria Messina Carthage Cyprus Rome Corinth Athens Phrygia and Judea.
To the best of these, a crown of victory.
The race begins.
Hail, Caesar!
Come, my children, come!
The Roman pig!
Salute.
A great victory.
You are the people's one true god for the time being.
Permit us to worship.
I crown their god.
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.
A long life, young Arrius and the good sense to live it.
We cannot wait, tribune.
He will come.
He will...
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.
He will come!
He will come.
I've sent for him, and he will come.
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.
Do you understand?
To hack the legs off me?
Not yet.
Not till I've seen him.
I don't receive him with half a body.
No!
I told you, Drusus.
I told you.
Here he is.
Triumph complete, Judah.
The race won.
The enemy destroyed.
I see no enemy.
What do you think you see?
The smashed body of a wretched animal?
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.
Let me help you.
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.
Dead.
And the race over.
It isn't over, Judah.
They're not dead.
Where are they?
Where are they?
Look for them in the Valley of the Lepers if you can recognize them.
It goes on.
It goes on, Judah.
The race...
The race is not over.
Is there a way down here?
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.
Man.
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.
There are many women.
Of the family of Hur.
We have no names here.
For them?
- Why did you say they were dead?
- It was what they wanted.
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?
Not to see them?
They are coming.
Love them in the way they must need to be loved.
Not to look at them.
Let them be as if you had never come here.
Please!
Is Judah well?
Is he happy?
Yes, he is well.
Your mind can be at rest for him.
He is well, Miriam.
God be with you.
They have gone.
We can go back.
Go back to what?
Judah, they have one blessing left.
To think you remember them as they were and live your own life.
Forget what is here.
Forget?
It's as though they're alive in a grave.
- But what can you do?
- Undo what you've done.
How could you have suffered them to come here?
I must see them.
No, Judah, please!
Judah!
Think, Judah, think.
It would tear them apart if they see you.
He is here.
I have found Him.
The child has become a man.
And the man, I know it now, is the Son of God.
The promise is true.
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.
Life has been answered.
God has answered it.
Come.
Come with me.
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys thirst had nearly killed me.
A man gave me water to drink.
I went on living.
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.
No.
I am thirsty still.
Come and listen.
I have business with Rome.
You insist on death.
Goodbye, Judah.
You sent for me?
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.
- I honor him.
- As you may honor yourself.
You have been made a citizen of Rome.
Do you say nothing to this?
I have just come from the Valley of Stone where my mother and sister live what's left of their lives.
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.
I have heard this.
There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.
Where there is greatness, great government or power even great feeling or compassion error also is great.
We progress and mature by fault.
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.
There are other voices.
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place not to crucify yourself on a shadow such as old resentment or impossible loyalties.
Perfect freedom has no existence.
A grown man knows the world he lives in.
And for the present, the world is Rome.
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.
I am Judah Ben-Hur.
I cross this floor in spoken friendship as I would speak to Arrius.
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar ready to crush those who challenge his authority.
There are too many men of envy and ambition who try to disrupt the government of Rome.
You have become the victor and hero to those people.
They look to you, their one true god, as I call you.
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.
I am already part of this tragedy.
Return this to Arrius.
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you from personal disaster if you stay here.
You are too great a danger.
Leave Judea.
You have my word.
I was afraid you would never come back afraid of what would happen to you.
But I see you again.
Your father's waiting for me.
Where is he?
What do you mean to do?
Rest, sleep.
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.
Peace?
Love and peace.
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?
Where do you see them?
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.
Balthasar's word.
He is more than Balthasar's word.
His voiced traveled with such a still purpose.
It was more than a voice.
A man more than a man.
He said, "Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God."
Children of God?
In that dead valley where we left them?
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean until we have scoured off our bodies the crust and filth of being at the mercy of tyranny.
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.
- In blood?
- Yes, in blood!
I know there is a law in life.
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.
Death generates death as the vulture breeds the vulture.
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:
"Love your enemy.
Do good to those who despitefully use you."
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.
As you make us do now.
Are we to bear nothing together?
Even love?
I can hardly draw breath without feeling you in my heart.
But I know that everything I do from this moment bears greater pain than you have ever suffered.
It is better not to love me.
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy giving evil for evil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.
It's as though you had become Messala.
I've lost you, Judah.
No further.
What are you doing here?
I was here last evening waiting for you.
I have waited all night.
What has happened?
Where is Tirzah?
Leave the food.
I am coming closer.
Don't be afraid.
- What are you doing?
- Don't be afraid.
I've heard Him again, the man from Nazareth.
If ever words were from God, they are in everything He says.
I cannot bear that you should have never known this hand of quiet reaching towards us.
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find Him there.
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find Him.
Tirzah is dying.
Leave the food and go.
It's Judah.
Why did you tell him?
Yes, Judah, yes.
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.
Mother.
Wait, Mother, wait.
Let me talk with you.
Please.
No, no further.
Please.
No, Judah.
Son, no.
Mother, let me see Tirzah.
Tirzah is dying.
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know that life is everlasting and death is nothing to fear if you have faith.
I will take them to Him.
No!
God, no!
No, no, dear son.
Mother where is Tirzah?
Judah, no.
Judah, no.
You must not go to her, dear son.
Please.
Dear son.
I am afraid.
No cause.
The world is more than we know.
Tirzah, it's Judah.
No, Judah.
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?
- Why are the streets deserted?
- They have gone to the trial.
Trial?
Whose trial?
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.
- This cannot be true.
- Alms?
What has he done?
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.
Help for the blind.
- Look, lepers!
- Lepers!
Get away!
Stay away!
Go away!
Lepers!
Lepers!
How can this be?
I know this man.
Will someone help Him?
Take pity on Him.
Have mercy.
In His pain this look of peace.
Watch over them, Esther.
We must go back.
I brought you here to this when I hoped...
You haven't failed, Esther.
Hail King of the Jews!
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.
He gave me water and a heart to live.
What has He done to merit this?
He has taken the world of our sins onto Himself.
To this end He said He was born in that stable where I first saw Him.
For this cause, He came into the world.
For this death?
This beginning.
I have lived too long.
As though He were carrying in that cross the pain of the world.
So fearful, and yet why is it I'm not afraid anymore?
The shadow of a storm.
A strange darkness but still day.
His life is over.
What is it?
This tearing.
I am in pain.
I feel it too.
Do you see your hand?
Almost at the moment He died I heard Him say, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do."
Even then.
Even then.
And I felt His voice take the sword out of my hand.
I never figured Hal Crane would have the nerve to string up barbed wire.
It's more than barbed wire.
It's a thousand head of my steers, dying for feed and water.
You just have to drive your herds across his land once a year.
You could still work out something reasonable.
I'm through being reasonable.
I told Crane what would happen if he strung that wire.
Blaise...
We've pulled over some hard hills together and I've rode behind you all the way.
A wire fence is a poor excuse to make a widow out of Crane's wife.
What have you been thinking about all winter?
Crane's barbed-wire fence or Crane's pretty wife, Helen?
Oh, hi, strangers.
It's good to see you.
- Hi, Ernine.
- Ernine.
Be with you in a minute, Blaise.
I didn't think you men would get out in this weather.
Ernine, put up some coffee.
You boys must be eating pretty good at your place.
Sure ran through that last batch of supplies awful fast.
I didn't come to town for supplies.
I came here to get a shave.
Look, Blaise, these farmers got a right to live too.
Never saw so much stock on your shelves.
You're doing a pretty brisk trade with them, Vic.
They're decent, hard-working folks.
All they ask out of life is a break from the weather and a chance to work their lands in peace.
Ever known me to break the peace, Vic?
No, but I've seen you put away some who tried to.
- I don't hold for killing.
- You don't have to.
As long as you got somebody to do it for you.
I'm beholden to you for what you've done in the past but things has changed and we got to change with them.
I don't object to change, just fences.
Barbed-wire fences.
I warned Hal Crane he was foolish for ordering that load of wire.
Still ordered it for him, didn't you, though?
Well, a man has a right to spend his own money as he sees fit.
You've declared yourself, Vic.
That's all I want to know.
Crane's a proud man.
He won't knuckle down.
But he's a farmer.
That gun he carries is mostly bluff.
You call his hand, it will be plain murder.
Hello, Mrs Crane.
Why, hello, Vic.
Dan.
Mr Starrett.
If you'll just give me a list, I'll get right to it so you can leave town before dark.
We're not leaving.
Hal wants to stay overnight to settle some business.
Coffee's on, boys.
Oh, hello, Mrs Crane.
Won't you join us for some nice hot coffee?
Why, thanks, Ernine.
I don't know if I should.
This is the first time we've been away in months.
I promised Mrs Preston that we'd come over.
Come on, boys.
I make much better coffee than that ranch mud you drink.
Go ahead.
Have a nice friendly cup of coffee the way neighbours do.
Won't you sit down, Mr Starrett?
You know, I'm glad your husband is stringing up those barbed-wire fences.
We want more farmers around here and less cattle.
That's not a very friendly thing to say, Ernine.
Oh, I'm friendly enough, all right.
It's just that you and Blaise are keeping me from getting married.
I want a husband and not some ranch hand that makes $30 a month with a bed in a bunkhouse.
I want a young farmer, homesteading a quarter section.
I'm afraid Mr Starrett's more concerned with keeping the range open than your getting a husband.
You've got the best excuse I've heard yet.
Ernine, where did you put the shortening?
Oh, Father, just when we were getting sociable!
Excuse me.
How's the winter at your place?
Oh, it's been colder and harder than most.
Excuse me, Mrs Crane.
This coffee made me think how good whiskey would taste.
Excuse me.
See you at the Wyoming.
Do you want to tell me something, Helen?
I don't love you anymore, Blaise.
- I want you to understand that.
- I don't.
- Can't you see how wrong it was?
- I can see what's true.
I don't care what's wrong or right.
Loving you has made me a stranger in my own family.
It's made me feel cheap every time Hal looks at me.
It's not a nice feeling.
It's better not to love at all.
You met him first, you married him.
Right now you can't even remember why.
Spending the rest of your life with him, that would be the cheap thing to do.
When Hal and I first came here, you could have had me for the asking.
I'd come to a new country with a new husband.
I would have given up anything if you'd only taken me then.
I made a mistake.
- I'm not proud of what we did, Blaise.
- I'm not proud I let you stay with him.
I could have been stronger with your help.
I'm only concerned with what's going to be.
We're going to meet in town once or twice a year.
I'm going to call you Mr Starrett and you're going to call me Mrs Crane.
That's what has to be.
That's easy to say, not so easy to do.
I was more lonely this winter than I've ever been before.
But I had time to think.
I'm gonna be Hal Crane's wife forever.
I'm sorry you had to say that, Helen.
Everything has to be on Blaise Starrett's terms.
You don't want the farmers to fence their farms.
You back your orders with guns.
You want another man's wife but the man has to be dead before you'll take her.
You don't have much mercy, do you, Blaise?
You won't find much mercy anywhere in Wyoming.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Funny weather we're having.
If that warm wind keeps blowing, the road will be belly-deep in mud.
You might have to stay in town a few days.
I wouldn't count on that.
Hey, George.
My horse seems to be favouring her left foreleg.
Give it a good rub-down before you turn in tonight.
You might not be needing a horse tomorrow.
He's coming.
I see you brought the kerosene.
Five gallons, like you ordered.
We've been having a meeting.
- Doesn't look like a prayer meeting.
- It wasn't.
I'm speaking for all present, Blaise.
We're not going to stand for any gun play in Bitters.
I won't start it, Vic.
I'd like that tin of kerosene back, Blaise.
- Didn't you pay for it?
- It's paid for.
Take good care of it.
I'd like to have a word with you, Mr Starrett.
You must have passed my wagon on your way in.
I did.
Soon as the road's in shape I'm moving that wire up to my place.
- And I'm stringing it up.
- That's what I thought it was for.
HAL:
What do you intend to do about it?
It's going to be cold riding home tomorrow.
I thought it'd be nice to stop and make a fire.
I hear kerosene is the fastest way to burn up a wagon.
- HAL:
You burn my wagons and I'll...
- Hal...
Hal.
Please.
HAL:
What do you intend to do about it?
I intend to go upstairs and get a good night's sleep.
I asked you a question, Mr Starrett.
BLAISE:
When I wake up I'll know what to do.
- I usually do.
- I've got to know.
You want to know the future, Mr Crane.
That's wanting too much for any man.
I'm not afraid of you, Starrett.
Mr Starrett and I have some business to discuss.
Would you excuse us, please?
I'm sure Mr Starrett doesn't object to my presence here.
Mrs Crane being with you doesn't influence me.
I'll fight for what I believe, Mr Starrett.
I'll die if I have to but I'll fight.
I want you to know that.
You've got a big mouth, farmer.
You got big eyes too.
You came here a year ago in your broken-down wagon, looking for a choice spot to settle.
And you think you found it.
But you never stopped to think what made it such a good place.
When Dan and I came here
Bitters was the nesting spot for every thief and killer in the territory.
A man's life wasn't worth the price of a bullet.
No woman was safe in the streets, let alone in a lonely farmhouse.
It took more than a big mouth to get rid of the lice who infested every bend of the road you ride so safely on.
I'm not saying Dan and I did it alone.
But we did more than our share.
We hunted them down in the freezing cold while you sat back in the east, hugging your pot-bellied stoves.
Nobody thanked us.
Nobody paid us.
We did it because we felt we belonged.
We'd earned the right to belong.
And all you've done is ride in here and put down your stinking roots.
And now you tell us that you belong and we don't.
Mr Crane, you said you'd fight to keep what you wanted.
Well, I've been doing that for 20 years and I intend to keep on doing it.
And no pig-bellied farmer's going to stop me.
Give me a bottle, Tom.
Don't kill my husband.
He intends to kill me.
Hal's never fired a pistol in his whole life.
Then he shouldn't wear one.
He's not a coward.
He won't beg for his life.
I'm not that courageous.
I do beg you.
You should be telling this to him.
I have.
- He won't listen.
- What made you think I would?
Do you want me, Blaise?
Do you want me to ride out to your ranch with you?
I'm offering myself to you, on any terms you want, but leave Hal live.
Your husband's a stubborn man.
He won't give up his fences.
Why should he give you up?
I'll tell him I no longer love him.
He'll only come after you.
It'll still have to end the same way.
You're not a cruel man.
I've been close enough to you to know.
Why must you act like one?
Because I can't feel sorry for someone I hate.
Do you hate me too, Blaise?
Tell your husband to load up his wagons and take you out of Wyoming.
Don't you think I've tried?
I knew this was coming.
I've waited all winter long for this day.
You have to do it, Helen.
Make him take you away.
He's afraid of you but he's not a weak man.
He'll die before he'll run.
Then that's the way it'll have to be.
I'm sorry to have troubled you, Mr Starrett.
Dan?
I'm no good to you, Blaise.
I'm no good to you.
Hold it.
Don't touch that kerosene.
We want you to go home.
There are three of us.
Dan.
Dan!
Roll the bottle down the bar.
When it hits the floor, that's it.
Roll the bottle, Dan.
Anything we can do for you strangers?
Yes, could be.
I was looking for a quiet place.
We were settling a little private quarrel.
I apologise.
I don't like to break in on a party.
But we'll take your guns.
You won't find anything to take in this town.
You'd be surprised at what we can find to take.
Trail ends in this town.
No place to go but back.
The trail back is closed.
Who's following you?
- Cavalry.
- Two days' hard riding behind us.
Cavalry doesn't bother tracking seven men like you.
Captain Jack Bruhn,
United States Army, formerly.
BRUHN:
Hey, you.
I want food and service for my men.
- We'll pay.
- Yes, sir.
That cavalry won't stop for food and rest.
My men rest.
Now, listen, do as you're told and you can go about your business just like we're not here, almost.
But we are here so it's best you know with what you're dealing.
Pace here, he derives pleasure out of hurting people.
Tex, rile him and you're gonna hear some screaming in this town today.
Denver, half Cheyenne.
Him hate white men but he doesn't feel half so badly about white women.
Vause, bones covered with dirty skin but even half-drunk he's the fastest draw in Wyoming territory.
Shorty, we soldiered together.
The young fella, he's a fresh recruit but he's learning fast.
I believe you.
You just killed a man for no reason.
There will be no more killing and to make sure,
Denver, Vause, take that drunk and round up every gun in town
and destroy them.
And don't waste time arguing with anybody.
How many people live around here?
About 20.
- Who's the law?
- We handle our own law.
Not now.
Let's get started, Bruhn.
We can do whatever we want in this town.
I'm edgy to get doing.
Where do you hide your women around here?
Leave our women out of this.
We only want to borrow 'em.
TEX:
We'll give 'em back.
No women.
And no whiskey and no gunning.
With 40,000 in gold in our saddlebags and a long ride ahead?
We'll pleasure ourselves at the end of the trail.
It's gonna be a long day, Captain.
You wanna argue, Pace?
No, just reminding you.
I gotta have a drink.
One.
I'd like one, but it's the order of the day.
Is there a doctor in this town?
BLAISE:
Doc Langer.
Vet, back of the barbershop.
BRUHN:
Can this horse doctor take out a bullet slug?
- BLAISE:
He has.
- (BOTH SNIGGER)
BRUHN:
Freeze it, Pace.
You seem to think a lot of your women in this town.
Who does she belong to?
She's my wife.
Change your mind about no women, Captain?
There are only four women in this town.
Do you want your men killing each other over them?
Tex, Pace...
Search upstairs.
Bring anybody you find down here.
Shorty, take these two to the store.
Then round up all the women and put 'em in the store and tell 'em to get inside and stay inside.
My wife is upstairs.
My men won't molest your women unless I give them permission.
(SHRIEKING)
- We found one more.
- Get down here!
Lady, you go to the store with the rest of the women.
Hey, you.
I told you to prepare the rations.
Now, get going.
We've been riding hard for over a month, Captain.
Hey!
Hide your liquor and hide it good.
(COUGHING)
Now...
let's go see that horse doctor.
When the boys come back, keep them here.
No man leaves this saloon till I return.
And no whiskey.
That's an order.
- You handle your men well, Captain.
- They need me.
Come along with me.
That bullet's way in deep.
I don't see how he's still walking around.
- Has he got a chance?
- If he was a horse or a cow, I'd know.
I just ain't had too much practice on humans.
It says that a person with a deep wound can die of internal bleeding even though nothing shows on the outside.
- Is he bleeding internally?
- I couldn't tell.
Do you want me to kill him?
Kill him?
If Bruhn dies, this town gets torn apart.
They'll go after you first.
You got to keep him alive.
But how?
Look, I don't know how.
I can't operate.
I haven't got the instruments.
- I wouldn't know how to use them.
- You're gonna operate.
What are you two talking about?
The Captain's waiting for you to take the bullet out, Doc.
He's waiting for the water to boil.
If Bruhn dies, I'll kill you.
What are we waiting for?
Sit down.
You'd better have some of this.
Put it away.
Hide the liquor.
BRUHN:
Mr Starrett, talk to me.
What about?
Anything, Mr Starrett.
Anything.
BLAISE:
Where did you serve in the cavalry, Captain?
Why do you ask?
I remember hearing about a Captain Bruhn.
Some incident with the Mormons in Utah.
I just wondered if you were the same.
DOC:
Would you help me, please?
What did you hear?
BLAISE:
No.
Couldn't be you.
Yes, it was.
BRUHN:
Strange, how one word can change a man's life.
I could have ordered, "Retreat!"
My command was, "Fire!"
At West Point I made up my mind to be all soldier, which doesn't leave much room for being human.
Thanks.
Keep your people in check.
I'll control my men.
Gene, stay with me.
I'm sleepy.
What are his chances, Doc?
I don't know.
It was in real deep.
I'd say if he lasts through the night...
I just don't know.
Shorty.
I found a bottle in the barbershop.
The Captain says no whiskey.
- He'll never know.
- He knows everything.
They'd have hung you back in Casper if it hadn't been for Captain Bruhn.
And I'd have been an old bum in Adeline.
I wish you hadn't busted the bottle, Shorty.
We could have had just one drink.
Did you ever see what the Captain does to men that disobey?
- I've never seen anybody disobey him.
- I have.
Be glad I busted that bottle.
I'll get it.
It's a relief to see you and Mr Starrett friendly again.
Mr Preston and I were so worried.
That's all over, isn't it, Mr Starrett?
Doesn't seem very important right now.
- Hal and you can be good friends.
- Yes, we might try it sometime.
What Blaise needs is a wife to steady him down.
Clagget stole a horse from 'em.
He's just saddling up.
He's gonna make a run for it.
He's crazy.
He'll never make it.
- He knows they're watching the road.
- Keep the women inside.
Clagget, hold it.
My wife's alone at the farm.
I got to go to her.
You can't get through.
They got a man watching the road.
I'll get through.
(GUNSHOT)
Bruhn is dying.
I saw him a little while ago.
He looks strong and healthy.
He might not last the day.
- What will happen if he dies?
- They'll start drinking and fighting.
- I've got to get Tommy out of that place.
- No, you can't help him.
You better stay.
- They'll be here too, soon enough.
- They mustn't find you here.
ERNINE:
Where can we hide in town?
DAN:
Beats me.
Even if we had horses you couldn't get away through the snow.
The ladies will have to walk.
Get back to town.
Get out of here.
Gene.
That's your name, isn't it?
Don't make me use this gun.
I don't think you ever shot anybody.
I could start with you.
What do you want?
Let those women go by.
I can't do that.
They're coming.
Are you gonna shoot them?
I can't cross Bruhn.
I got to warn him.
No.
I don't think you want those women to get hurt.
I don't think Bruhn wants it either.
Only Tex and Pace want it.
You gonna do it for them?
(GUNFIRE)
- Why didn't you stop 'em?
- GENE:
I was trying to.
Go back to town.
BRUHN:
I told you your women would be safe.
All you had to do was wait.
Why didn't you believe me?
You've got all the cards, Bruhn.
Go ahead and play.
Only don't take it out on them.
It was my idea.
I'm gonna have some fun with them now, Jack.
The name is Bruhn.
Ain't no reason to give 'em a break now, Bruhn.
- I put my claim on that one first.
- I'm gonna make the little one happy.
You won't turn your men loose, Bruhn.
Why not?
They wanna get drunk.
They wanna have some fun.
They could swallow this town whole and nobody would be alive to tell the tale.
You won't let that happen.
- Say the word, Captain.
- I'll toss you for the pleasure.
Mr Blaise, you broke your word.
Only because I don't believe you can hold your men.
Tex, put down the gun.
Go back to your homes, everybody.
Stay on the inside.
You, stay here.
He's all yours, Texas.
No gun.
(LAUGHTER)
(LAUGHTER CONTINUES)
(LAUGHTER CONTINUES)
Thought you'd make yourself a big man in this town, huh?
Vause, Denver, finish him.
With your fists.
BRUHN:
Shorty, bring that boy.
- SHORTY:
Come here, sonny.
- VIC:
What do you want him for?
BRUHN:
He comes with me.
Your friends will sacrifice you but they won't cause a young boy to be hurt by acting foolish.
Don't worry about the boy.
I'll take care of him.
I promise.
Now, go on back.
Please.
He'll be leaving as soon as it's daybreak.
Sure.
Bruhn seems to be getting better.
They're staying close to the Wyoming.
Good.
Hal is grateful for what you did.
Deeply grateful.
Go back to him.
I told him I was coming here.
I asked him to come with me.
But he told me to come alone.
I believe he knows and understands.
What's to understand?
You're his wife, I'm a stranger.
Go back to your husband, Mrs Crane.
Thank you, Blaise.
Thanks for understanding.
- You mustn't come in here.
- I've got to see Bobby.
He's all right.
This is no place for you to be.
Please.
Go home.
I wanna see Bobby first.
BOBBY:
Please don't.
Ow!
No, no!
- Ow!
- Say you'll do it or I'll break your little arm.
No, no.
Please don't.
Ow!
- Let the kid go, Pace.
- Bruhn's got the whiskey here.
I want the kid to find out where it is and get a bottle.
If you want a drink, ask Bruhn.
Are you giving orders now?
In this case I am.
Forget it, Gene.
We're all getting jumpy from not having any liquor or fun.
When he cools off, give him his gun back.
(SNORING)
Get out of here, Ernine.
I'm taking him with me.
Stop.
Look, I'm sorry.
You can't do that.
She hasn't done anything.
Don't hurt her.
I'm not gonna hurt anybody.
He's all right.
He's as rotten as the rest of them.
You shouldn't have come here.
I'm taking Bobby back with me.
That'll just make things worse.
The boy's got to stay.
I saw what happened.
I heard him screaming.
It won't happen again.
The boy has to stay.
There's no other way, Ernine.
How do you do, Miss?
She was worried about her brother.
She's leaving.
No need to be.
What's your name, Miss?
Bruhn said to leave the women alone, Pace.
I didn't bring her.
She's here because she wanted to be.
- That gives me certain privileges.
- Freeze, Pace!
This sure is a night for tangling.
I got a better idea.
Let's toss a coin for her.
Leave.
Bobby, tell your sister to leave.
Go ahead.
I'll be all right.
You didn't have to pull that iron on me, Gene.
I'm your friend.
We ride together, don't we?
Sure, Pace.
We ride together.
We're friends.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
Yeah, thanks.
I'm worried about Bruhn, Doc.
- How is he?
- Coming along.
He ain't hurt bad, is he, Doc?
Not like dying?
- You don't want him to die, do you?
- No, of course not.
He never answered you.
I tell you, Tex... there's something really wrong with Bruhn.
There is?
- What?
- TEX:
You sure look fine, Bruhn.
- Where's that little boy?
- PACE:
In the kitchen with Gene.
I don't want that boy harmed or frightened.
We all like the kid, Bruhn.
I want the boy with Gene.
How about breaking open a bottle, just one drink?
I'm getting a chill.
Just one drink.
I want every man cold sober.
We pull out of here at dawn.
(WIND HOWLING)
We don't ride tomorrow or the day after.
Did you see the weather coming in?
My tongue's salt-dry for whiskey.
We took that army pay wagon, fought hard, shot our way out.
For what?
Sitting around on our butts like this was Sunday school!
Captain, you ain't letting nature take its course.
Men don't act like you make us act here.
We've got this town under our thumb but we ain't getting no pleasure.
Two more days like this is gonna seem like two more years.
Maybe not even you can keep us in line, Bruhn.
I gave my word to the people of this town.
Why did you?
To make you look big and us little?
Maybe you better answer, Bruhn.
You'll drink, fool around, then kill each other over these women.
I'm a-riding out of here at daybreak with six men.
It's Saturday night.
Invite the ladies over for a social.
There's no harm in coffee and cookies and a little dancing.
- It'll take the edge off for a while.
- Yeah.
And all I'd like is a chance to talk to that little girl.
I won't even ask her to dance if she don't want to.
With no liquor it'll be a quiet Saturday night.
We need it bad, Captain.
Very well.
(HONKY-TONK PIANO)
BRUHN:
Tex!
One dance and I get her back.
If I was drunk I'd really show you how to dance.
Maybe Bruhn will open up the whiskey pretty soon.
I won't let Pace touch you.
Are you any better?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
No, you're right.
I came with them, I'm one of them.
I said I wouldn't let Pace touch you but you don't have to dance with me.
Don't leave me.
Why don't we dance?
I want to look at you.
I think Tex has got to the point where he can't stop.
Tex.
May I dance with the lady?
Now.
I'm gonna get Bruhn one of these days.
It's been tried by a lot of dead men.
Why did you have to do this terrible thing?
There are things worse, Ma'am, than dancing with lonely men.
- Please let us go.
- Soon.
Why did you have to come here?
You should be grateful.
Our coming saved the life of your husband.
I don't believe Blaise would have gone through with it.
Mrs Crane, when my men and I leave here there will be a showdown and you will be a widow.
Shorty.
Shorty.
- Having a good time, gentlemen?
- Yeah.
How long can Bruhn live?
Well, I gave him a big shot of morphine.
It deadens pain, makes the patient feel fine.
As soon as that dose wears off, he's gonna start coughing.
The cough's gonna rip the lungs a little bit more.
A few hours after he starts coughing he's gonna die.
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)
I didn't expect to hear music tonight.
They took the women to the saloon with them, to dance.
Dance?
What are the men gonna do about it?
Nothing, just talking.
Crane is talking about going to see Bruhn.
If he does, looks like you'll get what you wanted without doing a thing.
BLAISE:
Hold it, that's enough.
(MUSIC STOPS)
Are you giving the orders now?
No.
You don't know about the weather up in these mountains.
It's storming up here but not down in the valley below.
You came here to talk about the weather?
Those soldiers you think are days behind you are riding over the trail and they're heading this way.
Your concern for my men and me, Mr Blaise, is very touching.
Your position is hardly a tactical one.
You can't fight those soldiers here.
Even a private would realise that, Captain.
Can you suggest an alternative?
Yes, if you stop this party.
There's another way through the mountains.
No trail, no pass, but there's a way.
- I've been through it.
- He's lying.
Why didn't you take your women that way this morning?
It's too rough for the women.
Might be too rough for some of your men.
He's lying.
I tell you, Bruhn, he's lying.
I'll find out.
You ride with us, lead the way.
(WIND HOWLING)
You couldn't find it without me.
Shorty...
Pack your gear and assemble the men.
We're moving out at daybreak.
Gene, get the ladies out of here.
(COUGHING)
(COUGHING)
Don't be frightened anymore.
We'll be gone in a few minutes.
Can I get you something?
Some tobacco?
No, thanks.
I don't smoke.
I'll always remember you.
Goodbye, Gene.
Goodbye, Ernine.
You mustn't go with them.
I have to.
I might come back later but I have to.
If you go, you'll never come back.
There's no way through that mountain.
Blaise.
There is no trail to Cheyenne.
I never said there was a trail.
I said there was a way through.
Stop manoeuvring.
There's no way.
Kill him.
Wait, Gene.
I'd like you to know why I lied to you.
I'm not interested.
You're a dying man, Bruhn.
That interest you?
How do you want to die?
You're a man, not an animal.
You can ride out here with me and die clean, or turn your men loose on this town and die like a pig in the mud.
Do you want another Mormon massacre?
(COUGHING CONTINUES)
How do you want to go, Bruhn?
Ernine told you there was no trail.
- I didn't say who told me.
- Ernine must like you.
Have you any idea what Pace will do to her when Bruhn dies?
- I can stop him.
- Are you sure?
I won't be here to help you, son.
(COUGHING CONTINUES)
Just a minute.
I know what I'm doing and I know what Gene's doing.
But you, what's your reason?
- Why do you want to die?
- I know what I'm doing too, Bruhn.
Let's leave it at that.
I guess every fool has his reason.
Ernine spoke the truth.
- There is no way across the mountain.
- Who knows?
Maybe I'll find a trail.
I'm not even sure they're going.
But if they do go, you know you won't come back.
Probably not.
Why are you doing this?
I'm not doing anything special.
I'm just taking some bad men out of a good town.
You're the same man who would have killed Hal.
I don't know you at all.
No reason to.
Are you doing it because of me?
I'd like to know, Blaise.
I'm doing it because of myself.
That night in my room in the Wyoming you asked me not to kill your husband and I took a good look at myself in the mirror.
I didn't like what I saw.
I'm not any different from the men who rode in and took over this town, only they don't pretend to be anything but what they are.
And that's all there is to it, Mrs Crane.
Let's move.
Ah, I feel better now.
I'm beginning to hope we're gonna make it.
None of us are gonna make it.
Hey, Blaise, how are we gonna get out of this?
(WHINNYING)
I'm gonna need me another horse.
Ride one of the pack horses.
Gene, get off your horse.
Bruhn said get down.
And I'm saying leave your saddlebags where they are.
There's 6,000 in gold in 'em.
You can't carry it anyway.
Get down.
Just follow the tracks.
If snow covers them, keep the wind at your back.
You'll be all right.
Down!
Hey!
You won't be needing that gun.
We're both giving this party, Mr Blaise.
Move out, son.
Say hello to the soldiers for us, kid.
TEX:
That's right.
SHORTY:
Captain Bruhn!
Captain Bruhn!
What's wrong?
Hey, Starrett, help me.
Hold it.
We have to stop here till the Captain can ride again.
We're not stopping.
(GUNSHOT)
Get on your horse.
Thanks,
Captain Bruhn.
What are you thanking him for?
Get on your horse.
I don't think you wanna kill me.
We got to have Blaise, Tex.
We're gonna stop and bury these two men.
You know, it's kind of a lucky ride after all.
Lucky?
Yup.
We started out with about 6,000 in gold apiece.
Now we got 18,000 more to split four ways.
Cayenne, here I come.
(LAUGHTER CONTINUES)
What are you looking for?
You see anything?
Not much.
There's nothing to see.
You know where you're taking us?
Yes.
You lie, you know it.
I know it.
Turn around and go back to camp.
I'll show you what a Cheyenne does with a liar.
Get up.
You're not hurt.
Vause gave Tex and me the idea himself.
Let's ride.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on.
Come on back there.
Come on back there!
Not much shelter.
(WIND HOWLING)
PACE:
Stop him.
Stop him, Tex.
(GUNSHOT)
Now we have to go out and bring him back.
We need him.
I shot his horse.
He'll come crawling back to us.
Now, let's get this fire started.
We got the horses, the grub and the guns.
He can't live out there.
Damn wind!
Horses can't stand it either.
Now, let's get this fire started.
What are you doing?
(NEIGHING)
I don't have any matches.
I don't have any matches.
No matches.
(WIND HOWLING)
(WIND HAS DROPPED)
(NEIGHING)
Welcome home, Mr Starrett.
Wait a minute.
I thought it best he stay here while the soldiers will be around.
I'd like to work for you, Mr Starrett, if you'll have me.
All right, Gene.
Then you won't need this.
I never figured Hal Crane would have the nerve to string up barbed wire.
It's more than barbed wire.
It's a thousand head of my steer dying for feed and water.
Oh, you just have to drive your herds across his land once a year.
You could still work out something reasonable.
I'm through being reasonable.
I told Crane what would happen if he strung that wire.
Blaise, we've pulled over some hard hills together and I've rode behind you all the way.
A wire fence is a poor excuse to make a widow out of Crane's wife.
DAN:
What have you been thinking about all winter?
Crane's barbed wire fence, or Crane's pretty wife, Helen?
Oh, hi, strangers.
It's good to see you.
Hi, Ernine.
Ernine...
Be with you in a minute, Blaise.
I didn't think you men would get out in this kind of weather.
Ernine, put up some coffee.
You boys must be eating pretty good at your place.
Sure ran through that last batch of supplies awful fast.
I didn't come to town for supplies.
I came here to get a shave.
Look, Blaise, these farmers have got a right to live, too.
Never saw so much stock on your shelves.
You're doing a pretty brisk trade with them, aren't you, Vic?
They're decent, hard-working folks.
All they ask out of life is a break from the weather and a chance to work their lands in peace.
You ever know me to break the peace, Vic?
No, but I've seen you put away some who tried to.
I don't hold for killing.
You don't have to.
As long as you've got somebody to do it for you.
I'm beholden to you for what you've done in the past, but things is changing and we've got to change with them.
I don't object to change, just fences, barbed wire fences.
Well, I warned Hal Crane he was foolish for ordering that load of wire.
You ordered it for him, didn't you, though?
A man has the right to spend his own money as he sees fit.
You declared yourself, Vic, that's all I want to know.
Crane's a proud man.
He won't knuckle down.
But he's a farmer.
That gun he carries is mostly bluff.
You call his hand, it'll be plain murder.
Hello, Mrs. Crane.
Hello, Vic...
Dan.
Mr. Starrett.
If you'll just give me your list, I'll get right to it so you can leave town before dark.
We're not leaving.
Hal wants to stay overnight to settle some business.
Coffee's on, boys.
Oh, hello, Mrs. Crane.
Won't you join us for some nice hot coffee?
Why, thanks, Ernine.
I don't know if I should.
This is the first time we've been away from the farm in months.
I promised Mrs. Preston that we'd come over.
Come on, boys.
I make much better coffee than that ranch mud you've been drinking.
Go ahead.
Have a nice, friendly cup of coffee the way neighbors do.
Won't you sit down, Mr. Starrett?
You know something, Mrs. Crane?
I'm glad your husband's stringing up those barbed wire fences.
We want more farmers around here and less cattle.
That's not a very friendly thing to say, Ernine.
Oh, I'm friendly enough all right.
It's just that you and Blaise are keeping me from getting married.
I want a husband and not some ranch hand that makes $30 a month with a bed in a bunkhouse.
I want a young farmer homesteading a quarter-section.
Ernine, I'm afraid Mr. Starrett's more concerned with keeping the range open than in your getting a husband.
You've got the best excuse I've heard yet.
Ernine, where'd you put the shortening?
Oh, father!
Just when we were getting sociable!
Excuse me.
How's the winter at your place?
Oh, it's been colder and harder than most.
Excuse me, Mrs. Crane.
This coffee made me think how good whiskey would taste.
Excuse me.
See you at the Wyoming.
(DOOR BELLS TINKLING)
You want to tell me something, Helen?
I don't love you anymore, Blaise.
I want you to understand that and believe it.
I don't.
Can't you see how wrong it was?
I can see what's true.
I don't care what's wrong or right.
Loving you has made me a stranger in my own family.
It's made me feel cheap every time Hal looks at me.
It's not a nice feeling.
It's better not to love at all.
You met him first, you married him.
Right now you can't even remember why.
To spend the rest of your life with him, that would be the cheap thing to do.
When Hal and I first came here, you could have had me for the asking.
I'd come to a new country with a new husband.
I would have given up anything if you had only taken me then!
I made a mistake.
I'm not proud of what we did, Blaise.
I'm not proud I let you stay with him.
I could have been stronger and faithful with your help.
I'm only concerned with what's going to be.
We're going to meet in town once or twice a year.
I'm going to call you Mr. Starrett and you're going to call me Mrs. Crane.
That's what has to be.
That's easy to say, not so easy to do.
I was more lonely this winter than I've ever been before.
But I had time to think.
I'm going to be Hal Crane's wife forever.
I'm sorry you had to say that, Helen.
Everything has to be on Blaise Starrett's terms.
You don't want the farmers to fence their farms, you back your orders with guns!
You want another man's wife, but the man has to be dead before you'll take her!
You don't have much mercy, do you, Blaise?
You won't find much mercy anywhere in Wyoming.
(DOOR BELLS TINKLING)
Funny weather we're having.
That warm wind keeps blowing, the road'll be belly-deep in mud.
You might have to stay in town a few days.
I wouldn't count on that.
Say, George, my horse seems to be favoring her left foreleg.
Give it a good rubdown before you turn in tonight, will you?
You might not be needing a horse tomorrow.
He's coming.
I see you bought the kerosene.
Five gallons, like you ordered.
We've been having a meeting.
Doesn't look like a prayer meeting.
It wasn't.
I'm speaking for all present, Blaise.
We're not going to stand for any gunplay in Bitters.
I won't start it, Vic.
I'd like that tin of kerosene back, Blaise.
Didn't you pay for it?
It's paid for.
Take good care of it.
CRANE:
I'd like to have a word with you, Mr. Starrett.
You must've passed my wagon on your way in.
- I did.
- Soon as the road's in shape,
I'm moving that wire up to my place and I'm stringing it up.
That's what I thought it was for.
CRANE:
What do you intend to do about it?
It's going to be cold riding home tomorrow.
I thought it would be nice to stop and make a fire.
I hear kerosene is the fastest way to burn up a wagon.
- CRANE:
You burn my wagon, and I'll...
- Hal!
Hal!
Please...
CRANE:
What do you intend to do about it?
I intend to go upstairs and get a good night's sleep.
I asked you a question, Mr. Starrett.
When I wake up in the morning, I'll know what to do.
- I usually do.
- I've got to know!
You want to know the future, Mr. Crane.
That's wanting too much for any man.
I'm not afraid of you, Starrett.
Mr. Starrett and I have some business to discuss.
Would you excuse us, please?
I'm sure Mr. Starrett doesn't object to my presence here.
Mrs. Crane being with you doesn't influence me.
I'll fight for what I believe, Mr. Starrett.
I'll die if I have to, but I'll fight.
I want you to know that.
You've got a big mouth, farmer.
You've got big eyes, too.
You came here a year ago in your broken-down wagon
looking for a choice spot to settle.
And you think you found it.
But you never stopped to think what made it such a good place.
When Dan and I came here,
Bitters was a nesting spot for every thief and killer in the territory.
A man's life wasn't worth the price of a bullet.
No woman was safe in the streets, let alone in a lonely farm house!
It took more than a big mouth to get rid of the lice who infested every bend in the road you ride so safely on.
I'm not saying Dan and I did it alone, but we did more than our share.
We hunted them down in the freezing cold while you sat back in the East hugging your pot-bellied stoves!
Nobody thanked us, nobody paid us.
We did it because we felt we belonged.
We'd earned the right to belong!
And all you've done is ride in here and put down your stinking roots!
And now you tell us that you belong and we don't!
Mr. Crane, you said you'd fight to keep what you want.
Well, I've been doing that for 20 years and I intend to keep on doing it!
And no pig-bellied farmer's going to stop me!
Give me a bottle, Tom.
Don't kill my husband.
He intends to kill me.
Hal's never fired a pistol in his whole life.
Then he shouldn't wear one.
He's not a coward!
He won't beg for his life.
I'm not that courageous.
I do beg you!
You should be telling this to him.
I have.
He won't listen.
What made you think I would?
Do you want me, Blaise?
Do you want me to ride out to your ranch with you?
I'm offering myself to you on any terms you want, but leave Hal live.
Your husband's a stubborn man.
If he won't give up his fences, why should he give you up?
I'll tell him I no longer love him.
He'll only come after you.
It'll still have to end the same way.
You're not a cruel man.
I've been close enough to you to know.
Why must you act like one?
Because I can't feel sorry for someone I hate.
Do you hate me, too, Blaise?
Tell your husband to load up his wagons and take you out of Wyoming.
Don't you think I've tried?
I knew this was coming.
I've waited all winter long for this day.
You'll have to do it, Helen.
Make him take you away.
He's afraid of you, but he's not a weak man.
He'll die before he'll run!
Then that's the way it'll have to be.
I'm sorry to have troubled you, Mr. Starrett.
Dan?
I'm no good to you, Blaise.
I'm no good to you.
Hold it!
Don't touch that kerosene.
We want you to go home.
There are three of us.
Dan.
Dan!
Roll the bottle down the bar.
When it hits the floor, that's it.
Roll the bottle, Dan!
(GUNSHOT)
(GLASS SHATTERING)
Anything we can do for you, strangers?
BRUHN:
Yes, could be.
I was looking for a quiet place.
We were settling a little private quarrel.
I apologize.
I don't like to break in on a party.
But we'll take your guns.
You won't find anything to take in this town.
TEX:
You'd be surprised at what we can find to take.
The trail ends in this town.
There's no place to go but back.
The trail back is closed.
Who's following you?
Cavalry.
Two days hard riding behind us.
Cavalry doesn't bother tracking seven men like you.
Captain Jack Bruhn, United States Army, formerly.
Hey, you!
I want food and service for my men!
- We'll pay.
- Yes, sir.
That cavalry won't stop for food and rest.
And my men rest?
Now listen, do as you're told and you can go about your business just like we're not here, almost.
But we are here, so it's best you know with what you're dealing.
Pace, here, he derives pleasure out of hurting people.
Tex, rile him and you're going to hear some screaming in this town today.
Denver, half-Cheyenne.
Him hate white men.
But he doesn't feel half so badly about white women.
Vause, bones covered with dirty skin, but even half-drunk, he's the fastest draw in Wyoming Territory.
And Shorty, we soldiered together.
The young fella, well, he's a fresh recruit, but he's learning fast.
BLAISE:
I believe you!
You just killed a man for no reason!
There will be no more killing, and to make sure...
Denver!
Vause!
Take that drunk and round up every gun in town and destroy them!
Don't waste time arguing with anybody.
- How many people live around here?
- About 20.
- Who's the law?
- We handle our own law.
Not now.
Let's get started, Bruhn.
We can do whatever we want in this town.
I'm edgy to get doing.
(CHUCKLING)
Where do you hide your women around here?
Leave our women out of this!
We only want to borrow them.
We'll give them back.
(LAUGHING)
No women!
And no whiskey, and no gunning.
With $40,000 in gold in our saddlebags and a long ride ahead?
We'll pleasure ourselves at the end of the trail.
It's going to be a long day, Captain.
You want to argue, Pace?
No.
Just reminding you.
I got to have a drink.
One.
I'd like one, but it's the order of the day.
Is there a doctor in this town?
BLAISE:
Doc Langer.
A vet, back of the barber shop.
BRUHN:
Can this horse doctor take out a bullet slug?
BLAISE:
He has.
(CHUCKLING)
BRUHN:
Freeze it, Pace!
You seem to think a lot of your women in this town.
Who does she belong to?
She's my wife.
Change your mind about no women, Captain?
There are only four women in this town.
Do you want your men killing each other over them?
Tex,
Pace, search upstairs.
Bring anybody you find down here.
Shorty, take these two to the store.
Then round up all the women and put them in the store and tell them to get inside and stay inside.
My wife is upstairs.
My men won't molest your women unless I give them permission.
(GASPING)
We found one more.
Get down here!
Lady, you go to the store with the rest of the women.
Hey, you!
I told you to prepare the rations.
Now get going.
We've been riding hard for over a month, Captain.
Hey!
Hide your liquor and hide it good.
(BRUHN COUGHING)
Now, let's go see that horse doctor.
When the boys come back, keep them here.
No man leaves this saloon till I return.
And no whiskey.
That's an order.
You handle your men well, Captain.
They need me.
Come along with me.
That bullet's way in deep.
He lost a lot of blood.
I don't see how he's still walking around.
Has he got a chance?
Well, if he was a horse, or a calf, or a cow, I'd know.
I just ain't had too much practice on humans.
It says here that a person with a deep wound can die from the internal bleeding, even though nothing shows on the outside.
Is he bleeding internally?
Well, I couldn't tell.
Do you want me to kill him?
Kill him?
Bruhn dies, this town gets torn apart.
You'll be the one they'll go after first!
You've got to keep him alive!
How?
Look, I don't know how.
I can't operate.
I haven't got the instruments.
I wouldn't know how to use them even if I did have them.
- You're going to operate!
- But...
What are you two talking about?
The captain's waiting for you to take the bullet out, Doc.
He's waiting for the water to boil.
If Bruhn dies, I'll kill you!
What are we waiting for?
Sit down.
You'd better have some of this.
Put it away.
Hide the liquor.
BRUHN:
Mr. Starrett, talk to me.
What about?
Anything, Mr. Starrett.
Anything.
(SIGHS)
BLAISE:
Where did you serve in the cavalry, Captain?
Why do you ask?
I remember hearing about a Captain Bruhn.
Some incident with the Mormons in Utah.
I just wondered if you were the same.
DOC:
Would you help me, please?
What did you hear?
BLAISE:
No...
It couldn't be you.
Yes, it was.
Strange how one word could change a man's life.
I could have ordered retreat.
My command was, "Fire."
(GASPS)
At West Point, I made up my mind to be all soldier, which doesn't leave much room for being human.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Thanks.
Keep your people in check.
I'll control my men.
Gene, you stay with me.
I'm sleepy.
What are his chances, Doc?
I don't know.
It was in real deep.
I'd say if he lasts through the night...
I just don't know!
Shorty.
I found a bottle in the barber shop.
The captain says no whiskey.
- He'll never know.
- He knows everything.
They'd have hung you back in Casper if it hadn't been for Captain Bruhn!
And I'd have been an old bum in Abilene.
I wish you hadn't busted the bottle, Shorty.
We could have had just one drink.
Did you ever see what the captain does to men who disobey?
I've never seen anybody disobey him.
I have.
Be glad I busted that bottle.
I'll get it.
It's a relief to see you and Mr. Starrett friendly again.
Mr. Preston and I were so worried.
That's all over, isn't it, Mr. Starrett?
It doesn't seem very important right now.
Hal and you could be good friends.
Yes, we might try it sometime.
What Blaise needs is a wife to steady him down.
Clagget stole a horse from them.
He's just saddling up.
He's going to make a run for it!
He's crazy!
He'll never make it!
He knows they're watching the road.
CRANE:
Keep the women inside.
Clagget!
Stop it!
My wife's alone at the farm!
I've got to go to her.
You can't get through.
They've got a man watching the road.
I'll get through.
(GUNSHOT)
Bruhn is dying.
I saw him a little while ago.
He looked strong and healthy.
He might not last the day.
What'll happen if he dies?
They'll start drinking and fighting.
I've got to get Tommy out of that place.
No, you can't help him.
You better stay.
They'll be here, too, soon enough.
They mustn't find you here.
ERNINE:
Where could we hide in town?
DAN:
Beats me.
Even if we had horses, you couldn't get away through the snow.
You ladies will have to walk.
Get back to town.
Get out of here.
Gene.
That's your name, isn't it?
Don't make me use this gun.
I don't think you ever shot anybody.
I could start with you.
What do you want?
Let those women go by.
I can't do that.
They're coming.
You going to shoot them?
I can't cross Bruhn.
- I've got to warn him.
- No!
I don't think you want those women to get hurt.
I don't think Bruhn wants it, either.
Only Tex and Pace want it.
You're going to do it for them?
(GUNS FIRING)
- Why didn't you stop them?
- GENE:
I was trying to.
Go back to town.
BRUHN:
I told you your women would be safe.
All you had to do was wait.
Why didn't you believe me?
(COUGHING)
You've got all the cards, Bruhn.
Go ahead and play.
Only don't take it out on them.
It was my idea.
Can we have some fun with them now, Jack?
The name is Bruhn!
Ain't no reason to give them a break now, Bruhn.
I put my claim on that one first.
I'm going to make the little one happy.
You won't turn your men loose, Bruhn.
BRUHN:
Why not?
They want to get drunk, they want to have some fun!
They could swallow this town whole and nobody would be alive to tell the tale.
You won't let that happen.
Say the word, Captain.
I'll toss you for the pleasure.
Mr. Blaise, you broke your word.
Only because I don't believe you can hold your men.
Tex, put down the gun.
Go back to your homes, everybody.
Stay on the inside.
You, stay here!
He's all yours, Texas.
No gun.
(LAUGHING)
Thought you'd make yourself a big man in this town, eh?
Whoa!
Vause, Denver, finish him.
With your fists.
Shorty, bring that boy.
SHORTY:
Come here, sonny.
Why do you want my boy?
BRUHN:
He comes with me.
Your friends will sacrifice you, but they won't cause a young boy to be hurt by acting foolish.
Don't worry about the boy.
I'll take care of him.
I promise.
Now go on back, please.
They'll be leaving as soon as it's daybreak.
Sure.
Bruhn seems to be getting better.
They're staying close to the Wyoming.
Good.
Hal is grateful for what you did.
Deeply grateful.
Go back to him.
I told him I was coming here.
I asked him to come with me, but he told me to come alone.
I believe he knows and understands.
What's to understand?
You're his wife, I'm a stranger.
Go back to your husband, Mrs. Crane.
Thank you, Blaise.
Thanks for understanding.
- You mustn't come in here, Ernine.
- I've got to see Bobby.
He's all right.
This is no place for you to be.
Please, go home.
I want to see Bobby first.
BOBBY:
Please don't!
No, no!
(GROANS)
Say you'll do it or I'll break your little arm.
No, no.
Please don't...
Let the kid go, Pace.
Bruhn's got the whiskey hid.
I want the kid to find out where it is and get a bottle.
You want a drink?
Ask Bruhn.
You giving orders now?
In this case, I am.
(LAUGHING)
Forget it, Gene.
We're all getting jumpy from not having any liquor or fun.
When he cools off, give him his gun back.
(SHORTY SNORING)
Get out of here, Ernine.
I'm taking him with me.
GENE:
Stop!
I'm sorry.
You can't do that.
She hasn't done anything.
Don't hurt her.
I'm not going to hurt anybody.
He's all right.
He's as rotten as the rest of them.
You shouldn't have come here.
I'm taking Bobby back with me.
That'll just make things worse.
The boy's got to stay.
I saw what happened, I heard him screaming.
It won't happen again.
The boy has to stay.
There's no other way, Ernine.
How do you do, miss?
She was worried about her brother.
She's leaving.
No need to be.
What's your name, miss?
Bruhn said to leave the women alone, Pace.
I didn't bring her.
She's here because she wanted to be.
That gives me certain privileges.
Freeze, Pace!
This sure is a night for tangling.
I got a better idea.
Let's toss a coin for her.
Leave!
Bobby, tell your sister to leave.
Go ahead.
I'll be all right.
You didn't have to pull that iron on me, Gene.
I'm your friend.
We ride together, don't we?
Sure, Pace.
We ride together.
We're friends.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
Yeah, thanks.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
I'm worried about Bruhn, Doc.
How is he?
Coming along.
He ain't hurt bad, is he, Doc?
Not like dying?
You don't want him to die, do you?
No, of course not.
He never answered you.
I tell you, Tex,
there's something really wrong with Bruhn.
There is?
What?
TEX:
You sure look fine, Bruhn.
Where's that little boy?
PACE:
In the kitchen with Gene.
I don't want that boy harmed or frightened.
PACE:
We all like the kid, Bruhn.
I want the boy with Gene.
Hey, Bruhn, how about breaking open a bottle?
Just one drink.
I'm getting a chill.
Just one drink.
I want every man cold sober.
We pull out of here at dawn.
(WIND HOWLING)
We don't ride tomorrow or the day after.
Did you see the weather coming in?
My tongue's salt dry for whiskey.
We took that Army pay wagon.
We fought hard, shot our way out.
For what?
To sit around on our butts like this was Sunday school?
Captain, you ain't letting nature take its course.
Men don't act like you make us act here.
We've got this town under our thumb but we ain't getting no pleasure out of it.
Two more days like this is going to seem like two more years.
Maybe not even you can keep us in line, Bruhn.
I gave my word to the people of this town.
Why did you?
To make you look big and us little?
Maybe you better answer, Bruhn.
You'll drink, fool around, then kill each other over these women.
I'm a-riding out of here at daybreak with six men.
It's Saturday night.
Invite the ladies over for a little social.
There's no harm in coffee and cookies and a little dancing.
It'll take the edge off for a while.
Yeah.
And all I'd like is a chance to talk to that little girl.
I won't even ask her to dance if she don't want to.
With no liquor, it'll be a quiet Saturday night.
We need it bad, Captain.
Very well.
(LIVELY PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)
BRUHN:
Tex!
One dance and I get her back.
If I was drunk, I'd really show you how to dance.
Maybe Bruhn'll open up the whiskey pretty soon.
I won't let Pace touch you.
Are you any better?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.
No, you're right.
I came with them, I'm one of them.
I said I won't let Pace touch you, but you don't have to dance with me.
Don't leave me.
Why don't we dance?
I want to look at you.
I think Tex has got to the point where he can't stop.
Tex!
May I dance with the lady?
Now.
I'm going to get Bruhn one of these days.
It's been tried by a lot of dead men.
Why did you have to do this terrible thing?
There are things worse, ma'am, than dancing with lonely men.
Please let us go.
Soon.
Why did you have to come here?
You should be grateful.
Our coming saved the life of your husband.
I don't believe Blaise would have gone through with it.
Mrs. Crane, when my men and I leave here, there will be a showdown and you will be a widow.
Shorty.
Shorty!
Having a good time, gentlemen?
Yeah.
How long can Bruhn live?
Well, I gave him a big shot of morphine.
It deadens pain, makes the patient feel fine, but as soon as this dose wears off, he's going to start coughing.
Each cough's going to rip the lungs a little bit more.
A few hours after he starts coughing, he's going to die.
I didn't expect to hear music tonight.
They took the women to the saloon with them to dance.
Dance?
What are the men going to do about it?
Nothing.
Just talking.
Crane was talking about going to see Bruhn.
If he does, looks like you'll get what you wanted without doing a thing.
BLAISE:
Hold it!
That's enough!
Are you giving the orders now?
No.
You don't know anything about the weather up in these mountains.
It's storming up here but not down in the valley below.
You came here to talk about the weather?
BLAISE:
The soldiers you think are days behind you are riding over the trail right now and they're heading this way.
Your concern for my men and me, Mr. Blaise, is very touching.
Your position is hardly a tactical one.
You can't fight it out with those soldiers here.
Even a private would realize that, Captain.
Can you suggest an alternative?
BLAISE:
Yeah, if you stop this party.
There's another way through the mountains.
No trail, no pass, but there's a way.
I've been through it.
He's lying.
BRUHN:
Why didn't you take your women that way this morning?
It's too rough for the women.
Might be too rough for some of your men.
He's lying.
I tell you, Bruhn, he's lying.
I'll find out.
You ride with us.
Lead the way.
You couldn't find it without me.
Shorty, pack your gear and assemble the men.
We're moving out at daybreak.
Gene, get the ladies out of here.
(WIND HOWLING)
(COUGHING)
(COUGHING)
Don't be frightened anymore.
We'll be gone in a few minutes.
Can I get you something?
Some tobacco?
No, thanks.
I don't smoke.
I'll always remember you.
Goodbye, Gene.
Goodbye, Ernine.
You mustn't go with them.
I have to.
I may come back later, but I have to.
If you go, you'll never come back.
There is no way through that mountain.
Blaise!
There is no trail to Cheyenne.
I never said there was a trail.
I said there was a way through.
Stop maneuvering, there's no way.
Kill him.
Wait, Gene!
I'd like you to know why I lied to you.
I'm not interested.
You're a dying man, Bruhn.
That interest you?
How do you want to die?
You're a man, not an animal.
You can ride out of here with me and die clean, or you can turn your men loose in this town and die like a pig in the mud.
Do you want another Mormon massacre?
(COUGHING)
How do you want to go, Bruhn?
Ernine told you there was no trail.
I didn't say who told me.
Ernine must like you.
Have you any idea what Pace'll do to her when Bruhn dies?
- I can stop him.
- Are you sure?
I won't be here to help you, son.
Just a minute.
I know what I'm doing and I know what Gene's doing.
But you...
What's your reason?
Why do you want to die?
I know what I'm doing, too, Bruhn.
Let's leave it at that.
I guess every fool has his reason.
Ernine spoke the truth.
There is no way across the mountain.
Who knows?
Maybe I'll find a trail.
I'm not even sure they're going.
But if they do go, you know you won't come back.
Probably not.
Why are you doing this?
I'm not doing anything special.
Just taking some bad men out of a good town.
You're the same man who would have killed Hal.
I don't know you at all.
No reason to.
Are you doing it because of me?
I'd like to know, Blaise.
I'm doing it because of myself.
That night in my room in the Wyoming, when you asked me not to kill your husband, after you left, I took a good look at myself in the mirror.
I didn't like what I saw.
That doesn't make me any different from the men who rode in and took over this town.
Only they don't pretend to be anything but what they are.
And that's all there is to it, Mrs. Crane.
Let's move.
Well, I feel better now.
I'm beginning to hope we're going to make it.
None of us are going to make it.
Hey, Blaise!
How are we going to get out of this?
I'm going to need me another horse.
Ride one of the packhorses.
Gene, get off your horse.
Bruhn said get down.
And I'm saying leave your saddle bags where they are.
There's $6,000 in gold in them.
You can't carry it anyway.
Get down.
Just follow the tracks.
If snow covers them, keep the wind at your back.
You'll be all right.
Down!
Hey!
You won't be needing that gun.
We're both giving this party, Mr. Blaise.
Move out, son.
Say hello to the soldiers for us, kid.
Let's ride!
SHORTY:
Captain Bruhn, Captain Bruhn, what's wrong?
Hey, Starrett, help me!
Hold it!
We have to stop here till the captain can ride again.
We're not stopping.
(GUNSHOT)
Get on your horse.
Thanks, Captain Bruhn.
What're you thanking him for?
Get on your horse!
I don't think you want to kill me.
We got to have Blaise, Tex.
We're going to stop and bury these two men.
You know, it's kind of a lucky ride after all.
Lucky?
Yeah.
We started out with about $6,000 in gold apiece.
Now we've got $18,000 more to split four ways.
Cheyenne, here I come.
(CHUCKLING)
Cheyenne, here we come.
What are you looking for?
You see anything?
Not much.
There's nothing to see.
You know where you're taking us?
Yes.
You lie, you know it!
I know it!
Turn around and go back to camp.
I'll show you what a Cheyenne does with a liar!
Get up, you're not hurt.
Vause gave Tex and me the idea himself.
Let's ride!
Saddle.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on back here, come on back.
(WIND HOWLING)
Not much shelter.
(HORSE WHINNIES)
PACE:
Stop him!
Stop him, Tex!
PACE:
Now we have to go out and bring him back.
We need him!
I just shot his horse.
He'll come crawling back to us.
Now let's get this fire started.
We've got the horses, the grub and the guns.
He can't live out there.
Damn wind!
The horses can't stand it, either.
Now let's get this fire started.
What are you doing?
(WINDS HOWLING)
I don't have any matches.
I don't have any matches.
No matches.
(HORSE WHINNYING)
COWHAND:
Welcome home, Mr. Starrett.
Wait a minute.
I thought it best he stay here while the soldiers will be around.
I'd like to work for you, Mr. Starrett, if you'll have me.
All right, Gene.
Then you won't need this.
Day Of The Outlaw (1959)
I never figured Hal Crane would have the nerve to string up barbed wire.
It's more than barbed wire.
It's a thousand head of my steer dying for feed and water.
Oh, you just have to drive your herds across his land once a year.
You could still work out something reasonable.
I'm through being reasonable.
I told Crane what would happen if he strung that wire.
Blaise, we've pulled over some hard hills together and I've rode behind you all the way.
A wire fence is a poor excuse to make a widow out of Crane's wife.
What have you been thinking about all winter?
Crane's barbed wire fence, or Crane's pretty wife, Helen?
Oh, hi, strangers.
It's good to see you.
Hi, Ernine.
Ernine...
Be with you in a minute, Blaise.
I didn't think you men would get out in this kind of weather.
Ernine, put up some coffee.
You boys must be eating pretty good at your place.
Sure ran through that last batch of supplies awful fast.
I didn't come to town for supplies.
I came here to get a shave.
Look, Blaise, these farmers have got a right to live, too.
Never saw so much stock on your shelves.
You're doing a pretty brisk trade with them, aren't you, Vic?
They're decent, hard-working folks.
All they ask out of life is a break from the weather and a chance to work their lands in peace.
You ever know me to break the peace, Vic?
No, but I've seen you put away some who tried to.
I don't hold for killing.
You don't have to.
As long as you've got somebody to do it for you.
I'm beholden to you for what you've done in the past, but things is changing and we've got to change with them.
I don't object to change, just fences, barbed wire fences.
Well, I warned Hal Crane he was foolish for ordering that load of wire.
You ordered it for him, didn't you, though?
A man has the right to spend his own money as he sees fit.
You declared yourself, Vic, that's all I want to know.
Crane's a proud man.
He won't knuckle down.
But he's a farmer.
That gun he carries is mostly bluff.
You call his hand, it'll be plain murder.
Hello, Mrs. Crane.
Hello, Vic...
Dan.
Mr. Starrett.
If you'll just give me your list, I'll get right to it so you can leave town before dark.
We're not leaving.
Hal wants to stay overnight to settle some business.
Coffee's on, boys.
Oh, hello, Mrs. Crane.
Won't you join us for some nice hot coffee?
Why, thanks, Ernine.
I don't know if I should.
This is the first time we've been away from the farm in months.
I promised Mrs. Preston that we'd come over.
Come on, boys.
I make much better coffee than that ranch mud you've been drinking.
Go ahead.
Have a nice, friendly cup of coffee the way neighbors do.
Won't you sit down, Mr. Starrett?
You know something, Mrs. Crane?
I'm glad your husband's stringing up those barbed wire fences.
We want more farmers around here and less cattle.
That's not a very friendly thing to say, Ernine.
Oh, I'm friendly enough all right.
It's just that you and Blaise are keeping me from getting married.
I want a husband and not some ranch hand that makes $30 a month with a bed in a bunkhouse.
I want a young farmer homesteading a quarter-section.
Ernine, I'm afraid Mr. Starrett's more concerned with keeping the range open than in your getting a husband.
You've got the best excuse I've heard yet.
Ernine, where'd you put the shortening?
Oh, father!
Just when we were getting sociable!
Excuse me.
How's the winter at your place?
Oh, it's been colder and harder than most.
Excuse me, Mrs. Crane.
This coffee made me think how good whiskey would taste.
Excuse me.
See you at the Wyoming.
You want to tell me something, Helen?
I don't love you anymore, Blaise.
I want you to understand that and believe it.
I don't.
Can't you see how wrong it was?
I can see what's true.
I don't care what's wrong or right.
Loving you has made me a stranger in my own family.
It's made me feel cheap every time Hal looks at me.
It's not a nice feeling.
It's better not to love at all.
You met him first, you married him.
Right now you can't even remember why.
To spend the rest of your life with him, that would be the cheap thing to do.
When Hal and I first came here, you could have had me for the asking.
I'd come to a new country with a new husband.
I would have given up anything if you had only taken me then!
I made a mistake.
I'm not proud of what we did, Blaise.
I'm not proud I let you stay with him.
I could have been stronger and faithful with your help.
I'm only concerned with what's going to be.
We're going to meet in town once or twice a year.
I'm going to call you Mr. Starrett and you're going to call me Mrs. Crane.
That's what has to be.
That's easy to say, not so easy to do.
I was more lonely this winter than I've ever been before.
But I had time to think.
I'm going to be Hal Crane's wife forever.
I'm sorry you had to say that, Helen.
Everything has to be on Blaise Starrett's terms.
You don't want the farmers to fence their farms, you back your orders with guns!
You want another man's wife, but the man has to be dead before you'll take her!
You don't have much mercy, do you, Blaise?
You won't find much mercy anywhere in Wyoming.
Funny weather we're having.
That warm wind keeps blowing, the road'll be belly-deep in mud.
You might have to stay in town a few days.
I wouldn't count on that.
Say, George, my horse seems to be favoring her left foreleg.
Give it a good rubdown before you turn in tonight, will you?
You might not be needing a horse tomorrow.
He's coming.
I see you bought the kerosene.
Five gallons, like you ordered.
We've been having a meeting.
Doesn't look like a prayer meeting.
It wasn't.
I'm speaking for all present, Blaise.
We're not going to stand for any gunplay in Bitters.
I won't start it, Vic.
I'd like that tin of kerosene back, Blaise.
Didn't you pay for it?
It's paid for.
Take good care of it.
I'd like to have a word with you, Mr. Starrett.
You must've passed my wagon on your way in.
- I did.
- Soon as the road's in shape,
I'm moving that wire up to my place and I'm stringing it up.
That's what I thought it was for.
What do you intend to do about it?
It's going to be cold riding home tomorrow.
I thought it would be nice to stop and make a fire.
I hear kerosene is the fastest way to burn up a wagon.
You burn my wagon, and I'II...
- Hal!
Hal!
Please...
What do you intend to do about it?
I intend to go upstairs and get a good night's sleep.
I asked you a question, Mr. Starrett.
When I wake up in the morning, I'll know what to do.
- I usually do.
- I've got to know!
You want to know the future, Mr. Crane.
That's wanting too much for any man.
I'm not afraid of you, Starrett.
Mr. Starrett and I have some business to discuss.
Would you excuse us, please?
I'm sure Mr. Starrett doesn't object to my presence here.
Mrs. Crane being with you doesn't influence me.
I'll fight for what I believe, Mr. Starrett.
I'll die if I have to, but I'll fight.
I want you to know that.
You've got a big mouth, farmer.
You've got big eyes, too.
You came here a year ago in your broken-down wagon looking for a choice spot to settle.
And you think you found it.
But you never stopped to think what made it such a good place.
When Dan and I came here,
Bitters was a nesting spot for every thief and killer in the territory.
A man's life wasn't worth the price of a bullet.
No woman was safe in the streets, let alone in a lonely farm house!
It took more than a big mouth to get rid of the lice who infested every bend in the road you ride so safely on.
I'm not saying Dan and I did it alone, but we did more than our share.
We hunted them down in the freezing cold while you sat back in the East hugging your pot-bellied stoves!
Nobody thanked us, nobody paid us.
We did it because we felt we belonged.
We'd earned the right to belong!
And all you've done is ride in here and put down your stinking roots!
And now you tell us that you belong and we don't!
Mr. Crane, you said you'd fight to keep what you want.
Well, I've been doing that for 20 years and I intend to keep on doing it!
And no pig-bellied farmer's going to stop me!
Give me a bottle, Tom.
Don't kill my husband.
He intends to kill me.
Hal's never fired a pistol in his whole life.
Then he shouldn't wear one.
He's not a coward!
He won't beg for his life.
I'm not that courageous.
I do beg you!
You should be telling this to him.
I have.
He won't listen.
What made you think I would?
Do you want me, Blaise?
Do you want me to ride out to your ranch with you?
I'm offering myself to you on any terms you want, but leave Hal live.
Your husband's a stubborn man.
If he won't give up his fences, why should he give you up?
I'll tell him I no longer love him.
He'll only come after you.
It'll still have to end the same way.
You're not a cruel man.
I've been close enough to you to know.
Why must you act like one?
Because I can't feel sorry for someone I hate.
Do you hate me, too, Blaise?
Tell your husband to load up his wagons and take you out of Wyoming.
Don't you think I've tried?
I knew this was coming.
I've waited all winter long for this day.
You'll have to do it, Helen.
Make him take you away.
He's afraid of you, but he's not a weak man.
He'll die before he'll run!
Then that's the way it'll have to be.
I'm sorry to have troubled you, Mr. Starrett.
Dan?
I'm no good to you, Blaise.
I'm no good to you.
Hold it!
Don't touch that kerosene.
We want you to go home.
There are three of us.
Dan.
Dan!
Roll the bottle down the bar.
When it hits the floor, that's it.
Roll the bottle, Dan!
Anything we can do for you, strangers?
Yes, could be.
I was looking for a quiet place.
We were settling a little private quarrel.
I apologize.
I don't like to break in on a party.
But we'll take your guns.
You won't find anything to take in this town.
You'd be surprised at what we can find to take.
The trail ends in this town.
There's no place to go but back.
The trail back is closed.
Who's following you?
Cavalry.
Two days hard riding behind us.
Cavalry doesn't bother tracking seven men like you.
Captain Jack Bruhn, United States Army, formerly.
Hey, you!
I want food and service for my men!
- We'll pay.
- Yes, sir.
That cavalry won't stop for food and rest.
And my men rest?
Now listen, do as you're told and you can go about your business just like we're not here, almost.
But we are here, so it's best you know with what you're dealing.
Pace, here, he derives pleasure out of hurting people.
Tex, rile him and you're going to hear some screaming in this town today.
Denver, half-Cheyenne.
Him hate white men.
But he doesn't feel half so badly about white women.
Vause, bones covered with dirty skin, but even half-drunk, he's the fastest draw in Wyoming Territory.
And Shorty, we soldiered together.
The young fella, well, he's a fresh recruit, but he's learning fast.
I believe you!
You just killed a man for no reason!
There will be no more killing, and to make sure...
Denver!
Vause!
Take that drunk and round up every gun in town and destroy them!
Don't waste time arguing with anybody.
- How many people live around here?
- About 20.
- Who's the law?
- We handle our own law.
Not now.
Let's get started, Bruhn.
We can do whatever we want in this town.
I'm edgy to get doing.
Where do you hide your women around here?
Leave our women out of this!
We only want to borrow them.
We'll give them back.
No women!
And no whiskey, and no gunning.
With $40,000 in gold in our saddlebags and a long ride ahead?
We'll pleasure ourselves at the end of the trail.
It's going to be a long day, Captain.
You want to argue, Pace?
No.
Just reminding you.
I got to have a drink.
One.
I'd like one, but it's the order of the day.
Is there a doctor in this town?
Doc Langer.
A vet, back of the barber shop.
Can this horse doctor take out a bullet slug?
He has.
Freeze it, Pace!
You seem to think a lot of your women in this town.
Who does she belong to?
She's my wife.
Change your mind about no women, Captain?
There are only four women in this town.
Do you want your men killing each other over them?
Tex,
Pace, search upstairs.
Bring anybody you find down here.
Shorty, take these two to the store.
Then round up all the women and put them in the store and tell them to get inside and stay inside.
My wife is upstairs.
My men won't molest your women unless I give them permission.
We found one more.
Get down here!
Lady, you go to the store with the rest of the women.
Hey, you!
I told you to prepare the rations.
Now get going.
We've been riding hard for over a month, Captain.
Hey!
Hide your liquor and hide it good.
Now, let's go see that horse doctor.
When the boys come back, keep them here.
No man leaves this saloon till I return.
And no whiskey.
That's an order.
You handle your men well, Captain.
They need me.
Come along with me.
That bullet's way in deep.
He lost a lot of blood.
I don't see how he's still walking around.
Has he got a chance?
Well, if he was a horse, or a calf, or a cow, I'd know.
I just ain't had too much practice on humans.
It says here that a person with a deep wound can die from the internal bleeding, even though nothing shows on the outside.
Is he bleeding internally?
Well, I couldn't tell.
Do you want me to kill him?
Kill him?
Bruhn dies, this town gets torn apart.
You'll be the one they'll go after first!
You've got to keep him alive!
How?
Look, I don't know how.
I can't operate.
I haven't got the instruments.
I wouldn't know how to use them even if I did have them.
- You're going to operate!
- But...
What are you two talking about?
The captain's waiting for you to take the bullet out, Doc.
He's waiting for the water to boil.
If Bruhn dies, I'll kill you!
What are we waiting for?
Sit down.
You'd better have some of this.
Put it away.
Hide the liquor.
Mr. Starrett, talk to me.
What about?
Anything, Mr. Starrett.
Anything.
Where did you serve in the cavalry, Captain?
Why do you ask?
I remember hearing about a Captain Bruhn.
Some incident with the Mormons in Utah.
I just wondered if you were the same.
Would you help me, please?
What did you hear?
No...
It couldn't be you.
Yes, it was.
Strange how one word could change a man's life.
I could have ordered retreat.
My command was, "Fire. "
At West Point, I made up my mind to be all soldier, which doesn't leave much room for being human.
Thanks.
Keep your people in check.
I'll control my men.
Gene, you stay with me.
I'm sleepy.
What are his chances, Doc?
I don't know.
It was in real deep.
I'd say if he lasts through the night...
I just don't know!
Shorty.
I found a bottle in the barber shop.
The captain says no whiskey.
- He'll never know.
- He knows everything.
They'd have hung you back in Casper if it hadn't been for Captain Bruhn!
And I'd have been an old bum in Abilene.
I wish you hadn't busted the bottle, Shorty.
We could have had just one drink.
Did you ever see what the captain does to men who disobey?
I've never seen anybody disobey him.
I have.
Be glad I busted that bottle.
I'll get it.
It's a relief to see you and Mr. Starrett friendly again.
Mr. Preston and I were so worried.
That's all over, isn't it, Mr. Starrett?
It doesn't seem very important right now.
Hal and you could be good friends.
Yes, we might try it sometime.
What Blaise needs is a wife to steady him down.
Clagget stole a horse from them.
He's just saddling up.
He's going to make a run for it!
He's crazy!
He'll never make it!
He knows they're watching the road.
Keep the women inside.
Clagget!
Stop it!
My wife's alone at the farm!
I've got to go to her.
You can't get through.
They've got a man watching the road.
I'll get through.
Bruhn is dying.
I saw him a little while ago.
He looked strong and healthy.
He might not last the day.
What'll happen if he dies?
They'll start drinking and fighting.
I've got to get Tommy out of that place.
No, you can't help him.
You better stay.
They'll be here, too, soon enough.
They mustn't find you here.
Where could we hide in town?
Beats me.
Even if we had horses, you couldn't get away through the snow.
You ladies will have to walk.
Get back to town.
Get out of here.
Gene.
That's your name, isn't it?
Don't make me use this gun.
I don't think you ever shot anybody.
I could start with you.
What do you want?
Let those women go by.
I can't do that.
They're coming.
You going to shoot them?
I can't cross Bruhn.
- I've got to warn him.
- No!
I don't think you want those women to get hurt.
I don't think Bruhn wants it, either.
Only Tex and Pace want it.
You're going to do it for them?
- Why didn't you stop them?
I was trying to.
Go back to town.
I told you your women would be safe.
All you had to do was wait.
Why didn't you believe me?
You've got all the cards, Bruhn.
Go ahead and play.
Only don't take it out on them.
It was my idea.
Can we have some fun with them now, Jack?
The name is Bruhn!
Ain't no reason to give them a break now, Bruhn.
I put my claim on that one first.
I'm going to make the little one happy.
You won't turn your men loose, Bruhn.
Why not?
They want to get drunk, they want to have some fun!
They could swallow this town whole and nobody would be alive to tell the tale.
You won't let that happen.
Say the word, Captain.
I'll toss you for the pleasure.
Mr. Blaise, you broke your word.
Only because I don't believe you can hold your men.
Tex, put down the gun.
Go back to your homes, everybody.
Stay on the inside.
You, stay here!
He's all yours, Texas.
No gun.
Thought you'd make yourself a big man in this town, eh?
Whoa!
Vause, Denver, finish him.
With your fists.
Shorty, bring that boy.
Come here, sonny.
Why do you want my boy?
He comes with me.
Your friends will sacrifice you, but they won't cause a young boy to be hurt by acting foolish.
Don't worry about the boy.
I'll take care of him.
I promise.
Now go on back, please.
They'll be leaving as soon as it's daybreak.
Sure.
Bruhn seems to be getting better.
They're staying close to the Wyoming.
Good.
Hal is grateful for what you did.
Deeply grateful.
Go back to him.
I told him I was coming here.
I asked him to come with me, but he told me to come alone.
I believe he knows and understands.
What's to understand?
You're his wife, I'm a stranger.
Go back to your husband, Mrs. Crane.
Thank you, Blaise.
Thanks for understanding.
- You mustn't come in here, Ernine.
- I've got to see Bobby.
He's all right.
This is no place for you to be.
Please, go home.
I want to see Bobby first.
Please don't!
No, no!
Say you'll do it or I'll break your little arm.
No, no.
Please don't...
Let the kid go, Pace.
Bruhn's got the whiskey hid.
I want the kid to find out where it is and get a bottle.
You want a drink?
Ask Bruhn.
You giving orders now?
In this case, I am.
Forget it, Gene.
We're all getting jumpy from not having any liquor or fun.
When he cools off, give him his gun back.
Get out of here, Ernine.
I'm taking him with me.
Stop!
I'm sorry.
You can't do that.
She hasn't done anything.
Don't hurt her.
I'm not going to hurt anybody.
He's all right.
He's as rotten as the rest of them.
You shouldn't have come here.
I'm taking Bobby back with me.
That'll just make things worse.
The boy's got to stay.
I saw what happened, I heard him screaming.
It won't happen again.
The boy has to stay.
There's no other way, Ernine.
How do you do, miss?
She was worried about her brother.
She's leaving.
No need to be.
What's your name, miss?
Bruhn said to leave the women alone, Pace.
I didn't bring her.
She's here because she wanted to be.
That gives me certain privileges.
Freeze, Pace!
This sure is a night for tangling.
I got a better idea.
Let's toss a coin for her.
Leave!
Bobby, tell your sister to leave.
Go ahead.
I'll be all right.
You didn't have to pull that iron on me, Gene.
I'm your friend.
We ride together, don't we?
Sure, Pace.
We ride together.
We're friends.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
Yeah, thanks.
I'm worried about Bruhn, Doc.
How is he?
Coming along.
He ain't hurt bad, is he, Doc?
Not like dying?
You don't want him to die, do you?
No, of course not.
He never answered you.
I tell you, Tex,
there's something really wrong with Bruhn.
There is?
What?
You sure look fine, Bruhn.
Where's that little boy?
In the kitchen with Gene.
I don't want that boy harmed or frightened.
We all like the kid, Bruhn.
I want the boy with Gene.
Hey, Bruhn, how about breaking open a bottle?
Just one drink.
I'm getting a chill.
Just one drink.
I want every man cold sober.
We pull out of here at dawn.
We don't ride tomorrow or the day after.
Did you see the weather coming in?
My tongue's salt dry for whiskey.
We took that Army pay wagon.
We fought hard, shot our way out.
For what?
To sit around on our butts like this was Sunday school?
Captain, you ain't letting nature take its course.
Men don't act like you make us act here.
We've got this town under our thumb but we ain't getting no pleasure out of it.
Two more days like this is going to seem like two more years.
Maybe not even you can keep us in line, Bruhn.
I gave my word to the people of this town.
Why did you?
To make you look big and us little?
Maybe you better answer, Bruhn.
You'll drink, fool around, then kill each other over these women.
I'm a-riding out of here at daybreak with six men.
It's Saturday night.
Invite the ladies over for a little social.
There's no harm in coffee and cookies and a little dancing.
It'll take the edge off for a while.
Yeah.
And all I'd like is a chance to talk to that little girl.
I won't even ask her to dance if she don't want to.
With no liquor, it'll be a quiet Saturday night.
We need it bad, Captain.
Very well.
Tex!
One dance and I get her back.
If I was drunk, I'd really show you how to dance.
Maybe Bruhn'll open up the whiskey pretty soon.
I won't let Pace touch you.
Are you any better?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.
No, you're right.
I came with them, I'm one of them.
I said I won't let Pace touch you, but you don't have to dance with me.
Don't leave me.
Why don't we dance?
I want to look at you.
I think Tex has got to the point where he can't stop.
Tex!
May I dance with the lady?
Now.
I'm going to get Bruhn one of these days.
It's been tried by a lot of dead men.
Why did you have to do this terrible thing?
There are things worse, ma'am, than dancing with lonely men.
Please let us go.
Soon.
Why did you have to come here?
You should be grateful.
Our coming saved the life of your husband.
I don't believe Blaise would have gone through with it.
Mrs. Crane, when my men and I leave here, there will be a showdown and you will be a widow.
Shorty.
Shorty!
Having a good time, gentlemen?
Yeah.
How long can Bruhn live?
Well, I gave him a big shot of morphine.
It deadens pain, makes the patient feel fine, but as soon as this dose wears off, he's going to start coughing.
Each cough's going to rip the lungs a little bit more.
A few hours after he starts coughing, he's going to die.
I didn't expect to hear music tonight.
They took the women to the saloon with them to dance.
Dance?
What are the men going to do about it?
Nothing.
Just talking.
Crane was talking about going to see Bruhn.
If he does, looks like you'll get what you wanted without doing a thing.
Hold it!
That's enough!
Are you giving the orders now?
No.
You don't know anything about the weather up in these mountains.
It's storming up here but not down in the valley below.
You came here to talk about the weather?
The soldiers you think are days behind you are riding over the trail right now and they're heading this way.
Your concern for my men and me, Mr. Blaise, is very touching.
Your position is hardly a tactical one.
You can't fight it out with those soldiers here.
Even a private would realize that, Captain.
Can you suggest an alternative?
Yeah, if you stop this party.
There's another way through the mountains.
No trail, no pass, but there's a way.
I've been through it.
He's lying.
Why didn't you take your women that way this morning?
It's too rough for the women.
Might be too rough for some of your men.
He's lying.
I tell you, Bruhn, he's lying.
I'll find out.
You ride with us.
Lead the way.
You couldn't find it without me.
Shorty, pack your gear and assemble the men.
We're moving out at daybreak.
Gene, get the ladies out of here.
Don't be frightened anymore.
We'll be gone in a few minutes.
Can I get you something?
Some tobacco?
No, thanks.
I don't smoke.
I'll always remember you.
Goodbye, Gene.
Goodbye, Ernine.
You mustn't go with them.
I have to.
I may come back later, but I have to.
If you go, you'll never come back.
There is no way through that mountain.
Blaise!
There is no trail to Cheyenne.
I never said there was a trail.
I said there was a way through.
Stop maneuvering, there's no way.
Kill him.
Wait, Gene!
I'd like you to know why I lied to you.
I'm not interested.
You're a dying man, Bruhn.
That interest you?
How do you want to die?
You're a man, not an animal.
You can ride out of here with me and die clean, or you can turn your men loose in this town and die like a pig in the mud.
Do you want another Mormon massacre?
How do you want to go, Bruhn?
Ernine told you there was no trail.
I didn't say who told me.
Ernine must like you.
Have you any idea what Pace'll do to her when Bruhn dies?
- I can stop him.
- Are you sure?
I won't be here to help you, son.
Just a minute.
I know what I'm doing and I know what Gene's doing.
But you...
What's your reason?
Why do you want to die?
I know what I'm doing, too, Bruhn.
Let's leave it at that.
I guess every fool has his reason.
Ernine spoke the truth.
There is no way across the mountain.
Who knows?
Maybe I'll find a trail.
I'm not even sure they're going.
But if they do go, you know you won't come back.
Probably not.
Why are you doing this?
I'm not doing anything special.
Just taking some bad men out of a good town.
You're the same man who would have killed Hal.
I don't know you at all.
No reason to.
Are you doing it because of me?
I'd like to know, Blaise.
I'm doing it because of myself.
That night in my room in the Wyoming, when you asked me not to kill your husband, after you left, I took a good look at myself in the mirror.
I didn't like what I saw.
That doesn't make me any different from the men who rode in and took over this town.
Only they don't pretend to be anything but what they are.
And that's all there is to it, Mrs. Crane.
Let's move.
Well, I feel better now.
I'm beginning to hope we're going to make it.
None of us are going to make it.
Hey, Blaise!
How are we going to get out of this?
I'm going to need me another horse.
Ride one of the packhorses.
Gene, get off your horse.
Bruhn said get down.
And I'm saying leave your saddle bags where they are.
There's $6,000 in gold in them.
You can't carry it anyway.
Get down.
Just follow the tracks.
If snow covers them, keep the wind at your back.
You'll be all right.
Down!
Hey!
You won't be needing that gun.
We're both giving this party, Mr. Blaise.
Move out, son.
Say hello to the soldiers for us, kid.
Let's ride!
Captain Bruhn, Captain Bruhn, what's wrong?
Hey, Starrett, help me!
Hold it!
We have to stop here till the captain can ride again.
We're not stopping.
Get on your horse.
Thanks, Captain Bruhn.
What're you thanking him for?
Get on your horse!
I don't think you want to kill me.
We got to have Blaise, Tex.
We're going to stop and bury these two men.
You know, it's kind of a lucky ride after all.
Lucky?
Yeah.
We started out with about $6,000 in gold apiece.
Now we've got $18,000 more to split four ways.
Cheyenne, here I come.
Cheyenne, here we come.
What are you looking for?
You see anything?
Not much.
There's nothing to see.
You know where you're taking us?
Yes.
You lie, you know it!
I know it!
Turn around and go back to camp.
I'll show you what a Cheyenne does with a liar!
Get up, you're not hurt.
Vause gave Tex and me the idea himself.
Let's ride!
Saddle.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on back here, come on back.
Not much shelter.
Stop him!
Stop him, Tex!
Now we have to go out and bring him back.
We need him!
I just shot his horse.
He'll come crawling back to us.
Now let's get this fire started.
We've got the horses, the grub and the guns.
He can't live out there.
Damn wind!
The horses can't stand it, either.
Now let's get this fire started.
What are you doing?
I don't have any matches.
I don't have any matches.
No matches.
Welcome home, Mr. Starrett.
Wait a minute.
I thought it best he stay here while the soldiers will be around.
I'd like to work for you, Mr. Starrett, if you'll have me.
All right, Gene.
Then you won't need this.
The End
I never figured Hal Crane would have the nerve to string up barbed wire.
It's more than barbed wire.
It's a thousand head of my steers, dying for feed and water.
You just have to drive your herds across his land once a year.
You could still work out something reasonable.
I'm through being reasonable.
I told Crane what would happen if he strung that wire.
Blaise...
We've pulled over some hard hills together and I've rode behind you all the way.
A wire fence is a poor excuse to make a widow out of Crane's wife.
What have you been thinking about all winter?
Crane's barbed-wire fence or Crane's pretty wife, Helen?
Oh, hi, strangers.
It's good to see you.
- Hi, Ernine.
- Ernine.
Be with you in a minute, Blaise.
I didn't think you men would get out in this weather.
Ernine, put up some coffee.
You boys must be eating pretty good at your place.
Sure ran through that last batch of supplies awful fast.
I didn't come to town for supplies.
I came here to get a shave.
Look, Blaise, these farmers got a right to live too.
Never saw so much stock on your shelves.
You're doing a pretty brisk trade with them, Vic.
They're decent, hard-working folks.
All they ask out of life is a break from the weather and a chance to work their lands in peace.
Ever known me to break the peace, Vic?
No, but I've seen you put away some who tried to.
- I don't hold for killing.
- You don't have to.
As long as you got somebody to do it for you.
I'm beholden to you for what you've done in the past but things has changed and we got to change with them.
I don't object to change, just fences.
Barbed-wire fences.
I warned Hal Crane he was foolish for ordering that load of wire.
Still ordered it for him, didn't you, though?
Well, a man has a right to spend his own money as he sees fit.
You've declared yourself, Vic.
That's all I want to know.
Crane's a proud man.
He won't knuckle down.
But he's a farmer.
That gun he carries is mostly bluff.
You call his hand, it will be plain murder.
Hello, Mrs Crane.
Why, hello, Vic.
Dan.
Mr Starrett.
If you'll just give me a list, I'll get right to it so you can leave town before dark.
We're not leaving.
Hal wants to stay overnight to settle some business.
Coffee's on, boys.
Oh, hello, Mrs Crane.
Won't you join us for some nice hot coffee?
Why, thanks, Ernine.
I don't know if I should.
This is the first time we've been away in months.
I promised Mrs Preston that we'd come over.
Come on, boys.
I make much better coffee than that ranch mud you drink.
Go ahead.
Have a nice friendly cup of coffee the way neighbours do.
Won't you sit down, Mr Starrett?
You know, I'm glad your husband is stringing up those barbed-wire fences.
We want more farmers around here and less cattle.
That's not a very friendly thing to say, Ernine.
Oh, I'm friendly enough, all right.
It's just that you and Blaise are keeping me from getting married.
I want a husband and not some ranch hand that makes $30 a month with a bed in a bunkhouse.
I want a young farmer, homesteading a quarter section.
I'm afraid Mr Starrett's more concerned with keeping the range open than your getting a husband.
You've got the best excuse I've heard yet.
Ernine, where did you put the shortening?
Oh, Father, just when we were getting sociable!
Excuse me.
How's the winter at your place?
Oh, it's been colder and harder than most.
Excuse me, Mrs Crane.
This coffee made me think how good whiskey would taste.
Excuse me.
See you at the Wyoming.
Do you want to tell me something, Helen?
I don't love you anymore, Blaise.
- I want you to understand that.
- I don't.
- Can't you see how wrong it was?
- I can see what's true.
I don't care what's wrong or right.
Loving you has made me a stranger in my own family.
It's made me feel cheap every time Hal looks at me.
It's not a nice feeling.
It's better not to love at all.
You met him first, you married him.
Right now you can't even remember why.
Spending the rest of your life with him, that would be the cheap thing to do.
When Hal and I first came here, you could have had me for the asking.
I'd come to a new country with a new husband.
I would have given up anything if you'd only taken me then.
I made a mistake.
- I'm not proud of what we did, Blaise.
- I'm not proud I let you stay with him.
I could have been stronger with your help.
I'm only concerned with what's going to be.
We're going to meet in town once or twice a year.
I'm going to call you Mr Starrett and you're going to call me Mrs Crane.
That's what has to be.
That's easy to say, not so easy to do.
I was more lonely this winter than I've ever been before.
But I had time to think.
I'm gonna be Hal Crane's wife forever.
I'm sorry you had to say that, Helen.
Everything has to be on Blaise Starrett's terms.
You don't want the farmers to fence their farms.
You back your orders with guns.
You want another man's wife but the man has to be dead before you'll take her.
You don't have much mercy, do you, Blaise?
You won't find much mercy anywhere in Wyoming.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Funny weather we're having.
If that warm wind keeps blowing, the road will be belly-deep in mud.
You might have to stay in town a few days.
I wouldn't count on that.
Hey, George.
My horse seems to be favouring her left foreleg.
Give it a good rub-down before you turn in tonight.
You might not be needing a horse tomorrow.
He's coming.
I see you brought the kerosene.
Five gallons, like you ordered.
We've been having a meeting.
- Doesn't look like a prayer meeting.
- It wasn't.
I'm speaking for all present, Blaise.
We're not going to stand for any gun play in Bitters.
I won't start it, Vic.
I'd like that tin of kerosene back, Blaise.
- Didn't you pay for it?
- It's paid for.
Take good care of it.
I'd like to have a word with you, Mr Starrett.
You must have passed my wagon on your way in.
I did.
Soon as the road's in shape I'm moving that wire up to my place.
- And I'm stringing it up.
- That's what I thought it was for.
HAL:
What do you intend to do about it?
It's going to be cold riding home tomorrow.
I thought it'd be nice to stop and make a fire.
I hear kerosene is the fastest way to burn up a wagon.
- HAL:
You burn my wagons and I'll...
- Hal...
Hal.
Please.
HAL:
What do you intend to do about it?
I intend to go upstairs and get a good night's sleep.
I asked you a question, Mr Starrett.
BLAISE:
When I wake up I'll know what to do.
- I usually do.
- I've got to know.
You want to know the future, Mr Crane.
That's wanting too much for any man.
I'm not afraid of you, Starrett.
Mr Starrett and I have some business to discuss.
Would you excuse us, please?
I'm sure Mr Starrett doesn't object to my presence here.
Mrs Crane being with you doesn't influence me.
I'll fight for what I believe, Mr Starrett.
I'll die if I have to but I'll fight.
I want you to know that.
You've got a big mouth, farmer.
You got big eyes too.
You came here a year ago in your broken-down wagon, looking for a choice spot to settle.
And you think you found it.
But you never stopped to think what made it such a good place.
When Dan and I came here
Bitters was the nesting spot for every thief and killer in the territory.
A man's life wasn't worth the price of a bullet.
No woman was safe in the streets, let alone in a lonely farmhouse.
It took more than a big mouth to get rid of the lice who infested every bend of the road you ride so safely on.
I'm not saying Dan and I did it alone.
But we did more than our share.
We hunted them down in the freezing cold while you sat back in the east, hugging your pot-bellied stoves.
Nobody thanked us.
Nobody paid us.
We did it because we felt we belonged.
We'd earned the right to belong.
And all you've done is ride in here and put down your stinking roots.
And now you tell us that you belong and we don't.
Mr Crane, you said you'd fight to keep what you wanted.
Well, I've been doing that for 20 years and I intend to keep on doing it.
And no pig-bellied farmer's going to stop me.
Give me a bottle, Tom.
Don't kill my husband.
He intends to kill me.
Hal's never fired a pistol in his whole life.
Then he shouldn't wear one.
He's not a coward.
He won't beg for his life.
I'm not that courageous.
I do beg you.
You should be telling this to him.
I have.
- He won't listen.
- What made you think I would?
Do you want me, Blaise?
Do you want me to ride out to your ranch with you?
I'm offering myself to you, on any terms you want, but leave Hal live.
Your husband's a stubborn man.
He won't give up his fences.
Why should he give you up?
I'll tell him I no longer love him.
He'll only come after you.
It'll still have to end the same way.
You're not a cruel man.
I've been close enough to you to know.
Why must you act like one?
Because I can't feel sorry for someone I hate.
Do you hate me too, Blaise?
Tell your husband to load up his wagons and take you out of Wyoming.
Don't you think I've tried?
I knew this was coming.
I've waited all winter long for this day.
You have to do it, Helen.
Make him take you away.
He's afraid of you but he's not a weak man.
He'll die before he'll run.
Then that's the way it'll have to be.
I'm sorry to have troubled you, Mr Starrett.
Dan?
I'm no good to you, Blaise.
I'm no good to you.
Hold it.
Don't touch that kerosene.
We want you to go home.
There are three of us.
Dan.
Dan!
Roll the bottle down the bar.
When it hits the floor, that's it.
Roll the bottle, Dan.
Anything we can do for you strangers?
Yes, could be.
I was looking for a quiet place.
We were settling a little private quarrel.
I apologise.
I don't like to break in on a party.
But we'll take your guns.
You won't find anything to take in this town.
You'd be surprised at what we can find to take.
Trail ends in this town.
No place to go but back.
The trail back is closed.
Who's following you?
- Cavalry.
- Two days' hard riding behind us.
Cavalry doesn't bother tracking seven men like you.
Captain Jack Bruhn,
United States Army, formerly.
BRUHN:
Hey, you.
I want food and service for my men.
- We'll pay.
- Yes, sir.
That cavalry won't stop for food and rest.
My men rest.
Now, listen, do as you're told and you can go about your business just like we're not here, almost.
But we are here so it's best you know with what you're dealing.
Pace here, he derives pleasure out of hurting people.
Tex, rile him and you're gonna hear some screaming in this town today.
Denver, half Cheyenne.
Him hate white men but he doesn't feel half so badly about white women.
Vause, bones covered with dirty skin but even half-drunk he's the fastest draw in Wyoming territory.
Shorty, we soldiered together.
The young fella, he's a fresh recruit but he's learning fast.
I believe you.
You just killed a man for no reason.
There will be no more killing and to make sure,
Denver, Vause, take that drunk and round up every gun in town
and destroy them.
And don't waste time arguing with anybody.
How many people live around here?
About 20.
- Who's the law?
- We handle our own law.
Not now.
Let's get started, Bruhn.
We can do whatever we want in this town.
I'm edgy to get doing.
Where do you hide your women around here?
Leave our women out of this.
We only want to borrow 'em.
TEX:
We'll give 'em back.
No women.
And no whiskey and no gunning.
With 40,000 in gold in our saddlebags and a long ride ahead?
We'll pleasure ourselves at the end of the trail.
It's gonna be a long day, Captain.
You wanna argue, Pace?
No, just reminding you.
I gotta have a drink.
One.
I'd like one, but it's the order of the day.
Is there a doctor in this town?
BLAISE:
Doc Langer.
Vet, back of the barbershop.
BRUHN:
Can this horse doctor take out a bullet slug?
- BLAISE:
He has.
- (BOTH SNIGGER)
BRUHN:
Freeze it, Pace.
You seem to think a lot of your women in this town.
Who does she belong to?
She's my wife.
Change your mind about no women, Captain?
There are only four women in this town.
Do you want your men killing each other over them?
Tex, Pace...
Search upstairs.
Bring anybody you find down here.
Shorty, take these two to the store.
Then round up all the women and put 'em in the store and tell 'em to get inside and stay inside.
My wife is upstairs.
My men won't molest your women unless I give them permission.
(SHRIEKING)
- We found one more.
- Get down here!
Lady, you go to the store with the rest of the women.
Hey, you.
I told you to prepare the rations.
Now, get going.
We've been riding hard for over a month, Captain.
Hey!
Hide your liquor and hide it good.
(COUGHING)
Now...
let's go see that horse doctor.
When the boys come back, keep them here.
No man leaves this saloon till I return.
And no whiskey.
That's an order.
- You handle your men well, Captain.
- They need me.
Come along with me.
That bullet's way in deep.
I don't see how he's still walking around.
- Has he got a chance?
- If he was a horse or a cow, I'd know.
I just ain't had too much practice on humans.
It says that a person with a deep wound can die of internal bleeding even though nothing shows on the outside.
- Is he bleeding internally?
- I couldn't tell.
Do you want me to kill him?
Kill him?
If Bruhn dies, this town gets torn apart.
They'll go after you first.
You got to keep him alive.
But how?
Look, I don't know how.
I can't operate.
I haven't got the instruments.
- I wouldn't know how to use them.
- You're gonna operate.
What are you two talking about?
The Captain's waiting for you to take the bullet out, Doc.
He's waiting for the water to boil.
If Bruhn dies, I'll kill you.
What are we waiting for?
Sit down.
You'd better have some of this.
Put it away.
Hide the liquor.
BRUHN:
Mr Starrett, talk to me.
What about?
Anything, Mr Starrett.
Anything.
BLAISE:
Where did you serve in the cavalry, Captain?
Why do you ask?
I remember hearing about a Captain Bruhn.
Some incident with the Mormons in Utah.
I just wondered if you were the same.
DOC:
Would you help me, please?
What did you hear?
BLAISE:
No.
Couldn't be you.
Yes, it was.
BRUHN:
Strange, how one word can change a man's life.
I could have ordered, "Retreat!"
My command was, "Fire!"
At West Point I made up my mind to be all soldier, which doesn't leave much room for being human.
Thanks.
Keep your people in check.
I'll control my men.
Gene, stay with me.
I'm sleepy.
What are his chances, Doc?
I don't know.
It was in real deep.
I'd say if he lasts through the night...
I just don't know.
Shorty.
I found a bottle in the barbershop.
The Captain says no whiskey.
- He'll never know.
- He knows everything.
They'd have hung you back in Casper if it hadn't been for Captain Bruhn.
And I'd have been an old bum in Adeline.
I wish you hadn't busted the bottle, Shorty.
We could have had just one drink.
Did you ever see what the Captain does to men that disobey?
- I've never seen anybody disobey him.
- I have.
Be glad I busted that bottle.
I'll get it.
It's a relief to see you and Mr Starrett friendly again.
Mr Preston and I were so worried.
That's all over, isn't it, Mr Starrett?
Doesn't seem very important right now.
- Hal and you can be good friends.
- Yes, we might try it sometime.
What Blaise needs is a wife to steady him down.
Clagget stole a horse from 'em.
He's just saddling up.
He's gonna make a run for it.
He's crazy.
He'll never make it.
- He knows they're watching the road.
- Keep the women inside.
Clagget, hold it.
My wife's alone at the farm.
I got to go to her.
You can't get through.
They got a man watching the road.
I'll get through.
(GUNSHOT)
Bruhn is dying.
I saw him a little while ago.
He looks strong and healthy.
He might not last the day.
- What will happen if he dies?
- They'll start drinking and fighting.
- I've got to get Tommy out of that place.
- No, you can't help him.
You better stay.
- They'll be here too, soon enough.
- They mustn't find you here.
ERNINE:
Where can we hide in town?
DAN:
Beats me.
Even if we had horses you couldn't get away through the snow.
The ladies will have to walk.
Get back to town.
Get out of here.
Gene.
That's your name, isn't it?
Don't make me use this gun.
I don't think you ever shot anybody.
I could start with you.
What do you want?
Let those women go by.
I can't do that.
They're coming.
Are you gonna shoot them?
I can't cross Bruhn.
I got to warn him.
No.
I don't think you want those women to get hurt.
I don't think Bruhn wants it either.
Only Tex and Pace want it.
You gonna do it for them?
(GUNFIRE)
- Why didn't you stop 'em?
- GENE:
I was trying to.
Go back to town.
BRUHN:
I told you your women would be safe.
All you had to do was wait.
Why didn't you believe me?
You've got all the cards, Bruhn.
Go ahead and play.
Only don't take it out on them.
It was my idea.
I'm gonna have some fun with them now, Jack.
The name is Bruhn.
Ain't no reason to give 'em a break now, Bruhn.
- I put my claim on that one first.
- I'm gonna make the little one happy.
You won't turn your men loose, Bruhn.
Why not?
They wanna get drunk.
They wanna have some fun.
They could swallow this town whole and nobody would be alive to tell the tale.
You won't let that happen.
- Say the word, Captain.
- I'll toss you for the pleasure.
Mr Blaise, you broke your word.
Only because I don't believe you can hold your men.
Tex, put down the gun.
Go back to your homes, everybody.
Stay on the inside.
You, stay here.
He's all yours, Texas.
No gun.
(LAUGHTER)
(LAUGHTER CONTINUES)
(LAUGHTER CONTINUES)
Thought you'd make yourself a big man in this town, huh?
Vause, Denver, finish him.
With your fists.
BRUHN:
Shorty, bring that boy.
- SHORTY:
Come here, sonny.
- VIC:
What do you want him for?
BRUHN:
He comes with me.
Your friends will sacrifice you but they won't cause a young boy to be hurt by acting foolish.
Don't worry about the boy.
I'll take care of him.
I promise.
Now, go on back.
Please.
He'll be leaving as soon as it's daybreak.
Sure.
Bruhn seems to be getting better.
They're staying close to the Wyoming.
Good.
Hal is grateful for what you did.
Deeply grateful.
Go back to him.
I told him I was coming here.
I asked him to come with me.
But he told me to come alone.
I believe he knows and understands.
What's to understand?
You're his wife, I'm a stranger.
Go back to your husband, Mrs Crane.
Thank you, Blaise.
Thanks for understanding.
- You mustn't come in here.
- I've got to see Bobby.
He's all right.
This is no place for you to be.
Please.
Go home.
I wanna see Bobby first.
BOBBY:
Please don't.
Ow!
No, no!
- Ow!
- Say you'll do it or I'll break your little arm.
No, no.
Please don't.
Ow!
- Let the kid go, Pace.
- Bruhn's got the whiskey here.
I want the kid to find out where it is and get a bottle.
If you want a drink, ask Bruhn.
Are you giving orders now?
In this case I am.
Forget it, Gene.
We're all getting jumpy from not having any liquor or fun.
When he cools off, give him his gun back.
(SNORING)
Get out of here, Ernine.
I'm taking him with me.
Stop.
Look, I'm sorry.
You can't do that.
She hasn't done anything.
Don't hurt her.
I'm not gonna hurt anybody.
He's all right.
He's as rotten as the rest of them.
You shouldn't have come here.
I'm taking Bobby back with me.
That'll just make things worse.
The boy's got to stay.
I saw what happened.
I heard him screaming.
It won't happen again.
The boy has to stay.
There's no other way, Ernine.
How do you do, Miss?
She was worried about her brother.
She's leaving.
No need to be.
What's your name, Miss?
Bruhn said to leave the women alone, Pace.
I didn't bring her.
She's here because she wanted to be.
- That gives me certain privileges.
- Freeze, Pace!
This sure is a night for tangling.
I got a better idea.
Let's toss a coin for her.
Leave.
Bobby, tell your sister to leave.
Go ahead.
I'll be all right.
You didn't have to pull that iron on me, Gene.
I'm your friend.
We ride together, don't we?
Sure, Pace.
We ride together.
We're friends.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
Yeah, thanks.
I'm worried about Bruhn, Doc.
- How is he?
- Coming along.
He ain't hurt bad, is he, Doc?
Not like dying?
- You don't want him to die, do you?
- No, of course not.
He never answered you.
I tell you, Tex... there's something really wrong with Bruhn.
There is?
- What?
- TEX:
You sure look fine, Bruhn.
- Where's that little boy?
- PACE:
In the kitchen with Gene.
I don't want that boy harmed or frightened.
We all like the kid, Bruhn.
I want the boy with Gene.
How about breaking open a bottle, just one drink?
I'm getting a chill.
Just one drink.
I want every man cold sober.
We pull out of here at dawn.
(WIND HOWLING)
We don't ride tomorrow or the day after.
Did you see the weather coming in?
My tongue's salt-dry for whiskey.
We took that army pay wagon, fought hard, shot our way out.
For what?
Sitting around on our butts like this was Sunday school!
Captain, you ain't letting nature take its course.
Men don't act like you make us act here.
We've got this town under our thumb but we ain't getting no pleasure.
Two more days like this is gonna seem like two more years.
Maybe not even you can keep us in line, Bruhn.
I gave my word to the people of this town.
Why did you?
To make you look big and us little?
Maybe you better answer, Bruhn.
You'll drink, fool around, then kill each other over these women.
I'm a-riding out of here at daybreak with six men.
It's Saturday night.
Invite the ladies over for a social.
There's no harm in coffee and cookies and a little dancing.
- It'll take the edge off for a while.
- Yeah.
And all I'd like is a chance to talk to that little girl.
I won't even ask her to dance if she don't want to.
With no liquor it'll be a quiet Saturday night.
We need it bad, Captain.
Very well.
(HONKY-TONK PIANO)
BRUHN:
Tex!
One dance and I get her back.
If I was drunk I'd really show you how to dance.
Maybe Bruhn will open up the whiskey pretty soon.
I won't let Pace touch you.
Are you any better?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
No, you're right.
I came with them, I'm one of them.
I said I wouldn't let Pace touch you but you don't have to dance with me.
Don't leave me.
Why don't we dance?
I want to look at you.
I think Tex has got to the point where he can't stop.
Tex.
May I dance with the lady?
Now.
I'm gonna get Bruhn one of these days.
It's been tried by a lot of dead men.
Why did you have to do this terrible thing?
There are things worse, Ma'am, than dancing with lonely men.
- Please let us go.
- Soon.
Why did you have to come here?
You should be grateful.
Our coming saved the life of your husband.
I don't believe Blaise would have gone through with it.
Mrs Crane, when my men and I leave here there will be a showdown and you will be a widow.
Shorty.
Shorty.
- Having a good time, gentlemen?
- Yeah.
How long can Bruhn live?
Well, I gave him a big shot of morphine.
It deadens pain, makes the patient feel fine.
As soon as that dose wears off, he's gonna start coughing.
The cough's gonna rip the lungs a little bit more.
A few hours after he starts coughing he's gonna die.
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)
I didn't expect to hear music tonight.
They took the women to the saloon with them, to dance.
Dance?
What are the men gonna do about it?
Nothing, just talking.
Crane is talking about going to see Bruhn.
If he does, looks like you'll get what you wanted without doing a thing.
BLAISE:
Hold it, that's enough.
(MUSIC STOPS)
Are you giving the orders now?
No.
You don't know about the weather up in these mountains.
It's storming up here but not down in the valley below.
You came here to talk about the weather?
Those soldiers you think are days behind you are riding over the trail and they're heading this way.
Your concern for my men and me, Mr Blaise, is very touching.
Your position is hardly a tactical one.
You can't fight those soldiers here.
Even a private would realise that, Captain.
Can you suggest an alternative?
Yes, if you stop this party.
There's another way through the mountains.
No trail, no pass, but there's a way.
- I've been through it.
- He's lying.
Why didn't you take your women that way this morning?
It's too rough for the women.
Might be too rough for some of your men.
He's lying.
I tell you, Bruhn, he's lying.
I'll find out.
You ride with us, lead the way.
(WIND HOWLING)
You couldn't find it without me.
Shorty...
Pack your gear and assemble the men.
We're moving out at daybreak.
Gene, get the ladies out of here.
(COUGHING)
(COUGHING)
Don't be frightened anymore.
We'll be gone in a few minutes.
Can I get you something?
Some tobacco?
No, thanks.
I don't smoke.
I'll always remember you.
Goodbye, Gene.
Goodbye, Ernine.
You mustn't go with them.
I have to.
I might come back later but I have to.
If you go, you'll never come back.
There's no way through that mountain.
Blaise.
There is no trail to Cheyenne.
I never said there was a trail.
I said there was a way through.
Stop manoeuvring.
There's no way.
Kill him.
Wait, Gene.
I'd like you to know why I lied to you.
I'm not interested.
You're a dying man, Bruhn.
That interest you?
How do you want to die?
You're a man, not an animal.
You can ride out here with me and die clean, or turn your men loose on this town and die like a pig in the mud.
Do you want another Mormon massacre?
(COUGHING CONTINUES)
How do you want to go, Bruhn?
Ernine told you there was no trail.
- I didn't say who told me.
- Ernine must like you.
Have you any idea what Pace will do to her when Bruhn dies?
- I can stop him.
- Are you sure?
I won't be here to help you, son.
(COUGHING CONTINUES)
Just a minute.
I know what I'm doing and I know what Gene's doing.
But you, what's your reason?
- Why do you want to die?
- I know what I'm doing too, Bruhn.
Let's leave it at that.
I guess every fool has his reason.
Ernine spoke the truth.
- There is no way across the mountain.
- Who knows?
Maybe I'll find a trail.
I'm not even sure they're going.
But if they do go, you know you won't come back.
Probably not.
Why are you doing this?
I'm not doing anything special.
I'm just taking some bad men out of a good town.
You're the same man who would have killed Hal.
I don't know you at all.
No reason to.
Are you doing it because of me?
I'd like to know, Blaise.
I'm doing it because of myself.
That night in my room in the Wyoming you asked me not to kill your husband and I took a good look at myself in the mirror.
I didn't like what I saw.
I'm not any different from the men who rode in and took over this town, only they don't pretend to be anything but what they are.
And that's all there is to it, Mrs Crane.
Let's move.
Ah, I feel better now.
I'm beginning to hope we're gonna make it.
None of us are gonna make it.
Hey, Blaise, how are we gonna get out of this?
(WHINNYING)
I'm gonna need me another horse.
Ride one of the pack horses.
Gene, get off your horse.
Bruhn said get down.
And I'm saying leave your saddlebags where they are.
There's 6,000 in gold in 'em.
You can't carry it anyway.
Get down.
Just follow the tracks.
If snow covers them, keep the wind at your back.
You'll be all right.
Down!
Hey!
You won't be needing that gun.
We're both giving this party, Mr Blaise.
Move out, son.
Say hello to the soldiers for us, kid.
TEX:
That's right.
SHORTY:
Captain Bruhn!
Captain Bruhn!
What's wrong?
Hey, Starrett, help me.
Hold it.
We have to stop here till the Captain can ride again.
We're not stopping.
(GUNSHOT)
Get on your horse.
Thanks,
Captain Bruhn.
What are you thanking him for?
Get on your horse.
I don't think you wanna kill me.
We got to have Blaise, Tex.
We're gonna stop and bury these two men.
You know, it's kind of a lucky ride after all.
Lucky?
Yup.
We started out with about 6,000 in gold apiece.
Now we got 18,000 more to split four ways.
Cayenne, here I come.
(LAUGHTER CONTINUES)
What are you looking for?
You see anything?
Not much.
There's nothing to see.
You know where you're taking us?
Yes.
You lie, you know it.
I know it.
Turn around and go back to camp.
I'll show you what a Cheyenne does with a liar.
Get up.
You're not hurt.
Vause gave Tex and me the idea himself.
Let's ride.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on.
Come on back there.
Come on back there!
Not much shelter.
(WIND HOWLING)
PACE:
Stop him.
Stop him, Tex.
(GUNSHOT)
Now we have to go out and bring him back.
We need him.
I shot his horse.
He'll come crawling back to us.
Now, let's get this fire started.
We got the horses, the grub and the guns.
He can't live out there.
Damn wind!
Horses can't stand it either.
Now, let's get this fire started.
What are you doing?
(NEIGHING)
I don't have any matches.
I don't have any matches.
No matches.
(WIND HOWLING)
(WIND HAS DROPPED)
(NEIGHING)
Welcome home, Mr Starrett.
Wait a minute.
I thought it best he stay here while the soldiers will be around.
I'd like to work for you, Mr Starrett, if you'll have me.
All right, Gene.
Then you won't need this.
I never figured Hal Crane would have the nerve to string up barbed wire.
It's more than barbed wire.
It's a thousand head of my steer dying for feed and water.
Oh, you just have to drive your herds across his land once a year.
You could still work out something reasonable.
I'm through being reasonable.
I told Crane what would happen if he strung that wire.
Blaise, we've pulled over some hard hills together and I've rode behind you all the way.
A wire fence is a poor excuse to make a widow out of Crane's wife.
What have you been thinking about all winter?
Crane's barbed wire fence, or Crane's pretty wife, Helen?
Oh, hi, strangers.
It's good to see you.
Hi, Ernine.
Ernine...
Be with you in a minute, Blaise.
I didn't think you men would get out in this kind of weather.
Ernine, put up some coffee.
You boys must be eating pretty good at your place.
Sure ran through that last batch of supplies awful fast.
I didn't come to town for supplies.
I came here to get a shave.
Look, Blaise, these farmers have got a right to live, too.
Never saw so much stock on your shelves.
You're doing a pretty brisk trade with them, aren't you, Vic?
They're decent, hard-working folks.
All they ask out of life is a break from the weather and a chance to work their lands in peace.
You ever know me to break the peace, Vic?
No, but I've seen you put away some who tried to.
I don't hold for killing.
You don't have to.
As long as you've got somebody to do it for you.
I'm beholden to you for what you've done in the past, but things is changing and we've got to change with them.
I don't object to change, just fences, barbed wire fences.
Well, I warned Hal Crane he was foolish for ordering that load of wire.
You ordered it for him, didn't you, though?
A man has the right to spend his own money as he sees fit.
You declared yourself, Vic, that's all I want to know.
Crane's a proud man.
He won't knuckle down.
But he's a farmer.
That gun he carries is mostly bluff.
You call his hand, it'll be plain murder.
Hello, Mrs. Crane.
Hello, Vic...
Dan.
Mr. Starrett.
If you'll just give me your list, I'll get right to it so you can leave town before dark.
We're not leaving.
Hal wants to stay overnight to settle some business.
Coffee's on, boys.
Oh, hello, Mrs. Crane.
Won't you join us for some nice hot coffee?
Why, thanks, Ernine.
I don't know if I should.
This is the first time we've been away from the farm in months.
I promised Mrs. Preston that we'd come over.
Come on, boys.
I make much better coffee than that ranch mud you've been drinking.
Go ahead.
Have a nice, friendly cup of coffee the way neighbors do.
Won't you sit down, Mr. Starrett?
You know something, Mrs. Crane?
I'm glad your husband's stringing up those barbed wire fences.
We want more farmers around here and less cattle.
That's not a very friendly thing to say, Ernine.
Oh, I'm friendly enough all right.
It's just that you and Blaise are keeping me from getting married.
I want a husband and not some ranch hand that makes $30 a month with a bed in a bunkhouse.
I want a young farmer homesteading a quarter-section.
Ernine, I'm afraid Mr. Starrett's more concerned with keeping the range open than in your getting a husband.
You've got the best excuse I've heard yet.
Ernine, where'd you put the shortening?
Oh, father!
Just when we were getting sociable!
Excuse me.
How's the winter at your place?
Oh, it's been colder and harder than most.
Excuse me, Mrs. Crane.
This coffee made me think how good whiskey would taste.
Excuse me.
See you at the Wyoming.
You want to tell me something, Helen?
I don't love you anymore, Blaise.
I want you to understand that and believe it.
I don't.
Can't you see how wrong it was?
I can see what's true.
I don't care what's wrong or right.
Loving you has made me a stranger in my own family.
It's made me feel cheap every time Hal looks at me.
It's not a nice feeling.
It's better not to love at all.
You met him first, you married him.
Right now you can't even remember why.
To spend the rest of your life with him, that would be the cheap thing to do.
When Hal and I first came here, you could have had me for the asking.
I'd come to a new country with a new husband.
I would have given up anything if you had only taken me then!
I made a mistake.
I'm not proud of what we did, Blaise.
I'm not proud I let you stay with him.
I could have been stronger and faithful with your help.
I'm only concerned with what's going to be.
We're going to meet in town once or twice a year.
I'm going to call you Mr. Starrett and you're going to call me Mrs. Crane.
That's what has to be.
That's easy to say, not so easy to do.
I was more lonely this winter than I've ever been before.
But I had time to think.
I'm going to be Hal Crane's wife forever.
I'm sorry you had to say that, Helen.
Everything has to be on Blaise Starrett's terms.
You don't want the farmers to fence their farms, you back your orders with guns!
You want another man's wife, but the man has to be dead before you'll take her!
You don't have much mercy, do you, Blaise?
You won't find much mercy anywhere in Wyoming.
Funny weather we're having.
That warm wind keeps blowing, the road'll be belly-deep in mud.
You might have to stay in town a few days.
I wouldn't count on that.
Say, George, my horse seems to be favoring her left foreleg.
Give it a good rubdown before you turn in tonight, will you?
You might not be needing a horse tomorrow.
He's coming.
I see you bought the kerosene.
Five gallons, like you ordered.
We've been having a meeting.
Doesn't look like a prayer meeting.
It wasn't.
I'm speaking for all present, Blaise.
We're not going to stand for any gunplay in Bitters.
I won't start it, Vic.
I'd like that tin of kerosene back, Blaise.
Didn't you pay for it?
It's paid for.
Take good care of it.
I'd like to have a word with you, Mr. Starrett.
You must've passed my wagon on your way in.
- I did.
- Soon as the road's in shape,
I'm moving that wire up to my place and I'm stringing it up.
That's what I thought it was for.
What do you intend to do about it?
It's going to be cold riding home tomorrow.
I thought it would be nice to stop and make a fire.
I hear kerosene is the fastest way to burn up a wagon.
You burn my wagon, and I'II...
- Hal!
Hal!
Please...
What do you intend to do about it?
I intend to go upstairs and get a good night's sleep.
I asked you a question, Mr. Starrett.
When I wake up in the morning, I'll know what to do.
- I usually do.
- I've got to know!
You want to know the future, Mr. Crane.
That's wanting too much for any man.
I'm not afraid of you, Starrett.
Mr. Starrett and I have some business to discuss.
Would you excuse us, please?
I'm sure Mr. Starrett doesn't object to my presence here.
Mrs. Crane being with you doesn't influence me.
I'll fight for what I believe, Mr. Starrett.
I'll die if I have to, but I'll fight.
I want you to know that.
You've got a big mouth, farmer.
You've got big eyes, too.
You came here a year ago in your broken-down wagon looking for a choice spot to settle.
And you think you found it.
But you never stopped to think what made it such a good place.
When Dan and I came here,
Bitters was a nesting spot for every thief and killer in the territory.
A man's life wasn't worth the price of a bullet.
No woman was safe in the streets, let alone in a lonely farm house!
It took more than a big mouth to get rid of the lice who infested every bend in the road you ride so safely on.
I'm not saying Dan and I did it alone, but we did more than our share.
We hunted them down in the freezing cold while you sat back in the East hugging your pot-bellied stoves!
Nobody thanked us, nobody paid us.
We did it because we felt we belonged.
We'd earned the right to belong!
And all you've done is ride in here and put down your stinking roots!
And now you tell us that you belong and we don't!
Mr. Crane, you said you'd fight to keep what you want.
Well, I've been doing that for 20 years and I intend to keep on doing it!
And no pig-bellied farmer's going to stop me!
Give me a bottle, Tom.
Don't kill my husband.
He intends to kill me.
Hal's never fired a pistol in his whole life.
Then he shouldn't wear one.
He's not a coward!
He won't beg for his life.
I'm not that courageous.
I do beg you!
You should be telling this to him.
I have.
He won't listen.
What made you think I would?
Do you want me, Blaise?
Do you want me to ride out to your ranch with you?
I'm offering myself to you on any terms you want, but leave Hal live.
Your husband's a stubborn man.
If he won't give up his fences, why should he give you up?
I'll tell him I no longer love him.
He'll only come after you.
It'll still have to end the same way.
You're not a cruel man.
I've been close enough to you to know.
Why must you act like one?
Because I can't feel sorry for someone I hate.
Do you hate me, too, Blaise?
Tell your husband to load up his wagons and take you out of Wyoming.
Don't you think I've tried?
I knew this was coming.
I've waited all winter long for this day.
You'll have to do it, Helen.
Make him take you away.
He's afraid of you, but he's not a weak man.
He'll die before he'll run!
Then that's the way it'll have to be.
I'm sorry to have troubled you, Mr. Starrett.
Dan?
I'm no good to you, Blaise.
I'm no good to you.
Hold it!
Don't touch that kerosene.
We want you to go home.
There are three of us.
Dan.
Dan!
Roll the bottle down the bar.
When it hits the floor, that's it.
Roll the bottle, Dan!
Anything we can do for you, strangers?
Yes, could be.
I was looking for a quiet place.
We were settling a little private quarrel.
I apologize.
I don't like to break in on a party.
But we'll take your guns.
You won't find anything to take in this town.
You'd be surprised at what we can find to take.
The trail ends in this town.
There's no place to go but back.
The trail back is closed.
Who's following you?
Cavalry.
Two days hard riding behind us.
Cavalry doesn't bother tracking seven men like you.
Captain Jack Bruhn, United States Army, formerly.
Hey, you!
I want food and service for my men!
- We'll pay.
- Yes, sir.
That cavalry won't stop for food and rest.
And my men rest?
Now listen, do as you're told and you can go about your business just like we're not here, almost.
But we are here, so it's best you know with what you're dealing.
Pace, here, he derives pleasure out of hurting people.
Tex, rile him and you're going to hear some screaming in this town today.
Denver, half-Cheyenne.
Him hate white men.
But he doesn't feel half so badly about white women.
Vause, bones covered with dirty skin, but even half-drunk, he's the fastest draw in Wyoming Territory.
And Shorty, we soldiered together.
The young fella, well, he's a fresh recruit, but he's learning fast.
I believe you!
You just killed a man for no reason!
There will be no more killing, and to make sure...
Denver!
Vause!
Take that drunk and round up every gun in town and destroy them!
Don't waste time arguing with anybody.
- How many people live around here?
- About 20.
- Who's the law?
- We handle our own law.
Not now.
Let's get started, Bruhn.
We can do whatever we want in this town.
I'm edgy to get doing.
Where do you hide your women around here?
Leave our women out of this!
We only want to borrow them.
We'll give them back.
No women!
And no whiskey, and no gunning.
With $40,000 in gold in our saddlebags and a long ride ahead?
We'll pleasure ourselves at the end of the trail.
It's going to be a long day, Captain.
You want to argue, Pace?
No.
Just reminding you.
I got to have a drink.
One.
I'd like one, but it's the order of the day.
Is there a doctor in this town?
Doc Langer.
A vet, back of the barber shop.
Can this horse doctor take out a bullet slug?
He has.
Freeze it, Pace!
You seem to think a lot of your women in this town.
Who does she belong to?
She's my wife.
Change your mind about no women, Captain?
There are only four women in this town.
Do you want your men killing each other over them?
Tex,
Pace, search upstairs.
Bring anybody you find down here.
Shorty, take these two to the store.
Then round up all the women and put them in the store and tell them to get inside and stay inside.
My wife is upstairs.
My men won't molest your women unless I give them permission.
We found one more.
Get down here!
Lady, you go to the store with the rest of the women.
Hey, you!
I told you to prepare the rations.
Now get going.
We've been riding hard for over a month, Captain.
Hey!
Hide your liquor and hide it good.
Now, let's go see that horse doctor.
When the boys come back, keep them here.
No man leaves this saloon till I return.
And no whiskey.
That's an order.
You handle your men well, Captain.
They need me.
Come along with me.
That bullet's way in deep.
He lost a lot of blood.
I don't see how he's still walking around.
Has he got a chance?
Well, if he was a horse, or a calf, or a cow, I'd know.
I just ain't had too much practice on humans.
It says here that a person with a deep wound can die from the internal bleeding, even though nothing shows on the outside.
Is he bleeding internally?
Well, I couldn't tell.
Do you want me to kill him?
Kill him?
Bruhn dies, this town gets torn apart.
You'll be the one they'll go after first!
You've got to keep him alive!
How?
Look, I don't know how.
I can't operate.
I haven't got the instruments.
I wouldn't know how to use them even if I did have them.
- You're going to operate!
- But...
What are you two talking about?
The captain's waiting for you to take the bullet out, Doc.
He's waiting for the water to boil.
If Bruhn dies, I'll kill you!
What are we waiting for?
Sit down.
You'd better have some of this.
Put it away.
Hide the liquor.
Mr. Starrett, talk to me.
What about?
Anything, Mr. Starrett.
Anything.
Where did you serve in the cavalry, Captain?
Why do you ask?
I remember hearing about a Captain Bruhn.
Some incident with the Mormons in Utah.
I just wondered if you were the same.
Would you help me, please?
What did you hear?
No...
It couldn't be you.
Yes, it was.
Strange how one word could change a man's life.
I could have ordered retreat.
My command was, "Fire. "
At West Point, I made up my mind to be all soldier, which doesn't leave much room for being human.
Thanks.
Keep your people in check.
I'll control my men.
Gene, you stay with me.
I'm sleepy.
What are his chances, Doc?
I don't know.
It was in real deep.
I'd say if he lasts through the night...
I just don't know!
Shorty.
I found a bottle in the barber shop.
The captain says no whiskey.
- He'll never know.
- He knows everything.
They'd have hung you back in Casper if it hadn't been for Captain Bruhn!
And I'd have been an old bum in Abilene.
I wish you hadn't busted the bottle, Shorty.
We could have had just one drink.
Did you ever see what the captain does to men who disobey?
I've never seen anybody disobey him.
I have.
Be glad I busted that bottle.
I'll get it.
It's a relief to see you and Mr. Starrett friendly again.
Mr. Preston and I were so worried.
That's all over, isn't it, Mr. Starrett?
It doesn't seem very important right now.
Hal and you could be good friends.
Yes, we might try it sometime.
What Blaise needs is a wife to steady him down.
Clagget stole a horse from them.
He's just saddling up.
He's going to make a run for it!
He's crazy!
He'll never make it!
He knows they're watching the road.
Keep the women inside.
Clagget!
Stop it!
My wife's alone at the farm!
I've got to go to her.
You can't get through.
They've got a man watching the road.
I'll get through.
Bruhn is dying.
I saw him a little while ago.
He looked strong and healthy.
He might not last the day.
What'll happen if he dies?
They'll start drinking and fighting.
I've got to get Tommy out of that place.
No, you can't help him.
You better stay.
They'll be here, too, soon enough.
They mustn't find you here.
Where could we hide in town?
Beats me.
Even if we had horses, you couldn't get away through the snow.
You ladies will have to walk.
Get back to town.
Get out of here.
Gene.
That's your name, isn't it?
Don't make me use this gun.
I don't think you ever shot anybody.
I could start with you.
What do you want?
Let those women go by.
I can't do that.
They're coming.
You going to shoot them?
I can't cross Bruhn.
- I've got to warn him.
- No!
I don't think you want those women to get hurt.
I don't think Bruhn wants it, either.
Only Tex and Pace want it.
You're going to do it for them?
- Why didn't you stop them?
I was trying to.
Go back to town.
I told you your women would be safe.
All you had to do was wait.
Why didn't you believe me?
You've got all the cards, Bruhn.
Go ahead and play.
Only don't take it out on them.
It was my idea.
Can we have some fun with them now, Jack?
The name is Bruhn!
Ain't no reason to give them a break now, Bruhn.
I put my claim on that one first.
I'm going to make the little one happy.
You won't turn your men loose, Bruhn.
Why not?
They want to get drunk, they want to have some fun!
They could swallow this town whole and nobody would be alive to tell the tale.
You won't let that happen.
Say the word, Captain.
I'll toss you for the pleasure.
Mr. Blaise, you broke your word.
Only because I don't believe you can hold your men.
Tex, put down the gun.
Go back to your homes, everybody.
Stay on the inside.
You, stay here!
He's all yours, Texas.
No gun.
Thought you'd make yourself a big man in this town, eh?
Whoa!
Vause, Denver, finish him.
With your fists.
Shorty, bring that boy.
Come here, sonny.
Why do you want my boy?
He comes with me.
Your friends will sacrifice you, but they won't cause a young boy to be hurt by acting foolish.
Don't worry about the boy.
I'll take care of him.
I promise.
Now go on back, please.
They'll be leaving as soon as it's daybreak.
Sure.
Bruhn seems to be getting better.
They're staying close to the Wyoming.
Good.
Hal is grateful for what you did.
Deeply grateful.
Go back to him.
I told him I was coming here.
I asked him to come with me, but he told me to come alone.
I believe he knows and understands.
What's to understand?
You're his wife, I'm a stranger.
Go back to your husband, Mrs. Crane.
Thank you, Blaise.
Thanks for understanding.
- You mustn't come in here, Ernine.
- I've got to see Bobby.
He's all right.
This is no place for you to be.
Please, go home.
I want to see Bobby first.
Please don't!
No, no!
Say you'll do it or I'll break your little arm.
No, no.
Please don't...
Let the kid go, Pace.
Bruhn's got the whiskey hid.
I want the kid to find out where it is and get a bottle.
You want a drink?
Ask Bruhn.
You giving orders now?
In this case, I am.
Forget it, Gene.
We're all getting jumpy from not having any liquor or fun.
When he cools off, give him his gun back.
Get out of here, Ernine.
I'm taking him with me.
Stop!
I'm sorry.
You can't do that.
She hasn't done anything.
Don't hurt her.
I'm not going to hurt anybody.
He's all right.
He's as rotten as the rest of them.
You shouldn't have come here.
I'm taking Bobby back with me.
That'll just make things worse.
The boy's got to stay.
I saw what happened, I heard him screaming.
It won't happen again.
The boy has to stay.
There's no other way, Ernine.
How do you do, miss?
She was worried about her brother.
She's leaving.
No need to be.
What's your name, miss?
Bruhn said to leave the women alone, Pace.
I didn't bring her.
She's here because she wanted to be.
That gives me certain privileges.
Freeze, Pace!
This sure is a night for tangling.
I got a better idea.
Let's toss a coin for her.
Leave!
Bobby, tell your sister to leave.
Go ahead.
I'll be all right.
You didn't have to pull that iron on me, Gene.
I'm your friend.
We ride together, don't we?
Sure, Pace.
We ride together.
We're friends.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
Yeah, thanks.
I'm worried about Bruhn, Doc.
How is he?
Coming along.
He ain't hurt bad, is he, Doc?
Not like dying?
You don't want him to die, do you?
No, of course not.
He never answered you.
I tell you, Tex,
there's something really wrong with Bruhn.
There is?
What?
You sure look fine, Bruhn.
Where's that little boy?
In the kitchen with Gene.
I don't want that boy harmed or frightened.
We all like the kid, Bruhn.
I want the boy with Gene.
Hey, Bruhn, how about breaking open a bottle?
Just one drink.
I'm getting a chill.
Just one drink.
I want every man cold sober.
We pull out of here at dawn.
We don't ride tomorrow or the day after.
Did you see the weather coming in?
My tongue's salt dry for whiskey.
We took that Army pay wagon.
We fought hard, shot our way out.
For what?
To sit around on our butts like this was Sunday school?
Captain, you ain't letting nature take its course.
Men don't act like you make us act here.
We've got this town under our thumb but we ain't getting no pleasure out of it.
Two more days like this is going to seem like two more years.
Maybe not even you can keep us in line, Bruhn.
I gave my word to the people of this town.
Why did you?
To make you look big and us little?
Maybe you better answer, Bruhn.
You'll drink, fool around, then kill each other over these women.
I'm a-riding out of here at daybreak with six men.
It's Saturday night.
Invite the ladies over for a little social.
There's no harm in coffee and cookies and a little dancing.
It'll take the edge off for a while.
Yeah.
And all I'd like is a chance to talk to that little girl.
I won't even ask her to dance if she don't want to.
With no liquor, it'll be a quiet Saturday night.
We need it bad, Captain.
Very well.
Tex!
One dance and I get her back.
If I was drunk, I'd really show you how to dance.
Maybe Bruhn'll open up the whiskey pretty soon.
I won't let Pace touch you.
Are you any better?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.
No, you're right.
I came with them, I'm one of them.
I said I won't let Pace touch you, but you don't have to dance with me.
Don't leave me.
Why don't we dance?
I want to look at you.
I think Tex has got to the point where he can't stop.
Tex!
May I dance with the lady?
Now.
I'm going to get Bruhn one of these days.
It's been tried by a lot of dead men.
Why did you have to do this terrible thing?
There are things worse, ma'am, than dancing with lonely men.
Please let us go.
Soon.
Why did you have to come here?
You should be grateful.
Our coming saved the life of your husband.
I don't believe Blaise would have gone through with it.
Mrs. Crane, when my men and I leave here, there will be a showdown and you will be a widow.
Shorty.
Shorty!
Having a good time, gentlemen?
Yeah.
How long can Bruhn live?
Well, I gave him a big shot of morphine.
It deadens pain, makes the patient feel fine, but as soon as this dose wears off, he's going to start coughing.
Each cough's going to rip the lungs a little bit more.
A few hours after he starts coughing, he's going to die.
I didn't expect to hear music tonight.
They took the women to the saloon with them to dance.
Dance?
What are the men going to do about it?
Nothing.
Just talking.
Crane was talking about going to see Bruhn.
If he does, looks like you'll get what you wanted without doing a thing.
Hold it!
That's enough!
Are you giving the orders now?
No.
You don't know anything about the weather up in these mountains.
It's storming up here but not down in the valley below.
You came here to talk about the weather?
The soldiers you think are days behind you are riding over the trail right now and they're heading this way.
Your concern for my men and me, Mr. Blaise, is very touching.
Your position is hardly a tactical one.
You can't fight it out with those soldiers here.
Even a private would realize that, Captain.
Can you suggest an alternative?
Yeah, if you stop this party.
There's another way through the mountains.
No trail, no pass, but there's a way.
I've been through it.
He's lying.
Why didn't you take your women that way this morning?
It's too rough for the women.
Might be too rough for some of your men.
He's lying.
I tell you, Bruhn, he's lying.
I'll find out.
You ride with us.
Lead the way.
You couldn't find it without me.
Shorty, pack your gear and assemble the men.
We're moving out at daybreak.
Gene, get the ladies out of here.
Don't be frightened anymore.
We'll be gone in a few minutes.
Can I get you something?
Some tobacco?
No, thanks.
I don't smoke.
I'll always remember you.
Goodbye, Gene.
Goodbye, Ernine.
You mustn't go with them.
I have to.
I may come back later, but I have to.
If you go, you'll never come back.
There is no way through that mountain.
Blaise!
There is no trail to Cheyenne.
I never said there was a trail.
I said there was a way through.
Stop maneuvering, there's no way.
Kill him.
Wait, Gene!
I'd like you to know why I lied to you.
I'm not interested.
You're a dying man, Bruhn.
That interest you?
How do you want to die?
You're a man, not an animal.
You can ride out of here with me and die clean, or you can turn your men loose in this town and die like a pig in the mud.
Do you want another Mormon massacre?
How do you want to go, Bruhn?
Ernine told you there was no trail.
I didn't say who told me.
Ernine must like you.
Have you any idea what Pace'll do to her when Bruhn dies?
- I can stop him.
- Are you sure?
I won't be here to help you, son.
Just a minute.
I know what I'm doing and I know what Gene's doing.
But you...
What's your reason?
Why do you want to die?
I know what I'm doing, too, Bruhn.
Let's leave it at that.
I guess every fool has his reason.
Ernine spoke the truth.
There is no way across the mountain.
Who knows?
Maybe I'll find a trail.
I'm not even sure they're going.
But if they do go, you know you won't come back.
Probably not.
Why are you doing this?
I'm not doing anything special.
Just taking some bad men out of a good town.
You're the same man who would have killed Hal.
I don't know you at all.
No reason to.
Are you doing it because of me?
I'd like to know, Blaise.
I'm doing it because of myself.
That night in my room in the Wyoming, when you asked me not to kill your husband, after you left, I took a good look at myself in the mirror.
I didn't like what I saw.
That doesn't make me any different from the men who rode in and took over this town.
Only they don't pretend to be anything but what they are.
And that's all there is to it, Mrs. Crane.
Let's move.
Well, I feel better now.
I'm beginning to hope we're going to make it.
None of us are going to make it.
Hey, Blaise!
How are we going to get out of this?
I'm going to need me another horse.
Ride one of the packhorses.
Gene, get off your horse.
Bruhn said get down.
And I'm saying leave your saddle bags where they are.
There's $6,000 in gold in them.
You can't carry it anyway.
Get down.
Just follow the tracks.
If snow covers them, keep the wind at your back.
You'll be all right.
Down!
Hey!
You won't be needing that gun.
We're both giving this party, Mr. Blaise.
Move out, son.
Say hello to the soldiers for us, kid.
Let's ride!
Captain Bruhn, Captain Bruhn, what's wrong?
Hey, Starrett, help me!
Hold it!
We have to stop here till the captain can ride again.
We're not stopping.
Get on your horse.
Thanks, Captain Bruhn.
What're you thanking him for?
Get on your horse!
I don't think you want to kill me.
We got to have Blaise, Tex.
We're going to stop and bury these two men.
You know, it's kind of a lucky ride after all.
Lucky?
Yeah.
We started out with about $6,000 in gold apiece.
Now we've got $18,000 more to split four ways.
Cheyenne, here I come.
Cheyenne, here we come.
What are you looking for?
You see anything?
Not much.
There's nothing to see.
You know where you're taking us?
Yes.
You lie, you know it!
I know it!
Turn around and go back to camp.
I'll show you what a Cheyenne does with a liar!
Get up, you're not hurt.
Vause gave Tex and me the idea himself.
Let's ride!
Saddle.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on back here, come on back.
Not much shelter.
Stop him!
Stop him, Tex!
Now we have to go out and bring him back.
We need him!
I just shot his horse.
He'll come crawling back to us.
Now let's get this fire started.
We've got the horses, the grub and the guns.
He can't live out there.
Damn wind!
The horses can't stand it, either.
Now let's get this fire started.
What are you doing?
I don't have any matches.
I don't have any matches.
No matches.
Welcome home, Mr. Starrett.
Wait a minute.
I thought it best he stay here while the soldiers will be around.
I'd like to work for you, Mr. Starrett, if you'll have me.
All right, Gene.
Then you won't need this.
I never figured Hal Crane would have the nerve to string up barbed wire.
It's more than barbed wire.
It's a thousand head of my steers, dying for feed and water.
You just have to drive your herds across his land once a year.
You could still work out something reasonable.
I'm through being reasonable.
I told Crane what would happen if he strung that wire.
Blaise...
We've pulled over some hard hills together and I've rode behind you all the way.
A wire fence is a poor excuse to make a widow out of Crane's wife.
What have you been thinking about all winter?
Crane's barbed-wire fence or Crane's pretty wife, Helen?
Oh, hi, strangers.
It's good to see you.
- Hi, Ernine.
- Ernine.
Be with you in a minute, Blaise.
I didn't think you men would get out in this weather.
Ernine, put up some coffee.
You boys must be eating pretty good at your place.
Sure ran through that last batch of supplies awful fast.
I didn't come to town for supplies.
I came here to get a shave.
Look, Blaise, these farmers got a right to live too.
Never saw so much stock on your shelves.
You're doing a pretty brisk trade with them, Vic.
They're decent, hard-working folks.
All they ask out of life is a break from the weather and a chance to work their lands in peace.
Ever known me to break the peace, Vic?
No, but I've seen you put away some who tried to.
- I don't hold for killing.
- You don't have to.
As long as you got somebody to do it for you.
I'm beholden to you for what you've done in the past but things has changed and we got to change with them.
I don't object to change, just fences.
Barbed-wire fences.
I warned Hal Crane he was foolish for ordering that load of wire.
Still ordered it for him, didn't you, though?
Well, a man has a right to spend his own money as he sees fit.
You've declared yourself, Vic.
That's all I want to know.
Crane's a proud man.
He won't knuckle down.
But he's a farmer.
That gun he carries is mostly bluff.
You call his hand, it will be plain murder.
Hello, Mrs Crane.
Why, hello, Vic.
Dan.
Mr Starrett.
If you'll just give me a list, I'll get right to it so you can leave town before dark.
We're not leaving.
Hal wants to stay overnight to settle some business.
Coffee's on, boys.
Oh, hello, Mrs Crane.
Won't you join us for some nice hot coffee?
Why, thanks, Ernine.
I don't know if I should.
This is the first time we've been away in months.
I promised Mrs Preston that we'd come over.
Come on, boys.
I make much better coffee than that ranch mud you drink.
Go ahead.
Have a nice friendly cup of coffee the way neighbours do.
Won't you sit down, Mr Starrett?
You know, I'm glad your husband is stringing up those barbed-wire fences.
We want more farmers around here and less cattle.
That's not a very friendly thing to say, Ernine.
Oh, I'm friendly enough, all right.
It's just that you and Blaise are keeping me from getting married.
I want a husband and not some ranch hand that makes $30 a month with a bed in a bunkhouse.
I want a young farmer, homesteading a quarter section.
I'm afraid Mr Starrett's more concerned with keeping the range open than your getting a husband.
You've got the best excuse I've heard yet.
Ernine, where did you put the shortening?
Oh, Father, just when we were getting sociable!
Excuse me.
How's the winter at your place?
Oh, it's been colder and harder than most.
Excuse me, Mrs Crane.
This coffee made me think how good whiskey would taste.
Excuse me.
See you at the Wyoming.
Do you want to tell me something, Helen?
I don't love you anymore, Blaise.
- I want you to understand that.
- I don't.
- Can't you see how wrong it was?
- I can see what's true.
I don't care what's wrong or right.
Loving you has made me a stranger in my own family.
It's made me feel cheap every time Hal looks at me.
It's not a nice feeling.
It's better not to love at all.
You met him first, you married him.
Right now you can't even remember why.
Spending the rest of your life with him, that would be the cheap thing to do.
When Hal and I first came here, you could have had me for the asking.
I'd come to a new country with a new husband.
I would have given up anything if you'd only taken me then.
I made a mistake.
- I'm not proud of what we did, Blaise.
- I'm not proud I let you stay with him.
I could have been stronger with your help.
I'm only concerned with what's going to be.
We're going to meet in town once or twice a year.
I'm going to call you Mr Starrett and you're going to call me Mrs Crane.
That's what has to be.
That's easy to say, not so easy to do.
I was more lonely this winter than I've ever been before.
But I had time to think.
I'm gonna be Hal Crane's wife forever.
I'm sorry you had to say that, Helen.
Everything has to be on Blaise Starrett's terms.
You don't want the farmers to fence their farms.
You back your orders with guns.
You want another man's wife but the man has to be dead before you'll take her.
You don't have much mercy, do you, Blaise?
You won't find much mercy anywhere in Wyoming.
Funny weather we're having.
If that warm wind keeps blowing, the road will be belly-deep in mud.
You might have to stay in town a few days.
I wouldn't count on that.
Hey, George.
My horse seems to be favouring her left foreleg.
Give it a good rub-down before you turn in tonight.
You might not be needing a horse tomorrow.
He's coming.
I see you brought the kerosene.
Five gallons, like you ordered.
We've been having a meeting.
- Doesn't look like a prayer meeting.
- It wasn't.
I'm speaking for all present, Blaise.
We're not going to stand for any gun play in Bitters.
I won't start it, Vic.
I'd like that tin of kerosene back, Blaise.
- Didn't you pay for it?
- It's paid for.
Take good care of it.
I'd like to have a word with you, Mr Starrett.
You must have passed my wagon on your way in.
I did.
Soon as the road's in shape I'm moving that wire up to my place.
- And I'm stringing it up.
- That's what I thought it was for.
What do you intend to do about it?
It's going to be cold riding home tomorrow.
I thought it'd be nice to stop and make a fire.
I hear kerosene is the fastest way to burn up a wagon.
- You burn my wagons and I'll...
- Hal...
Hal.
Please.
What do you intend to do about it?
I intend to go upstairs and get a good night's sleep.
I asked you a question, Mr Starrett.
When I wake up I'll know what to do.
- I usually do.
- I've got to know.
You want to know the future, Mr Crane.
That's wanting too much for any man.
I'm not afraid of you, Starrett.
Mr Starrett and I have some business to discuss.
Would you excuse us, please?
I'm sure Mr Starrett doesn't object to my presence here.
Mrs Crane being with you doesn't influence me.
I'll fight for what I believe, Mr Starrett.
I'll die if I have to but I'll fight.
I want you to know that.
You've got a big mouth, farmer.
You got big eyes too.
You came here a year ago in your broken-down wagon, looking for a choice spot to settle.
And you think you found it.
But you never stopped to think what made it such a good place.
When Dan and I came here
Bitters was the nesting spot for every thief and killer in the territory.
A man's life wasn't worth the price of a bullet.
No woman was safe in the streets, let alone in a lonely farmhouse.
It took more than a big mouth to get rid of the lice who infested every bend of the road you ride so safely on.
I'm not saying Dan and I did it alone.
But we did more than our share.
We hunted them down in the freezing cold while you sat back in the east, hugging your pot-bellied stoves.
Nobody thanked us.
Nobody paid us.
We did it because we felt we belonged.
We'd earned the right to belong.
And all you've done is ride in here and put down your stinking roots.
And now you tell us that you belong and we don't.
Mr Crane, you said you'd fight to keep what you wanted.
Well, I've been doing that for 20 years and I intend to keep on doing it.
And no pig-bellied farmer's going to stop me.
Give me a bottle, Tom.
Don't kill my husband.
He intends to kill me.
Hal's never fired a pistol in his whole life.
Then he shouldn't wear one.
He's not a coward.
He won't beg for his life.
I'm not that courageous.
I do beg you.
You should be telling this to him.
I have.
- He won't listen.
- What made you think I would?
Do you want me, Blaise?
Do you want me to ride out to your ranch with you?
I'm offering myself to you, on any terms you want, but leave Hal live.
Your husband's a stubborn man.
He won't give up his fences.
Why should he give you up?
I'll tell him I no longer love him.
He'll only come after you.
It'll still have to end the same way.
You're not a cruel man.
I've been close enough to you to know.
Why must you act like one?
Because I can't feel sorry for someone I hate.
Do you hate me too, Blaise?
Tell your husband to load up his wagons and take you out of Wyoming.
Don't you think I've tried?
I knew this was coming.
I've waited all winter long for this day.
You have to do it, Helen.
Make him take you away.
He's afraid of you but he's not a weak man.
He'll die before he'll run.
Then that's the way it'll have to be.
I'm sorry to have troubled you, Mr Starrett.
Dan?
I'm no good to you, Blaise.
I'm no good to you.
Hold it.
Don't touch that kerosene.
We want you to go home.
There are three of us.
Dan.
Dan!
Roll the bottle down the bar.
When it hits the floor, that's it.
Roll the bottle, Dan.
Anything we can do for you strangers?
Yes, could be.
I was looking for a quiet place.
We were settling a little private quarrel.
I apologise.
I don't like to break in on a party.
But we'll take your guns.
You won't find anything to take in this town.
You'd be surprised at what we can find to take.
Trail ends in this town.
No place to go but back.
The trail back is closed.
Who's following you?
- Cavalry.
- Two days' hard riding behind us.
Cavalry doesn't bother tracking seven men like you.
Captain Jack Bruhn,
United States Army, formerly.
Hey, you.
I want food and service for my men.
- We'll pay.
- Yes, sir.
That cavalry won't stop for food and rest.
My men rest.
Now, listen, do as you're told and you can go about your business just like we're not here, almost.
But we are here so it's best you know with what you're dealing.
Pace here, he derives pleasure out of hurting people.
Tex, rile him and you're gonna hear some screaming in this town today.
Denver, half Cheyenne.
Him hate white men but he doesn't feel half so badly about white women.
Vause, bones covered with dirty skin but even half-drunk he's the fastest draw in Wyoming territory.
Shorty, we soldiered together.
The young fella, he's a fresh recruit but he's learning fast.
I believe you.
You just killed a man for no reason.
There will be no more killing and to make sure,
Denver, Vause, take that drunk and round up every gun in town
and destroy them.
And don't waste time arguing with anybody.
How many people live around here?
About 20.
- Who's the law?
- We handle our own law.
Not now.
Let's get started, Bruhn.
We can do whatever we want in this town.
I'm edgy to get doing.
Where do you hide your women around here?
Leave our women out of this.
We only want to borrow 'em.
We'll give 'em back.
No women.
And no whiskey and no gunning.
With 40,000 in gold in our saddlebags and a long ride ahead?
We'll pleasure ourselves at the end of the trail.
It's gonna be a long day, Captain.
You wanna argue, Pace?
No, just reminding you.
I gotta have a drink.
One.
I'd like one, but it's the order of the day.
Is there a doctor in this town?
Doc Langer.
Vet, back of the barbershop.
Can this horse doctor take out a bullet slug?
He has.
Freeze it, Pace.
You seem to think a lot of your women in this town.
Who does she belong to?
She's my wife.
Change your mind about no women, Captain?
There are only four women in this town.
Do you want your men killing each other over them?
Tex, Pace...
Search upstairs.
Bring anybody you find down here.
Shorty, take these two to the store.
Then round up all the women and put 'em in the store and tell 'em to get inside and stay inside.
My wife is upstairs.
My men won't molest your women unless I give them permission.
- We found one more.
- Get down here!
Lady, you go to the store with the rest of the women.
Hey, you.
I told you to prepare the rations.
Now, get going.
We've been riding hard for over a month, Captain.
Hey!
Hide your liquor and hide it good.
Now...
let's go see that horse doctor.
When the boys come back, keep them here.
No man leaves this saloon till I return.
And no whiskey.
That's an order.
- You handle your men well, Captain.
- They need me.
Come along with me.
That bullet's way in deep.
I don't see how he's still walking around.
- Has he got a chance?
- If he was a horse or a cow, I'd know.
I just ain't had too much practice on humans.
It says that a person with a deep wound can die of internal bleeding even though nothing shows on the outside.
- Is he bleeding internally?
- I couldn't tell.
Do you want me to kill him?
Kill him?
If Bruhn dies, this town gets torn apart.
They'll go after you first.
You got to keep him alive.
But how?
Look, I don't know how.
I can't operate.
I haven't got the instruments.
- I wouldn't know how to use them.
- You're gonna operate.
What are you two talking about?
The Captain's waiting for you to take the bullet out, Doc.
He's waiting for the water to boil.
If Bruhn dies, I'll kill you.
What are we waiting for?
Sit down.
You'd better have some of this.
Put it away.
Hide the liquor.
Mr Starrett, talk to me.
What about?
Anything, Mr Starrett.
Anything.
Where did you serve in the cavalry, Captain?
Why do you ask?
I remember hearing about a Captain Bruhn.
Some incident with the Mormons in Utah.
I just wondered if you were the same.
Would you help me, please?
What did you hear?
No.
Couldn't be you.
Yes, it was.
Strange, how one word can change a man's life.
I could have ordered, "Retreat!"
My command was, "Fire!"
At West Point I made up my mind to be all soldier, which doesn't leave much room for being human.
Thanks.
Keep your people in check.
I'll control my men.
Gene, stay with me.
I'm sleepy.
What are his chances, Doc?
I don't know.
It was in real deep.
I'd say if he lasts through the night...
I just don't know.
Shorty.
I found a bottle in the barbershop.
The Captain says no whiskey.
- He'll never know.
- He knows everything.
They'd have hung you back in Casper if it hadn't been for Captain Bruhn.
And I'd have been an old bum in Adeline.
I wish you hadn't busted the bottle, Shorty.
We could have had just one drink.
Did you ever see what the Captain does to men that disobey?
- I've never seen anybody disobey him.
- I have.
Be glad I busted that bottle.
I'll get it.
It's a relief to see you and Mr Starrett friendly again.
Mr Preston and I were so worried.
That's all over, isn't it, Mr Starrett?
Doesn't seem very important right now.
- Hal and you can be good friends.
- Yes, we might try it sometime.
What Blaise needs is a wife to steady him down.
Clagget stole a horse from 'em.
He's just saddling up.
He's gonna make a run for it.
He's crazy.
He'll never make it.
- He knows they're watching the road.
- Keep the women inside.
Clagget, hold it.
My wife's alone at the farm.
I got to go to her.
You can't get through.
They got a man watching the road.
I'll get through.
Bruhn is dying.
I saw him a little while ago.
He looks strong and healthy.
He might not last the day.
- What will happen if he dies?
- They'll start drinking and fighting.
- I've got to get Tommy out of that place.
- No, you can't help him.
You better stay.
- They'll be here too, soon enough.
- They mustn't find you here.
Where can we hide in town?
Beats me.
Even if we had horses you couldn't get away through the snow.
The ladies will have to walk.
Get back to town.
Get out of here.
Gene.
That's your name, isn't it?
Don't make me use this gun.
I don't think you ever shot anybody.
I could start with you.
What do you want?
Let those women go by.
I can't do that.
They're coming.
Are you gonna shoot them?
I can't cross Bruhn.
I got to warn him.
No.
I don't think you want those women to get hurt.
I don't think Bruhn wants it either.
Only Tex and Pace want it.
You gonna do it for them?
- Why didn't you stop 'em?
- I was trying to.
Go back to town.
I told you your women would be safe.
All you had to do was wait.
Why didn't you believe me?
You've got all the cards, Bruhn.
Go ahead and play.
Only don't take it out on them.
It was my idea.
I'm gonna have some fun with them now, Jack.
The name is Bruhn.
Ain't no reason to give 'em a break now, Bruhn.
- I put my claim on that one first.
- I'm gonna make the little one happy.
You won't turn your men loose, Bruhn.
Why not?
They wanna get drunk.
They wanna have some fun.
They could swallow this town whole and nobody would be alive to tell the tale.
You won't let that happen.
- Say the word, Captain.
- I'll toss you for the pleasure.
Mr Blaise, you broke your word.
Only because I don't believe you can hold your men.
Tex, put down the gun.
Go back to your homes, everybody.
Stay on the inside.
You, stay here.
He's all yours, Texas.
No gun.
Thought you'd make yourself a big man in this town, huh?
Vause, Denver, finish him.
With your fists.
Shorty, bring that boy.
- Come here, sonny.
- What do you want him for?
He comes with me.
Your friends will sacrifice you but they won't cause a young boy to be hurt by acting foolish.
Don't worry about the boy.
I'll take care of him.
I promise.
Now, go on back.
Please.
He'll be leaving as soon as it's daybreak.
Sure.
Bruhn seems to be getting better.
They're staying close to the Wyoming.
Good.
Hal is grateful for what you did.
Deeply grateful.
Go back to him.
I told him I was coming here.
I asked him to come with me.
But he told me to come alone.
I believe he knows and understands.
What's to understand?
You're his wife, I'm a stranger.
Go back to your husband, Mrs Crane.
Thank you, Blaise.
Thanks for understanding.
- You mustn't come in here.
- I've got to see Bobby.
He's all right.
This is no place for you to be.
Please.
Go home.
I wanna see Bobby first.
Please don't.
Ow!
No, no!
- Ow!
- Say you'll do it or I'll break your little arm.
No, no.
Please don't.
Ow!
- Let the kid go, Pace.
- Bruhn's got the whiskey here.
I want the kid to find out where it is and get a bottle.
If you want a drink, ask Bruhn.
Are you giving orders now?
In this case I am.
Forget it, Gene.
We're all getting jumpy from not having any liquor or fun.
When he cools off, give him his gun back.
Get out of here, Ernine.
I'm taking him with me.
Stop.
Look, I'm sorry.
You can't do that.
She hasn't done anything.
Don't hurt her.
I'm not gonna hurt anybody.
He's all right.
He's as rotten as the rest of them.
You shouldn't have come here.
I'm taking Bobby back with me.
That'll just make things worse.
The boy's got to stay.
I saw what happened.
I heard him screaming.
It won't happen again.
The boy has to stay.
There's no other way, Ernine.
How do you do, Miss?
She was worried about her brother.
She's leaving.
No need to be.
What's your name, Miss?
Bruhn said to leave the women alone, Pace.
I didn't bring her.
She's here because she wanted to be.
- That gives me certain privileges.
- Freeze, Pace!
This sure is a night for tangling.
I got a better idea.
Let's toss a coin for her.
Leave.
Bobby, tell your sister to leave.
Go ahead.
I'll be all right.
You didn't have to pull that iron on me, Gene.
I'm your friend.
We ride together, don't we?
Sure, Pace.
We ride together.
We're friends.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
Yeah, thanks.
I'm worried about Bruhn, Doc.
- How is he?
- Coming along.
He ain't hurt bad, is he, Doc?
Not like dying?
- You don't want him to die, do you?
- No, of course not.
He never answered you.
I tell you, Tex... there's something really wrong with Bruhn.
There is?
- What?
- You sure look fine, Bruhn.
- Where's that little boy?
- In the kitchen with Gene.
I don't want that boy harmed or frightened.
We all like the kid, Bruhn.
I want the boy with Gene.
How about breaking open a bottle, just one drink?
I'm getting a chill.
Just one drink.
I want every man cold sober.
We pull out of here at dawn.
We don't ride tomorrow or the day after.
Did you see the weather coming in?
My tongue's salt-dry for whiskey.
We took that army pay wagon, fought hard, shot our way out.
For what?
Sitting around on our butts like this was Sunday school!
Captain, you ain't letting nature take its course.
Men don't act like you make us act here.
We've got this town under our thumb but we ain't getting no pleasure.
Two more days like this is gonna seem like two more years.
Maybe not even you can keep us in line, Bruhn.
I gave my word to the people of this town.
Why did you?
To make you look big and us little?
Maybe you better answer, Bruhn.
You'll drink, fool around, then kill each other over these women.
I'm a-riding out of here at daybreak with six men.
It's Saturday night.
Invite the ladies over for a social.
There's no harm in coffee and cookies and a little dancing.
- It'll take the edge off for a while.
- Yeah.
And all I'd like is a chance to talk to that little girl.
I won't even ask her to dance if she don't want to.
With no liquor it'll be a quiet Saturday night.
We need it bad, Captain.
Very well.
Tex!
One dance and I get her back.
If I was drunk I'd really show you how to dance.
Maybe Bruhn will open up the whiskey pretty soon.
I won't let Pace touch you.
Are you any better?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
No, you're right.
I came with them, I'm one of them.
I said I wouldn't let Pace touch you but you don't have to dance with me.
Don't leave me.
Why don't we dance?
I want to look at you.
I think Tex has got to the point where he can't stop.
Tex.
May I dance with the lady?
Now.
I'm gonna get Bruhn one of these days.
It's been tried by a lot of dead men.
Why did you have to do this terrible thing?
There are things worse, Ma'am, than dancing with lonely men.
- Please let us go.
- Soon.
Why did you have to come here?
You should be grateful.
Our coming saved the life of your husband.
I don't believe Blaise would have gone through with it.
Mrs Crane, when my men and I leave here there will be a showdown and you will be a widow.
Shorty.
Shorty.
- Having a good time, gentlemen?
- Yeah.
How long can Bruhn live?
Well, I gave him a big shot of morphine.
It deadens pain, makes the patient feel fine.
As soon as that dose wears off, he's gonna start coughing.
The cough's gonna rip the lungs a little bit more.
A few hours after he starts coughing he's gonna die.
I didn't expect to hear music tonight.
They took the women to the saloon with them, to dance.
Dance?
What are the men gonna do about it?
Nothing, just talking.
Crane is talking about going to see Bruhn.
If he does, looks like you'll get what you wanted without doing a thing.
Hold it, that's enough.
Are you giving the orders now?
No.
You don't know about the weather up in these mountains.
It's storming up here but not down in the valley below.
You came here to talk about the weather?
Those soldiers you think are days behind you are riding over the trail and they're heading this way.
Your concern for my men and me, Mr Blaise, is very touching.
Your position is hardly a tactical one.
You can't fight those soldiers here.
Even a private would realise that, Captain.
Can you suggest an alternative?
Yes, if you stop this party.
There's another way through the mountains.
No trail, no pass, but there's a way.
- I've been through it.
- He's lying.
Why didn't you take your women that way this morning?
It's too rough for the women.
Might be too rough for some of your men.
He's lying.
I tell you, Bruhn, he's lying.
I'll find out.
You ride with us, lead the way.
You couldn't find it without me.
Shorty...
Pack your gear and assemble the men.
We're moving out at daybreak.
Gene, get the ladies out of here.
Don't be frightened anymore.
We'll be gone in a few minutes.
Can I get you something?
Some tobacco?
No, thanks.
I don't smoke.
I'll always remember you.
Goodbye, Gene.
Goodbye, Ernine.
You mustn't go with them.
I have to.
I might come back later but I have to.
If you go, you'll never come back.
There's no way through that mountain.
Blaise.
There is no trail to Cheyenne.
I never said there was a trail.
I said there was a way through.
Stop manoeuvring.
There's no way.
Kill him.
Wait, Gene.
I'd like you to know why I lied to you.
I'm not interested.
You're a dying man, Bruhn.
That interest you?
How do you want to die?
You're a man, not an animal.
You can ride out here with me and die clean, or turn your men loose on this town and die like a pig in the mud.
Do you want another Mormon massacre?
How do you want to go, Bruhn?
Ernine told you there was no trail.
- I didn't say who told me.
- Ernine must like you.
Have you any idea what Pace will do to her when Bruhn dies?
- I can stop him.
- Are you sure?
I won't be here to help you, son.
Just a minute.
I know what I'm doing and I know what Gene's doing.
But you, what's your reason?
- Why do you want to die?
- I know what I'm doing too, Bruhn.
Let's leave it at that.
I guess every fool has his reason.
Ernine spoke the truth.
- There is no way across the mountain.
- Who knows?
Maybe I'll find a trail.
I'm not even sure they're going.
But if they do go, you know you won't come back.
Probably not.
Why are you doing this?
I'm not doing anything special.
I'm just taking some bad men out of a good town.
You're the same man who would have killed Hal.
I don't know you at all.
No reason to.
Are you doing it because of me?
I'd like to know, Blaise.
I'm doing it because of myself.
That night in my room in the Wyoming you asked me not to kill your husband and I took a good look at myself in the mirror.
I didn't like what I saw.
I'm not any different from the men who rode in and took over this town, only they don't pretend to be anything but what they are.
And that's all there is to it, Mrs Crane.
Let's move.
Ah, I feel better now.
I'm beginning to hope we're gonna make it.
None of us are gonna make it.
Hey, Blaise, how are we gonna get out of this?
I'm gonna need me another horse.
Ride one of the pack horses.
Gene, get off your horse.
Bruhn said get down.
And I'm saying leave your saddlebags where they are.
There's 6,000 in gold in 'em.
You can't carry it anyway.
Get down.
Just follow the tracks.
If snow covers them, keep the wind at your back.
You'll be all right.
Down!
Hey!
You won't be needing that gun.
We're both giving this party, Mr Blaise.
Move out, son.
Say hello to the soldiers for us, kid.
That's right.
Captain Bruhn!
Captain Bruhn!
What's wrong?
Hey, Starrett, help me.
Hold it.
We have to stop here till the Captain can ride again.
We're not stopping.
Get on your horse.
Thanks,
Captain Bruhn.
What are you thanking him for?
Get on your horse.
I don't think you wanna kill me.
We got to have Blaise, Tex.
We're gonna stop and bury these two men.
You know, it's kind of a lucky ride after all.
Lucky?
Yup.
We started out with about 6,000 in gold apiece.
Now we got 18,000 more to split four ways.
Cayenne, here I come.
What are you looking for?
You see anything?
Not much.
There's nothing to see.
You know where you're taking us?
Yes.
You lie, you know it.
I know it.
Turn around and go back to camp.
I'll show you what a Cheyenne does with a liar.
Get up.
You're not hurt.
Vause gave Tex and me the idea himself.
Let's ride.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on.
Come on back there.
Come on back there!
Not much shelter.
Stop him.
Stop him, Tex.
Now we have to go out and bring him back.
We need him.
I shot his horse.
He'll come crawling back to us.
Now, let's get this fire started.
We got the horses, the grub and the guns.
He can't live out there.
Damn wind!
Horses can't stand it either.
Now, let's get this fire started.
What are you doing?
I don't have any matches.
I don't have any matches.
No matches.
Welcome home, Mr Starrett.
Wait a minute.
I thought it best he stay here while the soldiers will be around.
I'd like to work for you, Mr Starrett, if you'll have me.
All right, Gene.
Then you won't need this.

SOUTHERN GATE OF PEACE
This isn't like you.
- Why?
- You're running away.
Don't you want me?
Of course I do.
And I want you too.
Yet we can't marry -
How many times must I explain?
Because you might be called up?
I wouldn't care if it was the day after.
Of course I'd cry.
I'd cry bitterly.
But happiness only lies in marrying the one you love.
All right.
I'll take you back to my dormitory.
You'll stay with me tonight.
All right?
Yes...
I'll go.
No, you better go back to your own dormitory.
I can't take you to mine.
You were just testing me.
You shouldn't have done that.
You're a coward and a weakling!
Now I see that!
SOUTH MANCHURIA STEEL CO.
RESEARCH DEPARTMENT
Hey.
Well, what a surprise.
I came to say good-bye, as sentimental as that may sound.
You got called up?
When do you leave?
- Tomorrow morning.
The papers came five days ago.
I've been drinking ever since.
Oh, yes.
I ran into Michiko last night.
Aren't you going to marry her?
It's you today.
Tomorrow it could be me.
Being called up isn't a death sentence.
I'm a born optimist.
Unlike you, I've had my share of earthly pleasures.
My only regret is not having left the seed of life in the womb of a woman I love.
I'll probably regret it too, but I can't be as optimistic as you.
The manager wants me.
Wait for me inside.
No, I'll see you tonight.
Tonight?
All right.
Kaji looked a bit angry.
Is anything wrong?
Are you going to be platonic friends forever?
You had the spunk to come out here to Manchuria alone.
Throw yourself at him!
I did.
He rejected you?
No. 12 and 13, stop your chatter... or I'll report you.
THE SUPERVISION OF COLONIAL LABOR
I read it twice.
Very interesting, though it does smell of leftist tendencies.
What are you trying to say?
That men should be treated as men - I suppose that's the gist.
But in colonial territories it's -
- A challenge?
Yes, sir.
We profit by exploiting Chinese labor - isn't that the idea?
That's right.
And that goes against your thesis.
Yes, it does.
Mind if I take a cigarette?
- Help yourself.
So how about it?
Without that contradiction, there'd be nothing to write about.
So it contradicts your thesis, but there are still ways to improve performance, is that it?
Yes, perhaps there are.
Listen, I want you to take over at the Loh Hu Liong mines.
Any objections to being sent off to the hinterlands?
I'm not trying to force you.
You've analyzed the local situation quite well on paper.
Would you want it to end up only on paper?
No.
When you're ready to put your theories into practice,
I'll help you get a fair chance at exemption from military service.
An exemption from military service?
You're not the only one to get an exemption.
There are dozens of others.
But it's the idea of accepting an exemption in exchange for the Loh Hu Liong job.
You always complicate things.
It's a bad habit.
The war is escalating, and there's only one way to oppose it:
A life sentence in prison.
Neither you nor I have the courage for that.
Am I right?
Yes... you're right.
I humbly accept your kind gift.
Not even the commander of the Kwangtung Army ever dared slap me.
Take Michiko and go to Loh Hu Liong.
Michiko... his sweetheart?
Is pretty?
The most beautiful girl in the world.
But you're the most beautiful girl in my world.
Listen.
So you think you'd just be a shepherd's dog.
What's wrong with that?
A good dog can lead the sheep to greener pastures and earn their gratitude.
If such things are possible.
As for me, I'll take this one.
My little Manon, your hair smells like dried grass.
Michiko-san!
Kageyama-san, take care.
Michiko-san, go with Kaji to Loh Hu Liong.
Let this damn war go to the dogs.
If you let happiness slip through your fingers...
He may never return.
I won't be called up.
Loh Hu Liong is a tiny Manchurian village.
All we'll find there are iron ore and labor camps.
Would you go with me to a place like that?
I'd follow you anywhere.
This will affect your whole life.
Think it over carefully.
Even if you were called up...
I'd still want to have your child.
Is that crazy?
What a honeymoon!
What did you say?
It's all this wind and dust.
I don't care!
It's wonderful!
It feels like gravel in my mouth.
LOH HU LIONG
Step up.
All right.
Bastard!
Why, you!
Think I'm blind?
Trick me into giving you special rations?
Oh no, you don't!
Come here.
- Kaji from the head office?
- Yes.
I'm Okishima.
We'll be working together.
We can dispense with the formalities.
What ever made you come out to the boonies?
Following Kaji-san through thick and thin?
Nice to meet you.
This way.
Hey, take their bags to their new quarters.
I read your report on the supervision of colonial labor.
Lots of fancy words.
Please, ma'am.
The men here are plain speakers.
You'll be fundamentally incompatible.
- Thanks for the advice.
- What's so funny?
Sorry, but your own fancy words sound out of place.
Anyway, it's very well-written.
Touches the core of the matter.
Touches...
but doesn't quite grasp it.
Why?
If I knew, I'd write it myself.
I'll show your wife around.
You go see the boss.
Furuya, show him the way.
I know this is nothing new, sir, but our first shift requested 2,500 men.
Only 1,500 turned up this morning.
We can never meet our production goal that way.
We're at war, Okazaki.
We must expect such shortages.
You can't do your work unless all conditions are perfect?
I didn't mean that, but if Labor would do something -
MEETING IN PROGRESS
I'm Kaji.
I just arrived.
So you're Kaji?
I'll introduce you.
Mr. Higuchi, supervisor of Pit No. 2.
His foreman, Mr. Kawashima.
Mr. Koike, supervisor of Pit No. 1.
And his foreman, Mr. Okazaki.
The head office sent Mr. Kaji here as labor supervisor.
Pleased to meet you.
You're just in time.
Please sit down.
We're discussing labor problems.
Any good ideas?
I'd like to speak with Mr. Okishima first... and find out how many men are available.
If labor conditions are improved, all available men will report for work.
And in more concrete terms?
Our employment system must be radically revised.
The labor boss must be replaced by a direct employment system.
Ridiculous!
You'd be throttling the mines.
Right, Kawashima?
Why is that?
Because -
Kaji's the name, right?
Think about it.
We have 200 labor groups here.
You think a single one has no system of skimming or doesn't cheat on food rations?
I doubt it, but the matter under discussion is how to improve the work attendance rate.
Laborers lose the desire to work because labor conditions are basically no good.
Regardless of how things are "basically,"
workers aren't what you make them out to be in theory.
They squander any surplus in idleness or gambling or pour it into women's crotches.
We have a difference of opinion.
Mistreating the men won't yield good results.
You know, Kaji, theory may be correct and yet not always apply in reality.
Then either the theory was wrong or it was incorrectly applied.
Never mind.
Do what you think is right.
I respect revolutionary ideas.
Now, your work here won't just be a desk job.
It will cover all aspects of the men's lives.
Rationing food, disposing of excrement from 10,000 men, handling menstrual cases among the women.
The women?
We have comfort quarters for our men.
Okishima will show you.
There are about 60 Manchu women.
Starting today, you're their boss.
I'm relieved you're not a bachelor.
Go home now and do your duty by your wife - but don't overdo it, eh?
But why must our group be disbanded?
Poor yields.
You've been raking off too much.
Are you kidding?
What's this all about?
Shall I show you the evidence?
Why should the company make trouble over our contracts with the men?
The company's money is meant for the workers.
But Mr. Okazaki says our men work very hard.
Yes, but your rolls have been padded.
But Mr. Okazaki -
I'm not Mr. Okazaki!
Mr. Okishima, put in a good word for us.
We've been associates a long time.
And it's made me moldy.
Kaji's been scraping away the mold until I'm practically raw.
Mr. Supervisor, it's the poor living quarters and poor food that make our men sickly.
I know.
Bad quarters, poor food.
Men can't work on beans alone.
But there's a still greater evil.
You know what that is?
You men.
Now get this:
I give the men my word.
The food situation will definitely improve.
Better quarters will be considered.
But it's no use as long as you exploit them.
You lend money to transient laborers to bind them for life.
And that's not the worst.
You try to squeeze even more from your investment.
You hire slave-drivers to practically murder those who try to escape.
I won't allow such methods.
Allow them?
What do you mean?
You're just an employee yourself!
You have no right!
Won't allow it, eh?
Try and stop us!
Hey!
Any more threats and I'll kick your nuts in!
The gentlemen seem to be having a bad day.
We'll come back.
Mr. Muta.
I'm returning this.
Your other gifts have been returned to your home.
Sons of bitches left too peacefully.
They must be up to something.
Making a tour of inspection?
Much obliged.
Mr. Okishima, please see that we get the men we need.
I have to face the old man.
You'll get 'em.
Just don't kill 'em off too fast!
Son of a bitch!
What's going on?
The dog refused to work!
Beating him won't help.
They're not horses.
Get up, scum!
Beating them only lowers productivity.
I take orders from Okazaki... not you.
What goes on here doesn't concern Labor.
- So you'll keep beating them?
- That's right!
Fine.
Then tomorrow you'll have no men to beat.
What?
You're in the pit now.
You can't pull rank down here.
You men don't want to work?
Then don't!
But you needn't come back tomorrow.
Stay by the cozy fireplace in your barracks.
But remember:
You'll get no food!
Just getting home?
You want something?
Just one question.
Did you threaten to shut off our supply of labor?
Well?
Say something.
Can we talk about work in the morning?
In the morning?
I can see why you'd prefer that.
Can't have your loving wife seeing your weaknesses.
- Do I have any?
- Answer my question!
What have you got to be so proud of?
You may brutally beat your laborers, but it doesn't mean others will be intimidated.
I just warned your assistant.
Mr. Kaji, you know how important that ore is to us.
What's wrong with slapping a cheek or two if it keeps the ore coming out and helps the war effort?
What's more important:
The ore or the workers?
I don't think in those terms.
It's ridiculous to compare men with ore.
Take care of your men and the ore will come out.
Let me make it very clear that Okazaki of Loh Hu Liong won't be changed by any of your half-baked theories.
I'll stick to my own ways.
Remember that.
I will.
And I'll stick to my ways too.
Son of a...
KENPEITAI
- MILITARY POLICE
These gentlemen from the Kenpeitai are offering us 600 special laborers to achieve our goals.
Special laborers?
War prisoners from North China.
All you need do is keep them fed.
With the labor shortages, it's a heaven-sent blessing.
A stroke of good fortune.
Yes!
Our head office will certainly be pleased.
Kaji, discuss the matter with Okishima.
Discuss what exactly?
I'll tell you what.
I never repeat my instructions.
Got that?
First:
Special laborers must not mingle with ordinary laborers.
Second:
Their quarters must be enclosed by barbed wire... electrified barbed wire.
Understand?
You'll handle matters of food and labor, but they must not escape!
What voltage can you supply for the fence?
About 3,000 volts.
Good enough.
The laborers will be delivered one week from today.
The exact time will be specified later.
Understand?
We may not be ready in a week.
What?
You don't seem terribly grateful.
Kaji!
Why should civilians take over POWs -
Make preparations immediately!
Wait!
I haven't heard your answer.
We understand.
We'll be ready.
It could take an armed platoon to return safely with these men.
I want to be neither aggressive nor defensive with them.
You go on if you want.
Don't waste your heroism on me.
Someday you'll appreciate me.
Chen, how's your mother?
She says she's sick.
She lies in bed all day.
Sick, huh?
Take good care of her.
Mr. Kaji, I have a request.
May I have some flour from the storeroom?
For your mother?
I wish I could help, but I can't make any exceptions.
Here they come.
Chen, how do you feel about all this?
These are your fellow countrymen who lived in anti-Japanese areas.
Your mother's from Shantung.
Her friends might be among them.
My mother raised me not to be anti-Japanese.
In a battle zone, you'd be killed as a sympathizer.
The key!
We don't have it yet.
- You in charge from Loh Hu Liong?
- Yes.
- Your name?
- Kaji.
Oh, right.
I never forget a name.
Very well.
I hereby transfer the special laborers to you.
Never forget that these men are prisoners of war.
You must deal with them like a soldier.
Civilian negligence will not be tolerated.
You understand?
I do.
No, you don't!
You think your seven men can handle 600 prisoners?
What if they try to escape?
We received no special instructions about the transfer, so we anticipated no special danger.
You're a bold one.
How old are you?
I'm 28.
You married?
May I please have the key?
You don't back down.
I like that.
Will you witness the transfer?
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm now on leave.
You seem to believe that the army can make mistakes.
Don't worry.
When the army says 604, it's 604.
Submit a transfer receipt immediately.
Let those who die, die, but they must not escape!
Filthy bastard!
Get up!
What a mess to unload on us!
Open the other cars!
Out!
Everyone out!
Hurry up!
Everyone out!
Everyone out!
Line up!
Double file!
Mr. Kaji!
This is bad.
What is it?
Hurry!
Line up quickly!
They baked to death.
Help!
Don't let them eat all of a sudden!
Stop them!
If you gorge yourselves now, you'll die!
Kaji!
Get back!
Don't eat that!
Don't eat that!
Don't eat that!
Get back!
You'll all die!
Throw me the whip!
Kaji, the whip!
The special laborers are unfit for work.
Please give them a month's rest.
They're half dead.
These anti-Japanese elements should be fed without working?
If you'd witnessed the scene, I'm sure you'd agree, sir.
Twelve of them were allowed to bake to death.
If you want to kill them, stuff them with raw beans - they'll die for sure!
Listen here.
Be careful what you say.
What you're saying amounts to denouncing the military.
I'll defer to your opinion one last time.
- One last time?
- That's right.
One last time.
May I ask why?
You really want to know?
You're a man of strong convictions, but I just got a report from Furuya.
150 men under your supervision were just snatched away.
But I'll overlook the matter this once.
Everyone up!
I give you all warning.
I know you all want to escape.
But you cannot.
If you even try... you'll meet the same fate as this dog.
Chen, show them.
Tomorrow begins a month of still higher production goals.
The directors have even discussed replacing all the top men here.
I'll accept this disgrace if we cannot increase production.
However, we have not yet done our utmost.
Until we attain the 20% increase demanded of us,
I will extend the higher production goal every month.
If there are dissenting opinions, air them now.
In the name of final victory,
I refuse to listen to any excuses hereafter.
Mr. Koike, tell him we'll see it through.
I, Okazaki, vow that Pit No. 1 will achieve the new goal.
I'm sure you'll permit me to use any means necessary.
Use all means available.
Increased production is the main thing.
Listen here:
Lash them on with all you've got.
If any Chinaman balks, kill the scum!
Push them!
Whip them!
We need that extra 20%.
Those of you who top your quota will be amply rewarded.
Remember:
We're at war here.
If anyone feels he can't do this, let him step forward!
Good.
I have your word.
I'll assume all responsibility.
Don't worry... and do your best!
You will start work tomorrow.
Your rations will be sorghum wine and soy pulp, same as the regular laborers.
You don't smoke?
I used to.
You stopped?
When we run out of tobacco, we suffer again.
The Japanese won't keep us supplied.
We restored your health, yet you still hate us?
We are not soldiers.
We have the right to be released.
I don't have the authority to release you, only to detain you.
Master, when we be free?
We all not soldier.
We don't fight.
Japan soldiers come...
do bad things to Chinese women.
Take away all men... bring here.
Nothing to eat... many die.
Not die... killed.
I can't set you free, but I can promise that you will not be killed.
The Japanese say pretty words... and write pretty words... but never keep their promises!
Your name was Kao?
Remember this:
You've been placed under our supervision.
Whether that barbed wire stays up or not depends on you.
Faster!
Move it!
Step along there!
Come on!
Move!
You'll be in trouble if any men escape, won't you?
Why should they escape?
They used to work in their own villages.
Why would they want to work here?
Here they have no mother, no wife, no children.
Kaji, why are so many special laborers left in camp?
They're the sick ones.
Make sure they're not just malingerers.
I didn't come to find fault.
I'd like to see their camp.
Certainly.
No danger of escape?
I don't think so.
We must give them some incentive to work.
I think so too.
What does a man in a cage dream of most?
Freedom, I suppose.
Freedom?
You must be a poet!
It's women.
Men dream of women.
Women dream of men.
What did you dream of as a bachelor?
The ways of the empire?
I doubt it.
The way to make caged men work is to satisfy 70% of their bodily lust.
With what women?
It's very simple.
You're in charge of the comfort women.
Send them in here.
Is that necessary?
Do you want a woman?
See that?
Just the word brings joy to their hearts.
What is a man?
Not poetry or morality.
He's a mass of lust and greed that absorbs and excretes.
I'll ask their leaders' opinion.
Who gives you orders?
POWs or me?
I'm more concerned about escapes than you are.
Carry out my orders.
Stop loafing!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Son of a bitch!
Get up!
You dog!
Master!
This man sick!
He maybe die.
Have mercy... he sick man!
Save your whining for Kaji.
I don't care if I kill a few of you dogs.
Here he comes!
Ah, Kaji-san!
No want to see?
Sister Jin!
Mr. Kaji... welcome!
Mr. Kaji, wanna have some fun?
I won't charge you.
I'm sorry... but I need 30 girls for the special laborers.
The Labor Office will pay.
They go inside barbed wire?
Just like dogs... sleep together...
everybody watch?
If you don't wish to, just say so.
You don't, do you?
We no have choice.
It's our job.
I send 30 girls tomorrow.
Don't be crazy!
We can't work with everyone watching.
Know how many men are in that compound?
If you don't wish to go.
Then don't.
Even if the others go, I refuse.
Think you can get out of working?
What do you mean?
I was speaking for all of you.
You talk real big.
If you want to go, then go.
Don't act so big!
What about you?
Stop arguing.
You don't make the decisions here.
I'll decide what to do.
Thirty girls will go tonight.
All right?
Yes, please do that.
- What happened?
- The foreman let him have it.
- Where?
- Pit No. 3.
Okazaki!
Get him to first aid quickly.
If this is ignored, supervision will be impossible!
I'll charge Okazaki with manslaughter.
Come now!
Relax!
It wasn't wise to use force, but he was only following orders to increase production.
So he actually acted out of patriotism.
Listen here.
Okazaki may be a brute, but his brutality lets him run that large pit.
We need him just like we need you and Okishima to keep our 10,000 men in line.
Understand?
We're at war.
To achieve the greater goal, we must overlook the small mistakes.
Small mistakes?
A human being was murdered!
Kaji, I'll tell you just once more:
Calm down!
Think it over.
I'm sure you'll see.
Can we exchange a good, hard-working Japanese man for the life of one mere prisoner?
That's not the point.
If you insist on pressing charges, include me as an accomplice.
I'll see that the suit goes unfavorably for you.
I can do it, you know.
You'd dare distort the truth?
Sir, will you see that this never happens again?
How should we report it?
As an accidental death.
Say he fell off a ledge.
It does happen, you know.
Sir!
You think I'll falsify the report?
What else can we do?
- Well, I won't!
- Yes, you will!
Then I become Okazaki's accomplice.
What will you do?
I'll get Okazaki!
You fool!
Why play the hero?
Fight so hard and you'll just run out of steam.
You're a fool to ruin your future with his.
Mr. Kaji.
One of our men was mistreated.
What became of him?
He died.
I assume the culprit was arrested.
- He's still working.
- Will there be no trial?
I suppose not.
If that's why you're here, come inside and explain to all of us.
No, I came to wait for some women.
You promised not to kill!
You're like all the other Japanese!
If you treat me like a murderer just because I'm Japanese, you'll be losing the only friend you have.
Friend?
You don't have to believe me!
Wait.
Does this man's death mean others may also die?
I won't allow it.
Women!
Women!
Women!
Open the gate.
Let the women in.
Ten girls to a barrack.
Have them out by 10:00.
Look!
Women!
I'm coming!
Women!
We're here, just like I promised.
Why do you send us women?
Think as you please.
I'm just obeying orders.
You send whores to sleep with us like dogs so we'll work harder?
Is that it?
What's that about whores?
I wouldn't talk so big!
You wouldn't understand!
Oh, I understand.
You're no better off than us.
Look at your friends over there.
Have you no shame?
You think I like coming here?
I told him I refused!
Aren't you the same, beaten down by the Japanese every day?
Then why so cocky?
You love it here so much?
I'm sorry.
We all suffer the same misfortune.
Welcome home!
You must be tired.
Look at this!
Isn't it wonderful?
Her first egg!
She cackled so loud I thought a dog had gotten inside.
But right there was this great big egg!
What is it?
Are you in a bad mood?
No, it's nothing.
It's like you hate coming home.
Is something wrong?
Why won't you tell me about it?
Would you want a husband who runs a whorehouse?
What does that mean?
You'd vomit if I told you!
What happens to 30 women in a camp of 600 men?
And now I'm an accomplice to murder too.
That can't be.
The workers don't believe a word I say.
With time you'll gain their trust.
Could you just be quiet for a while?
It's a shame.
What is?
Since those prisoners came, you seem so far away.
I guess I do.
I hate feeling like I'm fighting a Ione battle.
You leave early every morning and return late at night.
During that time, you work.
Meanwhile, I clean the house, putter around the kitchen, and do the shopping... but it's like doing nothing.
Still I try to convince myself that the little things I do help keep you going.
Otherwise, there's no difference between a housewife and a housekeeper.
I'm sorry.
Forgive me.
I'll letting my work get the best of me.
Let's stop worrying about it... just for now.
It was nice talking to you.
Locked up in here, we lose touch with the outside world.
Thank you.
Don't you want to have a good time?
I came here for business.
I'm sorry to take your time.
I just wanted to talk.
You plan to escape, don't you?
It's impossible with all that barbed wire.
It's charged with electricity, that's all.
It's men who run the electricity through it.
Don't talk like that.
Human beings are weak creatures.
Go where you're told to go.
Do what you're told to do.
That's the only way to survive.
You're wrong.
Man can become as strong as he wishes.
He need only find the cause of his unhappiness.
Want to make some easy money?
You mean selling my girls elsewhere?
I don't go for that kind of deal.
This isn't about women.
Laborers?
I have something else in mind this time.
You mean behind the barbed wire?
Too dangerous.
If anything goes wrong, it's my neck.
It's not like the others.
Escaped prisoners mean big profit.
Help make arrangements and I'll split it with you.
It's easy money.
What kind of arrangements?
The easiest way... is like this.
You just flick off the electric switch.
Did someone put you up to this?
My buddy Muta, the Japanese assistant who was just fired.
How sad, selling men like that.
Don't expect any sympathy from me.
I'm just a Korean.
The Japanese and Chinese both look down on me.
Hurry it up!
Mr. Wang!
I just heard the Japanese say that the Italians have surrendered.
Defeat for Germany can't be far off.
Our time is coming.
When?
Six months, maybe a year.
We must be patient.
What's going on there?
You scum!
Thank you.
This'll really invigorate my man and the young folk.
If Okazaki gets any more invigorated, ma'am, you'll be in trouble.
Didn't you know?
We women prefer our men that way.
Ma'am, I'm sure you've seen to everything, but it might be wise to send some of that flour to Kaji's wife.
A very good idea!
I'll do just that.
Your food.
Good day, sir.
Ah, it's you.
You want dumplings?
Can you loan me a bag of white flour?
I'd like to make my mother happy.
She hasn't long to live.
One bag?
Why don't you go get some yourself?
The Japanese steal the flour they ration to us... and eat their fill.
I can't do that.
But Mr. Kaji trusts you.
This flour was stolen from the warehouse by the warehouse guard with the big mole.
It's stolen property.
You still want to buy some of it?
Let him have half a bag.
No, I won't.
Young man, don't forget you were born of a Chinese mother, of Chinese seed.
Go ask the man with the big mole!
Try not to be so obvious.
About what?
Okazaki's wife just left here with a big sack.
I hate to interfere, but you're making a mistake.
People around here appreciate my mistakes.
It's an old custom.
Well, it's one that should be abolished.
Unpleasant as it may seem, that's my job.
If it happens again, I'll have to order an inventory.
Mr. Kaji... the men in the pits wonder if you're one of us or just a puppet of the Chinese.
And?
That's all.
But I do think your acute sense of justice is inflamed by the fact that you can't take some extra flour to your own wife.
Take your filthy feet off your desk when speaking to me!
Or do you need my help?
You fool!
They'll see your light!
Go easy tonight.
Hurry!
It's the night watchman!
What's taking so long?
Get going!
I like you a lot.
You did very well for your first time.
You'll do it for me, won't you, Chen?
Talk to Sai at the power station.
Just have him shut off the current for three minutes.
I'll see that you're well-rewarded.
Then you can buy all the flour you want without playing the thief.
Still can't make up your mind?
Hey, Big Mole!
Well, Chen, how'd it go?
Did you get a good price?
Or did you eat it yourself?
Free white flour must taste good.
What's going on, Matsuda?
What indeed.
Seems even saints have thieves for underlings.
Flour thieves.
Mr. Kaji...
I'm willing to overlook it this time.
But just for future reference, I'd like to see how you handle this.
Chen, stand up.
Look at me.
You didn't do it, did you?
I did.
Alone?
Matsuda, I hope you're satisfied now.
Now get out before I expose all your dirty doings!
Chen, what's the matter?
I stole something... and Mr. Kaji struck me.
Kaji struck you?
But no matter.
Mr. Kaji is Japanese, and I'm Chinese.
It's that simple!
Sister Jin is busy now.
I think he's Korean.
Korean?
Hi, cutie.
Get in a fight?
Yang, let me use your room awhile.
What's wrong?
I don't understand it myself.
Foolish girl, acting like an amateur in love for the first time.
I can't seem to forget Kao.
Love at first sight...
with a man behind barbed wire.
Why not use your room?
It's such a mess.
Why do you ask?
The Japanese are all the same.
They don't consider us human beings.
Chen... go to the power station and work it out with your friend.
I'm not Korean.
I won't betray my friend for money.
I know that.
You're a good man.
But those men in there are prisoners.
The Japanese will exploit them and then kill them.
Can they really be saved?
Of course.
But the only one who can do it... is you.
This can wait, Chen.
First go do as I ask.
I understand.
I'm Chinese too.
I'm ready to do my part.
At exactly 1:00 a.m.
When the siren sounds, I'll cut the current.
But only for two minutes.
That's the best I can do.
Two minutes?
Watch out!
That's 3,300 volts!
Be careful.
Don't let them see you.
Sai!
Go now, and don't let them see you.
My regards to our brothers behind barbed wire.
They're in love.
This isn't business.
In that case, we don't pay.
Stop kidding around.
A prisoner and a prostitute in love - it's like a novel.
But what will come of it?
Nothing can come of it while there's a war going on.
They have their love today.
That's all.
Can't you let them marry?
I would if I could.
I'm sure you'd want to help them.
I do, but it ends right there.
Have some.
They're delicious.
What are they?
A rare treat.
They were given to us.
By whom?
Try and guess.
Mrs. Okazaki.
Send them back!
But...
I can't send them back now.
Return them!
Tell her I was furious.
But why?
Why?
Why do you glare at me like that?
She wanted to make up for earlier.
The murderer stole that flour!
It's time you showed more sense.
Can't you understand my position and what I'm trying to do at this mine?
No, I can't.
How could I, when you never tell me anything?
Of course, even I can guess where the flour and sugar came from.
But women can't always live by unbending rules.
I didn't accept them for myself.
So you accepted them for me?
I don't need that kind of thoughtfulness.
Because it was the Okazakis?
What if it had been Mrs. Okishima?
I'd still refuse.
Yes, you're just the kind who would!
You struck Chen, didn't you?
I know you didn't want to, yet you did.
Why?
Because he did something wrong?
That's not why.
You could have forgiven him for such a minor matter.
It was because you lost face in front of others.
For a man who aspires to great things, you have a small mind!
You wouldn't understand.
But I do!
I know what people think of you.
It's reached my ears too.
What do they think?
That you try to look better than everyone else.
I didn't believe them.
I thought it was just spite, but now -
- Think what you want!
- Where are you going?
I've kept 30 women waiting.
Marriage?
Impossible!
We can marry after the war is over.
Is the war going to end?
It won't be much longer.
But they'll take you away again.
No, Chun Lan.
It will end in victory for China.
We'll be free.
I...
I can only hope that things stay as they are.
Why, Chun Lan?
When that day comes, I'll never see you again.
But I'm asking you to marry me.
There are plans to escape from here, but I will not run away as long as you're here.
You won't run away?
You promise?
I'm sorry.
I went too far.
You brute!
I'm thinking of letting those two get married.
Hello.
What?
Escaped?
I'll be right there!
- How many?
Eleven men!
I won't bother asking for information.
We'll soon know who planned the break.
I won't ask for details.
But you must understand one thing.
We've tried our best to help you.
If you cannot trust us, and if you continue to try to escape,
those who remain behind will face reprisals and even more hard labor.
And I will not raise a finger to protect you.
You think we can't bring you before a firing squad.
But if Kaji and I decide to, we can always pack you into those freight cars and send you back to the army!
They acted on their own.
We only serve as liaisons for the prisoners.
We couldn't stop them even if we knew of their plot.
I see through your lies!
What if I said that Wang Heng Li plotted this break?
It no lie... we don't know.
I no run away.
You fools!
You think we'd take your word for it?
Why don't you all run off somewhere!
I will not run.
I'll walk out of here with dignity.
And just where will you go?
Don't think all Japanese are as forgiving as me.
If you want to die, just try to escape.
Wang, the safety of your men depends on all of you.
I'm the one who has to answer to the Kenpeitai - not you!
Investigate the situation and take adequate measures.
Oh, and think up a good story for the Kenpeitai.
Where's Kaji?
You stood by while those men escaped?
We didn't stand by.
So you took all precautionary measures?
Let me remind you once more:
Those prisoners are spoils of war, obtained at great sacrifice.
You allowed them to damage the prestige of our Imperial Forces.
I demand an explanation.
- I have none.
The only explanation is their desire to escape.
Why did you stand by and let them?
Answer me!
I can hear you.
You don't have to shout.
We have 10,000 other laborers here, but these special prisoners have taken all our attention.
No matter what, they'll manage to escape.
What are we supposed to do?
One question!
Go ahead.
We reported the truth.
I could have reported them dead and avoided trouble.
Does the Kenpeitai not want the truth?
I acknowledge your honesty.
But shortage of personnel is not an acceptable excuse.
Though your negligence is inexcusable,
I shall overlook it just this once.
No more men must escape.
Tell them that if they do, I will personally kill their leader.
Understand?
I understand.
How about it?
Want me to scare them a little?
That won't be necessary.
You must be quite sure of yourself to refuse aid from the military.
Very well.
I'll hold you personally responsible from now on.
I never go back on my word.
- I understand.
And you?
Do you understand?
I understand.
That will be all.
No!
Wait!
Wait!
Let me go!
- Don't take it out on the men.
- What about you?
You lost your temper and struck Chen, and now you lecture me?
Don't pull your humanism on me.
I struck Chen, and I regret it.
But should you do the same?
Don't let your feelings ruin my work.
Your work?
Yes, my work.
You've kept in step so far, but now you're going your own way.
Can't you see?
Force has meaning only when overcoming tyranny.
I know that.
I've had enough of your lectures.
You intend to let them do as they wish?
I'll talk to them.
I won't mince words.
I don't want your men trying to escape.
As far as you men are concerned,
I am your friendliest enemy.
I pride myself on supervising you without hostility.
Despite the conflicts of interest that result from our being at war,
I've tried to protect your interests.
What you say is difficult.
I see.
Eat your fill.
We can talk at our leisure.
When one of your comrades was killed, we didn't take adequate measures to protect you.
Therefore you no longer trust us.
That's only natural.
However...
I shall do my utmost to correct this mistake.
It may take time... but I hope you'll trust me and be patient.
No one wants to risk the danger of escaping.
Let me speak for my friend Kaji.
Since he arrived here, the regular laborers' conditions have greatly improved.
This also applies to you.
However, if there's another escape,
I cannot say what the Kenpeitai might do.
I don't know how Kaji feels, but the only way to save my own neck is to send you back to the Kenpeitai.
It's true what he says.
We can reach an understanding by talking.
How about you, Kao?
If you can marry Yang Chun Lan, will you stay until the war ends?
I don't like propositions that start... with the word "if."
Can't you understand?
We're talking things over.
Bootlicker!
It's the same old Japanese trick.
They always promise to do this and do that... but they never keep their word.
Stand up!
You dog!
You wouldn't understand what men say.
Go to Yang Chun Lan and learn the ways of human beings!
By the way, Wang, if I -
There's the "if" again.
If I gain the freedom for you enjoyed by the regular laborers, will you trust me?
To wait seems to be the only safe liberty.
You promise?
Wang, you must trust me.
I wonder if they trust me.
You want to believe they do, don't you?
I want to believe Wang when he says he'll wait.
You plan to continue sending the women inside.
Why?
Just a hunch.
I also plan to take 50 of them for outside labor.
- Under armed guard?
- No, just by myself.
These strange hunches aren't like you.
Why not be honest?
- About what?
You'd let them escape if you could.
That's nonsense.
When that happens, I stand to lose my neck.
Remember that.
On days they come out here, they seem happy.
Is your mother still ill?
I suppose she still longs for some white flour.
She's given up hope.
I'm sorry I struck you that day.
I'm hardheaded in some ways, I know.
It's all right.
Is Sai at the power station a friend of yours?
Somebody shut off the current.
Sai was on duty that night.
If he did it, tell him not to do it again.
Well, back to work.
They could escape whenever they want.
Maybe they're starting to trust you.
No, they're just wary of a trap.
Then you'll stop taking them out?
No, I'll keep doing it.
Isn't it dangerous?
They might kill you and escape.
I doubt that.
This bath feels good.
Why don't you come in?
I think I will.
If the workers settle down, let's go into town on vacation.
Let's do it!
How many days can you take off?
Three at the most.
That would be wonderful!
Well, if they really settle down...
Someday you'll be a great supervisor, but by then our youth will have vanished.
That's not for me.
I'll take that vacation.
You're probably right.
Please do, all right?
I will.
See to it, Cho.
We need a break in that barbed wire.
Kaji will be off on a three-day leave.
Okishima will be busy.
We'll do it then.
Releasing prisoners is more profitable, but more dangerous too.
With things going smoothly, Kaji has let down his guard... but watch out for Okishima.
The timing is ideal.
Let's pull another fast one and then make ourselves scarce.
That's right.
Getting away clean is the important thing.
Is Jin Tung Fu in?
She's in bed with the cute boy.
How about you?
There's a problem.
Chen won't help anymore.
Won't help?
Once is as bad as 100 times.
He doesn't want that risk with you and me.
But he'll risk sleeping with you.
He wants me to break away too.
Has that dog squealed on us?
- He'd never do that.
- You never know.
Don't let him spend the night.
Send him home.
Jin Tung Fu is some woman, eh?
How was it?
I hear Kaji will be away starting Saturday.
Have the power cut off while he's gone.
Sai isn't on duty those nights.
Then when is he?
Friday night.
Then make it Friday night.
He can't!
They already suspect him!
Who does?
Mr. Kaji.
What can he do without evidence?
Listen carefully, punk.
Play it straight and I'll fix it so Jin Tung Fu will be yours alone.
You little scum!
You'll do it, won't you?
Be a good boy.
If you refuse, you and Sai will die.

PART 2
I feel wonderful!
We arrived in a whirl of dust, but it's so nice today.
Worried about work?
- No.
Just wondering why I didn't do this before.
- Really?
- I mean it.
I'll phone Yasuko first thing and tell her to take the day off.
Would you mind?
And then what?
We'll have lunch together and then go to the apple orchard.
It's so wonderful!
I feel as light as a balloon!
Allow me just one thing.
What?
Let me go for just one hour?
What for?
With our increased production, I'd like to talk to the main office about treating the special laborers like the ordinary laborers.
Just one hour?
- The rest of my time is all yours.
- All right.
I'll give you two hours, but not a minute more.
Mr. Kaji!
- They broke out again.
- What?
Where's Okishima?
- At their camp.
All right.
I'll be right there.
I don't want you to go.
I have no choice.
You go have a good time with Yasuko.
Yasuko isn't you.
- But this is my job...
- I don't care!
You're officially on vacation.
They can't make you go back.
Leave it to Okishima.
I'll wait till after lunch, okay?
I'll never finish by then.
You just don't want to go.
Don't be foolish!
Your work's important, but don't you see how important this is for us?
I'll make up for it next time.
You needn't bother!
Why so angry over such a small thing?
Such a small thing?
You don't seem to care how I feel.
At any rate, I can't just leave now.
I see.
Then I'll go on alone.
Stop it!
From now on, I do things my way!
- And ruin everything?
- They'll understand my fist!
Hitting them won't bring back the others!
Do you realize how many got away?
Eighteen men, led by Hwang and Sung!
Still think words will help?
- I'll assume all responsibility.
- You fool!
If you don't like my methods, you can quit.
You won't be dragged before the Kenpeitai.
Fine!
Wang!
Stand up!
I've given up on all of you.
You said you'd wait.
You might think I'm a fool, but even a fool has limits!
Another escape and you'll all go without food for three days.
I'll turn your men against you and break your authority in this camp!
You Japanese are all the same!
Fine!
Then I'll act accordingly.
All promises are hereby retracted.
Now I realize there can be no trust between us.
Mr. Okishima!
How will you report this to the Kenpeitai?
They won't let us off easy this time.
- I won't report the incident.
- What?
If it leaks out, I'll assume all responsibility.
I don't think it was all your responsibility.
You think someone shut off the power?
I couldn't say.
Shall I put only Japanese on night duty there?
You can't do that without evidence.
Shall I increase the night watch around the fence?
I'd have to check that they're at their posts.
Eighteen men...
that's a big loss!
I've achieved the 20% increase in production.
I don't want trouble now over something like this.
I forgot:
Okishima is hereby relieved of all responsibility for the special prisoners.
I don't know!
Damned Chinaman!
Son of a bitch!
Tell me!
Who paid you?
Okishima favors drastic measures, but Kaji always stops him.
Meaning he gives tacit consent to the runaways?
I wouldn't say that, but it does all seem rather suspicious.
There is one way to teach them a lesson.
How?
We let them plan another break and then foil them.
With your permission, I'd like to try.
Sounds intriguing.
I'll try anything that brings results.
Give it a try.
Boss's orders.
We're distributing flour and oil.
Only to the Japanese, of course.
I'm sure you don't approve.
I do not.
Unfortunately, you're not the manager.
I'm sure you're happy I'm not.
Mr. Kaji, it's Mr. Okishima!
Filthy scum!
Son of a bitch!
Kill the rat!
Let him have it!
Mr. Okishima, let us handle that Korean dog!
Stay out of this!
Filthy dog!
Swipe men from under my nose, eh?
Bastard!
Not stopping me today?
You want me to?
Don't look so disapproving.
Should I go easy on the regular workers too?
Your clumsy humanism kills good men and lets scoundrels run wild.
Chen, take him to the medical ward.
Do no such thing!
His boss will pick him up.
Take him!
Go call Furuya.
Don't worry, young one.
I won't talk.
Chen, it seems I know more about you than you do about me.
Go back and tell Kaji his wounds aren't serious.
It's better if Kaji doesn't come around here.
Well?
How is he?
He seems all right.
Mr. Furuya is with him.
Furuya?
Furuya, send a telegram to Muta.
That rat Okishima!
He says he's going to sue Okishima.
Help him arrange it.
You two seem friendly enough.
Don't bother explaining!
Think I'm that stupid?
Was it the money?
Or just to make trouble for me?
Don't worry.
I won't tell the boss.
See that your buddy is hospitalized.
But you're paying for him...
not Labor!
You probably made plenty.
Where you been hidin'
What's wrong with you?
Drunk, I see.
Think I got drunk and came to make trouble?
I had a drink with the boss, but I'm not drunk.
I have some hot news.
They're issuing commendations for the increased production.
Okazaki will surely be included.
I told the boss you were the only one in Labor who deserved a commendation.
The boss felt the same way, but he feared that this old-timer might feel slighted.
You don't think I'd feel slighted, do you?
Why have you suddenly turned to brute force?
The boss asked the same thing.
I was born a brute...
good enough?
How long do you plan to keep on like this?
Meaning what?
Straddling a fundamental contradiction and trying to justify it.
I'm out of breath.
If I'm being a nuisance, just say so and I'll back off.
Kao!
Chun Lan!
I was afraid you might have escaped.
That's all I could buy today.
Thank you.
Thank you!
We can't meet for the time being.
We can't come here.
If you run off by yourself...
I'll kill myself.
I'll take you with me when I escape.
When?
After I learn how the others have fared.
I can't take any chances if I take you along.
Stay here.
They might let us marry.
Don't believe them!
Wang says the war will end soon.
Japan will be defeated.
Now that I have you...
I'm willing to bear anything.
Kao!
I wish we could meet like this every night.
But if they start suspecting us... then it's all over.
This cursed wire!
Careful!
Why do the gods torment us like this?
Chun Lan...
I love you!
And I love you!
Can't you sleep?
Kaji would have been happier married to a girl like you.
You're too much the wife, Michi.
You're forgetting to be a woman.
What do you mean?
Being a wife is a kind of profession, but it's the woman that men love.
When you typed Kaji's reports, you studied them like one possessed.
I never understood a word.
And now?
Do you ask him about his work?
He doesn't like me asking questions.
If I were you, I'd pester him until he told me everything.
Then I'd ask even more questions.
What's wrong?
Did I go too far?
I'm sorry about yesterday.
I failed as a wife and as a woman.
I couldn't sleep.
This is your home.
You can sleep soundly here.
Promise you'll share both your joys and sorrows with me.
Sorrow for one is enough.
It's not!
I'm walking down the same path you are.
It's okay if I lose my way.
Just tell me we might get lost and take me along.
I'll follow you... and do my best to keep up.
I understand.
If I don't walk fast enough, will you wait just a tiny bit for me?
Just a very tiny bit?
Of course.
I'll never ask you the same question twice.
"Through fitting leadership in the pit, you have helped achieve a 20% increase in ore production.
At this hour of dire national emergency, you've rendered a valuable service to our armed forces and set a fitting example for other employees.
You are hereby officially commended.
September 23, 1943.
Chairman of the board Jushiro Kitada.
Read in proxy by Junichi Kuroki."
Looks like we'll have rain.
Rainy nights are ideal for escape attempts.
When you deliver their dinner, tell them arrangements have been made.
They can break out tonight.
Tonight?
Then go to the power station and tell them Kaji says to cut the power.
But Mr. Kaji would never...
I'm acting under direct orders from the boss.
You want me to tell the Kenpeitai about you?
About how you and Jin Tung Fu aided the plotters, and how Kaji knew but pretended not to see?
It's the only way to save your neck.
As ships at sea part the great white waves
So do I part my loved one's thighs
Mr. Kaji, I look forward to your continued favor.
You're young, but you're quite a fellow!
No, a great fellow!
The day you arrived it was snowing...
No, it was windy.
Really?
Windy?
That day I thought a young squirt like you could never handle this mine.
But things really did work out as you said.
You're really something!
But Mr. Kaji...
I've been watching.
You haven't been drinking.
Give me a hand?
If you want to try, tonight is your last chance.
Why the sudden rush?
If the timing's no good, just forget it.
But my friend's being moved to the day shift tomorrow.
You sure about this?
On behalf of the men in the pit and in the spirit of friendship,
I challenge Mr. Kaji to a friendly drinking bout.
Hear!
Hear!
I concede defeat.
No, you can't!
We haven't even started yet!
No, I really do.
Mr. Kaji... do you only show spirit when you're snarling at me?
Come on.
Be a man!
All right!
I'm ready!
Use this.
Get drunk and let down your guard for once.
That's right!
Okay, let's begin.
Show 'em, Mr. Kaji!
- That's the way!
- More!
Those boys in Labor are used to being wined and dined by the bosses.
They get the women too!
They run the whorehouse and have their pick.
So we're wined and dined, eh?
And the whores are ours for the taking?
Fine!
Bring on your wine and women!
I'll take 'em on!
Chen.
All done delivering their meals?
This is a special ration ticket for Japanese only.
You're welcome to mine.
- But your wife...
- She's given up hope.
Mr. Kaji.
No, nothing.
I just wanted to say thank you.
It's me who should thank you.
I was afraid you wouldn't accept it now.
There's a nice ass!
Hey, lady-killer!
Tops in Japan!
Back off!
Still in heat at your age?
What if I am?
Go sow your seed in your own rice paddies!
I wouldn't act so big, Okishima.
If you and Kaji would mind your own business,
I could have topped our production goal long ago.
And you'd have 10 murders on your record now.
You'd be having dinner in jail!
Bastard!
If you want trouble, come on.
Chen, what's the matter?
What should I do?
I won't be able to see you again.
I've fallen into a trap!
Go to the station and have him cut off the power.
If I do that... and the men are captured... they'll kill me!
This is a Japanese plot.
No matter what happens, you won't be killed.
You speak as if this didn't concern you.
If I'm caught, I might confess everything.
Don't threaten me.
You dragged me into this!
- Where are you going?
- To warn them.
You'll never get word to them.
I can try.
Wait!
I have a better idea.
Chun Lan.
Kao is breaking out tonight.
Kao is breaking out?
Go tell him it's too dangerous.
I won't let him escape alone!
Drink.
It'll relax you.
I couldn't contact him.
Are you sure he plans to escape?
You met no one?
With this downpour, I couldn't see a thing.
Not a soul?
Is he really breaking out?
What'll we do now?
If he runs off by himself...
I'll kill myself!
The power must be cut off!
We mustn't anger the Japanese.
What should we do?
The best way is to confess the whole thing to Mr. Kaji.
No!
He's the worst of them all!
Where are you going?
Go to the power station!
You little punk!
I expected as much.
Did you do as I told you?
Yes.
You didn't mention the matter to Kaji, did you?
No.
We'll find out in a moment... whether you did as ordered.
If you betrayed us, it's a bullet in your head.
We'll report that we caught you helping the men escape.
It'll even mean a reward.
They're coming!
Mr. Furuya.
The power...
I didn't...
What?
Son of a bitch!
Bastard!
You want to die?
I never dreamt that Chen might plot something like this.
I've been blind.
Furuya!
Blind because I never thought you capable of such a diabolical plot!
Go brag to the boss of your brave deed!
Wang!
You're not always right either.
Your failed leadership caused this.
You refused to trust us.
The result is charred human flesh.
It serves you right!
Kao!
Why did you do it?
It was so foolish!
Kao!
You're alive!
You're alive!
Chun Lan!
Look at the man whose mistake killed his own friends!
Okishima came to tell me about it.
Why didn't Chen come to me?
He was probably afraid to.
Because I hit him?
Okishima told me you'd take it really hard.
It's not my fault that I'm Japanese... yet it's my worst crime that I am!
Chen was kind to you even though I struck him.
He understood how I felt.
Yet look what happened.
That son a bitch Furuya!
The boss put him up to this.
They'll never meddle in Labor affairs again!
Let's go home.
Some nice hot soup will help you feel better.
Yes, let's.
Let's go home.
I wish you'd ask the main office about getting the Kenpeitai to let us treat these prisoners like ordinary laborers.
But I know I asked you to stay out of my affairs.
Don't worry.
I'll do it.
My trip will cool us both off.
It'll be my present to you.
Seems the boss considers Okazaki more indispensable than me.
I'm boarding this run-down truck, but you're trying to catch the train of humanism before it's too late.
I won't stop you.
You seem willing to pay the fare, no matter how high.
Am I making trouble by coming here?
I already offered my apologies.
Leave us alone.
From now on, we'll have to escape from the work areas.
Wang wants us to lie low for a while.
And there's been no news from the others.
What's going on here?
Run!
Bastards!
You dare resist?
Get back here!
Come back!
Escape attempt!
Escape attempt!
How about it?
They're offering us 500 more prisoners.
We lack accommodations.
Accommodations?
Don't you mean supervision?
We just caught seven prisoners trying to escape!
You caught them?
Good work!
- Did they resist?
- The bastards almost got away.
- From the pit?
- The ore dump.
That's strange.
You were eating Chinese food here.
How would you know?
How could they escape in broad daylight?
Look at this.
Only desperate men would throw ore at me.
That makes it a break?
I'm not the only witness.
It took 15 men to capture them.
Inside the compound?
Running inside the compound is a break?
- Why do you defend the chinks?
- I'll investigate this.
You needn't bother!
- Where are they?
- The guard house.
Good.
Captain, what are your instructions?
Well, let's see.
Shall we try the method you've been suggesting?
He's a master swordsman.
How many men did you slay in China?
Wait!
How can you be sure it was a break?
Silence!
We have a witness.
Any more objections?
Yes!
An impassioned witness can't be trusted.
All those men want to escape.
Would you execute them all?
- Why you...
- Enough!
Whether it was or wasn't an escape attempt isn't the point.
All that matters is that we say it was!
Arguments will not be tolerated.
Sergeant!
They're to be executed tomorrow.
You decide how.
They will be executed tomorrow, sir!
I assume you approve.
You shall officially witness the execution!
You'll save seven men's lives if you testify they weren't trying to escape.
They were trying to escape.
They ran.
They should have stayed and taken their beating.
What's going to happen to us?
If injuring Okazaki was a crime, why not just investigate me?
Listen to me.
You're all guilty of attempted escape.
- Lies!
- You're wronging the innocent!
Quiet!
Dog!
An investigation will reveal the truth.
Investigate it!
Immediately!
The investigation is over.
But I don't believe you tried to escape.
You're turning us over to the Kenpeitai?
I don't intend to.
But you never had faith in me before.
Perhaps it's best to doubt me now as well.
Those men have all the power!
I have none!
I'll do everything I can until tomorrow evening.
Sir, if you ask them, the Kenpeitai will listen to reason.
This is an object lesson, Kaji.
Personally I don't approve, but the head office says to leave it to the Kenpeitai.
Why?
Must there be a reason?
Please wait!
You're about to chop off men's heads!
If the company protested strongly...
This is wartime.
Peacetime reasoning doesn't apply.
That's no reason!
You may not think so, but I do.
You're wasting your breath.
If you're not satisfied, speak to the head office.
I will!
There's no answer.
He's in a conference.
Shouting like a madman!
Hello?
One moment, please.
Someone else will take your call.
Okishima?
We're in real trouble.
You've heard?
Hello?
Hello?
I can't hear you!
Speak louder!
I can't hear you at all.
What's that?
Give up?
That's ridiculous!
Okishima, please talk to them again.
Please try again.
I'll be waiting.
I'll be honest.
There's only one chance in a hundred.
This does not concern us alone.
Just as my companions stand between life and death, so do you now stand at an important crossroads.
You're right.
If you fail now, no one will ever trust you again, and you too will lose faith in yourself.
It's true.
Yet you would do nothing?
What can I do?
Must a man outside this barbed wire ask me such a question?
Not all the Japanese working here are murderous devils.
Their combined opinion objecting to this execution will be more effective than one individual alone.
If I'd always acted as you wanted me to, there'd be no Kaji here today.
I'd like to see what you'd do in my position.
You and I will both make minor mistakes.
Such things can be forgiven.
But an error made at a crucial moment is an unforgivable crime.
Your life has been a series of errors stemming from the conflict between your work and yourself.
Such errors can possibly be corrected.
But this one cannot.
Meaning?
You'll either be revealed as a murderer wearing the mask of humanism or as one worthy of the beautiful name..."man."
I know that.
You have less faith in man than you try to believe.
Regardless of how you might feel, true men will always find kindred spirits!
What will happen to Kao?
I wish I knew myself.
When will you release him?
You won't kill Kao, will you?
You won't, will you?
Hello?
Okishima?
What's the decision?
Calm down and listen.
The manager is no help, the old fool.
Wait until morning.
I'll talk to the chairman.
The chairman?
Yes, the chairman!
I'll make him listen to me.
Please go away.
I want to be alone.
Mr. Kaji!
Please save him!
Save him!
He wouldn't try to escape!
We planned to be married after the war ended.
You won't kill him, will you?
You're a good man.
You won't kill him, will you?
Go to sleep and stop worrying.
I won't do anything.
There's nothing I can do.
Can I really set my mind at ease?
Really?
Go to sleep and don't worry.
I'll try to sleep too.
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
To free those men.
You can't!
Think what might happen to you!
I don't care!
You did everything you could.
Don't you care what happens to you?
Well, I do!
Michiko, don't torment me!
I'll call for help!
I won't let you do it.
You always go your own way, and perhaps you're right.
But if you free those men, they'll kill you for sure!
Please don't go!
I'll follow you!
I'll shout for help!
Michiko, if I don't, I'm no longer a human being!
How can you ignore me like some stray dog?
Even you don't want to give up this life, do you?
Remember:
You promised!
I'm sorry.
Go and do as you see fit.
Perhaps it's me who's wrong.
I can't have you feeling I stood in your way.
I don't want you hating me, not loving me anymore.
There's no hope for me!
- All ready!
- Good work.
Spare us!
It's best to wet the blade.
Keeps off the fat.
Kaji!
Stay right there.
Thanks for being my witness.
Get up!
On your knees!
Kaji... you can tell them all later:
If they want to die, they can run all they like.
Next!
Spare me!
Want to try?
Next!
I don't want it!
I demand an explanation!
Why are we being executed?
Son of a bitch!
Japanese devils!
Stand up!
I'll go by myself!
Inhuman wretch!
This is your true form!
The face of a man... but the heart of a beast!
Good!
You show some grit.
Stay calm!
Slash him!
The Chinese nation... will live forever!
Don't think of it as a human head.
Take a rest and try again.
Next!
Spare my life!
Wait!
No more!
What?
Please stop!
Stay out of this or I'll kill you too!
I'm not afraid any longer.
Kill me if you dare!
I'll be happy to oblige.
Enemy sympathizers deserve to be killed.
We won't let them kill our countrymen!
Stop them!
You're killing innocent men!
Murderers!
Murderers!
Murderers!
Murderers!
Private!
Very well.
The execution is called off.
Go back and join the others, quickly!
Take them back!
Kaji!
We're taking you to headquarters.
Pvt. Tanaka, take special care of our honored guest.
I'll return later.
Go.
Kaji won't be coming home today.
Did something happen?
Did something happen?
He refused to let me behead those enemy dogs.
He may not be back for a while.
It all depends.
Did he hide anything?
No.
No wonder.
Books by damn Westerners.
Open the desk drawers.
Place everything on top of the desk.
Son of a bitch!
How about it?
Wouldn't it be smarter to confess everything?
I only regret that I let you behead the first three.
You don't say!
You're a hopeless case.
Pvt. Tanaka... you should show our guest more courtesy.
Kaji, don't you miss your wife?
She was crying.
She'll have no one to ride her at night.
What have I done?
I'm no monster.
I'd like to put you back on top of your wife tonight, but for that I'd need more cooperation from you.
What's so funny?
I don't pick pockets.
I don't steal.
I have nothing to confess.
Very interesting.
Then don't confess until I make you.
Show off your bravado while you can.
You let 18 POWs escape and failed to report it, didn't you?
Is it so funny you can't even answer?
I didn't report it, but I never let them escape.
You used that chink Chen to contact the prisoners.
Show me evidence.
Or will you lose face if you can't prove it?
Son of a bitch!
Did you want something?
No.
I just didn't expect things to come to this.
Quarrels over work are one thing.
I didn't intend for others to do my fighting for me.
So I came to...
I understand.
I never thought Kaji would do such a thing.
Do what?
Oh... nothing.
I don't know what other people think, but I know that whatever Kaji did, he alone could do.
I see.
If that's how you feel, you can do as you please.
I just dropped by to see if I could help in any way.
I won't be asking for your help.
What you can do is admit that those men were not trying to escape.
Admit it!
You and Wang Heng Li plotted their escape.
Didn't you?
Why don't you answer?
Wang Heng Li was arrested.
He confessed everything.
Wang was arrested?
Only his execution remains.
When will it be?
Worried?
He was your friend, wasn't he?
He instigated the uprising at your suggestion, didn't he?
When is he to die?
Why don't you answer?
Very well.
Today I'll make you weep like a woman.
That'll be something for your wife to hear!
WANG HENG LI In Memoriam
Wang... in the end you died without seeing the dawn.
But your countrymen... will surely bury you by the light of the newborn day.
Get out here.
Come on.
Go inside.
Kiss her.
Don't let me stop you.
Michiko, you mustn't come here.
Don't worry.
Go home.
I brought some sushi.
May I give it to him?
Go ahead.
Won't you have some?
Michiko... if you ever need help, talk to Okishima.
Okishima, I'm counting on you.
Mr. Okishima... is being transferred.
I came to say good-bye.
I see.
I'm sorry I wasn't any help on the phone.
I argued with the manager.
I'm being shipped out to a smaller mine.
So that's how it is.
I'd have liked to stick around and fight with you some more.
Furuya's taking over my spot.
We're back to square one.
Is there anything you'd like?
Nothing.
So...
I won't be seeing you again?
I learned so much from you.
No, it's me who learned from you.
Though you've paid a bitter price, you finally caught the humanism train.
Oh, yes.
Wang Heng Li...
No unauthorized conversation!
Your time is up.
Private!
Michiko!
You're hereby released by special permission.
But don't think you're out of the woods.
Remember:
I'll always be watching you.
Wherever you go, I'll be there first.
Reporting back, sir.
It arrived, Kaji.
EMERGENCY SUMMONS TO MILITARY SERVICE
I knew something was up.
So you use me up and then throw me out.
I can't afford to lose you, but there's nothing I can do.
Forget the smooth talk!
Nice way to get rid of those you don't want.
There's nothing I can do.
Now I see the light.
I should have trusted the whores instead of the managers here!
I know you're tired, but turn your duties over to Furuya.
He needs to find a new leader among the special laborers.
Since Wang Heng Li escaped, no one wants to lead them.
Escaped?
Wang Heng Li escaped?
Thirty of them got away.
So he made it after all!
Good for you, Wang!
I hope they all get away!
Sir, please inform Furuya that he's been spared a thorough beating thanks to Wang's escape.
I was going over there to thrash him, not hand over my duties.
But I've suddenly changed my mind.
I guess a man finds kindred spirits after all.
Japanese devil!
Japanese devil!
Kill me...
like you murdered Kao!
Why don't you kill me, Japanese devil?
He murdered an innocent man!
He murdered an innocent man!
Mr. Kaji.
Don't be angry.
I know you have a good heart... but you weren't able to save Kao's life.
Michiko, you'll fall!
Welcome back!
I heard you'd come back in terrible shape.
But it's not true.
You look well.
I'm so happy!
So very happy!
What's this?
They wouldn't!
No, it's not fair!
They promised you an exemption.
This is a dirty trick!
This is too much.
It's not fair.
Nothing can be done now.
What did you do to deserve this?
Nothing.
But I'd hoped to accomplish things with you when I returned.
Why must these terrible things happen to you?
What have you done to deserve this?
You're so thin, so covered with scars.
And now they're dragging you off to war.
You mustn't die.
We must live again.
When will we meet again?
You'll come back.
I know you will.
Japanese devil!
Japanese devil!
Japanese devil!
I hope you die!
Michiko, let's go home.
We still have 24 hours together.
Japanese devil!

It's not like you.
Why?
You're running away!
Don't you want me?
Of course I do!
And I want you!
Yet we can't marry!
How many times do I have to tell you!
Because you may be called up at any moment?
I don't care if you're called up the day after we're married.
I'll cry no doubt.
But happiness comes only through marriage.
Then will you come to my dormitory?
Will you spend the night with me?
You'll come?
I'll come.
I'll come.
As I thought...
Go back to your own dormitory.
I couldn't do that to you.
You... were just trying to test me!
Weakling... coward!
I've had enough.
SOUTH MANCHURIA STEEL CO.
Research Section
Hi!
A rare meeting.
I just dropped by... to say "goodbye"
Your call... it came?
Yes.
And the date?
Tomorrow.
My papers came 5 days ago but I've been drinking ever since...
Oh yes...
I met Michiko last night.
Aren't you marrying her?
Tomorrow you then it'll be me!
But that needn't be the end.
I'm a born optimist and I've had my share of earthly pleasures.
I only regret...
That I haven't left the germ of life in the womb of some loving woman.
I may regret it, too.
But I can't be as optimistic as you.
The boss wants me... wait for me inside.
No...
I'll see you tonight.
That's so.
See you.
Kaji seemed a bit upset.
Is something wrong?
Going to remain just friends forever?
You had the spunk to come to work out here with him.
Throw yourself at him!
I did do.
He rejected you?
No. 12 and No. 13, stop that chatter!
I'll report you!
Supervision of Colonial Labour
I've read it twice.
Very interesting.
Smells of leftist tendencies, though.
What are you trying to say?
That men should be treated as men, that is all.
In colonial territories it...
It's difficult?
That's right.
We profit by exploiting Chinese labour... wasn't that the idea?
That's right.
Doesn't that conflict with your theory?
That's true.
Mind if I smoke?
No, I don't mind.
What do you think?
Without the contradiction my theory isn't needed.
In other words, you feel it's possible to improve work records... is that it?
A possibility.
By the way, I want you to take over at the Loh Hu Liong mines.
Any objections to being sent off into the hinterlands?
I'm not forcing you.
You've analysed the situation quite well... on paper.
Would you want it to end up only on paper?
Of course not.
Whenever you're ready to put your theories into actual practice...
I'll do my bit to help...
by having you exempted from army duty.
Exemption?
From military service?
You're not alone in the exemption.
There are dozens of others.
No.
What I meant was...
It's just the idea...
Of accepting military exemption in exchange for the Lo Hu Liong job that worries me.
A bad habit!
Leave well enough alone.
The savage fighting continues with only one way of resisting.
By facing a life sentence in prison.
Neither of us had the courage to face up to it.
Yes... you're right.
A gift from Heaven!
Not even the commander of the Kwangtung Army ever dared slap me!
Go to Loh Hu Liong with Michiko.
Michiko... his sweetheart?
Is pretty?
The most beautiful girl in the world.
But to me you're much more beautiful.
Hey...
You called yourself a shepherd's dog didn't you?
Why not?
A good dog can lead sheep to greener pastures...
And can earn their eternal gratitude.
If such things exist.
Me?
I'll take this one.
My little Mannon, your hair has the aroma of dried grass.
Michiko...
My best wishes go with you!
Go with Kaji to Loh Hu Liong!
Let this war go to the dogs!
You mustn't let happiness...
He may never come back...
I won't be called up
Loh Hu Liong is a tiny Manchurian village.
All we'll find there are iron ore and labour camps.
Would you go with me to such a place?
I'd follow you... anywhere!
It may affect your whole life.
Think it over!
If the army ever called you to active duty.
I...
I'd even been planning to have a child by you.
Is that too absurd?
What a honeymoon!
What did you say?
The wind... and this dust!
I don't care!
It's wonderful!
Like gravel in my mouth!
Loh Hu Liong
You must think I'm blind!
What?
Trick me into giving you special rations?
Oh no!
Kaji from Head Office?
That's right.
I'm Okishima.
We're working partners.
We can dispense with the niceties.
What ever made you come to this hole?
Come.
Thank you.
Anything for love's sake, eh?
Yes, how do you do?
Please, this way.
Haul their bags to their new quarters.
I read your report...
the one about supervision of labour.
Filled with fancy words...
Oh, madam... please!
Men here don't go for fancy talk.
You'll have little in common.
Thanks for your advice.
What's so funny?
Sorry!
Your own fancy talk sounds so out of place.
Very well written!
Reaching the pith of the matter.
Yes!
Reaching but not quite grasping...
Why is that?
If I knew, I'd write a book!
I'll take your wife.
You go see the boss.
Say, Furuya... show him the way!
I know this is nothing new, sir.
But our first shift requires 2,500 men.
Only 1,500 turned up this morning.
How can we be expected to make our production goal?
We're at war, Okazaki!
We must expect such shortages.
But...
You can't produce unless all conditions are perfect, is that it?
I didn't mean that, but Labour must help us.
Kaji... reporting for work, sir!
You're Kaji?
I'll introduce you.
2nd Pit Supervisor, Mr Higuchi.
His Foreman, Mr. Kawashima.
1st Pit supervisor, Mr Koiki.
And his Foreman, Mr. Okazaki.
This is Mr. Kaji... sent by Head Office as Labour Supervisor.
Pleased to meet you.
You're just in time.
Please, sit down.
We're discussing our labour shortage.
Any good ideas?
I'd like to talk to Okishima first...
And find how many men are available.
If their labour conditions are improved, all the men will report for work.
Yes... and in more concrete form?
Our employment system must be changed.
The labour boss must be replaced by a direct employment system.
You'd be throttling the mines.
It's ridiculous.
You agree Kawashima?
And why so?
Because... your name was Kaji?
You should know better!
We have some 200 labour groups here.
How many have no rake-off system or don't cheat on food rations?
I doubt if such a group exists.
But our problem is how to raise our work attendance rate.
Labourers lose the desire to work...
If, basically, labour condition are evil.
Regardless of how things are basically, labourers aren't what you make them out to be in theory.
Once they earn more than they need, they pour it into the crotch of women.
A difference in opinion.
Such methods never gain results.
But, Kaji, the theory may be correct and yet not apply in reality.
Then... either the theory is wrong.
Or the application is incorrect.
Be that as it may.
Try it your way.
I respect revolutionary ideas.
Moving on.
Yours is not a desk job.
It covers all aspects of the men's lives.
Food rationing, the disposal of the excrements of 10,000 men, handling menstrual cases among women.
Of women?
We have comfort quarters for our men.
As Okishima will point out, there are 60-odd Manchu women.
From today... you're their boss.
I'm glad to see you're not a bachelor.
Go home now and do your duty by your wife... but don't overdo it!
But why must our group be disbanded?
Poor records... you've been raking off too much.
Are you joking?
What's it all about?
Shall I show you the evidence?
Why need the company make trouble over our contracts with the men?
Our money is for the labourers.
But Foreman Okazaki says our men work very hard.
Yes... but your rolls have been over-padded.
But Mr. Okazaki...
I'm not Okazaki...
I'm Kaji of Labour!
Mr. Okishima, put in a good word for us.
We're like old buddies!
That's probably why I'm mouldy.
And Kaji has been scrubbing me until I'm practically raw!
Mr. Supervisor... poor living quarters, and poor food make our men sickly.
I know!
Inadequate quarters...
Poor food!
Men can't work that way.
But there is still greater evil.
Must I tell you?
You're that evil!
Now get this...
I give the men my word!
The food situation will improve.
Better quarters will be considered.
But it's no use as long as you exploit them.
You make a practice of lending money, to transient labourers and binding them for life.
You squeeze as much profit out of them as you can.
Your slave-drivers torture those who try to escape.
I won't allow such methods!
You won't?
And so what?
You're a mere employee of this company.
Won't allow it, eh?
Try and stop us!
Hey!
Any more threats and I'll kick your nuts in!
The gentlemen are having a bad day.
We'll come back.
Mr. Muta!
You can keep this!
And I've sent your packages back.
They left too peacefully!
They're up to something.
A tour of inspection?
I'm grateful to you gentlemen.
By the way... see to it that we get the men we need.
The old man won't take excuses.
Sure, you'll get them.
But don't kill 'em off too fast.
What happened?
The lazy dogs refuse to move!
Beating them senseless won't help.
Cruelty makes them worse.
I take orders from Okazaki... not you!
What goes on here doesn't concern you.
Then you refuse to stop?
Of course.
Good!
From tomorrow you'll have no men to beat.
What's that?
You're in the pit now.
You can't pull rank on us down here!
Lazy ones...
You don't wish to work?
Then... don't!
From tomorrow you needn't come.
Remain by the cosy fireplaces in your barracks.
But remember...
You will receive no food!
Just returning home?
Did you want something?
Just one question.
Did you threaten to shut off our supply of labour?
Well... how about it?
We can discuss it in the morning.
Morning?
I can understand why you'd prefer it so.
Especially with one's wife watching...
Do you think so?
Answer my question!
What's with you?
Your brutality may cow your labourers, but I'm not impressed.
I warned your man.
Mr. Kaji!
You surely know how important that ore is to us.
What's so wrong about beating the men?
As long as the ore keeps coming out, why the fuss?
Which is more important...
the ore... or the men?
I never think of things in that way.
One doesn't compare men with minerals.
Kindness will produce more ore.
Let me make it clear that Okazaki of Loh Hu Liong can't be changed...
By any of your half-baked ideas.
I stick to my own way.
Remember that!
I will!
And I'll stick to my own ways.
These gentlemen from the KEMPEITAI are offering us 600 special labourers.
Special labourers?
Prisoners from North China.
All you need do is keep them fed.
A heaven-sent blessing!
We're short of men here.
Completely unexpected!
Yes!
Our Head Office will certainly be pleased.
Kaji... talk it over with Okishima.
In what way?
I'll give the instructions.
I never repeat my instructions...
Is that Understand?
First:
Special labourers must be isolated from ordinary labourers.
Second:
Their quarters will be enclosed with barbed wire.
This barbed wire must be electrified.
Is that understood?
Food and labour are left in your hands but they must not escape!
How much electricity can you supply?
About 3,000 volts.
Good enough!
They will be delivered to you a week from today.
Arrival time will be notified later.
You understand?
We won't be ready in a week!
What?
Not too anxious to get help?
Kaji!
Why should we take over supervision of POWs?
Make all preparations.
Wait!
I need your answer!
We understand!
We'll be ready.
To be safe we need a whole platoon of armed men.
I hate being either aggressive or defensive.
Go if you wish!
Why play the hero in front of me?
Some day you'll appreciate me.
Chen... how's your mother?
She's in and out of bed all day.
Ill?
Take good care of her.
Yes.
Mr. Kaji...
I wish to ask a favour.
May I have some white flour from the storeroom.
For your mother?
Yes.
I wish I could help but I can't make any exceptions.
Here she comes!
Chen... how does all this strike you?
They are your fellow countrymen who lived in anti-Japanese areas.
They may be friends of your mother from Shantung.
My mother raised me so as not to be anti-Japanese.
In a battle area, you'd be murdered as a sympathizer.
The key!
We haven't received it yet.
From Loh Hu Liong?
That's right.
Are you in charge?
That's right.
What's your name?
Kaji.
Yes...
Kaji!
I never forget a name.
Good!
I transfer the labourers to you.
Never forget that these men are prisoners of war.
To deal with them you must be military men at heart.
Civilian negligence will not be tolerated!
You understand?
We understand.
You don't understand Kaji!
You think your seven men can handle 600 prisoners?
What if they escape?
We received no special instructions.
I assumed this meant no special danger.
You're quite a bold one!
How old are you?
I am 28.
You're married?
May I have the key?
You're a stubborn one!
I like 'em that way.
You'll witness the transfer?
Don't be ridiculous!
I'm on official leave.
You seem to feel that the army can make mistakes.
Don't worry!
When the army says 604... it's 604!
Send in a receipt immediately.
I don't care if they all die but they must not escape!
Dirty scum!
Get up!
Get up!
They unload this mess on us?
Hey!
Open the others.
Get up.
Hurry up!
Get off!
Get off!
Get off!
Line up... double file!
Mr. Kaji...
Mr. Kaji!
This looks bad!
What is it?
Hurry!
Hurry!
They've steamed to death.
Help me!
Help me!
Don't let them eat!
Stop them!
Mr. Kaji!
Get back!
Get back!
Don't eat that!
Don't eat that!
You'll all die!
Give me the whip!
Kaji!
Here!
The special labourers are unfit to work.
Let them have a month's rest They're half dead!
Meaning these anti-Japanese elements will be fed without working?
If you had witnessed the scene I'm sure you'd agree with me, sir.
They are POWs.
Is that why 12 were allowed to die?
If you want 'em dead, stuff them with raw beans... they'll die!
Say... watch that tongue of yours!
What you're saying amounts to a denouncement of the military.
I'll adopt your opinion just once more.
Just once more?
Yes... just once more!
And why so?
You'd like to know?
Despite all your convictions, I just got a report from Furuya.
150 men under your supervision have just walked out on us.
I shall overlook the matter this time.
I give you all warning.
I know you all want to escape.
However... you cannot escape from here.
If you even try...
This mongrel's fate will be yours.
Chen... release the dog!
Tomorrow means a new month of still higher production goals.
The Directors have even discussed replacement of all top men here.
I will accept this disgrace if production increase is impossible.
However, we have not yet done our utmost.
Until we attain the 20% production increase demanded of us...
We must continue this crash program.
Are there any dissenting opinions?
In the name of final victory, I refuse.
to listen to any of your excuses!
Mr. Koike... tell him he has my word.
I, Okazaki, vow that Pit No. 1 will top the new goal.
And I'm sure you've no objections regarding my methods.
Do as you think best!
The goal must be achieved.
Understand?
Lash them on with still greater fury.
Any Chinaman who shirks may be killed.
Push them!
Whip them!
We need that extra 20%!
Men who top their quota will be amply rewarded.
Remember!
We're at war here... at war!
Anyone here feel he can't do this?
Good!
Give 'em everything you have.
I'll assume all responsibility.
Starting tomorrow, you will go to work.
Rations will be kaoliang and bean-lees.
The same as ordinary labourers.
You don't smoke?
I did formerly.
You stopped?
When we run out of tobacco, we suffer.
I can't believe Japanese will keep us supplied.
Now that we've revived you, you would bear a grudge?
We were not fighting men.
We have the right to demand release.
I haven't the authority to free you.
I am only authorized to detain you.
Master... when we be free?
We all not soldier.
We no fight!
Japan soldier come...
Make bad all Chinese woman...
Take away all man...
Bring here.
No give us food...
Many die!
Not die...
They killed!
I cannot set you free but I can promise that you will not be killed.
Japanese speak clever words.
Also write clever words.
But never they keep promise.
I believe your name was Kao?
Now remember this...
You have been placed under our supervision.
Whether that barbed wire remains or is removed, depends on you!
Walk faster!
Walk faster!
Come on!
Step along there!
Mr. Kaji, if men escape, it mean trouble?
Why need they escape?
Those men work before in own village.
Do they wish to work here?
Here they have no mother...
no wife... and no children.
Kaji... how about those special labourers?
Why so many left?
They're the sick ones.
Make sure they're not feigning illness.
I didn't come to find fault, but I'd like to see their quarters.
This way...
No signs of any breaks?
No, I don't think so.
They must be given some incentive.
I think so too.
What do prisoners dream of the most?
Freedom, I suppose!
Freedom?
You must be a poet.
It's women!
If they're men they dream of women.
What did you dream of as a bachelor?
Of the ways of the Empire?
I doubt it!
The way to make prisoners work... is to satisfy 70% of their bodily lust.
But... women...
Very simple!
You supervise the comfort girls... send them inside.
Is it really necessary?
You... do you want a woman?
See?
The word "woman" alone brings joy to their hearts.
What is man?
He's not a poem!
Nor is he mortality!
A mere mass of matter formed of lust and greed!
I shall ask their leaders.
Who gives your orders?
Prisoners or I?
I'm concerned over their welfare.
See that it's carried out!
Stop loafing!
Hurry up!
Stop loafing!
You dog!
Master... this man sick!
He maybe die.
What did you say?
Have mercy... he sick man!
Save your whining for Kaji!
I don't care if you all die!
Dogs!
Kaji!
Mr. Kaji!
No want to see?
Sister Jin!
Mr. Kaji... welcome!
Mr. Kaji, you sleep with me?
I no want money.
I'm sorry but I need 30 girls for the special labourers.
The Labour Office will pay for them.
They go inside barb wire?
Like all dogs... all sleep together?
If you don't like it, you may refuse.
It can't be helped...
we work girls.
I send 30 girls... tomorrow.
Jin.
Don't be crazy!
We can't work with people watching!
Do you realize how many men there are in that compound?
Don't come if you'd rather not.
I refuse... even if the others go.
You want to be a shirker?
What do you mean?
I said it for all of us.
Talking big aren't you?
Go... if you wish!
Be quiet!
You don't make the decisions.
So what?
Enough.
Stop your bickering.
I'll decide what to do.
Night time... 30 girls go... all right?
Yes... send them.
What's wrong?
The foreman did him in.
Where?
Pit No. 3.
Okazaki, eh?
Rush him to the First Aid Station.
He can't be allowed to get away with this!
I'll charge him with manslaughter.
Come, now... relax!
It was unwise of Okazaki to use force.
But he only did it in his eagerness to increase production.
After all, his motives were patriotic.
Okazaki may be a brute.
But only with this brutality.
can one operate that large pit.
We need him just as we need you to keep our 10,000 men in line.
After all we're at war!
To achieve the ultimate victory, one must overlook the minor errors.
An error?
A human being was murdered!
Kaji...
I warn you again... relax!
Think it over... you'll see!
Can we exchange a good, hard-working Japanese.
for the life of one mere labourer?
That's not the point!
If you insist on pressing charges include me as an accomplice.
I'll see that the suit goes unfavourably for you.
I can do it, you know.
You'd dare distort the truth?
Sir... will you see that it never happens again?
How shall we report it?
Well now...
Report it as an accidental death.
Say he fell off a ledge...
It does happen you know.
You think I'll write that fake report?
What else can we do!
No.
I refuse to write it!
Yes, you will!
If I fake that report I'd become an accomplice.
What are you going to do?
I'll get Okazaki!
You fool!
Why try to be a hero?
You'll just run out of wind!
Why ruin your own future with his?
Mr. Kaji.
One of our men was persecuted.
What became of him?
He died.
And the culprit...
was he arrested?
He's still working.
Will there be no trial?
I suppose not.
If you wish to make excuses make them before my men.
No...
I'm waiting for some girls.
You promised not to kill!
You're no better than other Japanese!
If you treat me like a murderer just because I'm a Japanese...
You'll be losing the only friend you have.
Friend?
You needn't believe me.
That's enough, Kao.
Does this man's death mean that we may also die?
I won't let them do it!
Women... women!
Open the gate!
Let the girls in.
10 girls to a barrack...
Time limit: 10 p.m.
Yes!
We're here... as I promised.
Why do you send us women?
Think as you please!
I'm just obeying orders.
You send us harlots.
And let us sleep with them like dogs so that we will work harder?
What's that about harlots?
I wouldn't talk so big if I were you!
You wouldn't understand at all.
Why make such a fuss?
You're no better off than we are.
Do you feel no shame?
I didn't come of my own free will!
I refused to come!
Isn't it just the same with you?
Do you enjoy digging for ore here?
I'm sorry.
I didn't realise.
Welcome home!
You must be tired.
Look... isn't it wonderful?
Her first egg!
She cackled so loud...
That I went out to see that was going on...and there it was!
What is it?
Is anything wrong?
Not necessarily...
Don't you want to come home?
What happened?
Tell me about it.
Would you want a husband who runs a whorehouse?
What do you mean?
You'd vomit if I told you.
What happens... with 600 men and only 30 women?
And now I'm an accomplice of murderers!
That's not true!
Even the prisoners won't trust me any more.
Given time... you'll gain their trust.
Leave me alone for awhile.
I'm sorry.
What for?
Since those men came you've changed completely.
You think so?
I feel that I'm fighting a lone battle.
You leave early every morning...
And you always return late.
During that time... you work.
Meanwhile, I putter around the house and go out to do my shopping.
It's like doing nothing.
Yet...
I try to convince myself.
that what little I do will help to keep you going.
Otherwise, I'm nothing but an ordinary housekeeper!
I'm sorry... forgive me!
It's now become an obsession.
Stop worrying about it...
Just for now...
It was nice talking to you.
When one is confined here...
One loses contact with the outside.
Thank you!
What's the matter?
I'm a professional woman!
I'm sorry to have taken your time.
I just wanted to talk.
You plan to escape, don't you?
It's impossible...
with all that barbed wire.
And it's charged with electricity.
Man put electricity through it.
You mustn't do anything rash!
Man is such a weak creature.
No amount of squirming ever changes the course of events.
You're wrong!
Man can become as strong as he wishes.
He need only find the cause of his unhappiness.
Want to make some money?
By selling my girls elsewhere?
I don't go in for such deals.
It's not women!
More labourers?
That's not quite what I meant.
Those prisoners?
Too dangerous!
A single mistake and it could mean this.
It's easy!
Escaped prisoners bring big profit.
If you help me I'll split the profit with you.
It's easy money!
What do I do?
The best way... is to do it like this!
The electricity... just flick it off!
Someone asked you to do it?
My buddy... the Japanese assistant, Muta, who was just fired.
It's too pitiful... to sell those men!
You can't expect any sympathy from me!
I'm a Korean...
looked down upon by both Japanese and Chinese!
Keep moving!
Learned One.
The Italians seem to have surrendered
Oh?
The downfall of Germany cannot be far off.
Our time nears...
When will it be?
Six months... perhaps a year!
We must be patient.
What's going on here?
You scums!
Thanks!
This'll help revitalize my man and our young assistants.
If Okazaki picks up any more vitality, it'll mean trouble for you.
Didn't you know?
Women prefer it that way.
Ma'am... it might be wiser to send some of that flour to Kaji's wife.
Why, yes, a good idea!
I'll do that.
Good day, sir!
Welcome!
You want dumplings?
Can you loan me a bag of white flour?
My mother wishes some before she dies.
One bag?
Why don't you go get some?
The Japanese sneak out our rationed flour...
And they're eating their fill.
I can't do that.
After all...
Mr. Kaji trusts you.
My flour was sneaked out by the keeper with the big mole.
It's stolen property!
You still wish to buy some of it?
Let him have half a bag!
OK.
OK.
Young one... don't forget that you are Chinese...
And born of a Chinese mother.
Go ask the one with the big mole.
Don't do things so openly.
What are you saying?
I saw Okazaki's wife leaving here.
I hate to butt in, but you're making a mistake.
People appreciate the mistakes I make.
It's an old custom here.
It's one that should be broken!
Unpleasant as it might be, that's my job.
If it ever happens again, I'll have to order an inventory.
Mr. Kaji.
We often wonder if you're one of us or just a puppet of the Chinese.
So what?
Oh... that's all!
But your sense of justice is tempered...
By the fact that you can't take home some flour to your own wife.
Remove your dirty feet when speaking to me!
Do you need my help?
You fool!
They'll see your light!
Go easy tonight.
Hurry!
It's the watchman.
What's taking you so long?
Get going!
I'm so happy!
You've never slept with a woman before, have you?
You'll do it for me, won't you?
Talk to Sai at the power station... and have him shut off the current for just three minutes.
I'll see that you're well rewarded.
Then you can buy all the flour you want...
Without pretending to be a thief.
Can't you make up your mind?
Hey...
Big Mole!
Well, Chen... how'd it go?
Did you get a good price?
Or... did you eat it?
Free white flour must taste good!
What's up, Matsuda?
Well, now...
I wonder...
It seems that even saints have thieves as underlings...
Mr. Kaji.
I'm willing to overlook it this time.
However... for my reference, I'd like to see how you handle this.
Chen... stand up!
Look at me!
You didn't do it?
I did...
You did it alone?
Yes.
Matsuda, I hope you're satisfied.
Before I expose all your dirty doings... get out!
Chen... what's the matter?
I was a thief... and Mr. Kaji struck me.
Kaji?
He struck you?
It's nothing!
Mr Kaji is Japanese...
I am Chinese
It's all that simple!
Sister Jin is occupied now.
I think the man is a Korean.
A Korean?
Cute one...
Have you been fighting?
Let me use your room a while.
What's ailing you?
I can't understand it myself!
Foolish one!
You act like one having her first love affair.
I can't seem to forget Kao.
Love at first sight... with a man inside that barbed wire.
Why not use your room?
It's in disorder.
Why do you ask?
All Japanese are the same!
They don't consider us human beings.
Please...
Go to the power station and do as I ask you.
I can't!
I couldn't commit treachery for money.
I realize that!
You're a good man.
But those men in there are prisoners.
They'll be exploited and later killed.
Can they really be saved?
Of course!
But the only one who can do it... is you!
Later... please!
Go do as I ask.
I understand.
I'm Chinese, too!
I'm ready to do my bit.
At exactly 1 a.m.
When the siren sounds, I'll cut the current.
But only for 2 minutes!
That's the best I can do.
Two minutes?
Watch out!
That packs 3,300 volts!
Be careful!
Don't let them see you.
Sai!
Yes!
They mustn't see you leaving.
My regards to our brothers inside the barbed wire.
They're in love!
It's not business.
If it's love we won't pay.
You're joking!
A prisoner and a harlot in love!
It's so romantic!
But... what will come of it?
Nothing can come of it as long as there is a war going on.
All they can hope for is their love.
Can't you let them marry?
Yes...
I'd like to if it's possible.
I'm sure you'd want to help them.
I'd like to... but it ends right there!
Have some... they're delicious!
What's that?
Rare, isn't it?
It was given to us.
By whom?
Try to guess!
- It was Okazaki's wife!
Send them all back!
We can't... now!
I can't send them back now!
Return them!
Tell her that I was furious.
But... why?
You ask me why?
Why so angry?
She brought them to try to make up with us.
The murderer stole that flour!
Can't you see?
Can't you understand what I'm trying to do here at this mine?
I'm afraid not!
How could I when you never tell me anything?
Of course, even I can guess where the flour and sugar came from.
But women can't always live by hard-headed rules.
I didn't accept for myself!
Well, you needn't have bothered accepting for me!
Because it was the Okazaki's?
What if it were Mrs. Okishima?
I'd still refuse!
Yes... you're just the kind who would!
I understand you struck Chen...
I know you didn't want to...
yet you did!
Why?
Because he committed a wrong?
No!
You could have forgiven him such a minor matter.
You did it because he made you lose face in front of others.
For one who plans great things you've a small mind!
It's all beyond you!
That's not true!
I even know what the people are saying about you!
And what are they saying?
That you try to take all the credit.
I didn't believe them!
I thought it was merely spite... but now...
Believe as you wish!
Where are you going?
I've kept thirty women waiting!
Marriage?
It's impossible!
We can marry!
After the war is over.
Is it ending soon?
Not very long now... it will end.
But... they'll take you away again!
No, Chun Lan.
It is ending in victory for China.
We are going to be free again!
I...
I'd prefer things as they are.
Why?
Chun Lan!
When that day comes, I won't be able to see you.
But...
I'm asking you to marry me!
There are plans to escape from here.
But I will not run away as long as you are here.
Kao!
You won't run away... you promise?
It seems I'm running to extremes again.
You brute!
I'm thinking of helping those two get married.
Hello.
What's that?
They escaped?
Yes... we'll be right over!
Eleven men!
Escaped!
I won't bother asking for information.
We'll soon know who planned the break.
I won't ask for details.
But I want you to understand one thing.
We've tried our best to help you.
If you cannot trust us and continue in your efforts to escape.
those who remain behind will face reprisals and a further increase of hard labour.
And I will not raise a finger to protect you!
You think that you can get away with anything while here.
But if Kaji and I decide to do so.
we can always pack you into those freight cars and send you back.
They escaped without our knowing!
We only serve liaison purposes.
We can't stop them even if we learn of the plot.
Don't lie!
What if I said that Wang Heng Li plotted this break?
It no lie... we don't know!
I no run away.
You fools!
Do you think we'd take you words for it?
I wish you'd all run away!
I will not run!
I will stride boldly out of this compound.
Where will you go after you leave?
Not all Japanese are soft-hearted.
Run away and see for yourself.
I will not keep you!
Wang, whether this camp remains a haven depends on your future actions.
Ultimate responsibility to the KEMPEITAI lies with me... not you!
Investigate the matter thoroughly.
And find some alibi for the KEMPEITAI.
Where's Kaji?
You stood by while those men escaped?
That's not true.
You took all precautionary measures?
Must you be reminded...
That those prisoners cost us dearly?
You damaged the prestige of our imperial forces.
Start explaining!
What's to explain?
The only explanation is their desire to escape.
Why did you let them escape?
Answer me!
There's no need to shout.
We have 10,000 labourers here aside from your prisoners.
No matter how hard we try they'll manage to escape.
One question...
OK.
We reported the truth.
If I had reported them dead...
I could have avoided trouble with the KEMPEITEI.
Doesn't the KEMPEITEI want the truth?
I admit your honesty.
But inadequate supervision cannot be excused.
I shall overlook your negligence on this one occasion.
No more men must be allowed to escape.
If they do, I shall personally slay the leader of that group.
You understand?
We understand.
How about it?
Do you want me to intimidate them?
It won't be necessary.
Refusing aid from the military indicates your supreme confidence.
Hereafter, I'll hold you personally responsible in this matter.
I understand.
And you?
Do you understand?
I do.
That's all for today.
No... wait!
Wait!
Leave me alone!
Don't take it out on the men.
You did!
You struck Chen in a fit of temper!
Don't try to pull your humanism on me.
Yes... and I already regret it.
But why need you ape me?
Don't let your ire ruin my work.
Your job?
Yes... my work!
We've kept you in step so far but you're turning away.
Can't you see?
Force has meaning only when overcoming tyranny.
I know!
.
I've had enough of your lectures!
You intend to leave them alone?
I'll talk to them.
I mince no words!
I don't want your men to keep trying to escape.
As far as you men are concerned, I am your friendliest enemy.
I pride myself in the fact that there is no hostility in my work.
Despite the dilemmas which come of our being at war,
I have tried to protect your interests.
What you say... is difficult.
Is it?
Eat your fill.
We can talk at our leisure.
When one of your comrades was killed...
I did not adopt just measures to protect you.
Therefore, you no longer trust me.
This is only natural.
However...
I shall do my utmost to correct this mistake.
This may take considerable time.
But I hope you will trust me and be patient.
No one wishes to risk dangers to break out?
Let me speak for my friend, Kaji.
Since Kaji arrived here...
The labourers' has greatly improved.
This also applies to you.
However, if you continue to break out.
I cannot say what the KEMPEITAI might do.
I don't know how Kaji feels.
But the only way to save my own neck... is to send you back to the KEMPEITAI.
He speaks no falsehoods.
We can talk over our mutual problems.
How about you, Kao?
If you can marry Yang Chun Lan, will you stay until the war ends?
Tales which begin with the word "if"
Do not interest me.
Can't you understand?
We want to talk things over.
Fawning toad-eater!
It's the same old Japanese trick!
They always promise to do this and to do that...
But they never carry it out.
Stand up!
You dog!
Go to Yang Chun Lan and learn the ways of human beings.
By the way, Wang... if I...
There's the "if" again.
If I gain for you the freedom enjoyed by other labourers, will you promise to remain here?
To wait seems to be the only safe liberty.
You promise?
Wang... you must trust me!
Do you think they trust me?
You want to believe they do?
I want to believe Wang when he said that he'd wait.
You plan to continue sending the girls inside?
Why?
Just a hunch...
And I also plan to take about 50 men for outside work.
With guards?
No... just myself.
Such strange hunches aren't like you.
Why not be honest?
What about?
Admit that you'd let them escape... if you could!
That's nonsense.
When that happens, I stand to lose my neck, too.
Remember that!
When they come here, they seem happy.
Your mother... is she still ill?
Yes.
Does she still yearn for white flour?
She's given up hope.
I'm sorry that I struck you.
I'm hard-headed in some ways...
I know!
That's all right.
Is Sai who works at the power station a friend of yours?
Yes.
The current was shut off...
And Sai was on duty that night.
If he did it, he mustn't do it again.
All right!
Back to work!
They could have run away.
They're beginning to trust you.
No... they're just being wary.
They fear a trap.
You're giving it up?
No...
I'll continue.
It's dangerous!
They might kill you and escape.
I don't think so.
This bath feels good!
Why don't you come in, too?
I think I will.
If the labourers calm down, let's go on a vacation.
Let's do it!
How many days can you take off?
Three days... at most!
That's wonderful!
Well... if they really calm down...
Some day you'll be a great supervisor...
But youth will have vanished by then.
That's not for me!
You win!
What you say is probably the truth.
Will you?
Sure... we'll go.
Make no mistakes, Cho...
fix that barbed wire!
Kaji will be off on a 3-day leave.
We'll do it while he's away.
There's more of a profit in it but it's more dangerous.
With things going smoothly, Kaji has relaxed his guard.
But watch out for Okishima!
It's an ideal chance!
Let's pull another fast one and make ourselves scarce.
Yeah... getting away is the important thing.
Is Jin Tung Fu in?
She's in bed with the cute one.
How about you?
I'm having trouble!
Chen won't help any more.
He won't do it.
Once is as bad as 100 times!
He dislikes our company.
Oh?
Except when he's in bed with you?
He wants me to break away, too.
Has the dog squealed on us?
He wouldn't do that!
How do you know?
Don't stop him.
Send him home!
Hey, Jin Tung Fu is some woman, eh?
Was it good?
I hear Kaji is going on leave this Saturday.
Have the power cut while he's gone.
Sai isn't going on duty during those nights.
Well then when?
Friday night.
Then make it Friday night.
He can't!
He's under suspicion.
By who?
Mr. Kaji...
What can he do without evidence?
Listen carefully, you brat!
Play it straight and I'll fix it so Jin Tung Fu will be all yours.
You'll do it...
you'll be a good boy!
If you refuse...
you and Sai will die!
Oh!
I feel great!
We arrived in a whirl of dust but it's nice today!
You're worried?
I'm wondering why I didn't do this before.
Really?
I mean it!
When we arrive in town, I must phone Yasuko.
Do you mind?
And then?
And then we'll have lunch together and go to the apple orchard.
It's all so wonderful...
I feel as light as a balloon!
I beg just one liberty.
What's that?
Just one hour... will you let me go?
What for?
Our record is improving, I want to see the director...
About the status of the prisoners.
Just one hour?
Yes.
The remainder is all yours.
All right!
I'll give you 2 hours, But not a minute more!
Mr. Kaji!
Mr. Kaji!
They escaped again!
What?
And Okishima?
He's over at their camp.
OK.
I'll go right away.
No... please!
It can't be helped, but I can't go now.
Go on alone and have a good time with Yasuko.
It's not Yasuko...
I want you!
But this is my job.
I don't care!
You're on vacation.
Why do you have to go back now?
Leave it to Okishima...
I can't do that.
It can wait till after lunch, right?
I'll never make it.
You don't want to do!
Stop it!
Your work's important...yes!
But do you know how important this is to us?
I'll make up for it!
You needn't bother!
Why the fuss over such a tiny matter?
Such a tiny matter?
You don't care how I feel about it.
At any rate, there's no way I can leave now.
I see!
Then I'll go by myself.
Stop it!
From now on, I do things my own way!
And ruin everything I've done?
This is the only way of making them understand!
Brute force solves nothing!
Do you realize how many got away?
18 men escaped led by Hwang and Sung!
You still want to talk it over?
I'll assume all responsibility.
Foolish!
If you don't like my methods, you can quit and save your own neck.
OK.
I accept your offer.
Wang!
Stand up!
I've despaired of you all!
You gave your word.
I may seem like a fool to you but now I've had enough!
Another break and you all go without food for 3 days.
I'll break your authority in the camp.
All Japanese are the same!
Devils!
So be it!
I shall act accordingly.
All promises are hereby retracted.
I realize now that there can be no truth between us.
Mr. Okishima!
And the report to the KEMPEITAI?
We're in for it this time!
I won't report the incident.
What?
If it leaks out, I'll assume all responsibility.
I know it's not all your fault.
You think someone shut off the power?
I couldn't say.
How about a Japanese night shift?
We couldn't... without evidence.
Should I increase the night watch?
I'd have to check each night to see if they're on duty.
Eighteen men... that's a big loss!
I've achieved our new production goal... and I want no trouble of such nature.
May I report that Okishima is herewith relieved of all responsibility for the prisoners?
Tell me!
Who paid you the money?
Okishima favours aggressive measures but Kaji always vetoes him.
Meaning he gives tacit consent to the runways?
I wouldn't say that...
but it does all seem rather suspicious.
There is one way we can teach them a lesson.
How's that?
Let them plan another break, and we'll foil them.
With your permission, I'd like to try.
Sounds interesting!
If it brings results, I'll try anything.
Give it a try.
Boss's orders...
flour and oil rations for just the Japanese of course!
I'm sure you don't approve.
I do not!
Unfortunately however, you're not the manager.
It's fortunate for you that I'm not!
Mr. Kaji!
It's Mr. Okishima...
Kill the rat!
Let us take care of this Korean dog!
You stay out of this!
Swipe men from under my nose, eh?
Not stopping me today?
You want me to?
You disapprove?
Should I lay off the ordinary labourers, too?
Your so-called humanism is apt to harbour rascals like this one.
Chen... the medical ward!
Leave the cur be!
His boss will pick him up.
Take him!
Call...
Furuya...
Don't worry, young one!
They can't make me talk.
Chen... it seems I know more about you than you do about me.
Go tell Kaji the wounds are slight.
We don't want him around here.
Well?
How is he?
He'll be all right.
Mr. Furuya is with him.
Furuya?
Furuya... send a telegram to Muta...
That rat Okishima!
The man says he'll sue Okishima.
Help him arrange it.
He's your friend.
You needn't explain!
I'm not that dumb.
Was it money?
Or just to make trouble for me?
Don't worry!
I won't tell the boss.
See that your buddy is hospitalized.
But you're paying for him... not labour!
You've already made enough.
What kept you so long?
What's wrong with you?
You're drunk!
You think I came to make trouble?
I had a drink with the boss but I'm not drunk.
I bring tidings!
They're issuing commendations to the deserving.
Okazaki will get one of them.
I told the boss that you were the one who earned the award in the labour end.
The boss felt the same but he feared that it might hurt my feelings?
Do you think it would hurt my feelings?
Why have you turned to brute force?
The boss asked the same question.
Just say...
I was born a brute.
How long will you carry on as you are?
What do you mean by that?
You're ignoring the contradictions and trying to justify them.
I ran out of breath waiting.
If I'm in your way, just say so.
Lao Kao!
Lao Kao!
Jin!
I was afraid you might have escaped.
That is all I could buy today.
Thank you.
Thank you greatly.
We can't meet for the time being.
I...
I won't be able to come here.
If you run off by yourself...
I'll die on this fence.
I'll take you with me when I escape.
When will that be?
After I learn how the others have fared.
I can't take any chances with you accompanying me.
You will stay here?
They might let us be married.
Don't believe them!
The learned Wang says the war will soon end.
Japan will be defeated.
Now that I have you...
I'm willing to bear anything.
Lao Kao.
I wish we could meet like this every night.
But... it's better not to come so often.
They'll become suspicious.
This cursed wire!
Watch out!
God is unjust!
Chun.
I love you!
Lao Kao.
And I love you!
Can't you sleep?
Kaji would have been happier if he had married a girl like you.
Probably.
You're too much the wife, Michi.
You're forgetting to be a woman.
What do you mean?
Being a wife is a profession.
But it's the woman that men love.
When you typed Kaji's reports, you studied it like one possessed.
I never understood a word.
And now?
Do you talk about his work?
He hates my pestering him.
If I were you, I'd pester him until he told me about everything.
Then...
I'd ask more questions.
What's wrong?
Was I too outspoken?
I wanted to apologize.
I was a poor wife... and a poor woman.
I couldn't sleep.
This is your home...
lie down and get a good rest.
Promise me... that you'll share your joys and sorrows with me.
Sorrow for one is enough.
It's not!
The road which you take is also the road for me.
What matters if we get lost?
I want you to take me along.
I will follow you.
And I'll do my best to keep up.
I understand.
If I'm slow... will you slow down just a tiny bit?
Just a very tiny bit?
Of course.
I won't repeat a question twice.
Through fitting leadership in the pit you have helped achieve the 20% increase in ore production.
You have rendered valuable service to our armed forces and have proven yourself a fitting example for other employees.
You are herewith officially commended.
Chairman of the Board, Jushiro Kitada.
Read in proxy by Junichi Kuroki.
Looks like we'll have rain.
Rainy nights are ideal for escapes.
When you deliver their food, tell them they can break out tonight.
Tonight?
Then you go to the power station and say that Kaji wants the power cut...
But...
Mr. Kaji.
I'm under direct orders from the boss.
You want me to tell the KEMPEITAI about you?
About how you and Jin Tung Fu helped them escape?
And how Kaji knew about it but pretended not to notice?
It's the only way to save your neck.
Mr. Kaji, I look forward to your continued favours.
You're young... but you're quite a fellow!
On the day you first came...
when it was snowing...
No... just windy!
Was that right?
On that day, I thought that a young squirt like you could never handle this mine.
However... things did work out as you said.
You're really great!
But, Mr. Kaji...
I've been watching.
You haven't been drinking...
Lend me a hand.
If you want to try, tonight is your last chance.
Why this suddenness?
Let it pass if it's inconvenient.
But my friend is being shifted to day duty from tomorrow.
There's no mistake?
On behalf of the men in the pit and for the sake of friendship,
I challenge Mr. Kaji to a friendly drinking bout.
Here here!
I'm beaten already.
No... that won't do!
You can't be...
we haven't started yet!
I'm really beaten.
Does your spirit show only when you're snarling to me?
Come on... take it like a man!
Right!
Good!
If you want to drink...
Drink with this!
Get drunk and let down your guard.
He's right!
Okay!
Good luck Mr. Kaji!
There he goes!
They can take it!
They're used to being wined and dined.
Women, too!
They run the whorehouse and have their pick.
We're wined and dined, eh?
And the whores are ours for the taking?
Bring on your wine and women!
I'll take 'em on!
Chen.
Delivered their meal?
Special flour rations for the Japanese.
You're welcome to mine.
But your wife.
My wife has abandoned hope.
Mr. Kaji...
It's nothing.
I just wanted to say, "Thank you."
I should say "Thank you." I was afraid you wouldn't accept it from me.
That's a shapely rump!
Stop it!
You act like a dog in heat.
What do you mean?
Sow your seed in your own paddy field!
I wouldn't act so big, Okishima!
If guys like you and Kaji would mind your own business,
I could have topped our goal long ago.
And if we hadn't butted in, you'd have 10 killings to your credit.
And be dining in the pen.
You rat!
If you want trouble, come on!
Hey!
Chen... what's the matter?
What should I do?
I won't be able to see you again.
I've fallen into a trap.
Go to the station and have him cut off the power.
If I should do so and the men are captured...
They'll kill me!
This is a Japanese plot.
No matter what happens, you won't be killed for doing what they ask.
You talk as if it didn't concern you.
If I'm caught, I might confess everything.
Don't frighten me.
You dragged me into this.
Where are you going?
I'll warn them!
You'll never get word to them.
I can try.
Wait!
I have a better idea.
Chun Lan.
Chun Lan.
Kao is breaking out tonight.
Kao is escaping?
Tell him it's dangerous tonight.
I won't let him escape alone!
Drink it!
It will relax you.
I couldn't contact him!
Are you sure he's escaping?
You met no one?
With this downpour, I couldn't see a thing.
Not a soul?
Is he really breaking out?
What'll we do now?
If he runs off by himself...
I'll kill myself!
The power must be cut off!
We mustn't anger the Japanese.
What will you do?
The best way is to confess the whole thing to Mr. Kaji.
Don't!
He's the severest of them all.
Where are you going?
Go to the station!
I expected so much!
Did you do as I told you?
I did.
You didn't mention the matter to Kaji, did you?
I didn't.
Whether you did as I ordered... or not.
We'll soon find out.
If you betrayed us... you'll die!
We'll report you as having been shot helping the men to escape.
We'll even be rewarded.
They're coming!
Mr. Furuya!
The power...
I haven't...
What?
Dog!
You want to be killed?
I can't believe that Chen was behind it all.
I've been blind!
Furuya -
I hadn't believed you capable of such a diabolic plot!
Go brag to the boss of your brave deed.
And you, Wang!
You're not always right either.
Mistaken leadership caused this.
You refused to trust us.
The result is charred human flesh.
It serves you right!
Lao Kao!
Why did you do it?
Kao!
Chun Lan!
Gaze upon he who murdered his friends.
Okishima came and told me about it.
Why didn't Chen come to me?
He was afraid... probably.
Because I struck him?
Okishima was saying that you'd brood over this incident.
It's not my fault that I'm Japanese!
Yet... my worst crime is that I am!
Though I struck Chen...
he still liked you.
And he understood how I felt.
Yet...
look what happened!
That dog Furuya!
The boss put him up to this!
They'll never meddle in labour affairs again!
Let's go home!
Some nice hot soup will help you regain your vitality.
Let's go.
Let's go.
It may not help but I wish you'd talk to them about the treatment of the prisoners.
I'm asking you though it's no longer your job.
Yes, I'll talk to them,
My trip will cool us both off, I'll fix it up for you.
But the boss thinks more of Okazaki.
I'm boarding this run down truck.
You prefer the train of humanism...
I won't stop you.
You seem willing to pay the price.
Something I shouldn't know?
I've already offered my apologies.
We didn't say anything.
From now on, we'll have to escape from the work areas.
Wang wants us to lie low for a while.
And we haven't received any news from the others.
What's going on here?
Hide!
Wait!
How about it?
They're offering us 500 more prisoners.
We lack the accommodations.
No accommodation?
And also supervision?
Boss!
We just caught 7 prisoners who tried to escape.
Captured them?
Yes.
Good work!
You've done well.
The rascals almost got away.
From the pit?
From the ore dump.
That's not true.
You weren't there!
How could you know?
Escape?
In broad daylight?
Look at this!
Only the desperate would throw ore at me.
And so it's a break?
I'm not the only witness, It took 15 men to capture them.
Inside the compound?
You call that a break?
Why do you defend the Chinks?
Please excuse me...
You needn't bother!
Where are they?
They're in the guard house.
Captain...
I request instructions!
Let's see!
Shall we do it the way you suggested?
He's an expert swordsman.
How many men did you slay in China?
Please wait!
We don't have any proof yet.
Silence!
We have a witness, Any objections?
Yes!
An impassioned witness can't be trusted.
They all want to escape!
Would you have them all executed?
Why you!
Enough!
We needn't debate the matter here.
The important thing is that we recognize it as an attempt.
Sergeant, they will be executed tomorrow!
Details are left to you.
They will be executed tomorrow, sir!
Any objections?
You shall be witness to the execution.
By just giving testimony, you'll be saving the lives of men!
It was an attempt!
They ran!
They should have stayed and taken their beating.
What's going to happen to us?
If injuring Okazaki was a crime, why not just investigate me?
Heed me well!
You're all guilty of attempted escape.
Keep quiet!
Dog!
An investigation will bring out the truth.
Investigate us!
Investigate us!
The investigation is over.
I cannot believe that it was an attempted escape.
You're delivering us to the KEMPEITAI?
I don't intend to.
You were the one who never trusted me.
Perhaps it is better to continue to doubt my words.
Those men have authority.
I have no authority.
I'll do what I can until tomorrow evening.
The KEMPEITAI will listen to you!
It's an object lesson, Kaji.
It can't be...
Personally, I don't approve of it.
But Head Office says...
leave it to the KEMPEITAI.
Why?
Must there be a reason?
Please, wait!
Human heads are about to be chopped off.
If the company protested...
Don't forget... we are at war!
That's no reason!
You don't think so... but I do!
An idle discussion.
If you wish, you can talk to our Head Office.
I certainly will!
Hello.
Yes.
Sorry, no answer!
He's in conference.
He shouts and screams like a madman!
Yes... one moment, please.
Someone else will take it.
Okishima?
We're in real trouble.
You know about it?
Hello...
I can't hear you!
Speak louder!
I can't hear you!
What's that?
Give up?
Ridiculous!
Okishima!
Please... talk to them again.
Yes... yes... please, try again!
I'll be waiting.
I'll be honest...
Only one chance in a hundred!
Just as my companions stand on the borders of life and death, so do you now stand at an important crossroad.
That's true.
If you should fail now, no one will ever trust you again.
You will also lose faith in yourself.
Very true!
Yet... you would do nothing?
What can I do?
Must one outside this barbed wire ask me such a question?
All Japanese working here are not murderous devils.
Their combined opinion objecting to this execution will be more effective than you alone.
If I always acted as you wanted me to, there would be no Kaji here today.
I wish I could watch you when you're in my position.
Minor mistakes... you will make and so will I.
Such things can be forgiven.
But an error made at a crucial moment is an unforgivable crime.
Your life has been a series of errors stemming from the conflict between your work and yourself.
Such errors can possibly be corrected.
But not so for the crucial decision.
Then?
Then will be revealed the murderers who wear the mask of humanism.
And the ones worthy of the beautiful name... "man"
I realize that.
You have less faith in men than you try to believe.
Regardless of how you might feel, true men will always find fellow companions... somewhere!
What will happen to my man?
I only wish I knew myself!
When will we be released?
They won't kill Kao, will they?
Honestly?
He won't be killed?
Hello...
Okishima?
What's the decision?
Calm down and listen!
The manager is no help...
What?
The old chump!
Hello?
Hello?
Wait until the morning...
I'll talk to the Chairman.
What?
The Chairman?
Yes, the Chairman!
I'll make him listen to me.
Go away... please!
I want to be alone.
Mr. Kaji.
Save my man... please!
He wouldn't run away!
We planned to be married after the war ended.
Don't let them kill him!
Don't let them do it!
Please... please.
Go to sleep... you needn't worry!
I won't do anything.
There's nothing that I can do.
Can I really set my mind at ease?
Really?
Don't worry.
Go to sleep
I'll try to sleep, too.
What is it?
Where are you going?
I'll free those men!
Don't do it!
What will happen to you if you do?
It doesn't matter!
You've done everything you could.
Don't you care what happens to you?
I won't let you!
Michiko, don't torture me!
I'll call for help!
I won't let you do it.
You always go your own way.
Perhaps you are right.
But if you free those men...
then they'll surely kill you!
They'll kill you for sure!
Please... don't go!
I'll follow you...
I'll shout for help!
Michiko...
I'll no longer be a man!
Are my words those of some stray dog?
Even you... you don't want to give up this life... do you?
Remember... you promised!
I'm sorry... go and do as you see fit.
Perhaps I'm the one who's wrong
I couldn't bear standing in your way.
I don't want you hating me...
or not loving me.
I'm just no good!
All ready!
Good work.
It's best to wet the blade.
Keeps off the fat.
Kaji!
Stay there!
You're acting as my official witness.
Kaji... you may tell the men for me to attempt escape is to die!
- Next!
- Yes!
Want to try?
Yes!
- Next!
- Yes!
No...
I don't need it!
I demand an explanation!
Why are we being executed?
Damn you!
Japanese devils!
Stand up!
Stand up!
I'll go by myself!
Inhuman wretch!
This is your true form!
The face of a man... but the heart of a beast!
Good!
You show grit.
Stay calm!
Slash him!
Hurrah for China!
You fail because you think it's a human head.
Relax and try again.
Next!
No more!
That'll be enough!
What?
That'll be enough!
Stay out of this or I'll kill you too!
I'm no longer afraid.
Slay me if you dare.
Good...
I'll oblige.
Enemy sympathizers are better off dead.
Stop this massacre of our comrades!
Murderers!
Murderer!
Killers!
Murderer!
Murderer!
Murderer!
Murderer!
Murderer!
Murderer!
The execution is called off!
Go... go back to them!
You're coming with me.
Private Tenaka... take very good care of our honoured guest.
I'll return later.
Go!
Kaji won't be home today.
Did... did he do something?
Do something?
He refused to let us execute those enemy dogs!
He may be away some time...it depends!
Did he hide anything?
No!
It's because his way of thinking is no good.
Open the desk drawers.
Place everything on top of the desk.
Well... you feel like confessing now!
I only regret that I let you behead the first three victims.
You don't say!
You're a hopeless one.
Private Tanaka... you should show our guest more courtesy.
Kaji... don't you miss your wife?
She was crying.
No one to ride her belly from tonight.
What have I done?
I'm no boor...
I'd like to put you back on your wife's belly but in order to do so, I must have more cooperation from you.
What's so funny?
I neither pick pockets nor steal.
What shall I confess?
Interesting!
You needn't confess to anything until we make you.
Your bravado won't last long.
You let 11 POWs escape and failed to report it.
I'm waiting for an answer.
I didn't report it...
but I never let them escape!
You used Chen to contact the prisoners!
Show me evidence!
Will you lose face if I'm not found guilty?
You wanted something?
I didn't mean it to end up like this.
Quarrels over work are one thing but I don't need outside help for that.
I came to...
I understand.
But I didn't think Kaji would dare...
Kaji would dare do what...?
Oh... nothing!
I don't know how the others feel...
But I feel that what he did...
only he could do.
If that's how you feel, you can do as you please.
I dropped by to see if I could help you in any way.
Your help will not be needed.
What you can do is to admit that it was not an attempted escape.
Admit it!
You and Wang Heng Li helped them escape... didn't you?
Answer me... you scum!
Wang Heng Li was arrested and has confessed everything.
Wang was arrested?
He now awaits execution.
When will it be?
It worries you?
After all...
he was your friend!
Wang instigated the uprising at your request... am I right?
When will he die?
Answer my question!
All right!
Today I'll make you weep like a women.
I hope your wife hears you.
WANG HENG LI In Memorium
Wang... you have died without awaiting the dawn.
But your comrades will surely bury you by the light of the newborn day.
Come... out here!
Go inside!
Kiss her... don't let me stop you.
Michiko!
Why did you come?
Don't worry... go home!
I brought some rice balls...
may I offer them to him?
Won't you have some?
Michiko... when you need help, talk it over with Okishima.
Okishima...
look after her.
Mr. Okishima... he's being transferred.
I came to say goodbye.
I see.
I'm sorry I wasn't able to help.
I had a row with the manager and I'm being ousted.
I see.
I wanted to stay and argue some more with you.
Furuya takes over my spot.
That'll be the end.
Is there anything you need?
Nothing.
That means...
I won't see you anymore?
I learned so much from you.
No... that's for me to say.
Though you have paid a bitter price, you finally caught the humanism train.
Oh, yes...
Wang Heng Li...
Unnecessary conversation is not permitted!
Your time is up.
Private Tenaka!
Michiko!
As a special favour, I'm releasing you.
But I'm not setting you free.
Remember... my eyes will follow your every move.
Go where you may...
I'll always be there first.
I report back, sir.
It has come...
Kaji.
Emergency Call to Military Service.
I suspected as much!
So you wring me dry and cast me out.
I can't afford to lose you but there's nothing I can do.
Forget the smooth talk!
It's the easy way to rid yourself of the unwanted.
Far better to have trusted the harlots than the directors of this company.
Kaji...
Turn your duties over to Furuya.
We need a new leader for the prisoners.
Good men are scarce since Wang Heng Li escaped.
Escaped?
Wang Heng Li?
Along with 30 others.
So he got away!
Good for you, Wang!
Wonderful!
I hope they all get away.
Sir...
I wish you'd inform Furuya...
That Wang's escape saved him from a thorough beating.
I was going in there to thrash him...
not to hand over my work!
But suddenly...
I've changed my mind!
Probably because I found that I was in good company.
Japanese devil!
Japanese devil!
Kill me...
like you murdered Kao!
Kill me!
Why don't you kill me?
Japanese devil!
He murdered an innocent man!
Murderer!
Murderer!
Mr. Kaji.
Be not angry.
I know you have a good heart.
But you're not able to save Kao's life.
That's why...
You'll stumble, Michiko!
Welcome home!
Thank goodness!
One of the wives told me you had come back in terrible shape.
But it's not true!
You're looking fine.
Thank goodness, really, thank goodness!
This... what is it?
But they couldn't.
No... it's not fair!
They promised you military exemption.
A dirty trick!
This is too much... it's unfair!
Michiko... there's nothing that can be done now.
Why must they do this to you?
I've done nothing.
But I had hoped to accomplish things with you when I returned.
Why must you always be persecuted so?
Why do they pick on you?
You're so thin... and so full of scars.
And now they send you to the front.
Michiko!
You mustn't die... we must live again!
When will we be able to meet again?
You'll come back...
I know you will.
Japanese devil!
Japanese devil!
Japanese devil!
You die!
Michiko, let's go!
We still have 24 hours together.
Japanese devil!

It's not like you
Why?
You're running away!
Don't you want me?
Of course I do!
And I want you!
Yet we can't marry!
How many times do I have to tell you!
Because you may be called up at any moment?
I don't care if you're called up the day after we're married.
I'll cry no doubt
But happiness comes only through marriage
Then will you come to my dormitory?
Will you spend the night with me?
You'll come?
No... go back to your own dormitory
I couldn't do that to you
Weakling... coward!
I've had enough
SOUTH MANCHURlA STEEL CO.
Research Section
Hi!
A rare meeting I just dropped by... to say "goodbye"
Your call... it came?
And the date?
Tomorrow My papers came 5 days ago but I've been drinking ever since...
Aren't you marrying her?
Tomorrow you then it'll be me!
But that needn't be the end I'm a born optimist and I've had my share of earthly pleasures
I only regret that I haven't left the germ of life in the womb of some loving woman I may regret it, too
But I can't be as optimistic as you
The boss wants me... wait for me inside
No...
I'll see you tonight
Kaji seemed a bit upset
Going to remain just friends forever?
You had the spunk to come to work out here.
Throw yourself at him!
I did
He rejected you?
No. 12 and No. 13, stop that chatter!
I'll report you!
Supervision of Colonial Labor
What are you trying to say?
That men should be treated as men!
In colonial territories it lt's difficult?
I know
We profit by exploiting Chinese labor... wasn't that the idea?
Doesn't that conflict with your theory?
That's true
Mind if I smoke?
What do you think?
Without the contradiction my theory isn't needed
In other words, you feel it's possible to improve work records... is that it?
A possibility.
By the way, I want you to take over at the Loh Hu Liong mines
Any objections to being sent off into the hinterlands?
I'm not forcing you
You've analysed the situation quite well... on paper
Would you want it to end up on paper?
Of course not
Whenever you're ready to put your theories into actual practice
Exemption?
From military service?
You're not alone in the exemption There are dozens of others
A bad habit!
Leave well enough alone
The savage fighting continues with only one way of resisting
By facing a life sentence in prison
Neither of us had the courage to face up to it
Yes... you're right
A gift from Heaven!
Not even the commander of the Kwangtung Army ever dared slap me!
Go to Loh Hu Liong with Michiko
Michiko... his sweetheart?
is pretty?
The most beautiful girl in the world
But to me you're much more beautiful
You called yourself a shepherd's dog didn't you?
Why not?
A good dog can lead sheep to greener pastures and can earn their eternal gratitude
If such things exist
Me?
I'll take this one
My little Mannon, your hair has the aroma of dried grass
Michiko...
My best wishes go with you!
Go with Kaji to Loh Hu Liong!
Let this war go to the dogs!
You mustn't let happiness...
He may never come back... I won't be called up
Loh Hu Liong is a tiny Manchurian village
And we'll find there are iron ore and labor camps
Would you go with me to such a place?
I'd follow you... anywhere!
It may affect your whole life Think it over!
If the army ever called you to active duty
I'd even been planning to have a child by you
is that too absurd?
What a honeymoon!
What did you say?
The wind... and this dust!
I don't care!
It's wonderful!
Like gravel in my mouth!
Loh Hu Liong
You must think I'm blind!
Kaji from Head Office?
I'm Okishima.
We're working partners
What ever made you come to this hole?
Anything for love's sake, eh?
Yes, how do you do?
Please, this way
Haul their bags to their new quarters
I read your report... the one about supervision of labor
Filled with fancy words...
Oh, madam... please!
Men here don't go for fancy talk.
You'll have little in common
Thanks for your advice
Sorry!
Your own fancy talk sounds so out of place
Very well written!
Reaching the pith of the matter
Yes!
Reaching but not quite grasping
Why?
If I knew, I'd write a book!
I'll take your wife.
Go see the boss
Say, Furuya... show him the way!
I know this is nothing new, sir but our first shift requires 2,500 men
Only 1,500 turned up this morning
We're at war, Okazaki!
We must expect such shortages
You can't produce unless all conditions are perfect?
I didn't mean that, but Labor must help us
Kaji... reporting for work, sir!
You're Kaji?
I'll introduce you
2nd Pit Supervisor, Mr Higuchi
This is Mr. Kaji... sent by Head Office as Labor Supervisor
You're just in time.
Please, sit down
We're discussing our labor shortage Any good ideas?
I d like to talk to Okishima first and find how many men are available lf their labor conditions are improved all the men will report for work
Yes and in more concrete form?
Our employment system must be changed
The labor boss must be replaced by a direct employment system
You agree Kawashima?
And why so?
Because your name was Kaji?
You should know better!
We have some 200 labor groups here
How many have no rake-off system or don't cheat on food rations?
I doubt if such a group exists
But our problem is how to raise our work attendance rate
Laborers lose the desire to work
Regardless of how things are basically, laborers aren't what you make them out to be in theory
Once they earn more than they need,
A difference in opinion.
Such methods never gain results
But, Kaji, the theory may be correct and yet not apply in reality
Then... either the theory is wrong or the application is incorrect
Be that as it may.
Try it your way I respect revolutionary ideas
Yours is not a desk job. lt covers all aspects of the men's lives
Food rationing, the disposal of the excrements of 10,000 men, handling menstrual cases among women
Of women?
We have comfort quarters for our men
As Okishima will point out, there are 60-odd Manchu women
From today... you're their boss I'm glad to see you're not a bachelor
Go home now and do your duty by your wife... but don't overdo it!
But why must our group be disbanded?
Poor records... you've been raking off too much
Are you joking?
What's it all about?
Shall I show you the evidence?
Why need the company make trouble over our contracts with the men?
Our money is for the laborers
Yes... but your rolls have been over-padded
But Mr. Okazaki... I'm not Okazaki...
I'm Kaji of Labor!
Mr. Okishima, put in a good word for us.
We're like old buddies!
That's probably why I'm mouldy
And Kaji has been scrubbing me until I'm practically raw!
Mr. Supervisor... poor living quarters and poor food make our men sickly
I know!
lnadequate quarters... poor food!
Men can't work that way
But there is still greater evil.
Must I tell you?
You're that evil!
Now get this...
I give the men my word!
The food situation will improve
Better quarters will be considered
But it's no use as long as you exploit them
You make a practice of lending money to transient laborers and binding them for life
You squeeze as much profit out of them as you can
Your slave-drivers torture those who try to escape I won't allow such methods!
You won't?
And so what?
You're a mere employee of this company
Won't allow it, eh?
Try and stop us!
Any more threats and I'll kick your nuts in!
The gentlemen are having a bad day.
We'll come back
Mr. Muta!
You can keep this!
And I've sent your packages back
They left too peacefully!
They're up to something
A tour of inspection?
I'm grateful to you gentlemen
By the way... see to it that we get the men we need
The old man won't take excuses
Sure, you'll get them.
But don't kill 'em off too fast
What happened?
The lazy dogs refuse to move!
Beating them won't help
Cruelty makes them worse I take orders from Okazaki... not you!
What goes on here doesn't concern you
Then you refuse to stop?
Of course
Good!
From tomorrow you'll have no men to beat
What's that?
You're in the pit now
Then... don't!
From tomorrow you needn't come
Just returning home?
Want something?
Just one question.
Did you threaten to shut off our supply of labor?
Well... how about it?
We can discuss it in the morning
Morning?
I can understand why you'd prefer it so
Especially with one's wife watching...
Do you think so?
Answer my question!
What's with you?
Your brutality may cow your laborers, but I'm not impressed I warned your man
Mr. Kaji!
You surely know how important that ore is to us
What's so wrong about beating the men?
As long as the ore keeps coming out, why the fuss?
Which is more important... the ore...
or the men?
I never think of things in that way
One doesn't compare men with minerals
Kindness will produce more ore
Let me make it clear that Okazaki of Loh Hu Liong can't be changed by any of your half-baked ideas
I stick to my own way.
Remember that!
I will !
And I'll stick to my own ways
These gentlemen from the KEMPElTAl are offering us 600 special laborers
Special laborers?
Prisoners from North China.
All you need do is keep them fed
A heaven-sent blessing!
We're short of men here
Completely unexpected!
Yes!
Our Head Office will certainly be pleased
Kaji... talk it over with Okishima in what way?
I'll give the instructions I never repeat my instructions...
understand?
First: special laborers must be isolated from ordinary laborers
Second: their quarters will be enclosed with barbed wire
This barbed wire must be electrified.
Understand?
Food and labor are left in your hands but they must not escape!
How much electricity can you supply?
About 3,000 volts!
Good enough!
They will be delivered to you a week from today
Arrival time will be notified later.
Understand?
We won't be ready in a week!
Not too anxious to get help?
Kaji !
Why should we take over supervision of POWs?
Make all preparations
Wait !
I need your answer!
We understand!
We'll be ready
To be safe we need a whole platoon of armed men I hate being either aggressive or defensive.
Go if you wish!
Why play the hero in front of me?
Some day you'll appreciate me
Chen... how's your mother?
She's in and out of bed all day lll ?
Take good care of her
Mr. Kaji...
I wish to ask a favor
May I have some white flour from the storeroom
For your mother?
I wish I could help but I can't make any exceptions
Here she comes!
Chen... how does all this strike you?
They are your fellow countrymen who lived in anti-Japanese areas
They may be friends of your mother from Shantung
My mother raised me so as not to be anti-Japanese ln a battle area, you'd be murdered as a sympathizer
The key !
We haven't received it yet
From Loh Hu Liong?
Are you in charge?
What's your name?
Kaji
Yes...
Kaji!
I never forget a name
Never forget that these men are prisoners of war
To deal with them you must be military men at heart
Civilian negligence will not be tolerated!
We understand
You don't understand Kaji!
You think your seven men can handle 600 prisoners?
What if they escape?
We received no special instructions I assumed this meant no special danger
You're quite a bold one!
How old are you?
I am 28
You're married?
May I have the key?
You're a stubborn one!
I like 'em that way
You'll witness the transfer?
Don't be ridiculous!
I'm on official leave
You seem to feel that the army can make mistakes.
Don't worry!
When the army says 604... it's 604!
I don't care if they all die but they must not escape!
Dirty scum!
Get up!
Get up!
They unload this mess on us?
Hey!
Open the others
Down!
Come down!
Hurry up!
Get off!
Get off!
Line up... double file!
Mr. Kaji...
Mr. Kaji!
This looks bad!
They've steamed
Help me!
Help me!
Don't let them eat!
Stop them!
Get back!
Get back!
Don't eat that!
Don't eat that!
You'll all die!
Give me the whip!
The special laborers are unfit to work
Let them have a month's rest They're half dead!
Meaning these anti-Japanese elements will be fed without working?
If you had witnessed the scene I'm sure you'd agree with me, sir
They are POWs. ls that why 12 were allowed to die?
If you want 'em dead, stuff them with raw beans... they'll die!
Say... watch that tongue of yours!
What you're saying amounts to a denouncement of the military
I'll adopt your opinion just once more
Just once more?
Yes... just once more!
And why so?
You'd like to know?
Despite all your convictions, I just got a report from Furuya I shall overlook the matter this time
I give you all warning I know you all want to escape
However... you cannot escape from here lf you even try
Chen... release the dog!
Tomorrow means a new month of still higher production goals
The Directors have even discussed replacement of all top men here I will accept this disgrace if production increase is impossible
However, we have not yet done our utmost
Until we attain the 20% production increase demanded of us
Are there any dissenting opinions?
In the name of final victory, I refuse to listen to any of your excuses!
Mr. Koike... tell him he has my word I, Okazaki, vow that Pit No. 1 will top the new goal
And I'm sure you've no objections regarding my methods
Do as you think best!
The goal must be achieved
Understand?
Lash them on with still greater fury
Any Chinaman who shirks may be killed
Push them!
Whip them!
We need that extra 20% !
Men who top their quota will be amply rewarded
Remember!
We're at war here... at war!
Anyone here feel he can't do this?
Good!
Give 'em everything you have I'll assume all responsibility
Starting tomorrow, you will go to work
Rations will be kaoliang and bean-lees
The same as ordinary laborers
You don't smoke?
I did formerly
You stopped?
When we run out of tobacco, we suffer I can't believe Japanese will keep us supplied
Now that we've revived you, you would bear a grudge?
We were not fighting men
We have the right to demand release I haven't the authority to free you
Master... when we be free?
We all not soldier.
We no fight!
Japan soldier come...
make bad all Chinese woman...
Take away all man... bring here
No give us food... many die!
Not die... they killed!
I cannot set you free but I can promise that you will not be killed
Japanese speak clever words
Also write clever words
But never they keep promise
I believe your name was Kao?
Now remember this... you have been placed under our supervision
Whether that barbed wire remains or is removed, depends on you!
Hurry... walk faster!
Come on... march!
Step along there!
Mr. Kaji, if men escape, it mean trouble?
Why need they escape?
Those men work before in own village
Do they wish to work here?
Here they have no mother...
no wife... and no children
Kaji... how about those special laborers?
Why so many left?
They're the sick ones
Make sure they're not feigning illness I didn't come to find fault, but I'd like to see their quarters
No signs of any breaks?
No, I don't think so
They must be given some incentive I think so too
What do prisoners dream of the most?
Freedom, I suppose!
Freedom?
You must be a poet lt's women!
If they're men they dream of women
What did you dream of as a bachelor?
Of the ways of the Empire?
I doubt it!
The way to make prisoners work
But... women...
Very simple!
You supervise the comfort girls... send them inside ls it necessary?
You... do you want a woman?
See?
The word "woman" alone brings joy to their hearts
What is man?
He's not a poem!
Nor is he mortality!
A mere mass of matter formed of lust and greed!
I shall ask their leaders
Who gives your orders?
Prisoners or I?
I'm concerned over their welfare.
See that it's carried out!
Stop loafing!
Hurry up!
You dog!
Master... this man sick!
He maybe die
Have mercy... he sick man!
Save your whining for Kaji!
I don't care if you all die!
Dogs!
No want to see?
Sister Jin!
Mr. Kaji... welcome!
Mr. Kaji, you sleep with me?
I no want money
I'm sorry but I need 30 girls for the special laborers
The Labor Office will pay for them
They go inside barb wire?
Like all dogs... all sleep together?
If you don't like it, you may refuse
No one can help...
we work girls I send 30 girls tomorrow
Don't be crazy!
We can't work with people watching!
Do you realize how many men there are in that compound?
Don't come if you'd rather not I refuse... even if the others go
You want to be a shirker?
What do you mean?
I said it for all of us
Talking big!
Go... if you wish!
Be quiet!
You don't make the decisions
I'll decide what to do
Nightime... 30 girls go... all right?
Yes... send them
What's wrong?
The foreman did him in
Where?
Pit No. 3
Okazaki, eh?
Rush him to the First Aid Station
He can't get away with this!
I'll charge him with manslaughter
Come, now... relax!
It was unwise of him to use force but he only did it in his eagerness to increase production
After all, his motives were patriotic
Okazaki may be a brute.
But only with this brutality can one operate that large pit
We need him just as we need you to keep our 10,000 men in line
After all we're at war!
To achieve the ultimate victory, one must overlook the minor errors
An error?
A human being was murdered!
Kaji...
I warn you again... relax!
Think it over... you'll see!
Can we exchange a good, hard-working Japanese for the life of one mere laborer?
That's not the point!
If you insist on pressing charges include me as an accomplice I'll see that the suit goes unfavorably for you I can do it, you know
You'd dare distort the truth?
Sir... will you see that it never happens again?
How shall we report it?
Report it as an accidental death
You think I'll write that fake report?
What else can we do!
I refuse to write it!
Yes, you will!
If I fake that report I'd become an accomplice
What are you going to do?
I'll get Okazaki!
You fool!
Why try to be a hero?
You'll just run out of wind!
Why ruin your own future with his?
Mr. Kaji
One of our men was persecuted.
What became of him?
He died
And the culprit...
was he arrested?
He's still working
Will there be no trial?
I suppose not lf you wish to make excuses make them before my men
No...
I'm waiting for some girls
You promised not to kill!
You're no better than other Japanese!
If you treat me like a murderer just because I'm a Japanese you'll be losing the only friend you have
Friend?
You needn't believe me
Stop it!
Does this man's death mean that we may also die?
I won't let them do it!
Women... women!
Open the gate!
Let the girls in 10 girls to a barrack...
time limit: 10 p.m
We're here... as I promised
Why do you send us women?
Think as you please!
I'm just obeying orders
You send us harlots and let us sleep with them like dogs so that we will work harder?
What's that about harlots?
I wouldn't talk so big!
You wouldn't understand
Why make such a fuss?
You're no better off than we are
Do you feel no shame?
I didn't come of my own free will!
I refused to come!
Isn't it the same with you?
Do you enjoy digging for ore here?
I'm sorry
Welcome home!
You must be tired
Look... isn't it wonderful?
Her first egg!
She cackled so loud
What is it?
is anything wrong?
Not necessarily...
Don't you want to come home?
What happened?
Tell me about it
Would you want a husband who runs a whorehouse?
What do you mean?
You'd vomit if I told you
What happens... with 600 men and only 30 women?
And now I'm an accomplice of murderers!
That's not true!
Even the prisoners won't trust me any more
Given time... you'll gain their trust
Leave me alone for awhile
I like that!
Since those men came you've changed completely
You think so?
I feel that I'm fighting a lone battle
You leave early every morning...
And you always return late
During that time... you work
Meanwhile, I putter around the house and go out to do my shopping lt's like doing nothing
Yet...
I try to convince myself that what little I do will help to keep you going
Otherwise, I'm nothing but an ordinary housekeeper!
I'm sorry... forgive me!
It's now become an obsession
Stop worrying about it...
Just for now... lt was nice talking to you
When one is confined here one loses contact with the outside
Thank you!
What's the matter?
I'm a professional woman!
I'm sorry to have taken your time I just wanted to talk
You plan to escape, don't you?
It's impossible... with all that barbed wire
And it's charged with electricity
You mustn't do anything rash!
Man is such a weak creature
No amount of squirming ever changes the course of events
You're wrong!
Man can become as strong as he wishes
He need only find the cause of his unhappiness
Want to make some money?
By selling my girls elsewhere?
I don't go in for such deals lt's not women!
More laborers?
That's not quite what I meant
Those prisoners?
Too dangerous!
A single mistake and it could mean this lt's easy!
Escaped prisoners bring big profit lf you help me I'll split the profit with you lt's easy money!
What do I do?
The best way... is to do it like this!
The electricity... just flick it off!
Someone asked you to do it?
My buddy... the Japanese assistant, Muta, who was just fired lt's too pitiful... to sell those men!
You can't expect any sympathy from me!
I'm a Korean...
looked down upon by both Japanese and Chinese!
Keep moving!
Learned One the Italians seem to have surrendered
Oh?
The downfall of Germany cannot be far off.
Our time nears...
When will it be?
Six months... perhaps a year!
We must be patient
What's going on here?
You scums!
Thanks!
This'll help revitalize my man and our young assistants lf Okazaki picks up any more vitality, it'll mean trouble for you
Didn't you know?
Women prefer it that way
Ma'am... it might be wiser to send some of that flour to Kaji's wife
Why, yes, a good idea!
I'll do that
Good day, sir!
Welcome!
You want dumplings?
Can you loan me a bag of white flour?
My mother wishes some before she dies
One bag?
Why don't you go get some?
The Japanese sneak out our rationed flour and they're eating their fill I can't do that
After all...
Mr. Kaji trusts you
My flour was sneaked out by the keeper with the big mole lt's stolen property!
You still wish to buy some of it?
Let him have half a bag!
Young one... don't forget that you are Chinese and born of a Chinese mother
Go ask the one with the big mole
Don't do things so openly I saw Okazaki's wife leaving here
I hate to butt in but you're making a mistake
People appreciate the mistakes I make lt's an old custom here lt's one that should be broken!
Unpleasant as it might be, that's my job lf it ever happens again, I'll have to order an inventory
Mr, Kaji
We often wonder if you're one of us or just a puppet of the Chinese
So what?
Oh... that's all!
But your sense of justice is tempered by the fact that you can't take home some flour to your own wife
Remove your dirty feet when speaking to me!
Do you need my help?
You fool!
They'll see your light
Go easy tonight
Hurry!
It's the watchman
What's taking you so long?
Get going!
I'm so happy!
You've never slept with a woman before, have you?
You'll do it for me, won't you?
and have him shut off the current for just three minutes I'll see that you're well rewarded
Then you can buy all the flour you want without pretending to be a thief
Can't you make up your mind?
Hey...
Big Mole!
Well, Chen... how'd it go?
Did you get a good price?
Or... did you eat it?
Free white flour must taste good!
What's up, Matsuda?
Well, now...
I wonder... lt seems that even saints have thieves as underlings...
Mr. Kaji I'm willing to overlook it this time
However... for my reference, I'd like to see how you handle this
Chen... stand up!
Look at me!
You didn't do it ?
I did...
You did it alone?
Matsuda, I hope you're satisfied
Before I expose all your dirty doings... get out!
Chen... what's the matter?
I was a thief... and Mr. Kaji struck me
Kaji?
He struck you?
It's nothing!
Mr Kaji is Japanese...
I am Chinese lt's all that simple!
Sister Jin is occupied now
I think the man is a Korean
A Korean?
Cute one
Have you been fighting?
Let me use your room awhile
What's ailing you?
I can't understand it myself!
Foolish one!
You act like one having her first love affair I can't seem to forget Kao
Love at first sight... with a man inside that barbed wire
Why not use your room?
It's in disorder
Why do you ask?
All Japanese are the same!
They don't consider us human beings
Please...
Go to the power station and do as I ask you I can't!
I couldn't commit treachery for money I realize that!
You're a good man
But those men in there are prisoners
They'll be exploited and later killed
Can they really be saved?
Of course!
But the only one who can do it is you!
Later... please!
Go do as I ask
I understand I'm Chinese, too!
I'm ready to do my bit
At exactly 1 a.m when the siren sounds, I'll cut the current
But only for 2 minutes!
That's the best I can do
Two minutes?
Watch out!
That packs 3,300 volts!
Be careful!
Don't let them see you
They mustn't see you leaving
My regards to our brothers inside the barbed wire
They're in love!
It's not business lf it's love we won't pay
You're joking!
A prisoner and a harlot in love!
It's so romantic!
But... what will come of it?
Nothing can come of it as long as there is a war going on
All they can hope for is their love
Can't you let them marry?
Yes...
I'd like to if it's possible I'm sure you'd want to help them I'd like to... but it ends right there!
Have some... they're delicious!
Rare, isn't it?
It was given to us
By whom?
Try to guess it was Okazaki's wife!
Send them all back!
We can't... now!
I can't send them back now!
Return them!
Tell her that I was furious
But... why?
You ask me why?
Why so angry?
She brought them to try to make up with us
The murderer stole that flour!
Can't you see?
Can't you understand what I'm trying to do here at this mine?
I'm afraid not!
How could I when you never tell me anything?
Of course, even I can guess where the flour and sugar came from
But women can't always live by hard-headed rules I didn't accept for myself!
Well, you needn't have bothered accepting for me!
Because it was the Okazaki's?
What if it were Mrs. Okishima?
I'd still refuse!
Yes... you're just the kind who would!
I understand you struck Chen... I know you didn't want to...
yet you did!
Why?
Because he committed a wrong?
No!
You could have forgiven him such a minor matter
You did it because he made you lose face in front of others
For one who plans great things you've a small mind!
It's all beyond you!
That's not true !
I even know what the people are saying about you!
And what are they saying?
That you try to take all the credit
I didn't believe them!
I thought it was merely spite... but now...
Believe as you wish!
Where to ?
I've kept thirty women waiting!
Marriage?
It's impossible!
We can marry!
After the war is over ls it ending soon?
Not very long now... it will end
But... they'll take you away again!
No, Yang Chun Lan it is ending in victory for China
We are going to be free again!
I'd prefer things as they are
Why?
When that day comes, I won't be able to see you
But...
I'm asking you to marry me!
There are plans to escape from here but I will not run away as long as you are here
You won't run away... you promise?
It seems I'm running to extremes again
You brute!
I'm thinking of helping those two get married
Hello what's that?
They escaped?
Yes... we'll be right over!
Eleven men!
I won't bother asking for information
We'll soon know who planned the break I won't ask for details
But I want you to understand one thing
We've tried our best to help you lf you cannot trust us and continue in your efforts to escape
those who remain behind will face reprisals and a further increase of hard labor
And I will not raise a finger to protect you!
You think that you can get away with an hing while here
But if Kaji and I decide to do so we can always pack you into those freight cars and send you back
They escaped without our knowing!
We only serve liason purposes
We can't stop them even if we learn of the plot
Don't lie!
What if I said that Wang Heng Li plotted this break?
It no lie... we don't know!
I no run away
You fools!
Do you think we d take you words for it?
I wish you'd all run away!
I will not run!
I will stride boldly out of this compound
Where will you go after you leave?
Not all Japanese are soft-hearted.
Run away and see for yourself
I will not keep you, Wang.
Whether this camp remains a haven will depend on your future actions
Ultimate responsibility to the KEMPElTAl lies with me... not you!
lnvestigate the matter thoroughly
And find some alibi for the KEMPElTAl
Where's Kaji?
You stood by while those men escaped?
That's not true
You took all precautionary measures?
Must you be reminded that those prisoners cost us dearly?
You damaged the prestige of our imperial forces
Start explaining!
The only explanation is their desire to escape
Why did you let them escape?
Answer me!
There's no need to shout
We have 10,000 laborers here aside from your prisoners
No matter how hard we try they'll manage to escape
One question...
We reported the truth lf l had reported them dead I could have avoided trouble
Don't you want the truth?
I admit your honesty
But inadequate supervision cannot be excused
I shall overlook your negligence on this occasion
No more men must be allowed to escape lf they do, I shall personally slay the leader of that group
We understand
How about it?
Do you want me to intimidate them?
It won't be necessary
Refusing aid from the military indicates your supreme confidence
Hereafter, I'll hold you personally responsible in this matter I understand
And you?
Do you understand?
I do
That's all for today
No... wait!
Don't do it!
Leave me alone !
Don't take it out on the men
You struck Chen in a fit of temper!
Don't try to pull your humanism on me
Yes... and I already regret it But why need you ape me?
Don't let your ire ruin my work
Your job ?
Yes... my work!
We've kept you in step so far but you're turning away
Can't you see?
Force has meaning only when overcoming tyrrany I've had enough of your lectures!
You intend to leave them alone?
I'll talk to them
I mince no words!
I don't want your men to keep trying to escape
As far as you men are concerned, I am your friendliest enemy.
I pride myself in the fact that there is no hostility in my work.
Despite the dilemmas which come of our being at war, I have tried to protect your interests.
What you say ... is difficult.
is it?
Eat your fill.
We can talk at our leisure.
When one of your comrades was killed I did not adopt just measures to protect you.
Therefore, you no longer trust me.
This is only natural.
However ...
I shall do my utmost to correct this mistake.
This may take considerable time but I hope you will trust me and be patient.
No one wishes to risk dangers to break out?
Let me speak for my friend, Kaji.
Since Kaji arrived here the laborers' has greatly improved.
This also applies to you.
However, if you continue to break out I cannot say what the KEMPElTAl might do.
I don't know how Kaji feels but the only way to save my own neck
is to send you back to the KEMPElTAl.
He speaks no falsehoods.
We can talk over our mutual problems.
How about you, Kao?
If you can marry Yang Chun Lan, will you stay until the war ends?
Tales which begin with the word "if"
do not interest me.
Can't you understand?
We want to talk things over.
Fawning toad-eater!
It's the same old Japanese trick!
They always promise to do this and to do that .... but they never carry it out.
Stand up!
You dog!
Go to Yang Chun Lan and learn the ways of human beings.
By the way, Wang ... if I ...
There's the "if" again.
If I gain for you the freedom enjoyed by other laborers, will you promise to remain here?
To wait seems to be the only safe liberty.
You promise?
Wang ... you must trust me!
Do you think they trust me?
You want to believe they do?
I want to believe Wang when he said that he'd wait.
You plan to continue sending the girls inside?
Why?
Just a hunch ...
And I also plan to take about 50 men for outside work.
With guards?
No ... just myself.
Such strange hunches aren't like you.
Why not be honest?
Admit that you'd let them escape ... if you could!
That's nonsense
When that happens, I stand to lose my neck, too.
Remember that!
When they come here, they seem happy.
Your mother ... how is she?
Does she still yearn for white flour?
She's given up hope.
I'm sorry that I struck you.
I'm hard-headed in some ways ...
I know!
That's allright.
is Sai who works at the power station a friend of yours?
Yes.
The current was shut off ...
And Sai was on duty that night.
If he did it, he mustn't do it again.
All right!
Back to work!
They could have run away.
They're beginning to trust you.
No ... they're just being wary.
They fear a trap.
You're giving it up?
No ...
I'll continue.
It's dangerous!
They might kill you and escape.
I don't think so.
This bath feels good!
Why don't you come in, too?
I think I will.
If the laborers calm down, let's go on a vacation.
Let's do!
How many days can you take off?
Three days ... at most!
That's wonderful!
Well ... if they really come down ...
Some day you'll be a great supervisor but youth will have vanished by then.
That's not for me!
You win!
What you say is probably the truth.
Will you ?
Sure ... we'll go.
Make no mistakes, Cho ..
fix that barbed wire!
Kaji will be off on a 3-day leave.
We'll do it while he's away.
There's more of a profit in it but it's more dangerous.
With things going smoothly, Kaji has relaxed his guard - but watch out for Okishima!
It's an ideal chance!
Let's pull another fast one and make ourselves scarce.
Yeah ... getting away is the important thing.
is Jin Tung Fu in?
She's in bed with the cute one.
How about you?
I'm having trouble!
Chen won't help any more.
He won't do it.
Once is as bad as 100 times!
He dislikes our company.
Oh?
Except when he's in bed with you?
He wants me to break away, too.
Has the dog squealed on us?
He wouldn't do that!
How do you know ?
Don't stop him.
Send him home!
Jin Tung Fu is some woman, eh?
Was it good?
I hear Kaji is going on leave this Saturday.
Have the power cut while he's gone.
Sai isn't going on duty during those nights.
Well then when ?
Friday night.
Then make it Friday night.
He can't!
He's under suspicion.
Who ?
Mr. Kaji ...
What can he do without evidence?
Listen carefully, you brat!
Play it straight and I'll fix it so Jin Tung Fu will be all yours.
You'll do it ...
you'll be a good boy!
If you refuse ...
you and Sai will die!
Oh!
I feel great!
We arrived in a whirl of dust but it's nice today!
You're worried?
I'm wondering why I didn't do this before ...
I mean it!
When we arrive in town, I must phone Yasuko
Do you mind?
And then?
We'll have lunch together and go to the apple orchard.
It's all so wonderful ...
I feel as light as a balloon!
I beg just one liberty.
Just one hour ... will you let me go?
What for?
Our record is improving, I want to see the director about the status of the prisoners.
Just one hour?
The remainder is all yours.
All right!
I'll give you 2 hours, But not a minute more!
Mr. Kaji!
They escaped again!
And Okishima?
He's over at their camp, I'll go right away
No ... please!
I'm sorry but I can't go now!
Go on alone and have a good time with Yasuko.
But ...
I want you!
But this is my job.
I don't care!
You're on vacation.
You don't have to go back now!
Leave it to Okishima ...
I'll wait till after lunch.
I'll never make it.
You don't want to do!
Stop it!
Your work ... yes!
But do you know how important this is to us?
I'll make up for it!
You needn't bother!
Why the fuss over such a tiny matter?
Such a tiny matter?
You don't care how I feel about it.
At any rate, I can't leave now, I see!
Then I'll go by myself.
Stop ... stop it!
From now on, I do things my own way!
And ruin everything I've done?
This is a way of making them understand!
Brute force solves nothing!
Do you realize how many got away?
1 men led by Hwang and Sung!
You still want to talk it over?
I'll assume all responsibility.
If you don't like my methods, you can quit and save your own neck.
I accept your offer.
Wang!
Stand up!
I've despaired of you all!
You gave your word, I may seem like a fool to you but now I've had enough!
Another break and you all go without food for 3 days, I'll break your authority in the camp.
All Japanese are the same!
Good!
I shall act accordingly.
All promises are hereby retracted.
I realize now that there can be no truth between us.
Mr. Okishima!
And the report to the KEMPElTAl?
We're in for it this time!
I won't report the incident.
If it leaks out, I'll assume all responsibility.
I know it's not all your fault.
You think someone shut off the power?
I couldn't say.
How about a Japanese night shift?
We couldn't ... without evidence.
Should I increase the night watch?
I'd have to check each night to see if they're on duty.
Eighteen men ... that's a big loss!
I've achieved our new production goal and I want no trouble of such nature.
May I report that Okishima is herewith relieved of all responsibility for the prisoners?
Tell me!
Who paid you the money?
Okishima favors aggressive measures but Kaji always vetoes him.
Meaning he gives tacit consent to the runways?
I wouldn't say that ...
but it does all seem rather suspicious.
There is one way we can teach them a lesson.
Let them plan another break .
and we'll foil them,
With your permission, I'd like to try.
Sounds interesting!
If it brings results, I'll try anything,
Give it a try,
Boss's orders ...
flour and oil rations for just the Japanese ... of course!
I'm sure you don't approve.
I do not!
Unfortunately' however, you're not the manager.
It's fortunate for you that I'm not!
Mr. Kaji!
It's Mr. Okishima ...
Kill the rat!
Let us take care of this Korean dog!
You stay out of this!
Swipe men from under my nose, eh?
Not stopping me today?
You want me to?
You disapprove?
Should I lay off the ordinary laborers, too?
Your so-called humanism is apt to harbor rascals like this one,
Chen ... the medical ward!
Leave the cur be!
His boss will pick him up,
Take him!
Call ...
Furuya ...
Don't worry, young one!
They can't make me talk.
Chen ... it seems I know more about you than you do about me.
Go tell Kaji the wounds are slight.
We don't want him around here.
Well?
How is he?
He'll be all right.
Mr. Furuya is with him,
Furuya?
Furuya ... send a telegram to Muta ...
That rat Okishima!
The man says he'll sue Okishima,
Help him arrange it.
He's your friend.
You needn't explain!
I'm not that dumb,
Was it money?
Or just to make trouble for me?
Don't worry!
I won't tell the boss.
See that your buddy is hospitalized.
But you're paying for him ... not labor!
You've already made enough.
What kept you so long?
What's wrong with you?
You're drunk!
You think I came to make trouble?
I had a drink with the boss but I'm not drunk.
I bring tidings!
They're issuing commendations to the deserving.
Okazaki will get one of them.
I told the boss that you were the one who earned the award in the labor end,
The boss felt the same but he feared that it might hurt my feelings?
Do you think it would hurt my feelings?
Why have you turned to brute force?
The boss asked the same question.
Just say ...
I was born a brute.
How long will you carry on as you are?
What do you mean by that ?
You're ignoring the contradictions and trying to justify them.
I ran out of breath waiting.
If I'm in your way, just say so.
Kao!
I was afraid you might have escaped.
That is all I could buy today.
We can't meet for the time being.
I won't be able to come here.
If you run off by yourself I'll die on this fence.
I'll take you with me when I escape.
When?
After I learn how the others have fared.
I can't take any chances with you . accompanying me.
You will stay here?
They might let us be married.
Don't believe them!
The learned Wang says the war will soon end.
Japan will be defeated.
Now that I have you - l'm willing to bear an hing.
I wish we could meet like this every night.
But it's better not to come so often.
They'll become suspicious.
This cursed wire!
Watch out!
God is unjust!
I love you!
And I love you!
Can't you sleep?
Kaji would have been happier if he had married a girl like you.
You're too much the wife, Michi.
You're forgetting to be a woman.
What do you mean?
Being a wife is a profession.
But it's the woman that men love.
When you typed Kaji's reports, you studied it like one possessed.
I never understood a word.
And now?
Do you talk about his work?
He hates my pestering him.
If I were you, I'd pester him until he told me about everything.
Then ...
I'd ask more questions.
What's wrong?
Was I too outspoken?
I wanted to apologize.
I was a poor wife ... and a poor woman.
I couldn't sleep.
This is your home ...
lie down and get a good rest.
Promise me ... that you'll share your joys and sorrows with me.
Sorrow for one is enough.
It's not!
The road which you take is also the road for me.
What matters if we get lost?
I want you to take me along.
I will follow you.
And I'll do my best to keep up.
I understand.
If I'm slow ... will you slow down just a tiny bit?
Just a very tiny bit?
Of course.
I won't repeat a question twice.
Through fitting leadership in the pit you have helped achieve the 20 increase in ore production.
You have rendered valuable service to our armed forces and have proven yourself a fitting example for other employees.
You are herewith officially commended.
Chairman of the Board, Jushiro Kitada.
Read in proxy by Junichi Kuroki.
Looks like we'll have rain.
Rainy nights are ideal for escapes.
When you deliver their food, tell them they can break out tonight.
Tonight?
Then you go to the power station and say that Kaji wants the power cut ...
But ...
Mr. Kaji .
I'm under direct orders from the boss.
You want me to tell the KEMPElTAl about you?
About how you and Jin Tung Fu helped them escape?
And how Kaji knew about it but pretended not to notice?
It's the only way to save your neck.
Mr. Kaji, I look forward to your continued favors.
You're young ... but you're quite a fellow!
On the day you first came ...
when it was snowing ...
No ... just windy!
Was that right?
On that day, I thought that a young squirt like you could never handle this mine.
However ... things did work out as you said.
You're really great!
But, Mr. Kaji ...
I've been watching.
You haven't been drinking ...
Lend me a hand.
If you want to try, tonight is your last chance.
Why this suddeness?
Let it pass if it's inconvenient.
But my friend is being shifted to day duty from tomorrow.
There's no mistake?
On behalf of the men in the pit and for the sake of friendship, I challenge Mr. Kaji to a friendly drinking bout.
I'm beaten already.
No ... that won't do!
You can't be ... we haven't started yet!
I'm really beaten.
Does your spirit show only when you're snarling to me?
Come on ... take it like a man!
Good!
If you want to drink ...
Drink with this!
Get drunk and let down your guard.
He's right !
They can take it!
They're used to being wined and dined.
Women' too!
They run the whorehouse and have their pick.
We're wined and dined, eh?
And the whores are ours for the taking?
Bring on your wine and women!
I'll take 'em on!
Chen
Delivered their meal?
Special flour rations for the Japanese.
You're welcome to mine.
But your wife
My wife has abandoned hope.
Mr. Kaji ... lt's nothing .
I just wanted to say, "Thank you."
I should thank you. I was afraid you wouldn't accept it from me.
That's a shapely rump!
Stop it!
You act like a dog in heat.
Your right.
Sow your seed in your own paddy field!
I wouldn't act so big, Okishima!
If guys like you and Kaji would mind your own business, I could have topped our goal long ago.
And if we hadn't butted in, you'd have 10 killings to your credit.
And be dining in the pen.
You rat!
If you want trouble, come on!
Chen ... what's the matter?
What should I do?
I won't be able to see you again.
I've fallen into a trap.
Go to the station and have him cut off the power.
If I should do so and the men are captured ...
They'll kill me!
This is a Japanese plot.
No matter what happens, you won't be killed.
You talk as if it didn't concern you.
If I'm caught, I might confess everything.
Don't frighten me.
You dragged me into this.
Where to?
I'll warn them!
You'll never get word to them.
I can try.
Wait!
I have a better idea.
Chun Len -
Kao is breaking out tonight.
Kao is escaping?
Tell him it's dangerous tonight.
I won't let him escape alone!
Drink it!
It will relax you.
I couldn't contact him!
Are you sure he's escaping?
You met no one?
With this downpour, I couldn't see a thing.
Not a soul?
is he really breaking out?
What'll we do now?
If he runs off by himself - l'll kill myself!
The power must be cut off!
We mustn't anger the Japanese.
What will you do?
The best way is to confess the whole thing to Mr. Kaji.
Don't!
He's the severest of them all.
Where to?
Go to the station!
I expected so much!
Did you do as I told you?
I did.
You didn't mention the matter to Kaji, did you?
I didn't.
Whether you did as I ordered ... or not.
We'll soon find out.
If you betrayed us ... you'll die!
We'll report you as having been shot helping the men to escape.
We'll even be rewarded.
They're coming!
Mr. Furuya!
The power ...
I haven't ...
Dog!
You want to be killed?
I can't believe that Chen was behind it all.
I've been blind!
Furuya - l hadn't believed you capable of such a diabolic plot!
Go brag to the boss of your brave deed.
And you, Weng
You're not always right either.
Mistaken leadership caused this.
You refused to trust us.
The result is charred human flesh.
It serves you right!
Chun Lan
Gaze upon him who murdered his friends.
Okishima came and told me about it.
Why didn't Chen come to me?
He was afraid ... probably.
Because I struck him?
Okishima was saying that you'd brood over this incident.
It's not my fault that I'm Japanese!
Yet ... my worst crime is that I am!
Though I struck Chen ...
he still liked you.
And he understood how I felt.
Yet ...
look what happened!
That dog Furuya!
The boss put him up to this!
They'll never meddle in labor affairs again!
Let's go home!
Some nice hot soup will help you regain your vitality.
Let's do.
Let's go!
It may not help but I wish you'd talk to them about the treatment of the prisoners
I'm asking you though it's no longer your job.
Yes, I'll talk to them,
My trip will cool us both off, I'll fix it up for you,
But the boss thinks more of Okazaki
I'm boarding this run down truck,
You prefer the train of humanism, I won't stop you,
You seem willing to pay the price.
Something I shouldn't know?
I've already offered my apologies,
We didn't say an hing.
From now on, we'll have to escape from the work areas,
Wang wants us to lie low for awhile,
And we haven't received any news from the others.
What's going on here?
Hide!
How about it?
They're offering us 500 more prisoners,
We lack the accomodations.
And also supervision?
We just caught prisoners who tried to escape,
Fine ... good work!
The rascals almost got away
From the pit?
From the ore dump
That's not true
You weren't there!
How could you know?
Escape?
In broad daylight?
Look at this!
Only the desperate would throw ore at me,
And so it's a break?
I'm not the only witness, lt took 15 men to capture them inside the compound?
You call that a break?
Why do you defend the Chinks?
You needn't bother!
Where are they?
They're in the guard house
Captain ...
I request instructions!
Let's see!
Shall we do it the way you suggested?
He's an expert swordsman How many men did you slay in China?
Wait!
We don't have any proof yet,
Silence!
We have a witness, Any objections?
Yes!
An impassioned witness can't be trusted
They all want to escape!
Would you have them all executed?
Enough!
We needn't debate the matter here.
The important thing is that we recognize it as an attempt,
Sergeant, they will be executed tomorrow!
Details are left to you.
They will be executed tomorrow, sir!
Any objections?
You shall be witness to the execution,
By just giving testimony, you'll be saving the lives of men!
It was an attempt!
They ran!
They should have stayed and taken their beating,
What's going to happen to us?
If injuring Okazaki was a crime, why not just investigate me?
Heed me well!
You're all guilty of attempted escape,
Quiet!
Dog!
An investigation will bring out the truth, investigate us!
lnvestigate us!
The investigation is over, I cannot believe that it was an attempted escape,
You're delivering us to the KEMPElTAl?
I don't intend to
You were the one who never trusted me,
Perhaps it is better to continue to doubt my words,
Those men have authority, I have no authority,
I'll do what I can until tomorrow evening,
The KEMPElTAl will listen to you!
It's an object lesson, Kaji,
Personally, I don't approve of it,
But Head Office says ...
leave it to the KEMPElTAl,
Why ?
Must there be a reason?
Please, wait!
Human heads are about to be chopped off, lf the company protested ,
Don't forget ... we are at war!
That's no reason!
You don't think so ... but I do!
An idle discussion, lf you wish, you can talk to our Head Office.
I certainly will!
Sorry, no answer!
He's in conference.
He shouts and screams like a madman!
Yes .. one moment, please
Someone else will take it,
Okishima?
We're in real trouble, You know about it?
Hello ...
I can't hear you!
Speak louder!
I can't hear you!
What's that?
Give up?
Ridiculous!
Please .., talk to them again,
Yes ... yes ... please, try again!
I'll be waiting.
I'll be honest ...
only one chance in a hundred!
Just as of my companions stand on the borders of life and death, so do you now stand at an important crossroad.
That's true, lf you should fail now, no one will ever trust you again,
You will also lose faith in yourself,
Very true!
Yet ... you would do nothing?
What can I do?
Must one outside this barbed wire ask me such a question?
All Japanese working here are not murderous devils.
Their combined opinion objecting to this execution will be more effective than you alone,
If I always acted as you wanted me to, there would be no Kaji here today.
I wish I could watch you when you're in my position,
Minor mistakes ... you will make and so will I
Such things can be forgiven,
But an error made at a crucial moment is an unforgivable crime.
Your life has been a series of errors stemming from the conflict between your work and yourself,
Such errors can possibly be corrected,
But not so for the crucial decision,
Then ?
Then will be revealed the murderers who wear the mask of humanism and the ones worthy of the beautiful name ... "man."
I realize that
You have less faith in men than you try to believe.
Regardless of how you might feel, true men will always find fellow companions .,.. somewhere!
What will happen to my man?
I only wish I knew myself!
When will we be released?
They won't kill Kao, will they?
Honestly?
He won't be killed?
Hello ...
Okishima?
What's the decision?
Calm down and listen!
The manager is no help ., the old chump!
Wait until the morning ...
I'll talk to the Chairman,
What ?
The Chairman ?
Yes, the Chairman!
I'll make him listen to me
Go away ... please!
I want to be alone
Save my man ... please!
He wouldn't run away!
He planned to be married after the war ended
Don't let them kill him!
Don't let them do it!
Go to sleep ... you needn't worry!
I won't do an hing,
There's nothing that I can do,
Can I really set my mind at ease?
Really?
Don't worry.
Go to sleep
I'll try to sleep, too
What is it?
Where are you going?
I'll free those men!
Don't do it!
What will happen to you if you do?
You've done eve hing you could
Don't you care what happens to you?
Michiko, don't torture me!
I'll call for help!
I won't let you do it,
You always go your own way, Perhaps you are right
But if you free those men... then they'll surely kill you!
Please ... don't go !
I'll follow you ...
I'll shout for help!
Michiko ...
I'll no longer be a man!
Are my words those of some stray dog?
Even you ... you don't want to give up this life... do you?
Remember ... you promised!
I'm sorry ... go and do as you see fit,
Perhaps I'm the one who's wrong I couldn't bear standing in your way,
I don't want you hating me ... or not loving me
No ...
I'm just no good!
All ready !
It's best to wet the blade.
Keeps off the fat.
Kaji !
Stay there !
You're acting as my official witness.
Kaji... you may tell the men for me to attempt escape is to die !
Want to try ?
Next !
No...
I don't need it !
I demand an explanation !
Why are we being executed ?
Japanese devils !
Stand up !
I'll go by myself !
lnhuman wretch !
This is your true form !
The face of a man... but the heart of a beast !
Good !
You show grit.
Stay calm !
Slash him !
Hurrah for China !
You fail because you think it's a human head.
Relax and try again.
Next !
No more !
That'll be enough !
Stay out of this or I'll kill you too !
I'm no longer afraid.
Slay me if you dare.
Good...
I'll oblige.
Enemy sympathizers are better off dead,
Stop this massacre of our comrades !
Murderer... murderer !
The execution is called off !
Go... go back to them !
You're coming with me.
Pvt. Tenaka... take very good care of our honored guest.
I'll return later.
Go !
Kaji won't be home today.
Did... did he do something ?
Do something ?
He refused to let us execute those enemy dogs !
He may be away some time...it depends !
Did he hide anything ?
Because of his thinking no good.
Open the desk drawers.
Place everything on top of the desk.
Well... you feel like confessing now !
I only regret that I let you behead the first three victims.
You don't say !
You're a hopeless one.
Pvt. Tanaka... you should show our guest more courtesy.
Kaji... don't you miss your wife ?
She was crying.
No one to ride her belly from tonight.
What have I done ?
I'm no boor...
I'd like to put you back on your wife's belly but in order to do so, I must have more cooperation from you.
What's so funny ?
I neither pick pockets nor steal.
What shall I confess ?
Interesting !
You needn't confess until we make you.
Your bravado won't last long.
You let 1 POWs escape and failed to report it.
I'm waiting for an answer.
I didn't report it... but I never let them escape !
You used Chen to contact the prisoners !
Show me evidence !
Will you lose face if I'm not found guilty ?
You wanted something ?
I didn't mean it to end up like this.
Quarrels over work are one thing but I don't need outside help for that.
I came to. .
I understand.
But I didn't think Kaji would dare...
Kaji would dare do what
Oh... nothing !
I don't know how the others feel - but I feel that what he did... only he could do.
If that's how you feel, you can do as you please.
I dropped by to see if I could help you in any way.
Your help will not be needed.
What you can do is to admit that it was not an attempted escape.
Admit it !
You and Wang Heng Li helped them escape... didn't you ?
Answer me... you scum !
Wang Heng Li was arrested and has confessed everything.
Wang was arrested ?
He now awaits execution.
When will it be ?
It worries you ?
After all... he was your friend !
Wang instigated the uprising at your request... am I right ?
When will he die ?
Answer my question !
All right !
Today I'll make you weep like a women.
I hope your wife hears you.
WANG HENG Ll ln Memoriam
Wang... you have died without awaiting the dawn.
But your comrades will surely bury you by the light of the newborn day.
Come... out here !
Go inside !
Kiss her... don't let me stop you.
Michiko !
Why did you come ?
Don't worry... go home !
I brought some rice balls... may I offer them to him ?
Won't you have some ?
Michiko... when you need help, talk it over with Okishima.
Okishima...
look after her.
Mr. Okishima... he's being transferred.
I came to say .,goodbye .
.
I'm sorry I wasn't able to help.
I had a row with the manager and I'm being ousted.
I see.
I wanted to stay and argue some more with you.
Furuya takes over my spot.
That'll be the end.
is there anything you need ?
Nothing.
That means...
I won't see you anymore?
I learned so much from you.
No... that's for me to say.
Though you have paid a bitter price, you finally caught the humanism train.
Oh, yes...
Wang Heng Li, . .
Unnecessary conversation is not permitted !
Your time is up.
Pvt. Tanaka !
Michiko !
As a special favor, I'm releasing you.
But I'm not setting you free.
Remember... my eyes will follow your every move.
Go where you may...
I'll always be there first.
I report back, sir.
It has come...
Kaji.
Emergency Call to Military Service.
I suspected as much !
So you wring me dry and cast me out.
I can't afford to lose you but there's nothing I can do.
Forget the smooth talk !
It's the easy way to rid yourself of the unwanted.
Far better to have trusted the harlots than the directors of this company.
Turn your duties over to Furuya.
We need a new leader for the prisoners.
Good men are scarce since Wang Heng Li escaped.
Escaped?
Wang Heng Li ?
Along with 30 others.
So he got away !
Good for you, Wang !
Wonderful !
I hope they all get away.
Sir...
I wish you'd inform Furuya - that Wang's escape saved him from a thorough beating.
I was going in there to thrash him... not to hand over my work !
But suddenly...
I've changed my mind !
Probably because I found that I was in good company.
Japanese devil !
Japanese devil !
Kill me...
like you murdered Kao !
Kill me !
Why don't you kill me?
Japanese devil !
He murdered an innocent man !
Mr. Kaji
Be not angry.
I know you have a good heart.
But your not able to save Kao's life.
That's why...
You'll stumble, Michiko !
Welcome home !
One of the wives told me you had come back in terrible shape.
But it's not true !
You're looking fine.
I'm so happy !
This... what is it?
But they couldn't.
No... it's not fair !
They promised you military exemption.
A dirty trick !
This is too much... it's unfair !
Michiko... there's nothing that can be done now.
Why must they do this to you ?
I've done nothing.
But I had hoped to accomplish things with you when I returned.
Why must you always be persecuted so ?
Why do they pick on you ?
You're so thin... and so full of scars.
And now they send you to the front.
Michiko !
You mustn't die... we must live again !
When will we be able to meet again ?
You'll come back...
I know you will.
Japanese devil !
Japanese devil !
Japanese devil !
You die !
Michiko, let's go !
We still have 24 hours together.
Japanese devil !

SOUTHERN GATE OF PEACE
This isn't like you.
- Why?
- You're running away.
Don't you want me?
Of course I do.
And I want you too.
Yet we can't marry -
How many times must I explain?
Because you might be called up?
I wouldn't care if it was the day after.
Of course I'd cry.
I'd cry bitterly.
But happiness only lies in marrying the one you love.
All right.
I'll take you back to my dormitory.
You'll stay with me tonight.
All right?
Yes...
I'll go.
No, you'd better go back to your own dormitory.
I can't take you to mine.
You were just testing me.
You shouldn't have done that.
You're a coward and a weakling!
Now I see that!
SOUTH MANCHURIA STEEL COMPANY
RESEARCH DEPARTMENT
Hey.
Well, what a surprise.
I came to say goodbye, as sentimental as that may sound.
You got called up?
- When do you leave?
- Tomorrow morning.
The papers came five days ago.
I've been drinking ever since.
Oh, and I ran into Michiko last night.
Aren't you going to marry her?
It's you today.
Tomorrow it could be me.
Being called up isn't a death sentence.
I'm a born optimist.
Unlike you, I've had my share of earthly pleasures.
My only regret is not having left the seed of life in the womb of a woman I love.
I'll probably regret it too, but I can't be as optimistic as you.
The manager wants me.
Wait for me inside.
No, I'll see you tonight.
Tonight?
All right.
Kaji looked a bit angry.
Is anything wrong?
Are you going to be platonic friends forever?
You had the courage to come out hereto Manchuria alone.
Throw yourself at him!
I did.
He rejected you?
Nos. 12 and 13, stop your chatter... or I'll report you.
THE SUPERVISION OF COLONIAL LABOUR
I read it twice.
Very interesting, though it does smell of leftist tendencies.
What are you trying to say?
That men should be treated as men - I suppose that's the gist.
- But in colonial territories it's...
- A challenge?
Yes, sir.
We profit by exploiting Chinese labour.
Isn't that the idea?
That's right.
And that goes against your thesis.
Yes, it does.
- Mind if I take a cigarette?
- Help yourself.
So how about it?
Without that contradiction, there'd be nothing to write about.
So it contradicts your thesis, but there are still ways to improve performance, is that it?
Yes, perhaps there are.
Listen, I want you to take over at the Loh Hu Liong mines.
Any objections to being sent off to the hinterlands?
I'm not trying to force you.
You've analysed the local situation quite well on paper.
Would you want it to end up only on paper?
No.
When you're ready to put your theories into practice,
I'll help you get a fair chance at exemption from military service.
An exemption from military service?
You're not the only one to get an exemption.
There are dozens of others.
But it's the idea of accepting an exemption in exchange for the Loh Hu Liong job.
You always complicate things.
It's a bad habit.
The war is escalating, and there's only one way to oppose it:
a life sentence in prison.
Neither you nor I have the courage for that.
Am I right?
Yes... you're right.
I humbly accept your kind gift.
Not even the commander of the Kwangtung Army ever dared slap me.
Take Michiko and go to Loh Hu Liong.
Michiko... his sweetheart?
Is she pretty?
The most beautiful girl in the world.
But you're the most beautiful girl in my world.
Listen.
So you think you'd just be a shepherd's dog.
What's wrong with that?
A good dog can lead the sheep to greener pastures and earn their gratitude.
If such things are possible.
As for me, I'll take this one.
My little Manon, your hair smells like dried grass.
Michiko-san!
Kageyama-san, take care.
Michiko-san, go with Kaji to Loh Hu Liong.
Let this damn war go to the dogs.
If you let happiness slip through your fingers...
He may never return.
I won't be called up.
Loh Hu Liong is a tiny Manchurian village.
All we'll find there are iron ore and labour camps.
Would you go with me to a place like that?
I'd follow you anywhere.
This will affect your whole life.
Think it over carefully.
Even if you were called up...
I'd still want to have your child.
Is that crazy?
What a honeymoon!
What did you say?
It's all this wind and dust.
I don't care!
It's wonderful!
It feels like gravel in my mouth.
LOH HU LIONG
Step up.
All right.
Bastard!
Why, you!
Think I'm blind?
Trick me into giving you special rations?
Oh no you don't!
Come here.
- Kaji from the head office?
- Yes.
I'm Okishima.
We'll be working together.
We can dispense with the formalities.
Whatever made you come out to the boonies?
Following Kaji-san through thick and thin?
Nice to meet you.
This way.
Hey, take their bags to their new quarters.
I read your report on the supervision of colonial labour.
Lots of fancy words.
Please, ma'am.
The men here are plain speakers.
You'll be fundamentally incompatible.
- Thanks for the advice.
- What's so funny?
Sorry, but your own fancy words sound out of place.
Anyway, it's very well-written.
Touches the core of the matter.
Touches...
but doesn't quite grasp it.
Why?
If I knew, I'd write it myself.
I'll show your wife around.
You go and see the boss.
Furuya, show him the way.
I know this is nothing new, sir, but our first shift requested 2,500 men.
Only 1,500 turned up this morning.
We can never meet our production goal that way.
We're at war, Okazaki.
We must expect such shortages.
You can't do your work unless all conditions are perfect?
I didn't mean that, but if Labour would do something -
MEETING IN PROGRESS
I'm Kaji.
I just arrived.
So you're Kaji?
I'll introduce you.
Mr Higuchi, supervisor of Pit No. 2.
His foreman, Mr Kawashima.
Mr Koike, supervisor of Pit No. 1.
And his foreman, Mr Okazaki.
The head office sent Mr Kaji here as Labour Supervisor.
Pleased to meet you.
You're just in time.
Please sit down.
We're discussing labour problems.
Any good ideas?
I'd like to speak with Mr Okishima first... and find out how many men are available.
If labour conditions are improved, all available men will report for work.
And in more concrete terms?
Our employment system must be radically revised.
The labour boss must be replaced by a direct employment system.
Ridiculous!
You'd be throttling the mines.
Right, Kawashima?
Why is that?
Because...
Kaji's the name, right?
Think about it.
We have 200 labour groups here.
You think a single one has no system of skimming or doesn't cheat on food rations?
I doubt it, but the matter under discussion is how to improve the work attendance rate.
Labourers lose the desire to work because labour conditions are basically no good.
Regardless of how things are "basically", workers aren't what you make them out to be in theory.
They squander any surplus in idleness or gambling or pour it into women's crotches.
We have a difference of opinion.
Mistreating the men won't yield good results.
You know, Kaji, theory may be correct and yet not always apply in reality.
Then either the theory was wrong or it was incorrectly applied.
Never mind.
Do what you think is right.
I respect revolutionary ideas.
Now, your work here won't just be a desk job.
It will cover all aspects of the men's lives.
Rationing food, disposing of excrement from 10,000 men, handling menstrual cases among the women.
The women?
We have comfort quarters for our men.
Okishima will show you.
There are about 60 Manchu women.
Starting today, you're their boss.
I'm relieved you're not a bachelor.
Go home now and do your duty by your wife - but don't overdo it, eh?
But why must our group be disbanded?
Poor yields.
You've been raking off too much.
Are you kidding?
What's this all about?
Shall I show you the evidence?
Why should the company make trouble over our contracts with the men?
The company's money is meant for the workers.
But Mr Okazaki says our men work very hard.
Yes, but your rolls have been padded.
But Mr Okazaki...
I'm not Mr Okazaki!
Mr Okishima, put in a good word for us.
We've been associates a long time.
And it's made me mouldy.
Kaji's been scraping away the mould until I'm practically raw.
Mr Supervisor, it's the poor living quarters and poor food that make our men sick.
I know.
Bad quarters, poor food.
Men can't work on beans alone.
But there's a still greater evil.
You know what that is?
You men.
Now get this:
I give the men my word.
The food situation will definitely improve.
Better quarters will be considered.
But it's no use as long as you exploit them.
You lend money to transient labourers to bind them for life.
And that's not the worst.
You try to squeeze even more from your investment.
You hire slave-drivers to practically murder those who try to escape.
I won't allow such methods.
Allow them?
What do you mean?
You're just an employee yourself!
You have no right!
Won't allow it, eh?
Try and stop us!
Hey!
Any more threats and I'll kick your nuts in!
The gentlemen seem to be having a bad day.
We'll come back.
Mr Muta.
I'm returning this.
Your other gifts have been returned to your home.
The sons of bitches left too peacefully.
They must be up to something.
Making a tour of inspection?
Much obliged.
Mr Okishima, please see that we get the men we need.
I have to face the old man.
You'll get 'em.
Just don't kill 'em off too fast!
Son of a bitch!
What's going on?
The dog refused to work!
Beating him won't help.
They're not horses.
Get up, scum!
Beating them only lowers productivity.
I take orders from Okazaki... not you.
What goes on here doesn't concern Labour.
- So you'll keep beating them?
- That's right!
Fine.
Then tomorrow you'll have no men to beat.
What?
You're in the pit now.
You can't pull rank down here.
You men don't want to work?
Then don't!
You needn't come back tomorrow.
Stay by the cosy fireplace in your barracks.
But remember:
you'll get no food!
Just getting home?
You want something?
Just one question.
Did you threaten to shut off our supply of labour?
Well?
Say something.
Can we talk about work in the morning?
In the morning?
I can see why you'd prefer that.
Can't have your loving wife seeing your weaknesses.
- Do I have any?
- Answer my question!
What have you got to be so proud of?
You may brutally beat your labourers, but it doesn't mean others will be intimidated.
I just warned your assistant.
Mr Kaji, you know how important that ore is to us.
What's wrong with slapping a cheek or two if it keeps the ore coming out and helps the war effort?
What's more important:
the ore or the workers?
I don't think in those terms.
It's ridiculous to compare men with ore.
Take care of your men and the ore will come out.
Let me make it very clear that Okazaki of Loh Hu Liong won't be changed by any of your half-baked theories.
I'll stick to my own ways.
Remember that.
I will.
And I'll stick to my ways too.
Son of a...
KENPEITAI
- MILITARY POLICE
These gentlemen from the Kenpeitai are offering us 600 special labourers to achieve our goals.
Special labourers?
War prisoners from North China.
All you need do is keep them fed.
With the labour shortages, it's a heaven-sent blessing.
A stroke of good fortune.
Yes!
Our head office will certainly be pleased.
Kaji, discuss the matter with Okishima.
Discuss what exactly?
I'll tell you what.
I never repeat my instructions.
Got that?
First:
Special labourers must not mingle with ordinary labourers.
Second:
Their quarters must be enclosed by barbed wire... electrified barbed wire.
Understand?
You'll handle matters of food and labour, but they must not escape!
What voltage can you supply for the fence?
About 3,000 volts.
Good enough.
The labourers will be delivered one week from today.
The exact time will be specified later.
Understand?
We may not be ready in a week.
What?
You don't seem terribly grateful.
Kaji!
Why should civilians take over POWs?
Make preparations immediately!
Wait!
I haven't heard your answer.
We understand.
We'll be ready.
It could take an armed platoon to return safely with these men.
I want to be neither aggressive nor defensive with them.
You go on if you want.
Don't waste your heroism on me.
Someday you'll appreciate me.
Chen, how's your mother?
She says she's sick.
She lies in bed all day.
Sick, huh?
Take good care of her.
Mr Kaji, I have a request.
May I have some flour from the storeroom?
- For your mother?
- Yes.
I wish I could help, but I can't make any exceptions.
Here they come.
Chen, how do you feel about all this?
These are your fellow countrymen who lived in anti-Japanese areas.
Your mother's from Shantung.
Her friends might be among them.
My mother raised me not to be anti-Japanese.
In a battle zone, you'd be killed as a sympathiser.
The key!
We don't have it yet.
- You in charge from Loh Hu Liong?
- Yes.
- Your name?
- Kaji.
Oh, right.
I never forget a name.
Very well.
I hereby transfer the special labourers to you.
Never forget that these men are prisoners of war.
You must deal with them like a soldier.
Civilian negligence will not be tolerated.
You understand?
I do.
No, you don't!
You think your seven men can handle 600 prisoners?
What if they try to escape?
We received no special instructions about the transfer, so we anticipated no special danger.
You're a bold one.
How old are you?
I'm 28.
You married?
May I please have the key?
You don't back down.
I like that.
Will you witness the transfer?
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm now on leave.
You seem to believe that the army can make mistakes.
Don't worry.
When the army says 604, it's 604.
Submit a transfer receipt immediately.
Let those who die, die, but they must not escape!
Filthy bastard!
Get up!
What a mess to unload on us!
Open the other cars!
Out!
Everyone out!
Hurry up!
Everyone out!
Everyone out!
Line up!
Double file!
Mr Kaji!
This is bad.
What is it?
Hurry!
Line up quickly!
They baked to death.
Help!
Don't let them eat all of a sudden!
Stop them!
If you gorge yourselves now, you'll die!
Kaji!
Get back!
Don't eat that!
Don't eat that!
Don't eat that!
Get back!
You'll all die!
Throw me the whip!
Kaji, the whip!
The special labourers are unfit for work.
Please give them a month's rest.
They're half dead.
These anti-Japanese elements should be fed without working?
If you'd witnessed the scene, I'm sure you'd agree, sir.
Twelve of them were allowed to bake to death.
If you want to kill them, stuff them with raw beans - they'll die for sure!
Listen here.
Be careful what you say.
What you're saying amounts to denouncing the military.
I'll defer to your opinion one last time.
- One last time?
- That's right.
One last time.
May I ask why?
You really want to know?
You're a man of strong convictions, but I just got a report from Furuya.
150 men under your supervision were just snatched away.
But I'll overlook the matter this once.
Everyone up!
I give you all warning.
I know you all want to escape.
But you cannot.
If you even try... you'll meet the same fate as this dog.
Chen, show them.
Tomorrow begins a month of still higher production goals.
The directors have even discussed replacing all the top men here.
I'll accept this disgrace if we cannot increase production.
However, we have not yet done our utmost.
Until we attain the 20% increase demanded of us,
I will extend the higher production goal every month.
If there are dissenting opinions, air them now.
In the name of final victory,
I refuse to listen to any excuses hereafter.
Mr Koike, tell him we'll see it through.
I, Okazaki, vow that Pit No. 1 will achieve the new goal.
I'm sure you'll permit me to use any means necessary.
Use all means available.
Increased production is the main thing.
Listen here.
Lash them on with all you've got.
If any Chinaman baulks, kill the scum!
Push them!
Whip them!
We need that extra 20%.
Those of you who top your quota will be amply rewarded.
Remember: we're at war here.
If anyone feels he can't do this, let him step forward!
Good.
I have your word.
I'll assume all responsibility.
Don't worry... and do your best!
You will start work tomorrow.
Your rations will be sorghum wine and soy pulp, same as the regular labourers.
You don't smoke?
I used to.
You stopped?
When we run out of tobacco, we suffer again.
The Japanese won't keep us supplied.
We restored your health, yet you still hate us?
We are not soldiers.
We have the right to be released.
I don't have the authority to release you, only to detain you.
Master, when we be free?
We all not soldier.
We don't fight.
Japan soldiers come...
do bad things to Chinese women.
Take away all men... bring here.
Nothing to eat... many die.
Not die... killed.
I can't set you free, but I can promise that you will not be killed.
The Japanese say pretty words... and write pretty words... but never keep their promises!
Your name's Kao?
Remember this.
You've been placed under our supervision.
Whether that barbed wire stays up or not depends on you.
Faster!
Move it!
Step along there!
Come on!
Move!
You'll be in trouble if any men escape, won't you?
Why should they escape?
They used to work in their own villages.
Why would they want to work here?
Here they have no mother, no wife, no children.
Kaji, why are so many special labourers left in camp?
They're the sick ones.
Make sure they're not just malingerers.
I didn't come to find fault.
I'd like to see their camp.
Certainly.
No danger of escape?
I don't think so.
We must give them some incentive to work.
I think so too.
What does a man in a cage dream of most?
Freedom, I suppose.
Freedom?
You must be a poet!
It's women.
Men dream of women.
Women dream of men.
What did you dream of as a bachelor?
The ways of the Empire?
I doubt it.
The way to make caged men work is to satisfy 70% of their bodily lust.
With what women?
It's very simple.
You're in charge of the comfort women.
Send them in here.
Is that necessary?
Do you want a woman?
See that?
Just the word brings joy to their hearts.
What is a man?
Not poetry or morality.
He's a mass of lust and greed that absorbs and excretes.
I'll ask their leaders' opinion.
Who gives you orders?
POWs or me?
I'm more concerned about escapes than you are.
Carry out my orders.
Stop loafing!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Son of a bitch!
Get up!
You dog!
Master!
This man sick!
He maybe die.
Have mercy... he sick man!
Save your whining for Kaji.
I don't care if I kill a few of you dogs.
Here he comes!
Ah, Kaji-san!
No want to see?
Sister Jin!
Mr Kaji... welcome!
Mr Kaji, wanna have some fun?
I won't charge you.
I'm sorry... but I need 30 girls for the special labourers.
The Labour Office will pay.
They go inside barbed wire?
Just like dogs... sleep together...
everybody watch?
If you don't wish to, just say so.
You don't, do you?
We no have choice.
It's our job.
I send 30 girls tomorrow.
Don't be crazy!
We can't work with everyone watching.
Know how many men are in that compound?
If you don't wish to go, then don't.
Even if the others go, I refuse.
Think you can get out of working?
What do you mean?
I was speaking for all of you.
You talk real big.
If you want to go, then go.
Don't act so big!
What about you?
Stop arguing.
You don't make the decisions here.
I'll decide what to do.
Thirty girls will go tonight.
All right?
Yes, please do that.
- What happened?
- The foreman let him have it.
- Where?
- Pit No. 3.
Okazaki!
Get him to first aid quickly.
If this is ignored, supervision will be impossible!
I'll charge Okazaki with manslaughter.
Come now!
Relax!
It wasn't wise to use force, but he was only following orders to increase production.
So he actually acted out of patriotism.
Listen here.
Okazaki may be a brute, but his brutality lets him run that large pit.
We need him just like we need you and Okishima to keep our 10,000 men in line.
Understand?
We're at war.
To achieve the greater goal, we must overlook the small mistakes.
Small mistakes?
A human being was murdered!
Kaji, I'll tell you just once more:
Calm down!
Think it over.
I'm sure you'll see.
Can we exchange a good, hard-working Japanese man for the life of one mere prisoner?
That's not the point.
If you insist on pressing charges, include me as an accomplice.
I'll see that the suit goes unfavourably for you.
I can do it, you know.
You'd dare distort the truth?
Sir, will you see that this never happens again?
How should we report it?
As an accidental death.
Say he fell off a ledge.
It does happen, you know.
Sir!
You think I'll falsify the report?
What else can we do?
- Well, I won't!
- Yes, you will!
Then I become Okazaki's accomplice.
What will you do?
I'll get Okazaki!
You fool!
Why play the hero?
Fight so hard and you'll just run out of steam.
You're a fool to ruin your future with his.
Mr Kaji.
One of our men was mistreated.
What became of him?
He died.
I assume the culprit was arrested.
- He's still working.
- Will there be no trial?
I suppose not.
If that's why you're here, come inside and explain to all of us.
No, I came to wait for some women.
You promised not to kill!
You're like all the other Japanese!
If you treat me like a murderer just because I'm Japanese, you'll be losing the only friend you have.
Friend?
You don't have to believe me!
Wait.
Does this man's death mean others may also die?
I won't allow it.
Women!
Women!
Women!
Open the gate.
Let the women in.
Ten girls to a barrack.
Have them out by 10:00.
Look!
Women!
I'm coming!
Women!
We're here, just like I promised.
Why do you send us women?
Think as you please.
I'm just obeying orders.
You send whores to sleep with us like dogs so we'll work harder?
Is that it?
What's that about whores?
I wouldn't talk so big!
You wouldn't understand!
Oh, I understand.
You're no better off than us.
Look at your friends over there.
Have you no shame?
You think I like coming here?
I told him I refused!
Aren't you the same, beaten down by the Japanese every day?
Then why so cocky?
You love it here so much?
I'm sorry.
We all suffer the same misfortune.
Welcome home!
You must be tired.
Look at this!
Isn't it wonderful?
Her first egg!
She clucked so loudly I thought a dog had got inside.
But right there was this great big egg!
What is it?
Are you in a bad mood?
No, it's nothing.
It's like you hate coming home.
Is something wrong?
Why won't you tell me about it?
Would you want a husband who runs a whorehouse?
What does that mean?
You'd vomit if I told you!
What happens to 30 women in a camp of 600 men?
And now I'm an accomplice to murder too.
That can't be.
The workers don't believe a word I say.
With time you'll gain their trust.
Could you just be quiet for a while?
It's a shame.
What is?
Since those prisoners came, you seem so far away.
I guess I do.
I hate feeling like I'm fighting a lone battle.
You leave early every morning and return late at night.
During that time, you work.
Meanwhile, I clean the house, potter around the kitchen, and do the shopping... but it's like doing nothing.
Still I try to convince myself that the little things I do help keep you going.
Otherwise, there's no difference between a housewife and a housekeeper.
I'm sorry.
Forgive me.
I'm letting my work get the best of me.
Let's stop worrying about it... just for now.
It was nice talking to you.
Locked up in here, we lose touch with the outside world.
Thank you.
Don't you want to have a good time?
I came here for business.
I'm sorry to take your time.
I just wanted to talk.
You plan to escape, don't you?
It's impossible with all that barbed wire.
It's charged with electricity, that's all.
It's men who run the electricity through it.
Don't talk like that.
Human beings are weak creatures.
Go where you're told to go.
Do what you're told to do.
That's the only way to survive.
You're wrong.
Man can become as strong as he wishes.
He need only find the cause of his unhappiness.
Want to make some easy money?
You mean selling my girls elsewhere?
I don't go for that kind of deal.
This isn't about women.
Labourers?
I have something else in mind this time.
You mean behind the barbed wire?
Too dangerous.
If anything goes wrong, it's my neck.
It's not like the others.
Escaped prisoners mean big profit.
Help make arrangements and I'll split it with you.
It's easy money.
What kind of arrangements?
The easiest way... is like this.
You just flick off the electric switch.
Did someone put you up to this?
My mate Muta, the Japanese assistant who was just fired.
How sad, selling men like that.
Don't expect any sympathy from me.
I'm just a Korean.
The Japanese and Chinese both look down on me.
Hurry it up!
Mr Wang!
I just heard the Japanese say that the Italians have surrendered.
Defeat for Germany can't be far off.
Our time is coming.
When?
Six months, maybe a year.
We must be patient.
What's going on there?
You scum!
Thank you.
This'll really invigorate my man and the young folk.
If Okazaki gets any more invigorated, ma'am, you'll be in trouble.
Didn't you know?
We women prefer our men that way.
Ma'am, I'm sure you've seen to everything, but it might be wise to send some of that flour to Kaji's wife.
A very good idea!
I'll do just that.
Your food.
Good day, sir.
Ah, it's you.
You want dumplings?
Can you loan me a bag of white flour?
I'd like to make my mother happy.
She hasn't long to live.
One bag?
Why don't you go get some yourself?
The Japanese steal the flour they ration to us... and eat their fill.
I can't do that.
But Mr Kaji trusts you.
This flour was stolen from the warehouse by the warehouse guard with the big mole.
It's stolen property.
You still want to buy some of it?
Let him have half a bag.
No, I won't.
Young man, don't forget you were born of a Chinese mother, of Chinese seed.
Go ask the man with the big mole!
Try not to be so obvious.
About what?
Okazaki's wife just left here with a big sack.
I hate to interfere, but you're making a mistake.
People around here appreciate my mistakes.
It's an old custom.
Well, it's one that should be abolished.
Unpleasant as it may seem, that's my job.
If it happens again, I'll have to order an inventory.
Mr Kaji... the men in the pits wonder if you're one of us or just a puppet of the Chinese.
And?
That's all.
But I do think your acute sense of justice is inflamed by the fact that you can't take some extra flour to your own wife.
Take your filthy feet off your desk when speaking to me!
Or do you need my help?
You fool!
They'll see your light!
Go easy tonight.
Hurry!
It's the night watchman!
What's taking so long?
Get going!
I like you a lot.
You did very well for your first time.
You'll do it for me, won't you, Chen?
Talk to Sai at the power station.
Just have him shut off the current for three minutes.
I'll see that you're well-rewarded.
Then you can buy all the flour you want without playing the thief.
Still can't make up your mind?
Hey, Big Mole!
Well, Chen, how'd it go?
Did you get a good price?
Or did you eat it yourself?
Free white flour must taste good.
What's going on, Matsuda?
What indeed.
Seems even saints have thieves for underlings.
Flour thieves.
Mr Kaji...
I'm willing to overlook it this time.
But just for future reference, I'd like to see how you handle this.
Chen, stand up.
Look at me.
You didn't do it, did you?
I did.
Alone?
Matsuda, I hope you're satisfied now.
Now get out before I expose all your dirty doings!
Chen, what's the matter?
I stole something... and Mr Kaji struck me.
Kaji struck you?
But no matter.
Mr Kaji is Japanese, and I'm Chinese.
It's that simple!
Sister Jin is busy now.
I think he's Korean.
Korean?
Hi, cutie.
Got into a fight?
Yang, let me use your room awhile.
What's wrong?
I don't understand it myself.
Foolish girl, acting like an amateur in love for the first time.
I can't seem to forget Kao.
Love at first sight...
with a man behind barbed wire.
Why not use your room?
It's such a mess.
Why do you ask?
The Japanese are all the same.
They don't consider us human beings.
Chen... go to the power station and work it out with your friend.
I'm not Korean.
I won't betray my friend for money.
I know that.
You're a good man.
But those men in there are prisoners.
The Japanese will exploit them and then kill them.
Can they really be saved?
Of course.
But the only one who can do it... is you.
This can wait, Chen.
First go do as I ask.
I understand.
I'm Chinese too.
I'm ready to do my part.
At exactly 1:00 a.m.
when the siren sounds, I'll cut the current.
But only for two minutes.
That's the best I can do.
Two minutes?
Watch out!
That's 3,300 volts!
Be careful.
Don't let them see you.
Sai!
Go now, and don't let them see you.
My regards to our brothers behind barbed wire.
They're in love.
This isn't business.
In that case, we don't pay.
Stop kidding around.
A prisoner and a prostitute in love - it's like a novel.
But what will come of it?
Nothing can come of it while there's a war going on.
They have their love today.
That's all.
Can't you let them marry?
I would if I could.
I'm sure you'd want to help them.
I do, but it ends right there.
Have some.
They're delicious.
What are they?
A rare treat.
They were given to us.
By Whom?
Try and guess.
Mrs. Okazaki.
Send them back!
But...
I can't send them back now.
Return them!
Tell her I was furious.
But why?
Why?
Why do you glare at me like that?
She wanted to make up for earlier.
The murderer stole that flour!
It's time you showed more sense.
Can't you understand my position and what I'm trying to do at this mine?
No, I can't.
How could I, when you never tell me anything?
Of course, even I can guess where the flour and sugar came from.
But women can't always live by unbending rules.
I didn't accept them for myself.
So you accepted them for me?
I don't need that kind of thoughtfulness.
Because it was the Okazakis?
What if it had been Mrs. Okishima?
I'd still refuse.
Yes, you're just the kind who would!
You struck Chen, didn't you?
I know you didn't want to, yet you did.
Why?
Because he did something wrong?
That's not why.
You could have forgiven him for such a minor matter.
It was because you lost face in front of others.
For a man who aspires to great things, you have a small mind!
You wouldn't understand.
But I do!
I know what people think of you.
It's reached my ears too.
What do they think?
That you try to look better than everyone else.
I didn't believe them.
I thought it was just spite, but now...
- Think what you want!
- Where are you going?
I've kept 30 women waiting.
Marriage?
Impossible!
We can marry after the war is over.
Is the war going to end?
It won't be much longer.
But they'll take you away again.
No, Chun Lan.
It will end in victory for China.
We'll be free.
I can only hope that things stay as they are.
Why, Chun Lan?
When that day comes, I'll never see you again.
But I'm asking you to marry me.
There are plans to escape from here, but I will not run away as long as you're here.
You won't run away?
You promise?
I'm sorry.
I went too far.
You brute!
I'm thinking of letting those two get married.
Hello.
What?
Escaped?
- I'll be right there!
- How many?
Eleven men!
I won't bother asking for information.
We'll soon know who planned the break.
I won't ask for details.
But you must understand one thing.
We've tried our best to help you.
If you cannot trust us, and if you continue to try to escape, those who remain behind will face reprisals and even more hard labour.
And I will not raise a finger to protect you.
You think we can't bring you before a firing squad.
But if Kaji and I decide to, we can always pack you into those freight cars and send you back to the army!
They acted on their own.
We only serve as liaisons for the prisoners.
We couldn't stop them even if we knew of their plot.
I see through your lies!
What if I said that Wang Heng Li plotted this break?
It no lie... we don't know.
I no run away.
You fools!
You think we'd take your word for it?
Why don't you all run off somewhere!
I will not run.
I'll walk out of here with dignity.
And just where will you go?
Don't think all Japanese are as forgiving as me.
If you want to die, just try to escape.
Wang, the safety of your men depends on all of you.
I'm the one who has to answer to the Kenpeitai - not you!
Investigate the situation and take adequate measures.
Oh, and think up a good story for the Kenpeitai.
Where's Kaji?
You stood by while those men escaped?
We didn't stand by.
So you took all precautionary measures?
Let me remind you once more:
Those prisoners are spoils of war, obtained at great sacrifice.
You allowed them to damage the prestige of our Imperial Forces.
- I demand an explanation.
- I have none.
The only explanation is their desire to escape.
Why did you stand by and let them?
Answer me!
I can hear you.
You don't have to shout.
We have 10,000 other labourers here, but these special prisoners have taken all our attention.
No matter what, they'll manage to escape.
What are we supposed to do?
One question!
Go ahead.
We reported the truth.
I could have reported them dead and avoided trouble.
Does the Kenpeitai not want the truth?
I acknowledge your honesty.
But shortage of personnel is not an acceptable excuse.
Though your negligence is inexcusable,
I shall overlook it just this once.
No more men must escape.
Tell them that if they do, I will personally kill their leader.
Understand?
I understand.
How about it?
Want me to scare them a little?
That won't be necessary.
You must be quite sure of yourself to refuse aid from the military.
Very well.
I'll hold you personally responsible from now on.
- I never go back on my word.
- I understand.
And you?
Do you understand?
I understand.
That will be all.
No!
Wait!
Wait!
Let me go!
- Don't take it out on the men.
- What about you?
You lost your temper and struck Chen, and now you lecture me?
Don't pull your humanism on me.
I struck Chen, and I regret it.
But should you do the same?
Don't let your feelings ruin my work.
Your work?
Yes, my work.
You've kept in step so far, but now you're going your own way.
Can't you see?
Force has meaning only when overcoming tyranny.
I know that.
I've had enough of your lectures.
You intend to let them do as they wish?
I'll talk to them.
I won't mince words.
I don't want your men trying to escape.
As far as you men are concerned,
I am your friendliest enemy.
I pride myself on supervising you without hostility.
Despite the conflicts of interest that result from our being at war,
I've tried to protect your interests.
What you say is difficult.
I see.
Eat your fill.
We can talk at our leisure.
When one of your comrades was killed, we didn't take adequate measures to protect you.
Therefore you no longer trust us.
That's only natural.
However...
I shall do my utmost to correct this mistake.
It may take time... but I hope you'll trust me and be patient.
No one wants to risk the danger of escaping.
Let me speak for my friend Kaji.
Since he arrived here, the regular labourers' conditions have greatly improved.
This also applies to you.
However, if there's another escape,
I cannot say what the Kenpeitai might do.
I don't know how Kaji feels, but the only way to save my own neck is to send you back to the Kenpeitai.
It's true what he says.
We can reach an understanding by talking.
How about you, Kao?
If you can marry Yang Chun Lan, will you stay until the war ends?
I don't like propositions that start... with the word "if."
Can't you understand?
We're talking things over.
Bootlicker!
It's the same old Japanese trick.
They always promise to do this and do that... but they never keep their word.
Stand up!
You dog!
You wouldn't understand what men say.
Go to Yang Chun Lan and learn the ways of human beings!
By the way, Wang, if I...
There's the "if" again.
If I gain the freedom for you enjoyed by the regular labourers, will you trust me?
To wait seems to be the only safe liberty.
You promise?
Wang, you must trust me.
I wonder if they trust me.
You want to believe they do, don't you?
I want to believe Wang when he says he'll wait.
You plan to continue sending the women inside.
Why?
Just a hunch.
I also plan to take 50 of them for outside labour.
- Under armed guard?
- No, just by myself.
These strange hunches aren't like you.
- Why not be honest?
- About what?
You'd let them escape if you could.
That's nonsense.
When that happens, I stand to lose my neck.
Remember that.
On days they come out here, they seem happy.
Is your mother still ill?
I suppose she still longs for some white flour.
She's given up hope.
I'm sorry I struck you that day.
I'm hardheaded in some ways, I know.
It's all right.
Is Sai at the power station a friend of yours?
Somebody shut off the current.
Sai was on duty that night.
If he did it, tell him not to do it again.
Well, back to work.
They could escape whenever they want.
Maybe they're starting to trust you.
No, they're just wary of a trap.
Then you'll stop taking them out?
No, I'll keep doing it.
Isn't it dangerous?
They might kill you and escape.
I doubt that.
This bath feels good.
Why don't you come in?
I think I will.
If the workers settle down, let's go into town on vacation.
Let's do it!
How many days can you take off?
Three at the most.
That would be wonderful!
Well, if they really settle down...
Someday you'll be a great supervisor, but by then our youth will have vanished.
That's not for me.
I'll take that vacation.
You're probably right.
Please do, all right?
I will.
See to it, Cho.
We need a break in that barbed wire.
Kaji will be off on a three-day leave.
Okishima will be busy.
We'll do it then.
Releasing prisoners is more profitable, but more dangerous too.
With things going smoothly, Kaji has let down his guard... but watch out for Okishima.
The timing is ideal.
Let's pull another fast one and then make ourselves scarce.
That's right.
Getting away clean is the important thing.
Is Jin Tung Fu in?
She's in bed with the cute boy.
How about you?
There's a problem.
Chen won't help anymore.
Won't help?
Once is as bad as 100 times.
He doesn't want that risk with you and me.
But he'll risk sleeping with you.
He wants me to break away too.
Has that dog squealed on us?
- He'd never do that.
- You never know.
Don't let him spend the night.
Send him home.
Jin Tung Fu is some woman, eh?
How was it?
I hear Kaji will be away starting Saturday.
Have the power cut off while he's gone.
Sai isn't on duty those nights.
Then when is he?
Friday night.
Then make it Friday night.
He can't!
They already suspect him!
Who does?
Mr Kaji.
What can he do without evidence?
Listen carefully, punk.
Play it straight and I'll fix it so Jin Tung Fu will be yours alone.
You little scum!
You'll do it, won't you?
Be a good boy.
If you refuse, you and Sai will die.

PART 2
I feel wonderful!
We arrived in a whirl of dust, but it's so nice today.
- Worried about work?
- No.
Just wondering why I didn't do this before.
- Really?
- I mean it.
I'll phone Yasuko first thing and tell her to take the day off.
Would you mind?
And then what?
We'll have lunch together and then go to the apple orchard.
It's so wonderful!
I feel as light as a balloon!
Allow me just one thing.
What?
Let me go for just one hour?
What for?
With our increased production, I'd like to talk to the main office about treating the special labourers like the ordinary labourers.
Just one hour?
- The rest of my time is all yours.
- All right.
I'll give you two hours, but not a minute more.
Mr Kaji!
- They broke out again.
- What?
- Where's Okishima?
- At their camp.
All right.
I'll be right there.
I don't want you to go.
I have no choice.
You go and have a good time with Yasuko.
Yasuko isn't you.
- But this is my job...
- I don't care!
You're officially on holiday.
They can't make you go back.
Leave it to Okishima.
I'll wait till after lunch, OK?
I'll never finish by then.
You just don't want to go.
Don't be foolish!
Your work's important, but don't you see how important this is for us?
I'll make up for it next time.
You needn't bother!
Why so angry over such a small thing?
Such a small thing?
You don't seem to care how I feel.
At any rate, I can't just leave now.
I see.
Then I'll go on alone.
Stop it!
From now on, I do things my way!
- And ruin everything?
- They'll understand my fist!
Hitting them won't bring back the others!
Do you realise how many got away?
Eighteen men, led by Hwang and Sung!
Still think words will help?
- I'll assume all responsibility.
- You fool!
If you don't like my methods, you can quit.
You won't be dragged before the Kenpeitai.
Fine!
Wang!
Stand up!
I've given up on all of you.
You said you'd wait.
You might think I'm a fool, but even a fool has limits!
Another escape and you'll all go without food for three days.
I'll turn your men against you and break your authority in this camp!
You Japanese are all the same!
Fine!
Then I'll act accordingly.
All promises are hereby retracted.
Now I realise there can be no trust between us.
Mr Okishima!
How will you report this to the Kenpeitai?
They won't let us off easy this time.
- I won't report the incident.
- What?
If it leaks out, I'll assume all responsibility.
I don't think it was all your responsibility.
You think someone shut off the power?
I couldn't say.
Shall I put only Japanese on night duty there?
You can't do that without evidence.
Shall I increase the night watch around the fence?
I'd have to check that they're at their posts.
Eighteen men...
that's a big loss!
I've achieved the 20% increase in production.
I don't want trouble now over something like this.
I forgot:
Okishima is hereby relieved of all responsibility for the special prisoners.
I don't know!
Damned Chinaman!
Son of a bitch!
Tell me!
Who paid you?
Okishima favours drastic measures, but Kaji always stops him.
Meaning he gives tacit consent to the runaways?
I wouldn't say that, but it does all seem rather suspicious.
There is one way to teach them a lesson.
How?
We let them plan another break and then foil them.
With your permission, I'd like to try.
Sounds intriguing.
I'll try anything that brings results.
Give it a try.
Boss's orders.
We're distributing flour and oil.
Only to the Japanese, of course.
I'm sure you don't approve.
I do not.
Unfortunately, you're not the manager.
I'm sure you're happy I'm not.
Mr Kaji, it's Mr Okishima!
Filthy scum!
Son of a bitch!
Kill the rat!
Let him have it!
Mr Okishima, let us handle that Korean dog!
Stay out of this!
Filthy dog!
Swipe men from under my nose, eh?
Bastard!
Not stopping me today?
You want me to?
Don't look so disapproving.
Should I go easy on the regular workers too?
Your clumsy humanism kills good men and lets scoundrels run wild.
Chen, take him to the medical ward.
Do no such thing!
His boss will pick him up.
Take him!
Go and call Furuya.
Don't worry, young one.
I won't talk.
Chen, it seems I know more about you than you do about me.
Go back and tell Kaji his wounds aren't serious.
It's better if Kaji doesn't come around here.
Well?
How is he?
He seems all right.
Mr Furuya is with him.
Furuya?
Furuya, send a telegram to Muta.
That rat Okishima!
He says he's going to sue Okishima.
Help him arrange it.
You two seem friendly enough.
Don't bother explaining!
Think I'm that stupid?
Was it the money?
Or just to make trouble for me?
Don't worry.
I won't tell the boss.
See that your buddy is hospitalised.
But you're paying for him - not Labour!
You probably made plenty.
Where you been hidin'?
What's wrong with you?
Drunk, I see.
Think I got drunk and came to make trouble?
I had a drink with the boss, but I'm not drunk.
I have some hot news.
They're issuing commendations for the increased production.
Okazaki will surely be included.
I told the boss you were the only one in Labour who deserved a commendation.
The boss felt the same way, but he feared that this old-timer might feel slighted.
You don't think I'd feel slighted, do you?
Why have you suddenly turned to brute force?
The boss asked the same thing.
I was born a brute...
Good enough?
How long do you plan to keep on like this?
Meaning what?
Straddling a fundamental contradiction and trying to justify it.
I'm out of breath.
If I'm being a nuisance, just say so and I'll back off.
Kao!
Chun Lan!
I was afraid you might have escaped.
That's all I could buy today.
Thank you.
Thank you!
We can't meet for the time being.
We can't come here.
If you run off by yourself...
I'll kill myself.
I'll take you with me when I escape.
When?
After I learn how the others have fared.
I can't take any chances if I take you along.
Stay here.
They might let us marry.
Don't believe them!
Wang says the war will end soon.
Japan will be defeated.
Now that I have you...
I'm willing to bear anything.
Kao!
I wish we could meet like this every night.
But if they start suspecting us... then it's all over.
This cursed wire!
Careful!
Why do the gods torment us like this?
Chun Lan...
I love you!
And I love you!
Can't you sleep?
Kaji would have been happier married to a girl like you.
You're too much the wife, Michi.
You're forgetting to be a woman.
What do you mean?
Being a wife is a kind of profession, but it's the woman that men love.
When you typed Kaji's reports, you studied them like one possessed.
I never understood a word.
And now?
Do you ask him about his work?
He doesn't like me asking questions.
If I were you, I'd pester him until he told me everything.
Then I'd ask even more questions.
What's wrong?
Did I go too far?
I'm sorry about yesterday.
I failed as a wife and as a woman.
I couldn't sleep.
This is your home.
You can sleep soundly here.
Promise you'll share both your joys and sorrows with me.
Sorrow for one is enough.
It's not!
I'm walking down the same path you are.
It's OK if I lose my way.
Just tell me we might get lost and take me along.
I'll follow you... and do my best to keep up.
I understand.
If I don't walk fast enough, will you wait just a tiny bit for me?
Just a very tiny bit?
Of course.
I'll never ask you the same question twice.
"Through fitting leadership in the pit, you have helped achieve a 20% increase in ore production.
At this hour of dire national emergency, you've rendered a valuable service to our armed forces and set a fitting example for other employees.
You are hereby officially commended.
September 23, 1943.
Chairman of the board Jushiro Kitada.
Read in proxy by Junichi Kuroki."
Looks like we'll have rain.
Rainy nights are ideal for escape attempts.
When you deliver their dinner, tell them arrangements have been made.
They can break out tonight.
Tonight?
Then go to the power station and tell them Kaji says to cut the power.
But Mr Kaji would never...
I'm acting under direct orders from the boss.
You want me to tell the Kenpeitai about you?
About how you and Jin Tung Fu aided the plotters, and how Kaji knew but pretended not to see?
It's the only way to save your neck.
As ships at sea part the great white waves
So do I part my loved one's thighs
Mr Kaji, I look forward to your continued favour.
You're young, but you're quite a fellow!
No, a great fellow!
The day you arrived it was snowing...
No, it was windy.
Really?
Windy?
That day I thought a young squirt like you could never handle this mine.
But things really did work out as you said.
You're really something!
But Mr Kaji...
I've been watching.
You haven't been drinking.
Give me a hand?
If you want to try, tonight is your last chance.
Why the sudden rush?
If the timing's no good, just forget it.
But my friend's being moved to the day shift tomorrow.
You sure about this?
On behalf of the men in the pit and in the spirit of friendship,
I challenge Mr Kaji to a friendly drinking bout.
Hear!
Hear!
I concede defeat.
No, you can't!
We haven't even started yet!
No, I really do.
Mr Kaji... do you only show spirit when you're snarling at me?
Come on.
Be a man!
All right!
I'm ready!
Use this.
Get drunk and letdown your guard for once.
That's right!
OK, let's begin.
Show 'em, Mr Kaji!
- That's the way!
- More!
Those boys in Labour are used to being wined and dined by the bosses.
They get the women too!
They run the whorehouse and have their pick.
So we're wined and dined, eh?
And the whores are ours for the taking?
Fine!
Bring on your wine and women!
I'll take 'em on!
Chen.
All done delivering their meals?
This is a special ration ticket for Japanese only.
You're welcome to mine.
- But your wife...
- She's given up hope.
Mr Kaji.
No, nothing.
I just wanted to say thank you.
It's me who should thank you.
I was afraid you wouldn't accept it now.
There's a nice arse!
Hey, lady-killer!
Tops in Japan!
Back off!
Still in heat at your age?
What if I am?
Go and sow your seed in your own rice paddies!
I wouldn't act so big, Okishima.
If you and Kaji would mind your own business,
I could have topped our production goal long ago.
And you'd have 10 murders on your record now.
You'd be having dinner in jail!
Bastard!
If you want trouble, come on.
Chen, what's the matter?
What should I do?
I won't be able to see you again.
I've fallen into a trap!
Go to the station and have him cut off the power.
If I do that... and the men are captured... they'll kill me!
This is a Japanese plot.
No matter what happens, you won't be killed.
You speak as if this didn't concern you.
If I'm caught, I might confess everything.
Don't threaten me.
You dragged me into this!
- Where are you going?
- To warn them.
You'll never get word to them.
I can try.
Wait!
I have a better idea.
Chun Lan.
Kao is breaking out tonight.
Kao is breaking out?
Go and tell him it's too dangerous.
I won't let him escape alone!
Drink.
It'll relax you.
I couldn't contact him.
Are you sure he plans to escape?
You met no one?
With this downpour, I couldn't see a thing.
Not a soul?
Is he really breaking out?
What'll we do now?
If he runs off by himself...
I'll kill myself!
The power must be cut off!
We mustn't anger the Japanese.
What should we do?
The best way is to confess the whole thing to Mr Kaji.
No!
He's the worst of them all!
Where are you going?
Go to the power station!
You little punk!
I expected as much.
Did you do as I told you?
Yes.
You didn't mention the matter to Kaji, did you?
No.
We'll find out in a moment... whether you did as ordered.
If you betrayed us, it's a bullet in your head.
We'll report that we caught you helping the men escape.
It'll even mean a reward.
They're coming!
Mr Furuya.
The power...
I didn't...
What?
Son of a bitch!
Bastard!
You want to die?
I never dreamt that Chen might plot something like this.
I've been blind.
Furuya!
Blind because I never thought you capable of such a diabolical plot!
Go and boast to the boss of your brave deed!
Wang!
You're not always right either.
Your failed leadership caused this.
You refused to trust us.
The result is charred human flesh.
It serves you right!
Kao!
Why did you do it?
It was so foolish!
Kao!
You're alive!
You're alive!
Chun Lan!
Look at the man whose mistake killed his own friends!
Okishima came to tell me about it.
Why didn't Chen come to me?
He was probably afraid to.
Because I hit him?
Okishima told me you'd take it really hard.
It's not my fault that I'm Japanese... yet it's my worst crime that I am!
Chen was kind to you even though I struck him.
He understood how I felt.
Yet look what happened.
That son a bitch Furuya!
The boss put him up to this.
They'll never meddle in Labour affairs again!
Let's go home.
Some nice hot soup will help you feel better.
Yes, let's.
Let's go home.
I wish you'd ask the main office about getting the Kenpeitai to let us treat these prisoners like ordinary labourers.
But I know I asked you to stay out of my affairs.
Don't worry.
I'll do it.
My trip will cool us both off.
It'll be my present to you.
Seems the boss considers Okazaki more indispensable than me.
I'm boarding this run-down truck, but you're trying to catch the train of humanism before it's too late.
I won't stop you.
You seem willing to pay the fare, no matter how high.
Am I making trouble by coming here?
I already offered my apologies.
Leave us alone.
From now on, we'll have to escape from the work areas.
Wang wants us to lie low for a while.
And there's been no news from the others.
What's going on here?
Run!
Bastards!
You dare resist?
Get back here!
Come back!
Escape attempt!
Escape attempt!
How about it?
They're offering us 500 more prisoners.
We lack accommodations.
Accommodations?
Don't you mean supervision?
We just caught seven prisoners trying to escape!
You caught them?
Good work!
- Did they resist?
- The bastards almost got away.
- From the pit?
- The ore dump.
That's strange.
You were eating Chinese food here.
How would you know?
How could they escape in broad daylight?
Look at this.
Only desperate men would throw ore at me.
That makes it a break?
I'm not the only witness.
It took 15 men to capture them.
Inside the compound?
Running inside the compound is a break?
- Why do you defend the chinks?
- I'll investigate this.
You needn't bother!
- Where are they?
- The guard house.
Good.
Captain, what are your instructions?
Well, let's see.
Shall we try the method you've been suggesting?
He's a master swordsman.
How many men did you slay in China?
Wait!
How can you be sure it was a break?
Silence!
We have a witness.
Any more objections?
Yes!
An impassioned witness can't be trusted.
All those men want to escape.
Would you execute them all?
- Why you...
- Enough!
Whether it was or wasn't an escape attempt isn't the point.
All that matters is that we say it was!
Arguments will not be tolerated.
Sergeant!
They're to be executed tomorrow.
You decide how.
They will be executed tomorrow, sir!
I assume you approve.
You shall officially witness the execution!
You'll save seven men's lives if you testify they weren't trying to escape.
They were trying to escape.
They ran.
They should have stayed and taken their beating.
What's going to happen to us?
If injuring Okazaki was a crime, why not just investigate me?
Listen to me.
You're all guilty of attempted escape.
- Lies!
- You're wronging the innocent!
Quiet!
Dog!
An investigation will reveal the truth.
Investigate it!
Immediately!
The investigation is over.
But I don't believe you tried to escape.
You're turning us over to the Kenpeitai?
I don't intend to.
But you never had faith in me before.
Perhaps it's best to doubt me now as well.
Those men have all the power!
I have none!
I'll do everything I can until tomorrow evening.
Sir, if you ask them, the Kenpeitai will listen to reason.
This is an object lesson, Kaji.
Personally I don't approve, but the head office says to leave it to the Kenpeitai.
Why?
Must there be a reason?
Please wait!
You're about to chop off men's heads!
If the company protested strongly...
This is wartime.
Peacetime reasoning doesn't apply.
That's no reason!
You may not think so, but I do.
You're wasting your breath.
If you're not satisfied, speak to the head office.
I Will!
There's no answer.
He's in a conference.
Shouting like a madman!
Hello?
One moment, please.
Someone else will take your call.
Okishima?
We're in real trouble.
You've heard?
Hello?
Hello?
I can't hear you!
Speak louder!
I can't hear you at all.
What's that?
Give up?
That's ridiculous!
Okishima, please talk to them again.
Please try again.
I'll be waiting.
I'll be honest.
There's only one chance in a hundred.
This does not concern us alone.
Just as my companions stand between life and death, so do you now stand at an important crossroads.
You're right.
If you fail now, no one will ever trust you again, and you too will lose faith in yourself.
It's true.
Yet you would do nothing?
What can I do?
Must a man outside this barbed wire ask me such a question?
Not all the Japanese working here are murderous devils.
Their combined opinion objecting to this execution will be more effective than one individual alone.
If I'd always acted as you wanted me to, there'd be no Kaji here today.
I'd like to see what you'd do in my position.
You and I will both make minor mistakes.
Such things can be forgiven.
But an error made at a crucial moment is an unforgivable crime.
Your life has been a series of errors stemming from the conflict between your work and yourself.
Such errors can possibly be corrected.
But this one cannot.
Meaning?
You'll either be revealed as a murderer wearing the mask of humanism or as one worthy of the beautiful name... "man".
I know that.
You have less faith in man than you try to believe.
Regardless of how you might feel, true men will always find kindred spirits!
What will happen to Kao?
I wish I knew myself.
When will you release him?
You won't kill Kao, will you?
You won't, will you?
Hello?
Okishima?
What's the decision?
Calm down and listen.
The manager is no help, the old fool.
Wait until morning.
I'll talk to the chairman.
The chairman?
Yes, the chairman!
I'll make him listen to me.
Please go away.
I want to be alone.
Mr Kaji!
Please save him.
Save him.
He wouldn't try to escape.
We planned to be married after the war ended.
You won't kill him, will you?
You're a good man.
You won't kill him, will you?
Go to sleep and stop worrying.
I won't do anything.
There's nothing I can do.
Can I really set my mind at ease?
Really?
Go to sleep and don't worry.
I'll try to sleep too.
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
To free those men.
You can't!
Think what might happen to you!
I don't care!
You did everything you could.
Don't you care what happens to you?
Well, I do!
Michiko, don't torment me!
I'll call for help!
I won't let you do it.
You always go your own way, and perhaps you're right.
But if you free those men, they'll kill you for sure!
Please don't go!
I'll follow you!
I'll shout for help!
Michiko, if I don't, I'm no longer a human being!
How can you ignore me like some stray dog?
Even you don't want to give up this life, do you?
Remember!
You promised!
I'm sorry.
Go and do as you see fit.
Perhaps it's me who's wrong.
I can't have you feeling I stood in your way.
I don't want you hating me, not loving me anymore.
There's no hope for me!
- All ready!
- Good work.
Spare us!
It's best to wet the blade.
Keeps off the fat.
Kaji!
Stay right there.
Thanks for being my witness.
Get up!
On your knees!
Kaji... you can tell them all later:
If they want to die, they can run all they like.
Next!
Spare me!
Want to try?
Next!
I don't want it!
I demand an explanation!
Why are we being executed?
Son of a bitch!
Japanese devils!
Stand up!
I'll go by myself!
Inhuman wretch!
This is your true form!
The face of a man... but the heart of a beast!
Good!
You show some grit.
Stay calm!
Slash him!
The Chinese nation... will live forever!
Don't think of it as a human head.
Take a rest and try again.
Next!
Spare my life!
Wait!
No more!
What?
Please stop!
Stay out of this or I'll kill you too!
I'm not afraid any longer.
Kill me if you dare!
I'll be happy to oblige.
Enemy sympathisers deserve to be killed.
We won't let them kill our countrymen!
Stop them!
You're killing innocent men!
Murderers!
Murderers!
Murderers!
Murderers!
Private!
Very well.
The execution is called off.
Go back and join the others, quickly!
Take them back!
Kaji!
We're taking you to headquarters.
Pvt. Tanaka, take special care of our honored guest.
I'll return later.
Go.
Kaji won't be coming home today.
Did something happen?
Did something happen?
He refused to let me behead those enemy dogs.
He may not be back for a while.
It all depends.
Did he hide anything?
No.
No wonder.
Books by damn Westerners.
Open the desk drawers.
Place everything on top of the desk.
Son of a bitch!
How about it?
Wouldn't it be smarter to confess everything?
I only regret that I let you behead the first three.
You don't say!
You're a hopeless case.
Pvt. Tanaka... you should show our guest more courtesy.
Kaji, don't you miss your wife?
She was crying.
She'll have no one to ride her at night.
What have I done?
I'm no monster.
I'd like to put you back on top of your wife tonight, but for that I'd need more cooperation from you.
What's so funny?
I don't pick pockets.
I don't steal.
I have nothing to confess.
Very interesting.
Then don't confess until I make you.
Show off your bravado while you can.
You let 18 POWs escape and failed to report it, didn't you?
Is it so funny you can't even answer?
I didn't report it, but I never let them escape.
You used that chink Chen to contact the prisoners.
Show me evidence.
Or will you lose face if you can't prove it?
Son of a bitch!
Did you want something?
No.
I just didn't expect things to come to this.
Quarrels over work are one thing.
I didn't intend for others to do my fighting for me.
So I came to...
I understand.
I never thought Kaji would do such a thing.
Do what?
Oh... nothing.
I don't know what other people think, but I know that whatever Kaji did, he alone could do.
I see.
If that's how you feel, you can do as you please.
I just dropped by to see if I could help in any way.
I won't be asking for your help.
What you can do is admit that those men were not trying to escape.
Admit it!
You and Wang Heng Li plotted their escape.
Didn't you?
Why don't you answer?
Wang Heng Li was arrested.
He confessed everything.
Wang was arrested?
Only his execution remains.
When will it be?
Worried?
He was your friend, wasn't he?
He instigated the uprising at your suggestion, didn't he?
When is he to die?
Why don't you answer?
Very well.
Today I'll make you weep like a woman.
That'll be something for your wife to hear!
WANG HENG Ll In Memoriam
Wang... in the end you died without seeing the dawn.
But your countrymen... will surely bury you by the light of the newborn day.
Get outta here.
Come on.
Go inside.
Kiss her.
Don't let me stop you.
Michiko, you mustn't come here.
Don't worry.
Go home.
I brought some sushi.
May I give it to him?
Go ahead.
Won't you have some?
Michiko... if you ever need help, talk to Okishima.
Okishima, I'm counting on you.
Mr Okishima... is being transferred.
I came to say goodbye.
I see.
I'm sorry I wasn't any help on the phone.
I argued with the manager.
I'm being shipped out to a smaller mine.
So that's how it is.
I'd have liked to stick around and fight with you some more.
Furuya's taking over my spot.
We're back to square one.
Is there anything you'd like?
Nothing.
So...
I won't be seeing you again?
I learned so much from you.
No, it's me who learned from you.
Though you've paid a bitter price, you finally caught the humanism train.
Oh, yes.
Wang Heng Li...
No unauthorised conversation!
Your time is up.
Private!
Michiko!
You're hereby released by special permission.
But don't think you're out of the woods.
Remember:
I'll always be watching you.
Wherever you go, I'll be there first.
Reporting back, sir.
It arrived, Kaji.
EMERGENCY SUMMONS TO MILITARY SERVICE
I knew something was up.
So you use me up and then throw me out.
I can't afford to lose you, but there's nothing I can do.
Forget the smooth talk!
Nice way to get rid of those you don't want.
There's nothing I can do.
Now I see the light.
I should have trusted the whores instead of the managers here!
I know you're tired, but turn your duties over to Furuya.
He needs to find a new leader among the special labourers.
Since Wang Heng Li escaped, no one wants to lead them.
Escaped?
Wang Heng Li escaped?
Thirty of them got away.
So he made it after all!
Good for you, Wang!
I hope they all get away!
Sir, please inform Furuya that he's been spared a thorough beating thanks to Wang's escape.
I was going over there to thrash him, not hand over my duties.
But I've suddenly changed my mind.
I guess a man finds kindred spirits after all.
Japanese devil!
Japanese devil!
Kill me...
like you murdered Kao!
Why don't you kill me, Japanese devil?
He murdered an innocent man!
He murdered an innocent man!
Mr Kaji.
Don't be angry.
I know you have a good heart... but you weren't able to save Kao's life.
Michiko, you'll fall!
Welcome back!
I heard you'd come back in terrible shape.
But it's not true.
You look well.
I'm so happy!
So very happy!
What's this?
They wouldn't!
No, it's not fair!
They promised you an exemption.
This is a dirty trick!
This is too much.
It's not fair.
Nothing can be done now.
What did you do to deserve this?
Nothing.
But I'd hoped to accomplish things with you when I returned.
Why must these terrible things happen to you?
What have you done to deserve this?
You're so thin, so covered with scars.
And now they're dragging you off to war.
You mustn't die.
We must live again.
When will we meet again?
You'll come back.
I know you will.
Japanese devil!
Japanese devil!
Japanese devil!
I hope you die!
Michiko, let's go home.
We still have 24 hours together.
Japanese devil!

PART 3
- All's in order, sir!
- Good.
Attention!
All's in order, sir!
- Good.
Salute!
At ease.
JANUARY 23RD - 20:00 HOURS 32?
BELOW ZERO
Here he comes.
You recruits are feigning sleep, eh?
You can't rest until I've made my rounds.
All seems to be in order.
Recruits, fall in!
Turn on the light.
Legs apart and grit your teeth.
Idiots!
Did that hurt?
- No, sir!
Good.
I'll teach you dogs a lesson!
Fools!
You know what that was for?
What about you?
- I dunno.
- What?
I don't know, sir!
You don't?
Well, I'll show you.
It was for this.
Since when do you use the water tank as an ashtray?
Speak up!
The duty officer specifically ordered that those tanks be kept clean and sanitary.
We received the order.
Who was on duty today?
Step forward!
Remove your glasses.
Get up!
Obara refilled the tanks before evening mess.
I removed the ash trays after "lights out."
You're implying that one of your superiors smoked after "lights out"?
Kaji, are you trying to pin blame on a senior serviceman?
No.
I only said that Obara showed no neglect.
Watch your language!
Recruit Obara admits his neglect.
Of course.
Why didn't you say so?
- I'm very sorry.
- You should be.
- I'll be more careful.
- It's too late for that!
Owaku, where are you going?
To change the water.
You don't have to do that.
Kaji, you dare talk back to PFC Bannai?
I didn't talk back.
The platoon leader demands discipline!
Who taught you to be insubordinate?
Your friend Shinjo over there?
Logic won't get you anywhere in this army.
Don't try acting big around here just because you went to college.
Any arguments?
PFC Bannai, leave this to me.
Very well.
You, report to me later!
Can't you even see the target?
I can.
Then your heart isn't in it.
Take careful aim.
Imagine it's the enemy out there.
Come on, Obara.
Hit it, please!
Draw a bead carefully onto the target at the bottom of the bull's -eye.
Hold your breath!
Apply pressure on the trigger and squeeze gently.
You idiot!
No luck.
We'll never get to lunch at this rate.
And always because of him!
- It can't be helped.
- Shut up, you hick.
That's no excuse.
What's going on over there?
Stop acting like starved mongrels.
Kaji!
Show Obara how to do it.
Yes, sir!
Unstack arms.
Show him you can hit the target with eyes closed.
- With eyes closed?
- That's right.
With proper posture, you should at least hit the target.
Objective - the target!
Position - prone!
Obara, watch how he holds it and squeezes the trigger.
You see, Obara?
Bad eyesight is no excuse.
Try again.
Obara, try to relax.
Don't jerk the trigger.
Squeeze down on it.
Squeeze it slowly.
Slowly now...
You'd be better off dead!
You're a disgrace to the whole Kwangtung Army!
Obara, listen carefully.
A sense of responsibility is a soldier's life.
A grenade could wipe out your squad because of your missed shot.
Show some responsibility and some shame!
To the target on the double!
Kaji, you go with him.
Bayonet attack!
Charge!
Down!
Obara, stop crying!
Forward!
"A t the time, Kaji was trying to save the lives of innocent Chinese.
This earned him the hatred of the Kenpeitai.
They arrested him and grilled him mercilessly.
If my husband had indeed been guilty, they would not have released him after just 20 days.
I fervently hope that this unfortunate incident... will not compromise his position as a member of your unit.
As the wife of a recruit, I address this appeal to you.
The life of a recruit under suspicion would be a living hell with no salvation."
Orderly!
Where's the orderly?
Entering, sir!
Your orderly, sir!
Call Warrant Officer Hino.
Salute the warrant officer!
Present arms!
Eyes front!
PFC Yamazaki now relieved of guard duty, sir.
Good.
Thank you for your work!
Knock it off!
See to your own duties.
Thank you.
We're very grateful.
Anything you need washed?
That's all right.
You're a hard worker, Kaji.
I hated laundry duty even more than beatings.
One might hate it, but there's no avoiding it.
You won't be a private forever like me.
You're tops among the recruits.
But don't forget:
You're under suspicion.
I know.
They can't afford to have a Red leading the pack.
They're hoping you'll make a misstep.
You and I can't even talk without being watched.
Anything suspicious about Kaji's actions?
Have you received reports to that effect?
I asked if you had.
None, sir, though I have him under surveillance.
What are Sergeant Hashitani's thoughts?
He's giving Kaji special sniper training now, sir.
- He's a good marksman?
- An unerring eye, sir.
- And his barracks discipline?
- Excellent, sir.
How is he with Shinjo?
They seem close, but -
Seem?
You don't know?
They're both blacklisted by the Kenpeitai.
They have no time now to do any plotting.
Why's that?
I've kept Shinjo on constant supply transport and guard duty.
Keep an eye on them.
They'll soon show their true colors.
If they straighten up, they could be our best soldiers.
Attention!
At ease.
Listen as you are.
Afternoon training is canceled.
There'll be an arms inspection.
The tiniest speck of dust will not be tolerated.
After dark there'll be sentry training, followed by attack training at dawn.
What do you think?
Like the full schedule?
Owaku, you have a letter.
Kaji.
Obara.
Corporal Shibata.
- Salute!
Arms inspection again?
From your wife?
Read it out loud.
No, I save it till I can't bear it any longer.
Oh, well.
You must have a good wife.
I wonder what that wench of mine is up to.
Hey, Obara.
Think things will get better after basic?
It won't be this rough much longer.
I'm getting fed up.
Don't let little things get you down.
Little things, eh?
Bad news from home bothering you?
My mother and wife are fighting as usual.
My wife's threatening to leave home.
Doesn't mean she's leaving you.
You wouldn't understand.
You've had all the breaks.
It would leave my aging mother all alone.
Back one and drop the other.
To back 'em both is asking for trouble.
That's the wrong one.
Take it out.
You broke it.
You weren't paying attention.
You fool!
That was mine!
What are you gonna do about it?
I'm not apologizing to the army for you.
That won't fix your rifle, Kubo.
Forgive him.
- No, I won't!
- Then don't.
You stay out of this.
Everybody here knows you're a Red.
And so?
I'm just saying no one loves a Red.
Hit me.
Hit me all you want.
Attention!
Eyes right!
Front!
- All right, they're ready.
- Thank you!
Start distributing.
- Is there a Private Shinjo here?
- Yes, one.
Private Shinjo will take two recruits and clean out the latrines.
Good luck.
On whose orders?
Sergeant Soga's.
He sets up the roster for latrine duty too?
Quit your griping, Shinjo.
Is a three-year man too good to clean latrines?
Tell the NCO on duty or Warrant Officer Hino that I'll do it alone.
I don't need help from any recruits.
Shinjo... better take somebody along.
It ain't easy carting' all that shit alone.
Will none of you recruits go with him?
Kaji, why don't you go?
You're another Red shit like him.
Kubo, come with us.
I don't take orders from you.
That's it, fight it out.
The liquor will be here soon.
Come on, one more!
Get moving.
Recruit Kaji to latrine duty!
Recruit Tanoue to latrine duty!
That's the spirit!
They're giving you and me all the dirty work.
Standing duty the other night,
I suddenly realized how haggard you looked.
You've been on constant duty.
You have stamina, Kaji.
I've about had it.
They're just waiting for me to cave in under the pressure.
Salute!
- All is in order.
- Good.
A huddle in the latrine?
A truly stinking discussion.
Sir... does the company commander approve all duty assignments?
I wouldn't know.
Ask WO Hino.
I'll do that.
One more question.
What happens if a soldier refuses an assignment?
When such assignment is unfair, of course.
I suggest you check the Army Penal Code.
Aren't you asking for trouble?
I don't care about going home, but I do want to get out of here.
What do you mean?
I'm not even sure myself.
To go to some unknown place and get a fresh start.
Someplace where no one knows me.
Is there such a place?
Escaping from here only means immediate recapture.
There's only one other possibility.
Is the border close?
Not far.
But it's all marshland up to the lake.
Get bogged down there and you're finished.
Which would you choose?
The land where people are promised freedom... or the land where your loving wife awaits you?
I promised my wife we'd start a new life together.
You really believe you'll get back alive?
I don't know... but I hope so.
A rare Sunday leave
Walking down the boulevard
With her hairdo of a married woman
She led me up the stairs
To a tiny little room
" You're a wisteria dangling above
And I'm a lily below"
Just five minutes
To get back to barracks
"Come on, let me go!"
No time to take a train
No money for a cab
With my legs strong from daily drills
I'll make a run for it
PFC Yoshida!
There's to be a transfer.
A transfer?
They can't toss us out of here after four years' service.
They've already decided who it is.
Who?
Kaji, got a copy of the Penal Code?
Don't let them get to you.
What's the Penal Code for, Shinjo?
What did you tell him just now?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
A senior serviceman addressed you and you didn't reply?
Sir, have I done something wrong?
That's better.
What did you say?
Use your head.
We're celebrating today.
A beating could hurt.
I mentioned that he seemed tired and shouldn't be reading.
Hear that?
Telling a three-year man what to do.
So the old veteran Shinjo is tired, eh?
Hey, Shinjo!
Sorry to fatigue you even more, but may I trouble you with a question?
It seems he didn't hear you.
I'll clean out his ears!
A fight means trouble for us both, Yoshida.
I was reading the Penal Code at Sergeant Soga's suggestion to learn how to refuse an order without being insubordinate.
Attention!
Attention!
Salute!
At ease.
What happened?
It's Private Shinjo, sir.
He was taken suddenly ill.
I put him to bed.
Does a feverish man account for broken bowls?
Pick up these pieces.
Salute!
Cherry tree the color of my lapel
Your blossoms are scattered all over Mount Yoshino
If you're born a man in old Yamato
You must fall like a blossom at the battle front
It's ridiculous for a lady to come out here.
There's no place for you to stay.
What will you do?
I only wanted to see him.
I had no other concern.
The next train out is tomorrow afternoon.
Will you sleep outdoors?
Or spend the night walking home?
If you'll only let me see him, I'm willing to walk back.
Recruit Tanoue leaving to polish his boots!
Is Kaji here?
Report to the office.
You have a visitor.
- A visitor?
- Who is it?
A dame, no less!
Son of a bitch!
Better hurry up, Kaji, or someone might swipe her.
Don't be bashful.
Better hurry up.
I'll finish up for you.
Recruit Kaji reporting to the office!
Make sure you come back.
Damn!
Coming all the way out here to get laid!
Permission to enter, sir!
- Yes?
- Entering, sir!
Recruit Kaji reporting!
You wanted something?
What did you want?
Recruit Kaji, leaving!
Hold it there.
You're a disgrace to military discipline.
Don't let your wife make you homesick.
You're hereby authorized to spend the night with your wife within the confines of the company storeroom.
I finally had to come.
It's so far.
How did you make it?
I've changed, haven't I?
It must be rough.
I'm used to it now.
But winter makes things tougher.
We went hunting today.
I'll bring some of the meat later.
You haven't lost any weight.
I'm relieved.
You've come all this way, and there's so little I can offer you.
I'm just a recruit.
Look at me.
I am.
You mustn't worry.
I'll come through it all right.
How much time did they give us?
Until morning.
Even less than when they shipped me off.
So... it's all right then?
Entering!
Recruit Sasa with our squad leader's meal!
Ma'am...
Kaji bagged this game for us today.
Eat heartily and enjoy yourselves.
Thanks.
My husband is much indebted to you.
We recruits are all in the same boat.
The army's one helluva place.
But Kaji's a lucky devil.
No other woman would come way out here to see her man.
That's the truth.
There's so little time.
I hope it's not too much... but would you write my wife and tell her to do like you and come out to see me?
All she does is eat and sleep.
She cares about nothing else.
Tell her that things are rough out here and to bring lots of gifts for the senior servicemen.
Ride her good!
Recruit Sasa leaving!
Come on.
Let's eat.
A rookie allowed to monkey around with his wife!
The army sheds bitter tears!
Kaji, you're a sneaky one, keeping all the good things for yourself.
I request this favor.
He wants blankets.
Your wife should keep you warm.
Aren't your own blankets enough?
They are.
I'll make do.
Rolling around on a narrow futon.
Curse the blasted luck!
As long as we're alive, we'll be able to meet again.
I came here confident that I'd get to see you.
Even after you left, that Sergeant Watai kept coming by.
Wanted me to let him read your letters.
Nasty man!
Maybe he thinks you're planning to desert.
What would you do if I did?
Where would you go?
Across the border.
There's a man in my squad named Shinjo.
After three years, he's still a private.
His brother was arrested for communist leanings.
Even his girlfriend sold him out.
He claims there's a better world beyond that border.
A better world?
Where they treat people like human beings.
And you intend to escape there all by yourself?
You can't run away!
Not while you still have me!
The warrant officer said you were a top soldier, but you're still under suspicion, aren't you?
I won't go.
I won't run away.
I'll carry on here.
Please don't run away.
Come back to me.
All is in order!
You are relieved.
Assuming duty.
Forward... march!
Break step!
Don't forget your promise to come back alive.
I won't forget.
Aren't you sleepy?
Not a bit.
There wasn't anything else you wished to say?
No.
Even if there were, I couldn't express it in words.
I'm always thinking
I must tell you about this, mustn't forget to tell you that.
Me too.
Thanks for coming to see me.
It's only natural.
Thank you for such a wonderful night.
Don't thank me.
There's so little I can do.
Let's hope we never spend such a wretched yet beautiful night again.
Maybe it's because... you're headed for the front.
Why do you say that?
I just have this strange feeling.
Maybe that's why they let me see you.
No, you must come back to me!
You have to!
Will you grant me one last favor?
Anything.
Just ask.
I came here for your sake.
I realize it's cold... but I'd like you to undress and stand over by that window.
I must see you... all of you.
I want to burn that image into my mind.
I have nothing to offer you!
Nothing!
Please take me!
Reveille!
What's wrong, Kaji?
All worn out?
Bastard!
Come on, Kaji.
I'll give you a workout.
I'm not as easy to poke as your wife.
Come on!
I'm ready!
Enough!
Well done, Kaji.
PFC Yoshida... you let this recruit push you around?
Let's have another round like that.
I'm ready!
Don't retreat, Kaji.
Retreat is no way to victory.
I'm right here.
Come at me!
What is it?
I can't see you off.
We're leaving on maneuvers.
Be careful on your way back.
Time to part once again.
Thank you for coming.
Hurry and go.
I can't bear it.
Let's not say "good-bye", all right?
A soldier's will before departing should convey his resolution to his family and inspire them to carry on in a fitting way.
What does a departing soldier's resolution imply?
Speak up.
It means to lay down one's life for one's country.
You parrot back the right answer, but what did you write in your letter?
"Driving you crazy," eh?
"So worried that I could never face death" - was that it?
Coward!
I've never seen a worse soldier in ten years of service!
Obara admits his fault, sir.
That's not the answer your commander seeks!
Such effeminate ideas are more harmful than Red propaganda.
Even a Red will fight bravely when the time comes, but your kind surrenders before fighting.
WO Hino... see that he writes to his wife again.
Let him reaffirm his resolution.
" Tomie... your thinking is completely mistaken.
It's the duty of a Japanese wife to look after her mother-in-law in her husband's absence.
Please consider how your endless complaining interferes with the performance of my duties.
I'm very busy here.
Your bickering with my mother hinders me in my training.
It's my wish that you look after my mother, but if you feel this to be impossible,
I must ask you to leave my house."
Buck up, Obara!
We're only halfway there!
Come on!
Regulate your breathing!
This march ends your basic training.
Don't disgrace the whole squad!
Obara, don't give up!
Come on!
Keep going!
Somebody help him with his pack.
What kind of buddies are you?
Very well!
I'll help him.
You gonna let that happen?
Can you hold up your heads up if I do?
Lance Corporal, sir!
- I'll help him.
- Good!
Compassion for a buddy.
But if he still drops out, leave him.
A cart will pick him up.
Give me your blanket, pick, shovel, and tent.
You can handle the rest, right?
Sorry, Kaji.
Forgive me.
Hurry up!
Let me rest a while.
Your pack is 20 pounds lighter.
You don't need a rest!
You go on ahead.
I don't want you dropping out on my account.
Shut up and walk!
Quit now and all you've suffered will have been in vain.
We're almost done with basic.
Show some guts for once!
Obara, get up!
Get up, Obara!
It's no use.
Leave me behind.
I can't go on.
You'd let my help be for nothing?
Think what the senior soldiers will do to you, you fool!
It's no use.
Then to hell with you!
Be a quitter!
I'm going on!
Hate me all you want.
You quit before the fight was over.
But I won't quit!
You hear?
I'm going!
A bit fatigued, honorable recruits?
Bastard!
- Back a bit early, aren't you?
- Get up!
We've been waiting for you wretched dogs!
All you think about is food!
Stand up!
Stupid dog!
Pull yourself together!
Give 'em a shower!
Worthless scum!
Anyone who rides back on a cart isn't a man!
Don't you dogs have any balls?
If not, we can find a use for you.
Right, Obara?
Keep those fingers straight!
Get behind the gun rack and call out for customers.
"Hey, handsome, come on inside."
Go on.
Move it!
Show us how it's done.
The honorable Shosuke Obara What made the man go broke
He loved his morning baths, morning chasers and morning lays
It finally wore the poor man out
Get on with it.
Hey, mister, come in and have some fun.
Absolutely no sex appeal!
Hey, handsome, come on inside.
That's it.
Now beckon with your hands.
Say, handsome, come inside.
- Any takers for the lady?
- That's one I'd rather not mount.
Here's a customer.
Come on, keep it up!
Come on inside, handsome.
Want me to come in?
I haven't gotten any in a long time.
No objections to me buying this one?
We appreciate the business!
You stinking' shit!
You dog!
In the infantry, we don't ride home like a bunch of whores!
We walk!
You got that?
You should be grateful.
We never had it this easy!
You scum!
Worthless shit!
Why don't you go kill yourself?
Just returning the book I borrowed.
Get up!
Mind if I go to the latrine?
Don't be a fool!
You're on duty.
You're dead if they catch you.
Say I'm patrolling outside.
Do whatever you want.
We all have to die... sometime.
Is that a sign that I shouldn't?
Yes!
After all, one can die at any time.
Does that give you something to think about?
On your feet!
Attention!
Your morals are putrid!
You're like a bunch of stinking women!
This quitter who committed suicide... wasn't the only one at fault here.
It proves you're all rotten.
When did I ever train you to be like that?
What about it?
If you feel I didn't train you right, speak up!
All right.
Dismissed.
Do we stand guard over the corpse?
He's dead now.
He was a human being, after all.
That dog Obara jinxed us to the very end!
Say that again!
What's wrong?
Why so worked up?
Will you back me?
Don't do it.
They're all on edge over Obara's suicide.
You should have done it yesterday.
- Then why did you stop me?
Would you have stood a chance if you'd intervened?
I won't involve you, but I'll see this through.
Sir, I demand that PFC Yoshida be punished.
Demand?
That's no way to address your superiors.
Are you aware of the personal punishment he inflicted upon Obara yesterday?
I am not.
Not even a private 1st class is authorized to inflict such personal punishment upon a recruit.
But yesterday -
Hold it there!
Only dogs inform on others.
I'm not informing.
I'm demanding punishment.
Suicide is contrary to military discipline.
No matter the reason, there's no excuse.
Was Yoshida's action in accord with military discipline?
Forcing a helpless recruit to mimic a common harlot?
Silence!
You dog!
Regardless of what Yoshida did, this is all pure speculation on your part.
I don't claim it was the only reason... but it was the final humiliating blow.
Listen carefully.
A false step now could ruin your whole life.
I'm not concerned about myself.
What do you intend to do?
If you fail to adopt appropriate measures, I shall -
Spit it out!
It may be unwise, but there's no other way.
I'll be forced to take action myself.
You plan to make trouble, eh?
A personal feud could mean a stiff term in the guard house.
I won't be there alone.
Sir... please convey to PFC Yoshida that he'd better watch out for Kaji.
So you're implying that I indirectly caused my husband's death?
I can't honestly say otherwise.
I understand.
If only I hadn't written that letter.
It sounds cruel, but it's true.
I'm in a similar position.
I let him drop out during our march.
To help him walk would have meant dropping out myself.
If only I had quit with him -
The army recognizes no such reason for shirking one's duty.
When one drops out, what happens to him?
Please ask the warrant officer.
Quitters are the dredges of the military, a disgrace to their company.
Then my husband's suicide has doubled his shame?
I had hoped you'd understand.
Are there special ways of handling men who drop out?
No, nothing specific.
However, their promotions are delayed.
I just can't believe it!
My husband wasn't the type to do such a thing.
There must have been some reason.
Won't you tell me the truth?
A demoralized home front is the main reason.
Good soldiers only come from wholesome families.
I wouldn't probe too deeply.
Please try to see it like this.
A part of Obara died due to your feuding with your mother-in-law.
Another part died when I deserted him.
What was left -
That's enough!
You're dismissed.
Recruit Kaji leaving!
Is it true you're contemplating revenge on a superior out of personal enmity?
Answer me!
I have not breached military discipline, but PFC Yoshida has.
It's unfair to question me first.
You scum!
Is that any way to address the commander?
It's all right.
Let him speak.
Go ahead.
He inflicted unauthorized personal punishment of a vile nature after Obara dropped out from sheer fatigue.
I only ask why this goes unpunished.
- You were given an A in marching?
- Yes, sir.
- How were you treated that day?
- Very well, sir.
- Did Yoshida harass you?
- No, sir.
Would he have if you had dropped out?
I believe so, sir.
- Was Obara the only man punished?
- There were three men, sir.
- All by Yoshida?
- No, by others too.
Did all three commit suicide?
No, sir.
- Just Obara?
- Yes, sir.
Then why do you single out Yoshida?
Because Obara killed himself.
But I'm ready to press charges against the others too.
Silence!
It's clear you're out to get Yoshida and cause disorder in the unit.
Obara's death is merely an excuse.
By blaming a superior for a weak soldier's suicide, you undermine our finest military traditions.
I do not blame PFC Yoshida alone.
His actions only revealed the absurdity of conditions here.
That's why I demand his punishment.
Obara's death was not caused by domestic troubles.
Then what did cause it?
With your eloquence, I'm sure you can explain.
Tell me.
Answer me!
The basic cause... is the military itself.
You'd make a good private 1st class if you'd shut up!
Hashitani, teach him a lesson.
That's enough.
I'll warn you again:
Personal feuds are forbidden.
Violations will be treated as insubordination.
All right.
You may go.
Recruit Kaji leaving!
That one has guts.
His type make good soldiers.
WO Hino, I want him kept on the promotions list.
- Keep him on, sir?
- Yes.
Make sure he's well up on the list.
As his stars increase, his ideas will change.
Men are like springs.
The more pressure, the stronger they snap back.
It's best not to drive his kind too hard.
Put him on duty with the vets.
We're headed for the border in a few days anyway.
Thank you for your trying duties.
When did you come out here?
Today.
Half the guard's being replaced.
They keeping you out here?
Practically nothing but sentry duty.
That's just like WO Hino.
I admit it's effective.
I've about had it.
It's damn hot.
Take care of yourself.
They're wrong if they think they can wear me down.
What's that scoundrel Yoshida up to?
Don't do anything rash.
They're just waiting for an excuse to send you to prison.
So this is the real border!
You gonna try?
You coming along?
To the land of promise?
What'll you do over there?
That depends on them.
You believe unconditionally that true freedom can be found over there?
Not unconditionally.
It's all relative.
What use do they have for a deserter?
You'd be a mere tool.
A little tool in the service of their big promises.
You doubt that all races are equal?
I just don't share the same naive certainty.
What have the Japanese done?
Deserting the ranks of the invader doesn't prove the purity of your ideals.
You're still just a deserter.
What are you trying to say?
Prettier flowers blossoming on their soil... doesn't justify rejecting your own.
I could never do it.
This is WO Hino!
You hear me?
Send Kaji back immediately.
We need him for the intramural shooting match in two days.
Got that?
What?
I see.
They may not have plans to desert, but the danger definitely exists.
They were seen whispering together again last night.
Obara's death is shame enough for this company.
Have Shinjo transferred out at the first opportunity.
A signal flare!
It's close by!
Not that close.
Yes, it is.
Let's pick up a few merit points.
Come on.
I don't see anything.
You sure?
Might be farther away.
Damn!
Who goes there?
Stop or I'll shoot!
He was fishing.
You scared him and he ran off.
Does that prove he's innocent?
Son of a bitch!
You shot off that flare!
Confess!
I didn't!
I was just out fishing!
Please spare us!
He was really just fishing.
Shinjo, don't just stand there.
Take him to the guard post.
But if he's not the culprit -
Fool!
We'll make him the culprit.
That's ridiculous!
Do as I order you!
Forgive us!
Spare us!
What are you doing?
No, don't!
No!
Thanks for your troubles!
Kaji!
- There's mail from your wife.
- You've lost weight!
Have I?
I'm being sent out next week.
Was it rough?
Generally it shouldn't be too bad.
Three letters in three weeks.
Oh, and...
Obara's widow sent a letter to the entire squad.
What did she write?
She apologized for everything.
She also says the dead have no tongue, and she can't find out the truth about Obara's suicide.
Right?
What's that scoundrel Yoshida doing?
Five men for work duty!
At the storeroom.
One, two, three, four - still one short!
Kaji?
Obara would have made it five, PFC Yoshida!
Yoshida!
Shinjo's been called up before WO Hino for letting a spy escape.
Long time no see, Kaji.
You know your buddy's going to prison?
You're a disgrace to the Imperial Army!
Bannai shot the culprit anyway, so I'll let you off with the guard house.
I knew you'd end up there sooner or later.
Fire call!
Prairie fire!
Prairie fire!
Let's go!
Fan out to the right!
Move back to the left flank!
What the hell are you doing?
Move forward!
Careful, sir!
Hold your ground!
Move forward!
Start a backfire!
Retreat!
Everyone retreat!
Fall back!
Retreat!
Fall back!
Form a fire line where you are!
Stop!
Who's that?
Shinjo.
Deserter!
Sir, a deserter!
It's Shinjo, sir!
Cut that grass!
Kaji, wait!
It's too dangerous!
Stop!
Shinjo!
Shinjo, run for it!
Help me, Kaji!
Help me!
Yoshida, I'll save you if you'll make me a promise.
Can you hear me?
Admit to the CO that you made Obara commit suicide.
Can you hear me?
You're a lucky man.
You probably remember nothing.
We've shot you full of camphor.
I'm afraid it was too late for the other man.
He had hemorrhagic fever.
You were talking in your sleep, calling for Shinjo and a Michiko.
Your sweetheart?
Or your wife?
Both.
Who's been changing my bedpan?
Don't worry about that.
Just try to rest.
- Private Ishii?
- Yes.
- How many years of service?
- Three.
Well, you're not getting away with it!
Hey, medic... didn't you ever learn how to treat patients?
How long have you been in?
Three years, and still a private.
You may be a lance corporal, but don't try pulling rank.
What?
The slob took sputum from a TB patient to get shipped out.
Punishment should be per regulations.
We don't need people shouting in the middle of the night here.
Private Tange, eh?
Very well.
We'll see who has the last laugh.
PRIVATE TANGE
Don't overexert yourself.
They'll have you up and working soon anyway.
No point rushing things.
Patients get work detail too?
A rookie, eh?
Have a seat.
What was your profession, Honorable Veteran?
Forget the "honorable veteran" stuff.
I was a latheman, and a good one.
Weren't you guys exempted from service?
There are some guys it's safer to keep in the army.
Is that right?
Yes, it is.
You there!
Since when did you start walking?
No one does anything here without authorization.
I'm practicing my walking, nurse.
Hon. Head Nurse!
Sorry, Hon. Head Nurse!
I was practicing walking.
What's so funny?
Lance Cpl. Minakami... this ward lacks discipline.
Army hospitals aren't playgrounds.
Tighten things up!
Try that again and you've had it.
They say Roosevelt's in Russia talking to Stalin.
If Germany surrenders, that leaves only Japan.
Yes, the end is drawing near.
But if the Russians enter the war -
Kaji.
Private Tange's being sent back to his unit.
When?
Tomorrow.
That's terrible.
It's bad news, isn't it?
Sent back to his unit, eh?
No one can ever know what will happen tomorrow.
Your unit's been ordered to the front.
They'll probably keep you here on hospital duty.
Really?
Even in here, there's always more bad news than good.
There was so much I wanted to discuss with you.
We'll meet again somewhere.
You can always meet those you really wish to.
Someone once told me that true human beings will always find kindred spirits.
You're proof of that.
Don't give me too much credit.
But I appreciate your words.
More work for you.
Writing to your wife?
But I don't dare write the truth.
Because of the censors?
Not just that.
Everything I write ends up as a half-truth.
I want her to know how lonely I am, but I don't want to worry her.
What's more, as much as I detest army life,
I actually want to stay here as long as I can.
Is it that nice here?
There are things here you don't get at the front.
For instance?
For instance... talking to you.
And now... stay back.
The steam is hot.
Is it all right for you to be here?
I probably shouldn't be.
Nurse Tokunaga, why did you leave your post?
What's the meaning of this misconduct?
A rendezvous in broad daylight - while on duty!
Rendezvous?
Forgive me, but there's been no misconduct.
I asked Nurse Tokunaga to assist me.
A patient issuing orders to a nurse?
That's as bad as a rendezvous!
Hon. Head Nurse, I came of my own accord.
No excuses!
Get back to your post!
As you are outside my authority, I shall report this to your superiors.
It seems I repaid your kindness with injury.
You're being sent to the front because of me.
It's all right.
We had to part sooner or later.
We may even meet again somewhere.
I believe we will, whatever the odds.
You can always meet those you really wish to.
PART 4
Class-A fortifications with log-barrel cannons.
Must be the "scarecrow strategy."
This stinks!
Five years' artillery training, and they give us peashooters.
Let's put that one to old Commander Yamada.
Attention!
Is there a Private Kaji in this squad?
Yes, sir.
It's been a long time, Kaji.
So you're still alive?
At ease!
I am 2nd Lt. Kageyama.
I'm taking over your training as of today.
Who goes there?
Who goes there?
Firefly.
Snow.
Sounds of gun tractors or tanks for 10 minutes.
Otherwise all is in order, sir.
Good work.
What's that?
Probably a festival.
They shot off fireworks.
Doesn't make sense.
The fighting in Europe must have ended.
Germany must have surrendered.
A new batch of recruits arrives soon.
I want you to assist me in their training.
In what way?
The new men range from 20 to 44 years old.
Half active service, the remainder untrained.
Artillery men are a rough bunch.
They'd tear these men to shreds.
Basic is like that anywhere.
That's why I need your help.
Count me out.
I told you I gave up guarding the army's sheep.
I've reported that you're my assistant in the rifle squad.
I'll see that you make private 1st class.
Think you can bait me with a promotion?
No, I know I can't.
I just figured you could spare those recruits a lot of grief.
Need I say more?
I'll accept your proposal... on one condition.
What's that?
I want radical changes in squad composition.
And the training officer has agreed to separate the recruits from the veterans?
He has.
Hon. Squad Leader, if you approve, the company commander will as well.
Sure it's not just to keep the veterans off your own back?
That's part of it, but not all.
Many of the new untrained recruits are in their 40s.
Excessively rough treatment in the barracks would make it difficult for them to learn anything.
From my own days in basic I remember one case of suicide.
It's our duty to weed out such weaklings.
Training alone won't make men strong.
I'll work them hard during training but show them kindness in the barracks.
What would a two-year man like you know?
You have to put the screws on from the start to teach them what army life is really like.
So, PFC Kaji, you're the new assistant?
That is correct.
What will you teach them?
Just what I was taught.
And what were you taught?
Since you were picked as assistant, you must know a lot.
But there's one thing you have yet to learn.
Masui... teach the lad.
What could a mere private like me teach PFC Kaji?
Don't try to act big around me!
How long have you served?
I'll show you how artillery trains its men!
Cannon No. 1 loaded!
Kaji-san, you're a private 1st class in the infantry.
You could give Masui a beating if you wanted.
So our presence would interfere with training your recruits?
Want to lord it over them all alone, eh?
Won't let anyone lay a finger on your precious recruits, eh?
Then get ready for what you've got coming!
Open your mouth.
Wider!
Now listen carefully!
I didn't plug your ears, so you should be able to hear.
The pheasant that cries is apt to be killed.
This one won't cry anymore, the poor sap.
This is what you get for slighting the veterans.
When your beloved rookies arrive, forget the codes and manuals and teach them that!
Who'll save their hides under fire?
Not your codes or manuals, but the vets.
The same ones showing you such affection now.
Remember that!
The lieutenant!
What's going on here?
Take that slipper out of your mouth!
Take it out.
I'll overlook this whole matter... but only this once.
Such behavior will not be tolerated!
Nice young kid.
Thank you for everything.
- Get your men settled in?
- Yes, sir.
The vets may have grumbled, but you got your way, even if it meant eating that slipper.
I want to train men who'll be willing to die with me.
How many men will the rifle squad get?
Twenty on light machine guns and 20 on mortars.
Well, are you tired out?
Is the border close to the enemy?
The enemy?
Yes, very close.
Then this is the very front line.
I can boast to Father.
What does he do?
He's an officer.
A major.
Worried about your kid?
I'm not the only one.
I'll be all right, sir.
Sir...
I'm gonna carry a picture, okay?
Watch the casual language.
What kind of picture?
Of a girl.
Sure.
Most pictures are of girls or boys.
- I told you.
- His is different.
It's a naked woman.
A good luck charm?
Something like that.
It'll never pass inspection.
Better sew it into your loincloth.
Listen here:
Use formal language when addressing veterans besides myself.
If they hear "ain't" or "gonna,"
you'll get a beating you'll never forget.
Understand?
With eager face and eager voice
My wife and children urge me on to great deeds
Come here.
A little early to go around with loose buttons.
Words don't seem to teach you men anything.
I'll be more careful.
May I have it back, please?
No, you may not.
You can come for it later.
The button must have worked itself loose.
Go to the veterans' room and don't waver.
Be prepared for a beating.
Go get it back.
You'll have to handle this yourself.
Recruit Koizumi to retrieve his button!
Enter!
- What's that?
Your button?
- It was my fault.
Tashiro did it!
He pushed me!
What?
You dog!
Look at what they serve the veterans.
Don't tell me you scooped it up off the ground with those dainty hands you wipe your ass with!
Who cut our ration?
Why do you keep blaming me?
Tashiro, stop playing innocent!
What's that?
Cut it out!
Why fight over it now?
What should I do?
What should you do?
Hon. Lance Corporal, what should he do?
How about another helping from the kitchen?
No real hurry.
We'll wait.
Very well!
Dump the food back in the bucket.
Azumi, when that's done, take it to the vets.
We'll eat just rice.
It's better than nothing.
Take this!
Is that how Kaji taught you?
No, it was all my own mistake.
You polish your boots sitting on your ass?
What did you do, Enji?
Ah, the Honorable Assistant.
Kaji, how'd you teach your men to shine their boots?
- I was at fault.
- Shut your mouth!
How about it, Kaji?
I've yet to give them any special instructions.
He did teach us.
I was at fault.
You keep quiet.
I'll see that they're taught correctly.
Please forgive him.
Fine.
I'll stand by and watch how you teach him.
Hit him!
I understand you're opposed to striking your recruits.
I cannot do it.
Shall I show you how?
Like this!
Sir, strike me!
You're through here.
Go!
Son of a bitch!
It's not because I took a beating.
I want orders forbidding all corporal punishment of recruits.
I'd go along with you if we were stationed further back.
But it's different here.
The vets may be louts, but they can stand on their own two feet.
If I lost control over them, what would happen in battle?
I'd place my recruits and myself at your command.
In actual combat...
I couldn't trust you half as much as I trust those men.
Those jaded five-year vets wouldn't listen to a 2nd lieutenant fresh from the academy.
I understand, sir!
Just a minute.
Michiko wrote me.
I told her you were here with me.
She can't understand why you so rarely write, since you must be enjoying more freedom here.
More freedom, eh?
Want to read it?
Just give me the gist.
She's relieved.
Figures you have it easy under my command.
She has a lot to learn.
She asked me to keep an eye on you.
Be careful, Kaji.
Don't twist her words to support your own position.
Fool!
She's praying that our worthless lives might be spared, hoping against hope that you'll survive.
She repeats that over and over.
I'm sorry.
You're an officer.
You can write to her.
If you send a reply, here's what you should say:
"Kaji will not die.
No matter what happens, he'll make it out alive."
Please tell her that.
2nd Lt. Kageyama.
Okinawa has fallen, but we have the main island.
The 2.5 million soldiers waiting there -
- It's too late to pray for miracles.
- We're not!
Our strategy aims at final victory.
We all like to think so.
Though the home front expects the tide to turn, our men are being wiped out.
That's the true picture.
Meaning they died in vain?
Depends on how you look at it.
- Why, you -
- Calm down!
Save your heroism for your soldiers.
He who shouts loudest isn't always the bravest.
2nd Lt. Kageyama.
Aren't you making a mistake?
Japan's not as feeble as you might think.
From the Aleutians to Australia, from Tarawa to India,
Japan has pressed the battle across thousands of miles.
A pessimist like you can't begin to grasp her strength.
Yes, we've had to draw back our battle lines.
We've lost Okinawa and face battle on our mainland.
But that's all part of our basic strategy.
Look how the enemy doesn't yet dare attack our main island.
Their supply lines grow longer as our units grow more ready and compact.
Our main forces at home are still intact.
Our Pacific losses are like a single hair off the hide of a bull.
Can't you understand that?
- I understand.
- What do you understand?
That I'll probably die here.
And 2nd Lt. Nonaka... so will you.
What's going to happen to us?
If the Japanese lose -
Nonsense!
Japan will never lose.
It's un-Japanese to even consider it!
Un-Japanese?
It's only natural to be concerned about oneself.
Tucking your tails just 'cause we lost Okinawa!
You have no dedication!
PFC Kaji pampers you!
As far as I'm concerned, he's -
I'm what?
Afraid to say it to my face?
You've said nothing to us about the fall of Okinawa.
We need a pep talk.
We need faith in our ultimate victory.
You seem to love ultimate victory even more than food.
Personally, I love my wife more than ultimate victory.
You may consider that unmanly.
But when fighting starts,
I'll be the only one you can count on.
Hey, where's your salute?
Hold it!
You call that a salute?
Hon. Squad Leader!
I alone was at fault.
Let me alone be punished.
Save your breath.
Nice work, Hon. Squad Leader.
Mind taking over here?
Sir, spare the others!
Just shut up and keep it up!
- Hon. Squad Leader!
- Shut your trap!
Sir!
Naruto, shut up!
I'm taking it too.
You'll keep it up until he says you can stop... even if the commander says otherwise.
Got that?
You dog!
Get up or I'll whack you one!
Who's that?
Enji?
I'm sorry, sir.
When we were rookies, we kept this up for an hour.
Naruto!
Drinking after hours and raising hell!
You damned NCOs!
Scum!
You dare defy us?
Dog!
We'll murder you!
Yeah?
Just try it!
You're in for a surprise.
Son of a bitch!
I've been in and out of worse places.
Throw me in your guard house - I don't care!
Naruto, they'll throw you in prison!
Out of my way!
What have you got to brag about?
You've never earned an honest meal in your lives!
To hell with all of you!
Sir, please leave this to me.
I'll assume custody of him.
Insubordination and insulting a superior.
What will happen?
Can you help him?
If the CO feels that locking up a recruit would disgrace the company...
Please try to convince him.
Salute the duty officer!
Eyes right!
Front!
Cpl. Takeda and command of eight men have duly transferred guard duties to Cpl. Fujimoto and command.
Out!
Was it tough?
Sorry to concern you.
It was only three days.
They're all waiting.
Naruto's back!
Go on inside.
Naruto, was it rough?
PFC Kaji, come here!
Some training you're giving your recruits.
Our men are worn out from guard duty.
What are your men doing?
I'm sorry.
I happened to be out.
That's no excuse!
You'd better teach them right.
And stop acting big because you're a PFC!
Take that!
Kaji... get ready!
You scum!
Get up!
Well, how do you like being sacrificed for your precious recruits?
That's enough, Akaboshi.
Let's see you do that again, Akaboshi.
Come on!
I'll cut you wide open!
Don't think I won't do it.
Pride and face mean nothing to me now.
Come on!
You filthy -
Wait!
Filthy braggarts!
Don't tell me you're afraid of one two-year man.
I'll swap my life for one of you stinking worms!
Wait, Kaji!
Afraid to fight man-to-man?
Sir!
Naruto, let me go!
- Sir!
- Let me go!
Don't you rats ever forget:
I'll get even with you someday!
Sir... next time let me lend a hand.
Tashiro will help too.
Thanks, but that would never do.
Why not?
We'd all be called up for mutiny.
We'll fight it in court.
We'd be sure to lose.
Naruto... we can't win right now.
Maybe we could give those vets a good licking... but they're not the real enemy.
Our real enemy... is the army.
Prepare for roll call!
Sir, don't get up.
I want Lt. Kageyama to get a good look at my face.
Roll call!
Attention!
First squad:
Total 36.
Absent: 4.
Present: 32.
Count off!
Unnumbered: 1.
Sick room: 4.
All accounted for.
Emergency orders for this squad.
PFC Kaji and 28 recruits will depart at 19:00 hrs.
Tomorrow for trench-digging detail.
You'll march at night to maintain secrecy.
You'll join Cpl. Hironaka's command on site.
Work detail:
Approximately one month.
This is a cowardly trick... sending me out with a work party to avoid friction with the vets.
Look at that way if you wish.
You may think you've rid the company of its cancerous growth, but I'll be back in a month... probably more malignant than ever.
I don't think so.
When you get back,
I'm sending you away for special training.
Sending the prodigal son out for a few knocks in the harsh world?
To South Manchuria.
Maybe even close to Michiko.
Why stay here at the front if you have a chance to get away?
You agree?
You and I still have unfinished business.
You avoided the issue, while I pushed a little too hard.
Neither of us accomplished anything.
You're a clever man, but picking the army as the stage for your battles was a fool's work.
It's wiser to play it safe than to be stubborn.
Will you do this clever fool a favor?
The mother hen's leaving half her brood behind.
It causes her some concern.
My absence may make it easier to keep the vets in line.
Can I count on you?
Don't be such a pessimist.
If you must worry, worry about your wife.
You must be all out.
Take them.
Sir, please come back to us.
It's only a month.
I get the strange feeling I'm being stranded.
You and I here together makes some people nervous.
Neither of us is very patient.
Naruto, watch that temper.
Take any trouble to Lt. Kageyama, you hear?
Work party, fall in!
Attention!
Salute the honorable lieutenant!
Eyes center!
Front!
PFC Kaji and party now departing!
Right face!
Forward... march!
Here comes our water!
Sir!
Take a look.
Good work.
Well done.
Feels like I'm building my own house.
Yes, I suppose you'd want to fight in here if possible.
I could battle fate with an easy mind here.
I see.
Sir, that bum wants to bring his mother and girlfriend to live here.
You idiot!
Your mother might want to sleep between you and your bride!
Are you engaged?
When the war's over, let Naruto build you a love nest.
He's a carpenter.
He'll be glad to.
Nakai, you can help handle his mother.
I'll help handle the bride anytime!
Sir, you've never told us about your wife.
She's a good wife.
You'll all have to meet her after the war.
Is she tall or short?
Medium build.
About 5'2 ", 105 Ibs.
- Just my size!
- Fool!
Work party, fall in!
On the double!
Listen carefully!
At dawn today, our Seiundai fortifications were attacked by heavy Soviet forces.
It seems Major Ushijima and all his men died a glorious death.
The enemy is advancing inland along the entire Manchurian border.
We are to return immediately to barracks to await reassignment.
We are to construct fortifications along the new line of defense, where we shall meet and crush the advancing enemy!
Disperse!
Hit the dirt!
A reconnaissance plane.
Nonaka Platoon, listen carefully.
Those without rifles will lash their bayonets to birch staffs for use in close combat.
Don't we get rifles?
Birch breaks too easily to be of much use.
Is it my fault it's all that grows here?
We're moving out!
Break camp!
Prepare to depart in 10 minutes!
Volunteers to go pick up our weapons!
Tashiro to the supply depot for weapons!
Very well.
Be careful.
We're moving out!
Break camp!
We leave in one hour!
Sir... what's happening with our command unit?
These conflicting orders confuse and demoralize our troops.
Do your griping to the CO!
This is war!
Where's Doi Company?
Over here!
Hironaka Squad?
Over here!
What happened?
We're worn out.
Did you come from Seiundai?
There weren't any survivors there!
Only Onodera managed to sneak away.
I didn't sneak away.
I was sent out with a message.
What's the difference?
Why so angry?
At least you got out alive.
Recruits, bring us some food!
What happened at Seiundai?
We got wiped out, including all your precious recruits.
Russian shells suddenly started whistling overhead.
And Lt. Kageyama?
Killed in action.
Aircraft approaching from the north!
Let's go!
Platoon... halt!
Fall out!
You'll find no loot around here.
Where's the senior officer?
Good question.
Hey, you know where he is?
Probably giving his girl a final workover.
In that case, Sergeant, will you issue orders for weapons?
Sorry, sir, but I'm not authorized to issue orders.
You'll need orders from HQ.
Where's the phone?
I'll talk to HQ.
Right there.
What's wrong with this thing?
The bombings cut the lines.
Sir, shall I liberate more candy from the canteen?
Good idea.
Stay where you are!
Traitors!
I'll kill you all!
I'm taking the rifles on my authority.
300 men can't possibly dig 1.5 miles of trenches in 48 hours.
You think the enemy will wait while you finish?
Instead of ineffective half measures, we should stop up the valleys with trenches and concentrate on strengthening our fortifications.
When you're the strategy officer, you can do it your way.
You're stationed in Area C, I believe?
I'm sorry to say this, but for strategic reasons, your area will suffer heavy casualties.
I'm not saying this to protect myself.
The task is simply impossible.
Even if I order you?
Lieutenant Doi... proceed with the work.
Yes, sir.
But the Hon. Staff Officer must remember that some areas will not be finished.
Should those breaches prove fatal, I cannot be held responsible.
To hell with your family.
The fate of Japan is at stake.
If we lose, we'll have no homes!
Easy for you to say with no family.
Even if we lose, if I survive, my wife has a future.
If parents survive, the kids have a chance to grow up.
It's not them.
You're just afraid to die.
That's enough, Terada.
You're always arguing with everybody.
Because they only think of themselves, not our country.
You're not afraid to die?
I am not.
I see.
Well, I am.
I thought you'd say that.
Now that we're in combat, may I speak my mind?
Go ahead.
You hate me because my father's a major.
That can't be helped.
But you defend this cowardly scum because you're critical of this war.
It's all right.
Let him talk.
Yes, I am critical of it.
I sold my soul for a military exemption.
I can't approve of how your father raised you.
So you mean you reject this war completely?
I mean I should have rejected it.
Then you're a coward with a split personality!
You've had your chance to speak.
Now it's my turn.
You're a fool!
A simpleton who wouldn't understand why his mother would shed tears if he was killed in action.
To die here is a dog's death.
Even you'll understand that someday, if you survive.
Here come our rifles!
Command squad leader Cpl. Hironaka.
Light machine gun squad, PFC Iwabuchi.
Rifle squad, PFC Kaji.
Antitank suicide squad, PFC Akaboshi.
At ease!
Attention!
Lt. Nonaka will assume command of Platoon III.
The enemy attack will presumably commence at dawn.
Each man will dig a foxhole by midnight in the spot designated by his squad leader and prepare to meet the enemy.
PFC Kaji.
You will take a scouting party and ascertain the location of the enemy.
You'll rejoin this main party before sundown.
Takasugi and Terada, step forward.
Ready ammunition!
This is ridiculous!
After five years of training, they want me crawling under tanks!
I'll bet you recruits don't want to die either.
Well, don't look to me.
You're on your own.
Your report conflicts with the others.
Did you penetrate deeply enough to confirm?
I did, sir.
Can your two men confirm the 15 tanks?
I left them behind the embankment, sir.
Why?
We were ordered to remain behind until called.
And he didn't call you?
- I did not, sir.
- Why not?
Recruits are not trained in scouting tactics.
Very considerate of you.
You never got close enough to confirm those tanks.
Coward!
I'm scared out of my wits.
This waiting's getting on my nerves.
It's already decided who will live and who will die.
It's just a few hours till dawn.
We're like condemned men awaiting execution.
There's white cloth in my foxhole.
It must be a grave.
There are no graves here.
It has to be a grave.
It must be filled with crumbling bones.
Stop driving yourself crazy!
You're not a child anymore.
Please let me change places with someone.
Sir...
I'll swap with him.
No!
You'll soon be glad to hide under corpses.
Why worry about a grave?
Terada, go join Cpl. Hironaka as orderly and runner.
Well, the end has come.
Orders may not be heard above the din of battle.
Each of you must think for himself.
There are just two things I want to say.
Don't be a coward.
Like it or not, what comes will come.
The other thing is:
Never give up.
Not for the sake of victory, but for yourself.
If things get too hot, take cover and think about home... or your girl.
That's what I plan to do.
Nakai, you got that girl in your loincloth?
Of course!
Good.
Hang on to her.
They're coming!
Send up the signal flare!
Lt. Nonaka, prepare for action.
Nonaka Platoon, every man to his station.
Hold your fire.
Commence firing at 300.
Distance 800.
Fire!
Blast 'em!
Wipe 'em all out!
Hold your fire!
Save your ammo!
To your right, 400!
Fire!
Get those tanks!
Rifle squad... when the big guns open up, keep your heads down!
Lhara!
Sir!
What is it?
Tanks closing in on our rear!
Where's the CO?
- Over there!
I'm going!
Wait!
They're still firing.
I'll be okay.
Fire!
Keep your heads down!
Sir!
Koizumi...
Mimura...
Our only alternative is to attack.
Send a runner to the CO.
Ask what he plans to do.
Terada, take the message!
Terada relaying the message!
I'm out of ammo, sir!
Azumi, you got ammo?
Let me have some.
No, I'm short too.
You're not even firing!
Fine, keep it!
I'm out of ammo, sir!
I warned you about wasting it.
Here.
Wait!
Stay here.
We'll fire together.
Commander!
Where's that runner?
Enemy troops to our rear!
We're trapped!
We all feel safer with you here, sir.
And I want to send you home safe to your mothers.
Enji!
I'm out of ammo, sir!
I'll take him some.
You'll go?
I'm out.
Ammo!
I'll be right back.
No, if you go, stay there.
Make every bullet count, okay?
Get ready.
I'll cover you.
Go!
Tashiro!
Nakai, stay down!
Tashiro!
Sons of bitches!
Lieutenant, should we retreat?
Fool!
Long live the Japanese empire!
You fool, come back!
Terada, what are you doing?
Where's the tank?
It's gone.
Does it hurt?
They'll come back for us again.
The major's son fought bravely.
You just might make it through this.
I'll sear your wound.
Close your eyes.
Rifle squad!
Rifle squad, show yourselves!
Anyone there?
I refuse to die.
- What'll we do?
- One final charge.
A final charge?
Watch out, Kaji!
Onodera.
Will we make it?
They coming this way?
- You got a grenade?
- No.
If we have to, we jump at 'em.
Please save me!
Are they gone?
Are they?
- Quiet!
They're still up there.
Stop shooting!
He'll get us all killed!
- Stop shooting!
- I got him in the leg!
The battle's over.
No, it's not!
I'm gonna attack!
If you wanna die like a dog, go ahead.
What do we do now?
We were lucky to come through it alive.
Let's try and stay that way.
All right, we get it!
We know how tough you are.
Stop showing off!
You don't know the Kwangtung Army!
He's raving mad!
Pin him down, Kaji!
Come on, you damned Ruskies!
I'll chop you up!
Onodera, it's too dangerous!
Quiet!
You don't know how tough I am!
Quiet or we'll all be killed!
Onodera, be quiet!
Be quiet!
What happened?
He's dead.
I won't claim I put him out of his misery.
I killed him!
You didn't have to kill him.
Do you blame me?
Do you?
I'm a monster!
But I'm going to stay alive!
Is anyone there?
Isn't anyone left alive?
Answer me!
Is anyone else still alive?
END OF PART 4
[¶]
How many times am I going to tell you?
Papa.
How many times?
Banging on pots and pans and garbage can covers wasn't enough noise for you, and driving us all crazy by playing on the washboard with Mother's thimble, that was not enough noise either.
But it doesn't have to be noise.
There's music in drums, Papa, I know there is.
I don't know how to tell you.
Well, sometimes, it can be real quiet music too.
Listen.
[SOFT DRUMMING]
Papa, did you know that drums were the first instrument man ever played?
It's true.
Did you know that?
I've been too easy with my baby son.
Papa, I'm 18 years old.
Why do you treat me like a kid?
Why do you act like one?
At your age,
I was already working for eight years, but I wanted you to be somebody...
But I think I can be somebody as a drummer.
Somebody fine, a priest, maybe.
But I want to be a drummer.
Why?
Papa, if I told you why, I'd be lying, I don't know why.
Now, listen to me, my son.
In one month from now, you are graduating from high school.
It is time that you understood that there are men walking the streets begging for work, and you...
Where did you get this thing with drums?
From the devil himself?
No, Papa.
Then get rid of them.
Didn't you hear me?
I can't, Pop.
Didn't you hear me?
How many times am I going to tell you?
And tell you, and tell you, and tell you, and tell you, tell you?
Why don't you kick me too, Pop.
You might just as well.
Don't talk, Eugene.
It's no use.
No, that's right, because I'm gonna get me another set of drums.
I don't know how, but I will, and if you break those,
I'm gonna get me another set, and another after that, because you're right, I'm not a baby anymore.
I'm getting a chance to play with a bunch of guys at Austin High.
They formed a band, and they play jobs for money,
Pop.
That's what I'm gonna do.
Oh, can't you see, Pop?
I gotta.
Yeah, crazy, man.
Man, and I was worried about who was gonna fill in for Davey Tough when he cuts out for New York, but the good Lord never closes one door without opening another.
Hi.
Oh, hi.
We met last week.
Yeah, I know.
Oh.
Would you like some?
Oh, thanks.
What?
I was just trying to remember if I thanked you for the gum.
You're funny.
I'm not.
Who were you beating on those drums?
Well, that's how you were playing just now, like there was some kind of devil in those drums you just had to beat out of there.
There is.
His name is Nobody, Mr. Nobody, and he wants me to be just like him, see?
Hey, Eth, how do you like that, huh?
He sure tore things up, didn't he?
Yeah.
All right, you guys, come on.
That's enough playing for ourselves.
Let's rehearse for the job before my folks get home, huh?
Come on, Gene.
Hi, new boy.
Where have you been?
One, two...
Don't knock yourself out.
We're having a weenie roast and swim party at my house next Saturday, and... you're my date.
¶ Let there be you ¶
¶ And let there be me ¶
¶ Let there be oysters ¶
¶ Under the sea ¶
¶ Let there be wind ¶
¶ An occasional rain ¶
¶ Chile con carne ¶
¶ And some sparkling champagne ¶
¶ Let there be birds ¶
¶ To sing in the trees ¶
¶ And someone to bless me ¶
¶ Whenever I sneeze ¶
¶ Let there be cuckoos ¶
¶ A lark, and a dove ¶
¶ But first of all ¶
¶ Please let there be love ¶
¶ Let there be love ¶
¶ Ah, let there be love ¶
What'll you have?
Oh.
One of those.
[CHUCKLES]
Hey, do you think drummers ever get to live like that?
Not by playing at marathons, or that dime- a-dance palace you played last night.
You know, I'll bet everyone even has his own room up there.
Do you?
I'm an only child.
Oh, that's nice.
Is it?
Well, I always thought having brothers and sisters was the nicest.
Are they all like you?
Shy and so quiet, until you get behind those drums, then boom! "Look out, I'm coming at you, so hear me good."
It's like...
It's like drums must have been when they began, back there in the jungle.
Voodoo drums making black magic, getting everybody all shook up, like--
Do you say those things to surprise yourself?
I'll shut up.
No, no, I...
I like the way you talk.
Hey, I bet you could write a book.
I'll bet I couldn't.
Besides, I'd much rather write music.
You father, doesn't he mind?
No.
Does yours?
Uh...
He wants me to be a priest.
You love him, don't you?
Like he was God.
Uh...
Hey, listen, what are you doing after graduation?
Well, I know what I'd like to do.
Go to New York and study at the Juilliard School of Music, and maybe one day, if God is good to me,
I'd-
- I'd hear a symphony of mine played at Carnegie Hall, and...
I'd get married and have a house full of kids with--
Hey, drummer boy, come quick, I need your help.
Come on, hurry.
Hey, hey.
Can I bite you lower lip?
I thought you needed help.
Oh, I do, baby, I do.
Mm, with that moon and that music.
Mm...
Don't you want it?
Hey!
Stop it, stop it!
Stop it.
Thanks.
[HONKING]
Hey, thanks for the ride.
Nice seeing you.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
I'll see you, fellows.
...do thy will, Jesus.
[GROUP MURMURING IN PRAYER]
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women, and bless the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
[GROUP MURMURING IN PRAYER]
Papa.
Papa?
Papa.
Papa!
Papa, don't die!
[ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING]
Pray for me, Father, because something is wrong.
I...
I thought I had it made, but... the rain drips, and somebody walks a certain way, and--
The rhythm beats everything else out of my head.
I hear "Ave Maria,"
and my mind takes off on a syncopated version of it.
Father, I know I'm profaning something that's holy, I know.
I just can't help it.
I tried, I tried, I really have.
I know you have, but becoming a priest is a fulfillment, not a penance.
If you feel certain that it wasn't meant to be and you wish to leave--
No, I can't.
I promised them.
I'll make it.
In six weeks, summer vacation will be here.
You'll go home, get some rest and peace.
Fat?
What do you mean, fat?
How can you tell I'm fat, huh?
Hey, come on.
Hey, Ed, how come you guys are putting out in a speakeasy like this, huh?
Oh, we're lucky.
Boy, the kind of places that'll let us play our music, you can count on your nose, so here we play it the way we like.
Hey, Gene?
Huh?
Boy, you know, we could sure use you around here.
What do you say, huh?
What's to say, Ed?
A guy's going to be a priest, he can't...
Well, you know.
Yeah.
Sure, I know.
What are you gonna do all summer?
Oh, I don't know, my mother's...
I don't know, Eddie.
Gene, well, look, maybe she wouldn't mind if you just played for the summer, huh?
Maybe?
Well, she...
Maybe.
Yeah?
Boy, that's it.
You really put me on the sunny side.
Hey, hey, did you hear about Davey Tough?
He went to New York and made it with Paul Whiteman.
No kidding.
[THUMP]
Hey, hey, what's she doing here?
Oh, it's...
We've been-
- We've been dating kind of steady, you know.
Yeah, I tell you, it's crazy.
I just look at her, and she knocks me apart.
I'll tell you something even crazier.
I'm going to marry her.
Well, I haven't asked yet, so don't say anything, all right?
Hi.
Oh, no, no.
All right.
Hi, Eth.
Hello, Gene.
Hello.
Eddie told me you might be around today, and I-
- I just had to come and say hello and catch some of that scary drumming.
Scary?
It always scared me.
Didn't you know that?
Are my eyebrows off or something?
You've changed.
It's been a year, almost.
No more gum, huh?
I haven't changed that much.
You remembered.
I tried not to.
Thanks.
Didn't you write to anybody?
Well, it was better that way.
You look good, Eth.
I feel good.
It shows.
Excuse me.
[BUZZING]
Hey, Eddie, hey, what's that?
Oh, they're just testing.
See, in case of a raid, the light blinks a warning from the front door, that is, unless you blow out the man's fuse box... if you remember how.
[¶]
Yeah, come on, come on.
Hiya, Padre.
I asked you not to call me that.
Okay, Padre.
You know I love you too.
Come on, I'll even buy you a drink to prove it.
You know I don't drink.
Even if I did,
I wouldn't drink with a big noise.
Hey, hey.
Huh?
What do you keep tangling her for?
She's only trying to get a rise out of you.
Every time she comes in--
She's nothing but a big noise.
Look, just because one of her boyfriends owns this joint--
Whoa, he not only owns the place, but he's liable to open up your head to see why you don't use your brains while you've still got them.
Mr. Krupa.
Huh?
[VOICES AND LAUGHTER IN BACKGROUND]
Hello, Mama.
Ted.
Eugene.
Mom, would you like to come in and sit down, huh?
Come on in.
¶ I love my baby ¶
¶ My baby loves me ¶
What are you looking for, Mama?
I wanted to know where my son is working and with what kind of people.
Thank God that soon you will be going back to the seminary.
Mama, I'm not going back.
I can't.
Don't say that.
I've got to, Mama.
Don't say it.
Mama, I can never be a priest.
I wish I could be, but I just don't have it in me.
Mama, come on, don't look at me that way.
I...
I tried, Ma,
I really tried, for a whole year, but...
That life is just not for me.
And this life is for you?
In dark cellars filled with smoke?
Shameless men and women drinking alcohol, breaking the law, while you entertain them.
This is the life you have chosen?
This filth?
Compliments of Miss Corregio, sir.
Take it away!
Listen, Mama, if the whole world wants to drink and to go crazy, how is that my fault?
All I want to do is make my kind of music, and I'm doing that.
Mama, did you hear the waiter?
"Sir," he called me, not, "Hey, kid," "Hey, squirt," but "sir."
That's what I am around here, Mama, and I like that.
I have a job, money, friends.
Mama, why are you crying?
Being a musician doesn't have to be bad.
Ma, where are you going?
Aren't you at least going to listen to me play?
Here?
Your father was right.
Mama.
Mama, why don't you tell me what you used to say about Papa.
Don't you dare to mention his name in this place.
You said it didn't matter what a man did, but what he-- but what he was.
If I was meant to be a priest, Ma--
You are worse than they, because your father taught you to know better.
¶ We never worry ¶
¶ 'Cause we're just Yes, we're having fun ¶
I didn't think I could ever tell her.
You had to.
Yeah, I know, I know, and the way she left...
I guess she knows she can't stop you.
No one can.
How do you mean?
Well, your music's all that matters to you.
Why can't she understand?
Still, she's right, you know.
Oh, you-- Don't get mad.
She is, about you not belonging in dives like this.
Music like yours is being played in theaters and high-class hotels--
Sure, in New York.
Then that's where you belong.
Well, that's easy for you to say.
Not easy at all, Gene, because if you go, Eddie goes with you, and... and then there'd be two of you to miss.
Hey, Eddie.
Eddie.
Yeah.
Listen...
Did you ever think of making New York?
Well, Davey Tough connected.
Yeah, man, but...
Listen, maybe she'll come too.
Well, she always wanted to make that Juilliard and Carnegie Hall.
[BEEPING]
MAN:
A raid!
[SCREAMING]
Come on, Eth, let's get out of here.
[CYMBAL CLASHING]
[¶]
[SCALES BEING PLAYED ON PIANO]
Cooking is not allowed in the room.
No practicing after midnight, and, uh, that'll be one week's rent in advance, and don't try to sneak your buddies in here to sleep on the chairs.
I'm wise to that.
Well, welcome to the big city.
You know,
I think we should've gone to the Y like Ethel did.
What for?
Ah, we won't be living in this joint long enough for it to matter.
Hello, big town.
Are you ready?
[GENE HUMMING]
[WHISTLING]
Ethel sure mends a fine collar.
Yeah, she does pretty good with the socks too.
From rags to rags in one generation.
Hey, Gene?
Yeah?
How about packing this town and then going home, huh?
Never.
Not until we've made it.
But it's been over three months.
If there are no jobs for us, what are we going--
Oh, there will be.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah, if we live long enough.
Look, look, I'm no mental giant, so sometimes I'm a little slow on the upbeat, but you would rather hock your drums than play bread-and-butter jobs.
Look, we didn't come here to play at polka parties or to whoop it up on a truck at election rallies.
We came here to make a certain kind of music.
And that's what we're-- And nobody wants us?
Well, they do.
They just don't know about it.
Tell me something.
Tell me what it is with you, pride or something?
Look, I know you're a hard-head, but don't you understand something?
That they want it strictly from the cob,
Ted Lewis, and "Waltz Me Around Again, Willie."
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
The manager.
Ow!
[KNOCKING CONTINUES]
Aah...
Okay.
Hi--
Hi.
Hi, Eth.
Hi.
Any luck today?
Yeah, plenty.
All bad.
Seems like every jazz man in town has more experience than us.
Why, where'd all this come from?
The market.
Well, what did you use for money?
Money.
I got a job.
Switchboard operator at the Hotel Edison.
[NASAL VOICE] Good evening, Hotel Edison.
One moment, please.
I'll connect you with room service.
Good evening, sir...
No, sir.
There's nobody cooking food in this room.
Ain't nobody here but us chickens.
What about Carnegie Hall and all of the symphonies you came here to write?
Well, I can do both.
Ethel, what did you do a thing like that for?
I mean, sometimes I just don't understand you, Eth.
[SIGHS]
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to jump all over you.
Did you?
Well, it's just that you've been washing and... and sewing and ironing for us and now you want to feed us.
Ah, what's the matter with us that you have to go out and work for us?
Wouldn't you do as much for me?
Or Eddie?
Of course you would.
I just found a job first, that's all.
I...
I got to run.
Talk to you later, huh?
Hotel Edison.
One moment, please.
Hey, Eth.
I'll make it up to you.
You don't have to.
Oh, I do, I do.
You're a wonderful gal, Eth.
You know that, don't you?
Oh, that's just a rumor I started, and besides, I think you're wonderful too, so we're even.
Good night, Gene.
Good night...
Cold Hands.
Are they?
Hold me, Gene.
Close.
So close that nothing can ever come between us.
Don't look at me.
Eth, what are we getting ourselves into?
Eddie's expecting to marry you.
No, he's not.
Not anymore.
He knows how I feel about you.
Oh, I wish I understood you.
I wish you did too.
Eddie's one of the nicest and best-looking guys.
Why-- He's a wonderful guy.
I'm no good for anybody else but you, Gene.
I never was.
Please never let me go.
Whew.
Man, watch me make a slob of myself.
I'm so tired of those salt and pepper sandwiches.
Where'd you go?
Out.
Looking the natives over.
I don't want to be in the way.
Listen, Eddie, I, uh...
Look, I want you to know I never tried to cut you out, or make time or anything like that--
No, I know you didn't.
You didn't have to.
That girl looks at you like she's just sighted land.
You know, even while you were at the seminary, she was carrying a torch for you like the Statue of Liberty.
I figured maybe she'd have to get over it, but...
Look, I never really stood a chance.
I don't know how you feel about her, but I--
Oh, I'm going to marry her.
On the level?
First job I get.
She could die an old maid that way.
Hey, guess who I met in the lobby.
Who did you meet in the lobby?
Davey Tough.
Remember?
Yeah, sure.
I remember.
He said to say hello and how come we didn't make a dee-dee some night.
All right, I'll bite.
What's a dee-dee?
Oh, I don't know, a session at Dorissa Dinell's place?
The Lady Dee.
Huh.
That's where all the big guys drop in after hours.
Dorsey, Teagarden, Red Nichols.
Dorsey, Teagarden, Red Nichols?
Did you get the address?
Yeah.
Then what are you waiting for?
Come on, let's go.
[¶]
[APPLAUSE]
Hey, Eddie.
Hey, man, long time.
Hi, Dave.
You remember Gene.
Sure.
How are you?
Ethel, Davey Tough.
Nice to know you.
Hello.
Come on.
[CHATTER FROM CROWD]
Man, somebody wake me up.
How about this?
Oh, what a way to live.
I'm going to have a place just like this, and soon... way up high, with--
There goes Red Nichols... and there goes Dorsey.
[WARMING UP]
And here goes Krupa.
With them?
Careful with those drums, sonny.
[PLAYING "BACK HOME AGAIN IN INDIANA"]
[SONG ENDS]
[APPLAUSE]
Dorsey's the name, Tommy.
And this is my brother, Jimmy.
How do you do?
I'm Red Nichols.
Wow, you kick a lot of drums, Jack.
Uh, Gene.
Gene Krupa.
Hey, Eth.
Guess what?
Red Nichols asked me to hang around.
He wants to talk to me about working in his band for the new George Gershwin show
"Strike Up the Band."
Isn't that wild, Eth?
Oh, Eth, I'm on my way.
My luck is changing, Eth.
I'm on my way.
This is no time to be sleeping, Cinderella.
Yeah, we're all going up to Harlem for some barbecued spareribs, which Nichols says is the most.
Yeah.
No, no.
No, honey, that was last time.
No, no, I know, honey, but this is a different place.
Yeah, and listen, and then we're all going up to Charlie Sims' after that to play some--
Oh, darn it, I...
Gee, I forgot.
You've got school in the morning.
Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ethel.
Hey, you should have been to the party we went to after we got through with the club.
Oh, very, very, uh, high society, and you know what it got us?
Huh?
A record date with, uh, Dorissa Dinell.
Huh?
Only she'd never done real jazz before, so keep your fingers crossed.
A week from Tuesday.
Hey, wonderful.
That's my birthday.
Hey, that's right.
Well, that'll give us two things to celebrate.
Oh, Ethel, Ethel, I'm telling you, more things are happening.
I'm really beginning to move now.
What with the...
Oh, darn it.
Honey, I'm...
I'm not going to have time to take you to lunch today.
I have this interview with Down Beat magazine.
They're doing a thing on Chicago jazz, and after that, I'm meeting Red with some friends for cocktails, and then I've got to meet the man who runs the Jack of Clubs, and-- and then...
Honey, I'm sorry.
How about dinner at the club?
How about a nice, quiet sandwich somewhere, just the two of us?
When?
You say when.
I'll call you later, huh?
Say, uh, wish me luck, huh?

Hold it.
Hold it.
Is this what you meant by real jazz backing?
Because it sounds more like a razor fight in the dark to me.
All that racket.
And those drums.
I'm sure all that boom-boom would knock the needle to hell and gone.
The technicians will take--
I said I'm sure.
Dee-Dee, that's what rehearsals are for.
I know what they're for.
I'm not sure that they do.
I'm sorry.
I'll try to hold it down--
Well, you ought to be.
Do we need these pots and pans?
Now--
After all, I am not a cooch dancer and we're not doing "The Zombie's Mating Call,"
you know, which may come as a big shock to you.
Got a better idea.
There.
Now you can bang your pretty head off, just to show you my heart is in a good place.
Your what?
Snow again, junior.
I didn't quite get your drift.
I said, "Thank God I'm not a mink."
Aren't you, though?
Can we try it once again.
Tempo, Jackson.
She'll tear your ears off just for souvenirs.
Laying her pussycat on my bass.
Just who--
Gene-o.

Yeah, I'd love to, Tom, but it's my girl's birthday, and I promised I'd take her to a late show, you know, and some supper, and, well, I wouldn't want to disappoint her.
Okay, Gene-o.
Tell her happy birthday for me.
See you, Tom.
Now, that wasn't so bad, was it?
[PLAYS WITH VIGOR]
[DOOR SLAMS]
Oh, man, did you put her down.
Time somebody did.
My compliments, maestro.
What are we giving away here?
The most.
One sip and you're gone from the vale of tears.
Reefers?
Reet, the tender weed, or as the peasants say, "tea," and I don't mean oolong.
So that's what they look like, huh?
Don't give me that, Daddy-o.
How else would you get that crazy kick on your drums?
Oh, come off it, Jack.
Do you think I need anything like that to get me out there?
Stand up, Dad.
They're going over your head.
Drummer boy.
Do you have a minute?
Half a minute?
Haven't I heard what you've got to say?
I'm trying to apologize.
Yes, sir.
Anything else, sir?
If I let you go away mad, you'd spook me the longest day I lived.
That's how I am, and I don't like to eat alone, so...
Why don't we have supper or breakfast or both and get to like each other?
We ought to if you're going to do all my record dates.
I'm not going to bite you.
I'm not worried about you biting me.
There happens to be a girl.
There always is.
Does that mean we can't have a drink and talk for an hour or so?
It's her birthday and we're celebrating it tonight.
And you're afraid she won't wait, huh?
And I thought it was just me you were scared of.
Maybe if you called her and asked,
"Pretty please?"
[TELEPHONE RINGING]
DORISSA:
Don't answer it, doll.
[RINGING STOPS]
Good.
Come and scrub my back.
[WATER RUNNING]
Hmm.
What a night.
Do you know how much champagne you put away?
[TELEPHONE RINGING]
Gene?
Where are you?
At home?
Uh...
No, I'm uptown.
Yeah, I...
I had to call and apologize for not seeing you last night or... or telephoning.
That's all right.
Eddie explained that you'd gotten hooked into some extra work and that you'd be busy most of the night.
You must be exhausted with all--
Oh, never mind me.
What did you do?
I waited... like the foolish girl I am.
Gee, I...
I'm sorry, Eth.
I...
Listen, Eth, I got to go now.
Can I see you tonight?
Can you?
At the club...
All right.
And, oh, listen, Eth.
Happy birth--
Thanks, Gene.
Goodbye.
[¶]
[APPLAUSE]
Hey, Gene-o.
Hey, something wrong?
My mother.
I invite her to come and visit and stay at the new apartment, and...
I know she'd like to see how well I'm doing.
Sure.
She says she can't.
But she won't.
She says she prays for me and she's happy for me if I enjoy this life.
I wanted her to enjoy it.
I...
I wanted to see her face get happy for me.
Take it easy.
Okay, fellows.
Come on.
"Cherokee."
One, two...
Go, Gene, go.
MAN:
Go, Gene, go.
Go, Gene, go.
Go, Gene, go!
Go, Gene, go!
Go, Gene, go!
Go, Gene, go!
Can you hear that, Mama?
They're yelling for your boy.
Mama, they approve.
Go, Gene, go!
Go, Gene, go!
Go, Gene, go!
Go, Gene, go!
Go, Gene, go!
Go, Gene, go!

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Gene-o!
Gene-o!
Oh, you were wonderful.
Hi.
Honey...
That was Dorissa Dinell, the singer, and sitting next to her is Mark Hellinger, the columnist, and next to him is Speaker Willis, the top agent in the business, and they want me to join them.
I see.
Oh, come on.
Don't say it that way.
Well, you have to, don't you?
Nah.
It's not that.
It...
Well, you know how important it is for me to meet people like that.
And?
And I may get Speaker Willis to handle me.
And you don't want me there.
Well...
You can say it, Gene.
Okay.
If you want me to stay, I will.
If you really want--
No, I don't.
Not like that.
After all, I'm not your wife.
I'm just...
What am I, Gene?
I'm...
Uh, I'm sorry.
I just don't want to be in the way.
Ethel, you're not.
Good night, Gene.
It's just...
Hey, Eth.
Okay, let me get you a cab.
Thanks.
I can manage.
Honey, you...
You do understand, don't you?
I think I do.
How do you do, Mr. Willis?
My pleasure.
Using the drums as a solo instrument.
I don't know how anybody who looks like his mama's own angel-child can explode like that and... and... and knock everybody's plaster loose.
[PLAYING "INDIANA"]
But I did try to reach you all last night.
Well, how sick is she?
Not very, but she is my mother, and, well,
I haven't been home in a long time.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Eth.
It's funny.
I...
I miss you already.
That's an improvement already.
[¶]
[WOMEN SCREAMING]
[HORN HONKING]
Well, like I told you.
It took a little longer than I figured, but I made it.
Ah, you talk about class.
Hey, you haven't seen anything yet.
Just wait until you see the view.
Come on, Eddie.
I'm telling you, you haven't seen anything like this except at Dee-Dee's, only this is better.
Look.
Seventeen floors up and all of Central Park for your ashtray.
Huh.
Not mine.
I can't afford it.
Well, you don't have to.
You're my buddy, aren't you?
I don't understand something.
Last month, you moved to that beautiful place--
That was last month.
Eddie-boy, we gotta try real hard to be satisfied with the best.
Well, that's what making money is for, to have a good time before it all caves in on you.
Yeah, like the mine shaft did on my old man's leg.
Hey, we've got a lot of fun to catch up on, and this is the place for it.
Hey, I can't wait until I see Ethel's face when she gets back from Chicago.
Yeah, if she gets back.
I thought her mother was getting better.
I don't think she went just because of her mother.
Do you?
Anyway, I got a letter from her yesterday.
Oh?
Yeah, she asked me whether I thought she ought to come back or not.
How come she asked you?
Because I'm her friend.
And what am I, her enemy?
Well, don't get hot.
You know, she wasn't exactly happy around here--
Yeah, I know, I know, but whose fault is it?
We were hardly ever awake at the same time.
Well, you know what it is for jazz-blowers.
If it isn't the job six nights a week, it's a rehearsal or a benefit--
Yeah, or a new girl.
You know, you even had me fooled for a while.
I really thought you were going to marry that girl.
I am gonna marry her.
Yeah?
Like when?
You want me to tell you when?
Do you want me to tell you?
Gene, don't you understand something?
That she's not going to stand still for all that goop?
That you're gonna have to make a choice?
Why?
Eddie, what good is making good if you can't have everything that goes with it?
The parties, the kicks...
Oh, those gals mean nothing to me.
You know that.
Well, why can't she understand that?
I think she does, Gene.
Well, it isn't much, but he calls it home.
But why?
This must take every dollar he earns.
Yeah, and some he hasn't earned yet.
Hey, Eth!
Hey, you know something?
Every time I see you, you're looking better, only this time, you're looking like the next time.
Welcome back, Eth.
Gee, I'm sorry I couldn't meet you at the station, but I--
Gene-o!
Lookit who I brung.
Hey, Bunny!
Uh, excuse me.
Bunny, baby.
Nice to see you.
You know Bunny Berrigan.
And Frankie Trumbauer...
Frankie.
Bix Beiderbecke...
Bix Beiderbecke.
How are you?
And me.
And me.
Come on in, everybody.
Come on.
Come on.
Drinks for everybody.
Hello, Gene.
How are you?
Hello, pal.
Beautiful, marvelous party.
Look who I brought.
A couple of Ziegfeld Follies rejects.
I got one more to show you.
A little card trick.
A little card trick.
Watch this one, Gene.
Four of hearts.
Seven of diamonds.
Queen of spades.
Nine of clubs.
Nine of diamonds.
Ace of spades.
Four of hearts.
Queen of clubs.
Nine of diamonds.
Ace of spades.
Four of hearts.
Queen of clubs.
Where's the cards?
What?
Where's the cards.
I can't do it with the cards.
This one is an imitation of a, uh... of an airplane that is...
Pow!
[BLOWING]
Pow!
[LAUGHTER]
Hey, uh, tell me, you seen Eddie?
Sirota?
Yeah.
Saw him leave with your girl.
Why?
That's a good question.
Why?
All right, come on.
What gives?
She wanted to leave, so I put her in a cab.
Alone?
Well, that's how she wanted it.
She's a funny girl, Gene.
Yeah, hilarious.
Where'd she go?
Uh, to the Edison.
Smile like you're glad to see me.
I am.
It doesn't always show.
Aren't you going to invite me in?
No, Gene.
Huh.
It's just a room.
A small room without a view.
Oh, I get it.
You're mad at me because I didn't meet you at the station, huh?
That would have been nice.
Well, didn't Eddie explain?
You think I should have blown the whistle on the whole party, sent all of my friends packing, the greatest names in jazz--
No.
Then why did you walk out?
Because, all of a sudden,
I could.
Once, I...
I didn't think I could ever stop hearing those drums in my head or wondering where you were and what you were doing and whom you were doing it with.
No, Gene, let me finish.
I don't know what happened to that boy I knew in Chicago, but--
He grew up, all the way up, only you don't approve.
What I don't approve of is... is my being a sometime thing, Gene, a convenience.
Not even yours.
I tried to be, but it made love a dirty word, messy.
Don't talk that way.
How'd you like me to talk?
Pretend that...
I'm going to stone you out of my life, Gene, even if it kills me.
I know nobody ever died from that, but it sure feels like I may be the first.
Ethel, Ethel, what is it you want?
Too much.
I know.
Marriage.
You want us to live locked up in each other's pockets, like we--
I want you to say good night.
Then why did you come back?
Because hope can be very foolish.
Good night, Gene.

I want to front my own group.

Well, what doesn't?
Set it up with a long tour to break it in right.
Well, Gene, I'm not sure I can.
If you can't,
I'll have to get somebody who can.
You're pretty young for a...
You know what she said?
She said she didn't want to see--
Can we talk about something else?
Telling me she was going to stone me--
I said, can we talk about something else?
Hey, wait a minute.
Since when can't I talk without checking you first?
Since you decided to discuss her, that's when.
Like this.
I don't want her name kicked around here--
You don't want?
That's right, I don't want.
So let's talk about something else, all right?
Well, let's not, Eddie, buddy, because I don't have to talk to you at all.
Yeah, well, that's all right too.

Translate, please?
Last week you almost got us pulverized in that car.
[CHUCKLES]
So?
That was last week, and "almost" doesn't count.
Hey, what's the matter?
You want to live forever?
Okay, Eric, that's enough.
Nope.
Just as long as I can.
You're in no shape to handle that buggy.
Half the time you're not tracking, the other half the time you're not caring or you'd be plenty worried about not being able to hold onto those sticks.
Who can't?
What's the matter?
Didn't you ever have an accident?
Gene, you've got to come down.
The way you've been going, you're... you're going to wind up in a hospital.
That's the only way to go if you're going to go at all: big.
No, not big.
Bigger.
Everything's got to be bigger for you.
Bigger, bigger, then bigger than that, until--
Oh, wow.
My buddy's been on the full moon.
Now you want to tell me success is bad?
No, success is when you can stop worrying about it.
Success is when you can handle it, and you can't, not even nearly.
You're like all wonder boys who stop--
Where are you preaching next Sunday, Daddy?
Because I want to be sure and miss it.
All I did was invite you to a bongo session--
All right, all right.
So don't get hot.
Then don't go telling me what to do!
Yeah, wouldn't that be something?
Anybody telling you anything.
Look, if you're gonna break your neck, that's fine, but you do it without me, because this is where I'm getting off.
Oh, come on.
What is this, a threat?
No, it's just something
I should have done a long time ago, Gene.
He'll change his mind.
No, he won't.
Not this time.

We'll get it later.
Wow.
This your coat?
Yeah, sure.
Why?
What's--
Hey, what is this?
An arrest.
Now, look, fellows, if this is your idea of a gag--
These two envelopes, one of them containing 37 marijuana cigarettes, reefers, the other containing two, one of them half-smoked.
Found in your coat pocket.
In my pocket?
Now I know this is a gag.
Your man here was a witness.
Sure, I've messed with some reefers.
Don't ask me why, because I don't know.
Maybe I had to see what everybody was talking about.
Maybe I was low and I thought it might be kicks, like somebody drinks too much or gambles more than he meant to...
Or messes with a woman he thinks is poison, because that's exactly what it is.
That stuff not only threw my timing off, but it made my... my sticks kind of slippery, and...
All right, so if there's a rap for having messed with the stuff once,
I guess I've got it coming to me, but those reefers were not mine!
Miss Dinell can testify to that.
Whoa, hey, hold it.
Let's not drag little old me into this.
That's why we have Mr. Harlock here, who is only the best lawyer in town, and he says possession of marijuana is only a misdemeanor.
You plead guilty, and--
To what?
Listen, I'm telling you the truth.
I know you are.
Otherwise you'd have been caught in the act or they'd have been found on you, but the fact is, they did find them.
I talked to your valet.
It could look very bad in court.
But who would want to frame me?
Well, could be anybody.
A jealous woman, a musician you fired, a peddler, a vice crusader hipped on musicians.
You're a sitting duck.
Of course, we'll have Miss Dinell on the stand.
No, you won't.
You get me up there and I'm one dead duckling.
You are our key witness,
Miss Dinell--
The hell I am.
I'd never get rid of the smell.
It's very important-- Forget it.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got a town I'd better get out of.
[DOOR SLAMS]
Boy, there are smells and smells, huh?
[TELEPHONE RINGS]

Who?
Just a moment, please.
It's for you.
I'm not here.
It's your mother.
Mama?
Ma, don't cry.
There's nothing to worry--
No, I don't want you to come.
Because you'd only get yourself hurt by all the news--
I know that doesn't matter to you, Ma, but...
And I love you for it, but what good would it do?
I want to see you too, but not now, not this way.
Ma, why didn't you want to see me when things were going good?
Why now, when--
No, Ma.
No.
I needed you more then.
Why didn't you ever understand that?
Yeah, I will.
Yeah, on my way back to New York.
Now, you take care of yourself, you hear me, Ma?
Please try not to worry.
You see, I got myself a real great lawyer.
Yeah.
Thanks, Ma.
I do too.
Goodbye.
Well, for a man who just took a bum rap, you're doing--
What rap, Mr. Harlock?
Look, it's all over and done with, and as soon as I pay you the rest of the tab and blow this town, it'll be like it never was.
only I, uh...
Look, I can't pay it now.
I'm kind of broke, but, uh, only until I get to New York.
Gene!
Gene Krupa!
Kenny!
Long time no see.
Nice to see you.
Gee, when'd you get back?
You're looking great.
It's about three or four weeks.
Fine.
Listen, uh, did Willis talk to you about me?
No.
No.
About what?
About your drum spot.
Do I hear an offer?
For you?
Oh, marone, what I wouldn't give to have you on those drums.
Well, here I am.
Yeah, but Gene, how could I?
That pressure's worse than ever.
Do you know what would happen to me if I was to give a job to an addict--
Is that what you think I am?
No, of course not, Gene.
I know you're not, but they don't know it.
They think you are.
Kid, they'd crucify me with my head hanging down, and then we'd both be out of the business.
You mean I can't even work for you, huh?
It'd be like cutting my own throat, kid.
I'm sorry.
I'll see you, Kenny.
What's going on, Speaker?
Because something sure is, and let's not waltz me around.
Well, the heat's still on, Gene.
If a musician so much as smiles on a bandstand, he's suspected of being a dope fiend.
So?
So nobody's exactly anxious to stick his neck out, not even for you.
You should have told me.
Letting me walk around, embarrassing everybody like I was a two-headed beggar.
Come on.
It'll pass, Gene.
Six months or so, after the election, then all these reformers will be back in--
And just what do I do for those six months or so, huh?
Go nuts banging away on my practice pad, too ashamed to look at anybody in the face?
Because that's what I am, Speaker, and it's not a good feeling.
Something may turn up.
Yeah, sure.
Sure...
If I beg long enough or crawl long enough.
Well, I'd rather cut my tongue out.
Dope peddlers stop me in the street, call me up at home and...
Give me anything at all.
Well, anything at all is liable to be pretty far out of town.
It can't be far out enough, because this town is like it died and left me, and good riddance.
If you're sure, Gene.
How many watches do you think
I have left to hock, huh?
[PLAYING STIFF SWING MUSIC]
You missed the tempo change,
Mr. Jones.
Mr. Jones.
Didn't you mark it?
Oh, I got it.
I hope so.
This is my eighth year with this hotel and nobody's going to compromise my standards.
Well, nobody's going to compromise mine, either.
Look, you may not know who you're talking to.
Ha.
I know precisely who I'm talking to, Mr. Jones.
I owed Willis a favor, which is why I took the chance with you.
Now, you just behave and play my music precisely as it--
Your what?
I've heard better music coming from a squeaky floorboard.
Much better.
[¶]
[PLAYING A SLOW BLUES]
[CROWD HOOTING]
On the house...
Krupa.
All right, all right.
I'll go quietly.
When I tell you to.
With your name up in lights, this joint'll be mobbed.
Gene Krupa in person.
The champ himself on the comeback trail.
Well, not me.
I'm no freak in a sideshow.
Okay.
You're a great star.
Let's do it my way, cookie, huh?
Anguish and absurdity, that's all it is, so get tall, man.
Get tall, and to hell with them all.
Just...
Open up the Golden Gate.
Get off of me.
Well, how else you going to stand it?
Get off of me, I said!
I'm sorry.
You see what I mean?
Look at those hands.
Shaking like they were waving goodbye.
No wonder you can hardly hold onto those sticks.
[SMASH]
[BROKEN GLASS DROPS ON FLOOR]
Now, who's going to believe it?
Here I am, a million miles from nowhere, locked up in a dead letter office, and... and you drop in.
What are you doing in a joint like this?
How are you, Gene?
Surprised, mostly.
I guess I could do with a couple of shaves and a pressing, huh?
You look good, Eth.
I spent all day trying.
What brought you to Philly?
A train.
[CHUCKLES]
I finally found out where you were, so I thought I'd come down and catch some of that scary Krupa drumming.
You shouldn't have.
Oh, you don't belong in a dump like this.
Neither do you.
How long has it been?
Oh, eight months...
Years.
I don't know.
I forget.
What are you doing about it?
Like I do when it rains.
I...
I let it rain.
Pretty clever of me, huh?
It's only a matter of time and I'll be right back on top again.
Bigger than ever.
Oh, great, because, well, when I heard that you'd been playing in chop-suey parlors and strip joints, I...
I sort of began to wonder.
What else have you heard?
Tommy Dorsey's forming a band.
Where'd you hear that from?
Eddie?
How is he?
Fine.
If you're planning to see Dorsey about getting a job--
About eating some more crow?
Nah, no thanks.
He knows where to find me.
Would you mind very much if I got to Dorsey and talked to him about you?
Because I don't have that kind of pride, or I could get someone else to find out how he feels about you--
I can tell you how he feels about me!
Number one, there's the blacklist, and even if there wasn't, his men have to read music, and I mean read.
And you still haven't learned?
You knew that and didn't do anything about it.
All this-- Did what?
Go to school like a kid, learning how to play the tom-toms?
And from whom?
Jokers who wouldn't know it was "The Star Spangled Banner"
unless everybody was standing up.
Hey, I'm Gene Krupa, remember?
The Gene Krupa I remember would never have let anything or anyone stop him.
Not for long.
Go home, Eth.
Look, if Speaker sent you here, I--
Nobody sends me.
You ought to know that, Gene.
All right, he asked you to come.
He asked me not to.
Said I was a very foolish girl...
As if I didn't know that.
Because he thinks that success for you is, well, is like whisky to an alcoholic.
Then why do you bother?
Because I can't sit by while you let yourself disappear, Gene.
That's what's happening.
I wish I understood you.
I wish you did too.
When I had everything,
I mean everything-- money, jobs, friends-- you brushed me.
You gave me the rap for making it big, and now--
Not for making it big, Gene.
For not being big enough to handle it, because if you could make a solo instrument out of drums and, without a single lesson, set millions of people on fire with them, what couldn't you do
once you got your mind around to it?
Didn't they scream, "Go, Gene, go"?
And you went and took them with you like nobody'd ever done before, not on drums.
If you tried, you could.
What do you think I've been trying to do--
Not enough.
Otherwise--
Oh, since when do you know everything?
As if learning how to read music was the whole, almighty answer.
It'd be better than nothing and a lot better than hiding, because that's what you're doing, Gene.
Hiding.
From what?
What could be worse than this?
Or don't you even care anymore?
You don't leave me very much of myself to like.
I wasn't trying to.

[MUSIC STOPS]
Gene.
Hi, Eddie.
Aw, it's good to see you.
It's good to see you too, Ed.
Been a long time, huh?
Yeah, too long.
How have you been?
Fine, fine.
You know...
Well, what am I going to tell you?
What's to tell me?
It's good to see your ugly puss again.
So what are your plans?
Plans?
Oh, I just thought I'd drop down and say hello, you know, and just in case somebody was having a hard time reading these flyspecks.
You know, I...
I kind of like this change you got here, Eddie.
This D-flat chord against the B-flat...
What's the matter?
Didn't you know even kids could learn how to read music?
Especially if their coach is from the New York Philharmonic.
You want to see the scars?
You took lessons, huh?
Yeah, yeah.
Quite a few.
Hey, Gene!
Good to see you.
It's good to see you too, Tom.
How are you?
Available.
Do I hear an offer?
Look, Gene-o,
I'd love to use you in the tubs, but I'll tell you, I just--
No, let me tell you.
It's a new band, see?
And the pressure is still on, and the--
And you're all wet.
I'm a music man.
What I care is whether a man can make music good enough and you're more than good enough, but I have a drummer.
You must know Davey.
Oh, sure.
Well, they...
they don't come any better.
I'm sorry, Gene.
Oh, come on, don't be sorry.
Nice to see you again, Tom, and, uh, good luck, huh?
You too.
MAN:
Hey, Mr. Dorsey.
Can I see you a minute?
Excuse me a moment.
Ah, it's just as well.
Why?
What are you talking about?
Ah, I don't know.
They...
They probably wouldn't accept me out there.
I'm not sure I can make it, Ed.
I'll see you, Ed.
No, now, wait a minute.
Don't go away.
Stay here a minute, huh?
Hey, Tommy?
I've got an idea.
[SWING MUSIC PLAYING]
Mr. Krupa?
Mr. Krupa?
Good luck, Mr. Krupa, and don't worry about the crowd.
No matter what they do, you're--
MAN:
Places, Mr. Krupa.
Right away, please.
[APPLAUSE]
DORSEY:
And now, ladies and gentlemen, back after too long an absence,
Gene Krupa!
Let's give him a great big welcome.
Let's hear it.
[SCATTERED APPLAUSE]
MAN:
Hey, Krupa, got a reefer?
WOMAN:
Smoke one for me.
MAN:
Hey, jailbird!

Go, Gene, go!
Go, Gene, go!
[CHEERING]
There he goes again, and there they go after him.
[SONG ENDS]
[WILD CHEERING]
You always knew he'd make it again.
You also know this is the surest way to lose him?
He never was mine to lose.
I'll tell you something, Gene.
It's nice to see you back in the old groove again, Daddy.
Man, it was just like old times.
Just like old times.
Yeah, man.
Remember those parties?
Yeah, they were the wildest.
Used to go on for days.
I knew a guy who was never heard from again.
[LAUGHING]
Hey, hey, where are you going, man?
Ain't you coming to our party?
Ah, thanks, man.
I've been to that party.
See you, fellows.
Thanks a lot, huh?
Hey, Gene.
Hey, Gene, where are you going?
Oh, you know where I'm going.
Hey, uh...
Now, where do you think you're going?
Away.
Without me?
Some chance.
What's the matter?
Didn't you think I'd ever learn?
After a couple of days, when you two really get thirsty,
Don't look back to find me, look up above you.
The buzzards will tell you how near the end is.
Hmm!
Get down!
Get away from that window!
You are hurt?
I'm all right.
Did you see anyone?
Must've come from those roofs across the street.
I send for police?
Hey boy, by all means, you send for police.
Here, sir.
Thank you very much.
My name is morgan.
Sid morgan.
My name is paladin,
And I may be able to be of some further service to you.
Maybe we'd better have a little talk.
All right, sir.
So you see, mr.
Paladin,
Danbury and his combine want to buy my railroad interest at any cost.
And danbury is the kind of a man that gets whatever he wants no matter how.
Witness,
This is the third attempt on my life.
Three misses and three attempts.
That's not a very good average.
Perhaps they're trying to frighten you into selling.
That's what I thought at first.
The first two times, but now...
Mr. Paladin.
My fianc e and I are leaving for silver city in the morning.
I'll pay you whatever you think it's worth
To see that I get there alive.
Well, I think $1,000 should cover it.
Done.
All right.
It's all right.
There, now.
Here, it's harmless.
It's a horn toad.
It won't hurt you.
Here, take it.
There now.
Why don't you refresh yourself by the spring?
Excuse me.
He is kind of cute.
I think stacy likes you.
I'm not hard to get along with.
Stacy likes to play games.
Thinks it makes me jealous.
That's all it is, games.
At heart, stacy's a business woman.
That's why I trust her enough to marry.
Congratulations.
Let's get out of here.
What's your hurry?
How long has he been here?
Not long.
Never mind the horses.
Stacy.
Come on.
Rough and ready, straight ahead, go on into town.
Where are you going?
I'll see you there.
Something I can do for you?
Yes, you can give me some information.
Like who you are, where you're going and why.
That's a lot of information to give to a stranger.
My name is paladin.
You're still a stranger to me,
But I don't mind telling you.
I'm howard gorman.
Well, now I've heard of you.
Twelve men, isn't it?
Yeah.
Maybe I better start thinking about adding that lucky thirteenth.
Mr. Gorman, why are you following us?
Why'd anyone want to follow you?
I'll know the answer to that
When I have the answers to my other questions.
Gorman.
About that lucky 13.
There's a legend that when the world began, there were 13 gods.
Only 12 of them were aquatinted with one another.
So to learn the stranger's identity, they invited him to a banquet.
And, to their everlasting sorrow, he came.
The thirteenth god was death.
Our friend looks like
He might know how to handle that gun he's wearing.
He does.
I'm sure danbury hired him.
Otherwise, why would he have followed us?
Don't worry, mr.
Morgan, you're safe.
Do you know him?
I've never seen him before.
He probably works for the combine.
Paladin.
Stand up.
Morgan.
Get her out of here.
Mr. Gorman, you're making a mistake.
You gonna stand up?
No, I think I'd rather finish my dinner.
It's finished.
Very well, sir.
We'll have it your way.
Number 13, paladin.
Now what do you know about this?
I'm an agent for mr.
Danbury.
He's changed his mind about buying mr.
Morgan out.
I tried to stop gorman.
I told him he'd get his money anyway, but he wouldn't listen to me.
Whoever you are, mister, you did us all a great favor.
Gorman was a killer.
All of you saw it.
It was a fair fight.
That's right.
The dead man drew first.
You've been too modest about your talents, mr.
Paladin.
If we'd had any idea that you were this good-
Stacy, go to your room.
I have some business with mr.
Paladin.
What are you gonna do?
You gonna try to talk him out of his fee-
Shut up!
I can always throw you right back where I got you.
It's too bad, paladin.
You're quite a man.
It's too bad you can't use your head as well as you do your gun.
Your fee, mr.
Paladin.
You're a very generous man.
Not generous, rich.
It won't be necessary for you to go to silver city with us.
Gorman's dead.
The danger's over.
What about the shot in san francisco?
What about it?
If gorman fired it, he wouldn't have missed.
Unless he had some reason for missing.
It's done.
This finishes it.
Good night, mr.
Paladin.
Give me a whiskey.
Bartender.
Oft times the fruit of the vine will lend surcease to the pain of the mind.
Or the pain of a punched-in face.
You know, he's quite a man with his fists around women.
I'm leavin' him.
Just as soon as I can get some place so I can.
Then I'll start lookin' again.
I'd like to find somebody else rich enough to marry.
How's pickings in san francisco?
Well, I don't think you'll have any trouble.
It's never any trouble at first.
It's too bad that you're not rich.
I like you.
Let me get you something for that - no!
It's all right.
The things that he does, and he gets away with it.
Tellin' you that he'd never seen shawcross before.
That's pretty funny.
Oh?
He's his business partner.
He has been for years.
He still is.
What about gorman?
Hired gun.
Just like you.
Shawcross paid him to kill you.
It was a bet.
A bet?
That's insane.
I won't argue with you, but I knew about it.
I thought it would be exciting.
It was.
And two men shot it out.
And one of them was killed.
And for what?
For an evening's entertainment.
You can't stop them.
It's over.
They didn't do anything wrong.
They didn't break the law.
They've been doing things like this for years, and you can't do anything.
Stacy!
Get up to your room.
I was very interested in what she had to say.
You've got no complaint.
You're well paid.
For what?
For killing a man in a sideshow?
You get up to your room.
Mr. Morgan, you've got a gun.
Draw it!
No!
I've got no reason to draw on you, mr.
Paladin.
You've got an excuse now!
Draw the gun!
I'm not gonna draw on you, paladin,
Give you an excuse to kill me.
You're gonna have to shoot me in cold blood.
Commit a real murder.
Come on, stacy.
Stacy.
You don't have to go with him.
He'd find me again, sooner or later.
It's no use, paladin.
He'll go on and on.
People will be hurt and will die,
But nothing can stop him.
Miss neal come down yet?
Come down?
I guess she has.
All of them did.
Left in a buckboard two or three hours ago.
All of them?
Well, it was that lady, like I said.
Then mr.
Morgan and that mr.
Shawcross.
I see.
This will cover what I owe you.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Stacy.
Stacy.
Come here.
Here, stacy.
Come on now, take some more.
Come on.
Stacy, they're just going around this point.
Bring this horse on in slowly.
Hold it!
Right where you are, both of you!
Now don't be hasty, mr.
Paladin.
Just you give you me one slight excuse,
Either one of you.
Stacy!
Now, morgan, you hand her your billfold.
Give it to her.
Stacy, take my horse into rough and ready.
Use whatever's in that billfold and take a stage wherever you want to go.
Go on, it's a long hot trip.
Stacy.
Goodbye, and good luck.
Now move out.
Paladin, you're a smart man, if it's money you want-
Giddyup.
Paladin.
You two gentlemen have been untouched by any law for so long
That you've become dangerous fugitives from justice.
I wonder if you really are beyond any retribution.
What do you mean?
You're 30 miles due west of silver city.
It's about a three-day walk, and you'd better get started.
Walk?
I'll take your gun, mr.
Morgan.
Now yours, mr.
Shawcross.
You were willing to let a lone woman without any water
Try to walk 30 miles across the desert.
I've made myself a bet that two men carrying water could make it.
Now get down.
Why are you doing this?
Because it's necessary.
It s the same as murder.
I'm sure you are much better qualified to define murder than I am.
Now get down.
Get out of there!
And good day to you, too.
Paladin, wait!
What do you suppose he's up to?
I don't know.
Well, may as well get going.
He's following.
First chance we get, we'll figure some way to jump him.
Every time I look back, he's taking another drink.
I've got to have water.
Just one swallow.
All right.
Just one swallow.
Now I can wait.
You owe me one swallow.
You drank it all!
Gentlemen, you should've nursed your water better.
But you had to indulge yourselves.
Well, there's no sense in both of you dying.
Here.
Just water.
Not much, but some.
I'm owed one swallow.
One swallow's mine.
You'll get it.
I get a swallow.
All right, morgan.
Now carry shawcross back over here to the buckboard.
He's dead.
That's too bad.
We'll need the body anyway.
This time you're not beyond the law.
I'm taking you back to stand trial for murder.
You come near me and I'll kill you.

Are you sleeping?
I'm not.
You're lying.
You were breathing so calmly.
No.
What are you thinking about?
Nothing.
Don't lie to me.
You must be thinking about something.
So what were you thinking about?
I'm serious.
I was thinking about sensei.
You shouldn't be thinking about him.
If sensei died, would you...
Stop... don't say that.
You're young and handsome.
You'll find a good girl.
You'll graduate and get a good job.
And you'll become a big boss.
One day, someone will introduce you to a girl from a good family.
You'll start dating.
You'll see as much of each other as you want.
Not like we see each other now, once a week instead of cooking classes.
You'll go to cinemas and expensive restaurants.
And then you'll have a wedding.
Here comes the groom, Ikuo Kawashima...
He graduated with honors from the law faculty of University of Tokyo.
Will you invite me to your wedding?
I'll sit in the corner and look at your happy face.
I won't be jealous.
I just want to see your future wife.
She'll be charming and well-mannered.
But at the same time, lively and funny.
And she'll be very pretty.
Not like me, an old woman...
Why are you saying all these things?
Because I love you.
This love is unbearable.
And I'm torturing myself.
It's cruel.
But it's wonderful to be with you.
I immediately forget that I'm ten years older.
Hold me tight.
With you, I become younger.
I feel like a schoolgirl.
Ikuo-san, do you feel it?
I feel like my body is shrinking.
So fast.
It's shrinking faster and faster.
And finally...
You become a baby?
My love...
Don't leave.
I want us to always be together.
And never to part.
Let's go.
Goodbye.
Let's not see each other for some time.
I'll write you.
Bye.
Welcome home.
- How did it go?
- Nothing special.
Your husband is upstairs.
He asked me to wake him up at 8:30 tomorrow.
And told me to make him some coffee.
What were you learning to cook today?
What is it?
Put it in the fridge.
Alright.
Your cooking teacher was on TV today.
Careful with the pot.
I got delayed.
- Kikuko, is that you?
- Yes.
Welcome home.
I told Sayo to wake me up at 8.30.
There's something I need to do before the lecture.
Alright.
Good night.
Good night.
Brother, is that you?
- Welcome home.
- Hi.
- Are you hungry?
- No.
Good.
I wanted to make chop suey.
But it turned out bad.
So I threw it away and ordered sushi with tuna.
It was delicious.
By the way, Kanezawa's mother called.
Father will be here next week and will bring some money.
What's wrong?
Are you sick?
Want some salt water?
No?
It's not that bad then.
Are you drunk again?
You shouldn't drink so much.
One, two, three five, six.
Slow, slow, quick.
Slow, slow, quick.
One, two, three, four, five, six...
One, two, three, four...
One, two, three...
Sayo-san, you're disturbing my husband.
Stop it immediately.
- Yes.
- It's late.
Go to bed.
Good night.
Hello?
Yes, that's right.
Are you from the newspaper?
I see.
Hold on.
Hello?
Yes, it's Miyahara.
Yes... the incident in Hakkai?
Yes... my forecast on the Hakkai case?
No, it's not my area.
Since this is subject to special examination there's nothing I can help you with.
Besides, journalists working in newspapers treat these things too lightly.
Court trial is not a sports game.
Brother, when will you be home tonight?
Damn, I have a spot.
If you come before me, make dinner.
We should take turns.
Right?
What is it?
Are you unwell?
No.
Madam, I forgot about this.
What is it?
Your yesterday's class?
Do I have to add this too?
Damn, it's stuck.
Oh my god!
I'm sorry.
This girl how do you still tolerate her?
All maids are like this these days.
Really?
I saw it myself.
Did you?
Hold on.
There's a white hair...
Madam!
Madam, there was a murder in the grove in front of the Kumano shrine.
The guy from the laundry told me.
There's a lot of police and journalists.
It's terrible.
The driver was about 50.
His head has been smashed.
It's impossible to recognize his face anymore.
It happened again.
It's terrifying.
It's our punishment.
It's been more than 6 months.
When was it exactly?
Around mid-April.
I took cooking classes out of boredom.
Excuse me, are you professor Miyahara's wife?
My name's Kawashima.
We're visiting you on the 20th.
Yes, right.
Do you feel unwell?
It's hot and I felt dizzy.
But I'm better now.
- I'll accompany you.
- Don't bother.
It's no trouble at all.
Would you like to come in for a cup of coffee?
I'm sorry but I have to be going.
Well, thank you so much.
It's the 20th the day after tomorrow.
Are you coming?
Yes, of course.
I'll be looking forward to it.
Thank you again.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Goodbye.
It was a strange feeling, but I enjoyed it.
I immediately liked him.
On the 20th of every month my husband's students from the law faculty gathered at our house.
They didn't come for any particular purpose.
My husband had many friends in business.
So people came mostly to establish business relations or to find a job.
Of course, they talked about law.
My husband wanted everyone to express their opinion.
After all, we have to take into account the Article 81 of the Constitution.
The Socialists demand the government's resignation.
That will require re-elections.
There's also the option of going to the International Court in Washington.
- But that won't be easy.
- This is a very difficult question.
It's easy to talk when you're not in the government.
First of all, it's a matter of defense.
In the Evening Star...
No, in the Washington Daily...
But the Supreme Court didn't make a decision.
The main principle of the Constitution is human rights.
- Is that right, sensei?
- Yes.
Yes, the Constitution and the Convention are closely connected.
There are a few theories regarding this.
Class hierarchy theory has to do with the notion of dualism.
Triepel and Anzilotti recognize the supremacy of international law.
Kelsen and Radbruch agree with this.
Jellinek and Koellreutter put forward the theory of the supremacy of the Constitution.
In general, international community of politicians supports structural pluralism.
In English, they call it The Constitution of Japan.
Agreement is called "a treaty".
Synonyms of "treaty" are "charter" "arrangement", "convention", "declaration", "act".
Each of these words has many meanings.
Read Jellinek's "System der subjektiven öffentlichen Rechte"... and Koellreutter's "Grundriß der Allgemeinen Staatslehre"...
I avoided looking at him.
But to myself, I was counting how many times he looked at me.
There is an underlying connection.
For example, Paru in India Walsh in America, Street in Australia Leicester and Lonsdale in England Pratt in Chile...
Every time we met, he always accompanied me.
Every time I looked him in the eyes, he blushed.
That night it was like I felt light-headed from fresh leaves.
I wasn't thinking whether it was a joy or a crime.
It was as if my eyes opened.
Some warm tide at once filled my heart with joy.
Madam, there's a stray dog there...
It's terrible!
Its tongue is sticking out of its mouth.
Its chest and stomach are smashed.
Its guts are all over the road.
But it's still alive.
After the ratification of the pact by International Labour Organization a decision concerning the relations between employers and employees has to be taken.
At the same time, there's a number of difficulties, the work on solving which continues.
This morning, at around 5:40 in Seijo, near the Kumano shrine a robbery and murder was committed.
The victim has been identified.
It is a taxi driver from the Nissho company.
His name is Tokuhiro Kanayama.
The murderers threw away the body.
It was found in the bushes 20 meters from the car.
The victim had been hit on the head with a blunt object.
Death occurred around 8 hours ago.
Therefore, the murder was committed at 9:30 PM.
There are no houses in the proximity of the crime scene.
No witnesses have been found yet.
The suspect is supposed to be wearing geta.
The investigation is progressing slowly.
That is all for now.
Weather forecast is coming up next.
The weather across the country...
Hello?
Yes, that's right.
Hold on.
- Sir, it's for you.
- Who's calling?
It's me... sister, it's you?
Me too.
Haven't heard from you in a while.
No, I'll have left by then.
Yes, let's meet then.
Alright.
It was my sister Aoyama.
She'll come by around 3.
And your plans?
I have a lecture in the morning and a meeting after that.
I'll be home after it's over.
CLASS 31
Having lost shelter and due to constant harassment on the part of Umekichi he was forced to protect himself.
An axe is added to the evidence.
It has an oblong shape.
Holding it in his hand, he was trying to deflect Umekichi's blow.
And, being in the state of affect, he applied too much force.
He hit Umekichi on the head a few times with the blade of the axe.
The blow came from the left.
So the victim was hit in the right parietal region.
Extensive damage to the skull was found in the center of the parietal region.
In the parietal bone, there was a crack of 3-3.5 centimeters.
On top of that, one lacerated wound resulted in a bone shattered in 13 fragments.
There were 3 lacerated wounds in total, plus a scratch on the forehead.
The fracture of the parietal bone led to damage to the brain and bleeding.
20 million yen?
Yes, but it can come to around 25 million.
General manager told my husband that they can arrange it.
I think it's a good opportunity.
It will be a great present for father.
I think Yuichiro-san is also experiencing some problems.
It's not that we need money.
But maintaining a house in Kamakura is very expensive.
These are pointless expenses.
If I want to go there, my husband's company owns a hotel.
I can always stay there.
After all, money is more useful.
It can be invested.
If you had children, it would be different.
By the way, why don't you?
Maybe you should get examined?
Hello?
Yes.
- What?
- I'm talking about children.
I'll call the mistress of the house.
You could always go to the Keyo hospital.
You don't have any health issues?
No.
Madam, your husband will be back in about 5 hours.
He asked me to tell you.
Yes...
Yuichiro-san ran away, after all.
- I don't think so.
- Yes, he did.
He's always felt embarrassed by me.
By the way, how is it going?
As usual, once in 3 months?
It's because of Yuichiro-san.
You still sleep in separate bedrooms?
Poor girl.
You're still so young.
But I'm used to it by now.
Even so...
Once, when I was your age my husband went to Germany.
So I...
Now concerning the murder near the Kumano shrine.
We visited the family of the victim, Tokuhiro Kanayama in Kishi-cho, Sumida region.
Everything has changed in this house.
People are burning incense and bowing before his body.
Without the master of the house, it's empty and dreary here.
He is survived by his wife and three little children.
We inquired about how Kanayama-san lived.
Please accept our condolences.
Can you tell us how you got married?
We got married in autumn of 1943, three months after we met.
Where did you meet?
At the frontline?
In North China.
After the war, we ended up in Siberia.
When did you come back to Japan?
Shortly before I gave birth.
Around 1948.
Did he get this job after you returned?
No... there was no work at the time.
We had just had a baby.
It was tough.
Finally, he found a job at the Ichigaya military office.
Soldiers were returning from captivity, and the army was in decay.
He got a piece of bread for a day's work.
You can't fully achieve satiety, but it's enough to survive.
Finally, he got a job at this company.
He said, "This is the end to our suffering."
"Otherwise, we would have to commit suicide."
Until then, he'd often talked about it before going to bed...
He didn't hurt anyone.
What happened to him is unfair.
He survived the war, and now...
Hiroko-chan...
Hiroko-chan, how do you feel now that your dad's gone?
Lonely...
An ordinary family at once plunged into despair...
Why are you looking at me like that?
This new kimono smells nice.
You scared me.
If you're home, why didn't you turn the lights on?
It was mean of you.
My friends called a taxi for me.
It made me think about that driver.
He was all covered in blood.
It's unthinkable that something like that could happen.
Last year, a driver was also attacked.
The driver said since there are no witnesses, it will be difficult to catch the murderer.
If he doesn't get caught, he'll kill someone else.
So...
Yes... yes...
- Madam!
- What is it?
There's a student named Kawashima.
He wants to see you.
What do you want me to tell him?
I don't know what he wants...
- Alright, let him in.
- Yes.
At such an hour...
What's sensei going to think?
What is it?
What do you want?
Madam, I'm going to tell the police about what happened two days ago.
I saw the murderer's face very well.
If I tell the police about it they will be able to catch him.
They say, the driver had three children.
I can't take this anymore.
I see this man's face every time I close my eyes.
What are you talking about?
I'll be in trouble.
Why have you come here?
I won't be able to justify myself.
If sensei finds out it will be the same as death for me.
I won't tell them about you.
They'll find out anyway.
Why have you come here?
What if someone hears us?
At the police, everything will come out.
Besides, we saw a policeman on the bridge.
Absolutely not.
It's out of the question.
What am I to do, Madam?
I can't sleep at night.
Ikuo-san, forget everything you saw.
If the police and the papers don't find out about it we have nothing to worry about.
Please, don't go to the police.
How am I going to live with this, Madam?
I feel sorry for that man.
- Have you locked the door?
- Yes.
Then you can go to sleep.
Give me the key to the gate...
- I'll lock it myself.
- Well, if you...
Good night.
Pull yourself together, Ikuo-san.
You're just tired.
Alright?
I'll come see you tomorrow morning.
And we'll discuss everything.
Alright?
Do you hear me?
And now go home.
It's late.
We'll figure something out tomorrow.
Everything will be alright.
Don't go to the police tonight.
Let's wait till tomorrow.
One... two... three four... five...
- May I?
- Yes.
This student is suffering from unreciprocated love.
He wanted to talk to me about it.
How strange...
Good night.
Good night.
- May I?
- Yes.
You're still awake?
Yes.
I wanted to look at this picture...
- I'm...
- What?
I'm a little...
I see... that's fine...
It's not important.
Good night.
Good night.
I was going to go see sister Aoyama today.
Yes... concerning that thing, tell her I'm fine with it.
- Bye.
- Have a good day.
- Sayo-san, I need to go out.
- Yes.
What is it?
You're not hungry?
You haven't eaten anything for two or three days now.
It's not normal.
Are you feeling alright?
Maybe you should go see the doctor?
Do you have a fever?
A headache?
I think you have a fever.
- Let's take the temperature.
- I'm fine.
No, you're not.
Let's do it.
- Here.
- Leave me alone.
No way.
Do it.
Stop it!
Get off me!
Are you out of your mind?
Was that your sister I saw just now?
That girl...
she's your younger sister, right?
She's very lively.
She looks very much like you.
Come in.
It's nice here.
You keep everything in order.
And what happened here?
You had an argument?
An argument between siblings.
I'm jealous.
What a mess!
You shouldn't do it.
Everything is in its place.
How lovely!
Is this you?
Did your sister paint it?
It's very pretty.
Well?
Do you feel better today?
Try to forget about it as soon as possible.
It's not important.
Madam...
I'll go to the police anyway.
What for?
I've been thinking all night.
I have to go to the police.
Ikuo-san!
Ikuo-san, why don't you understand?
Do you want me to get in trouble?
I have a husband.
If he finds out my life will be over and his reputation will be ruined.
You're so afraid he might find out.
Isn't it reasonable?
Are you that stupid?
I'm a married woman!
I know that, Madam...
But you said you wanted to spend your whole life with me.
I remember you saying it that night.
Do you mean to say...
So what if everyone finds out?
Maybe I did say that...
But, Ikuo-san, please, get it out of your head.
I love you very much.
I really love you.
But for us to be together is impossible.
So it was all a lie?
What you said about us always being together, was that a lie?
It's so hard with you.
You're such a child.
What about what happened between us?
Was all that a lie too?
What if it was?
It was just a game for you, wasn't it?
Am I just a toy to you?
Why do you say that?
You're not a toy.
It's just that I...
I see.
Where are you going?
To the police.
I'll tell them everything.
Stop!
Please, don't!
Stop...
I beg you.
Don't go.
Everything will be alright.
One ticket.
SECRET LOVERS WITNESSED MURDER
UNIVERSITY STUDENT AND HIS LOVER...
Train to Shinjuku is arriving at platform 3.
Please, step away from the edge of the platform.
He just jumped.
- Look, there's a leg!
- He committed suicide?
Hey, girl...
I was right there and I saw everything.
It was you who pushed him!
Rock-a-bye baby, in the treetop
When the wind blows, the cradle will rock
When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall
And down will come baby, cradle and all
Rock-a-bye baby...
THE END
THE MAGLIARI
- Hi there, what would you like?
- Please... a...
- A würstel?
- Yes.
Hey, hey!
You forgot your würstel!
Such lovely pasta!
- Please, sit.
- Why here?
- The place is full, Sir, don't you see?
I'm paying and have the right to be served like everybody else.
- Sir, have you read the prices?
- Yeah, I've read them!
I've read them!
- Hey, you're not at the market!
You want me to show you the money?
It's a restaurant.
I'm paying so I'll sit where I want!
The tables are all empty!
- What's all this shouting?
- No idea.
- Get me Umberto.
Oh, I understand, it bothers you if I sit in the middle of everyone else.
- But I'm out of here!
I'm out of here!
- Kid.
What is it?
They're giving you trouble?
- Where are you going?
Come and sit with me.
Guys!
There's an Italian here...
- Oysters to table 15!
- Excellent!
- He's our guest.
- Your guest?
- No, our guest!
- This guy runs things with other peoples' pockets.
- Thanks but won't disturb you.
- I need to get to the station anyway, the train leaves early tomorrow morning.
- Hey, what are you saying?
!
Sit yourself down.
Pietruccio, take this gentleman's coat.
Hand me your bag.
- We're just kidding.
- Sit down.
- Your pocket, my pocket...
Drink, warm yourself up.
It's Chianti, Italian wine.
- We're all friends here.
- To good health!
- You're a northerner, eh?
- Yes, from Tuscany.
Ah, good!
Then we represent all of Italy!
The Tuscan, the Roman and the Neapolitan!
- Eh, we're never short of Neapolitans!
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Drink.
Maybe I went too far before.
When you've seen what I've seen...
Go to work abroad!
Yeah, and wait for 3 years for them to accept you and then...
After six months I couldn't even...
Ah, no!
Eh!
Your problems... "Zip!" We don't want to hear them.
And you don't need to say anything, it's written all over your face.
Right, now let's eat!
- Bring out the spaghetti!
- Let's eat.
- He's right.
- Yeah.
- If it's overcooked I won't eat it!
- Yeah, you'll drink it.
- Hey, what's this?
It needs to be cooked well, with a bit of cheese.
- Hey, sing "Napoli"!
Hey, another plate of spaghetti for the kid.
He's eating with us.
- Let's eat, eh?
- Bring me the cheese!
Ah, Don Raffaele!
'Scuse us, we invited this guy to sit with us.
He's in a strange country, you know, far from home...
Christ, he never smiles!
This is how it works, you know.
First they entice people over then, when the poor workers arrive, they ignore them!
So then what am I meant to do?
Go back to Italy?
With the one thing I did manage to obtain.
Here!
A kilo of documents and a passport!
Yeah, for us that's difficult.
Just to renew a passport you have to kill...
Come on!
Eat, eat!
Don't think about it, you still have your health.
Drink up!
- A drop for me, too.
- Hey.
- What?
- There's a shady-looking gentleman.
- Where?
- Walking slowly...
Good evening.
Could I please speak to the owner?
Hey!
He's going back to Italy and he's moaning!
Tomorrow he'll open the window of the train and see the Italian sun!
Going back to Italy and he's moaning!
Tomorrow he'll see the Italian sun!
- Going back to Italy and...
- What are you singing, disco?
!
I know that Ferdinando Magliulo frequents this place.
Ferdinando Magliulo?
I don't know him.
Are you sure?
Please think carefully.
Hey, forget about all those troubles!
You're bringing us all down...
- Hey!
What are you doing?
!
- Here, let me wipe that off.
- That's okay...
- It's nothing.
Look at me!
You've ruined a new pair of trousers.
- "The dog barks at he who is dressed badly."
- It's nothing...
- Do you know a certain Ferdinando Magliulo?
- No!
- Hey, this is wine from the carton.
It comes out easily.
- It's already gone.
- Just go to the bathroom and dry yourself off.
- Bathroom?
No, I'll just run home.
In five minutes I'll be there and back.
I can't stay wet now, can I?
I'll just run home and change.
I'll see you afterwards at the "Copacabana".
Wait for me there.
- Excuse me, a small formality...
This gentleman wishes to check your documents.
- Yes...
- Here you go!
What's this novelty?
Now you're asking to see documents?
- It's just a formality.
Did something happen?
Before you never asked, now you're asking... "Danke schön!"
- I must see the passports of all Italian clients.
- Yes, please...
- This gentleman wishes to verify your documents.
- Yes, of course.
It that okay? "Gut"?
I had my passport right here.
I only just took it out...
But... where did that Roman guy go?
I showed it to him.
- You're all witnesses.
- Witnesses?
What witnesses?
!
- What?
- Kid, which of us do you know?
- What do you mean, who do I know?
- Follow me.
- I... have... passport!
I want to find that Roman guy, where did he go?
!
Kid, nobody needs your passport.
Just go with this gentleman and sort everything out.
I have... my passport!
Tell him!
You all saw my passport, no?
!
- Follow me.
- Go on, go on.
Explain it to him.
- Sure, I'll explain it!
I had a passport and I want it back!
This doesn't end here!
I'm going to...
I'll come back and find you!
I want my passport back!
I don't like this rubbish, mister.
First you feed him and then...
Tell Totonno to sort himself out or not to set foot in here again.
Kid?
"Psst!" Hey, kid!
- Damn... thieving bastard!
- Quiet!
- You're going to shout like that right here in front of the consulate?
!
- I don't care!
- You're mad, you know?
!
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'll kill you!
Here, take it!
Here you go!
Damn!
Last night I came back to give it to you but couldn't find you anymore.
I was surprised, you know?
I thought: "Where has he gone, this guy?"
What, you don't believe I came looking for you?
I needed a passport because they took mine away when I was in Belgium.
It's a disgrace.
They keep it and laugh in your face.
But for you workers they'll give it back straight away.
- First I'll whack you in the face and then I'll report you!
- Calm down!
Calm... calm down!
What do you mean, report?
You don't even know my name!
You don't understand!
I found the passport on the floor and was bringing it to the consulate, okay?
!
- No, you stole it!
You already said that!
- Yeah?
Alright, go to the police!
- Yeah, I'm going?
- Go, go!
Go to the police, go to the consulate!
Who'll listen to you?
!
Ah, look at this poor kid, dying of hunger.
Came here but couldn't achieve anything, now he's going back to Italy more miserable than when he arrived and makes a huge deal about spending 3 hours in lock-up.
Here you go;
I'll pay you for those 3 hours!
Don't you see?
!
Here you go!
And now what are you doing?
What, are you crying?
Hey!
- Damn, you big... here, take it!
- I don't want your money.
- Ah, come on, take it!
We're friends, no?
Come on, get in.
Why are you crying, eh?
- Take it.
- I don't want it.
- You don't want it?
It's not the money...
I want to work.
I want to earn it for myself.
I've made so many sacrifices.
How is it possible that I can't find a job?
A single job, I say!
Yeah, but for you with these nice clothes...
This nice car...
What could you ever know about someone like me?
Why, you think I was born in this car?
If someone doesn't have work, we can invent it.
- What do you mean, "invent" it?
- We'll invent it.
Salesman.
Here, take one
Salesman... with this car?
Even as a salesman you can get a car like this.
- So, I can do it too!
- Why not?
If you want to...
You need to know how, though.
You can't just 'become' a salesman, this is an art!
I'm very willing.
Ha, willing is enough!
Hey, now I'll try to get you in.
If I introduce you, maybe they'll give you a job.
Damn it's cold out here!
I'm not promising anything, though.
It's up to Don Raffaele and whoever has the stuff to sell.
What would we sell if it weren't for them?
Here all the Italians are Neapolitan.
And it's freemasonry, you know?
There are Greeks, Spanish...
There's a Turk... who can ever understand him?
Me, I'm independent.
Either I work for me or I don't work at all, you know?
Isn't God Almighty funny, eh?
First he puts you in Rome, with that beautiful sunshine then, to make a living he throws you out here in Germany, with the polar ice caps!
- Totò!
- Yeah?
- Napoli-Roma, 3-nil!
- Who cares?
!
Let's go.
Ah, and how am I supposed to introduce you with that face?
In this profession you need to keep your eyes and ears open, to understand the language...
- But I don't even speak German
- Who cares?
!
You speak English, French, Turkish, Tuscan you know...
- Hello!
- Hey, Totò!
They're all good guys, all friends.
You'll see, you'll see!
- Why do you have to give it to me?
- Who wants to give it to you?
Wrap it up.
Wrap it, wrap it!
- Hey, you, new guy, tell me something.
You like this stuff?
- Yes.
- And could you make clothes from this stuff?
- I wish!
- Well done, give it a try.
- See how it's good stuff?
Now if you want it you'll have to give me 30 marks.
- What?
!
30 marks!
- Let's see it!
- Ah, look what we have here today!
- See how fine it is!
- Fine?
!
In my day it was difficult to make this stuff.
And now it's easy, give thanks to God Almighty!
And who asked you?
!
- Ah, Totò is right.
I'm sorry, I really am!
It's just that you hate progress.
- What progress?
!
- You sleep with your pipe in your mouth...
- And you sleep with the cigarette!
Now you're making trouble that I'll have to put right.
Ah, you always make it hard!
Let him work, what are you going to lose?
Anyway, Gennaro, this guy doesn't know how to do anything.
In 2 days he'll be going back to Italy, I'm telling you.
Yeah, and what do I tell Don Raffaele?
- Who knows this guy?
- What are you talking about?
Yeah, but if he were Neapolitan it would be alright, eh?
Come here!
Help me out, Gennaro.
Today I'll show him the ropes but you'll have to help him settle in.
You'll have to clean him up, look after him.
Come here!
I'll introduce you to Don Gennaro, come on.
He's a real youngster, eh?
At the moment he looks like a tramp with this big ol' coat but Gennaro just look at this guy, clean him up and he'll look better than anyone!
You're convinced?
He's convinced.
We're okay?
Okay, enough talking.
Get yourself a shave.
You're being difficult with me?
After all I've done for you?
- You really had to bring this to me?
- Don't worry kid, don't be afraid.
Don Gennaro is like a pitbull sometimes, but he has the heart of a Neapolitan.
Get him a shave, Gennaro.
- Where are we going?
- You like it?
It's beautiful, eh?
- Don't we need to get to work?
- Why, we're not working?
- Here?
- Listen to the little birds, listen!
- Yeah, the little birds...
Quiet a moment.
There they are, let's go.
What do you want to do?
This is a cemetery.
"Herr Professor Gustav Stüdendorf."
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Professor Stüdendorf.
- Sorry?
- Professor Gustav Stüdendorf.
- One moment.
- Excuse me!
- I've an appointment with Herr Professor Gustav Stüdendorf.
- Please, one moment.
- Thank you.
She's gone to...
What are you doing, you're outside?
Come in, let's go.
Madam!
- Hey, what do I have to do?
- What do I know?
Quiet, here he comes.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Herr Professor Gustav Stüdendorf?
Herr Professor Gustav Stüdendorf?
!
- And who are you?
I'm the representative of an important Italian textile firm - excuse me, I don't speak good German - that produces wool, silk and cotton.
- Please.
- Thank you.
- Please!
- Thank you!
My firm has put me in charge of delivering 3 cuts of material that Herr Professor Gustav Stüdendorf has ordered.
Bring me the bag.
We'll show the various cuts of material to this kind gentleman.
Herr Professor Gustav Stüdendorf in his good taste has ordered 3 cuts of material.
First, a black "Smoke of London"; show him...
"Smoke of London" is black, what kind of white...
The "Smoke of London" is for ceremonies and such.
That's it, we want to get the right one for you.
Second, a youthful colour to be used on afternoon occasions...
And a third, in "Prince of Wales" to be used on travels.
Encase the professor ever decides to take a journey anywhere.
Very durable and the fabric used is ideal.
- One moment.
- Thank you.
- What a nice guy, he's already hooked.
I know it...
- Gertrud!
Here's another hook!
Good morning, kind lady.
Good morning!
This gentleman has brought material that Gustav had ordered...
Yes, kind lady.
Please excuse me if I don't speak perfect German.
I represent an Italian textile firm that makes wool, silk and cotton.
The good professor ordered this "Prince of Wales" which is the perfect representation of Italy there's the blue of the sky, then the mandolins and macaroni...
What happened?
Gertrud, I'm sorry that your pain is still so real...
Our good professor Gustav is no longer with us... he's dead!
- No!
- Yes.
Did you hear?
Herr Professor Gustav Stüdendorf, he's dead!
Herr Professor Gustav Stüdendorf, in all his politeness, in all his wonderful gaiety.
Kind lady, I offer my condolences, the mortality of death...
Keep crying...
And now what do we do?
He factory has already marked these as sold, I've already bought the material.
The professor has already paid twenty marks up front.
And anyway, a lovely cut of wool is never a personal item.
No, no, no.
I inherited four shirts from my poor father!
And we must always remember that the memory of the dead is always present in the clothes they leave behind.
Here, if you keep these close to you you'll always feel that he, too, is close.
The memory of the great Herr professor Gustav Stüdendorf.
That'll be 410 Marks, 20 you've already paid up front so that comes to 390.
Three, nine, zero!
To whom should I make out the invoice?
The full title, please.
Sir, Lady, please?
Gertrud, you see that the material is already here, perhaps we ought to...
Thank you!
It's my right to take care of the wishes of my late husband.
- I'll go and fetch the money
- Thank you, kind lady, thank you.
She'll be very happy with this product Going to get the "grain", she is.
Eh, I'll never be good enough to do what you do.
You seemed like a different person.
If to sell things every day you must be always able to improvise, then I'll never manage it.
I don't have what it takes.
- So now you don't want to work?
!
- If you can call it work!
So tell me something.
In the factory where you worked, how many people were working there?
What, are you mad?
You want to sell to them?
They don't even have enough money for cigarettes!
- So what?
It's one piece of material per person.
Waiter!
Bill please!
- 2 marks and 20.
So over there is it just factories and workers?
Are there not, I don't know, families, houses, shops...?
- There's a restaurant and also a beautiful lady.
- Yeah?
So what are we waiting for, let's go!
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- What's this?
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?
- I told you.
- It seems like a fairytale village.
- So where is this restaurant with your beautiful lady?
- There it is.
- So go.
- On my own?
What can I do?
- Go and say hello, it's so long since you last saw her.
Say to her: "Wie gez Frau, Gutte Morgen".
Do you know how to say "Gutte Morgen"?
- Uhuh.
So go and say "Gutte Morgen" to her.
Go on!
Go on!
I'm coming as well.
Oh!
What are you doing, spying?
Do you have a "pennetta"?
Where are you from, the alps?
Go away, now.
Go home!
The girl, miss.
The girl...
Damn, how am I meant to make her understand me?
I would like to help, but I do not understand.
I... met... a waitress here.
You know?
A beautiful lady!
- I do not understand.
- No?
- Here you are, I finally found you... oh God!
- Oh my God!
- What's that?
!
Who's there?
- Oh God!
What's wrong with me?
It's my spinal column!
"Vertebralisc colonisc"!
Goodness, my backbone!
Be careful, have mercy!
I will be disabled for the rest of my life.
It hurts so much, how unlucky could I possibly be!
?
I was in such good shape!
God damn you!
Slowly, put him down here.
"Lndorsalisc spinosa".
"Lncolonisc verterbralisc"!
Oh, "Mein Frau", if only you knew how bad it felt.
Such terrible pain!
I have been abandoned in a strange land.
Please help me, you who are so merciful!
- You don't have a miracle remedy?
- No.
- An ointment?
- Yes!
- Yes, you have an ointment!
Fetch it!
Help me!
- Where does it hurt?
- "Hilfe, hilfe, mein Frau".
- Totò, answer me!
- "Hilfe, hilfe"!
- Has she gone?
- So...
- So what?
What do you want, are you mad?
- Come on, roll it out.
- So you haven't hurt yourself?
- Hurt?
What, do you want me to hurt you?
!
Oh my God, such terrible pain!
Quickly!
Get those rugs on the ground, we need to leave her the whole pack.
Oh, God!
It hurts!
When she comes down we really need her to see all the rugs.
Quiet!
Here she is.
Oh God!
Damn it, I've really hurt myself this time.
"Hilfe, hilfe, mein Frau"!
I can't feel my "indorsalisc spinosa" any more.
It will encumber me for the rest of my life.
Oh God, I've messed up.
I'm lying in a different position.
Oh, that's much better.
Get rid of that sickness!
It's okay, she hasn't noticed anything.
- "Mein liebe Frau", help me! "Hilfe, mein Frau".
- Just a moment.
This man came to find the nice lady and I've gone and hurt myself.
It's all his fault.
If he didn't need to come, none of this would have happened.
- Sorry?
- My friend here knows a girl who works here.
- Ah, what a nice young man!
- Thank you. "Danke."
- Oh, my goodness!
"Grazie?" What are you doing, go and sort out the rugs, you're a real idiot.
- Oh God! "Oh, mein Gott"!
- That's it, you're doing well.
- "Mein Gott", such pain!
- You will see, soon it will be better.
- You can't imagine ... how much I'm suffering!
Should I be worried about this pain?
Will I be able to get married, to have kids?
Such misfortune!
Hey, tell her that I'm a merchant.
Tell her I've got lots of problems.
Such misfortune I have!
"Frissioné", please rub it!
Save this young man.
Save me and I will give you anything!
Tell her that she should take a look at the rugs, I would ask you to show her but I don't trust you.
Would you like to see some nice rugs?
"In bukara", "in persiano"?
- Of course.
- Ah!
She said she would.
Thank you...
She said that she would take a look.
My God, such heavy hands!
Slowly...
"In delicatessen frizione".
Slowly...
lightly...
- Does it hurt here, too?
- Like that, lightly.
Oh, stay here, don't leave me.
How beautiful you are, how soft.
Who are you, the fairy from Pinocchio?
You have the wonderful blue eyes, blonde hair.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, it's a miracle! "Miraculo"!
"Ich spazire", I'm walking!
The pain is gone.
It must have been the ointment!
- Yes, the ointment!
It's wonderful!
- I'm jumping for joy!
I'm dancing the Strauss waltz!
Look!
I'm doing push-ups!
"Eins, zwei, drei, vier..."
- Oh, such beautiful rugs!
- "Eins, zwei, drei, vier..."
Ah!
Now you noticed, you ugly oaf!
These are my rugs!
With rugs nobody will ever slip over again!
"Nicht Kaput!".
Haha!
And what does a rug cost, but 150 marks?
- 150 marks!
- So little?
- Yes!
150 marks!
My head is worth more than 150 marks.
This way my head will not go "kaput".
What are you doing?
Put a rug in front of the door.
You're standing there like a statue!
We will demonstrate just how great our rug would look in front of your door.
What are you doing, walking over it?
That isn't your rug!
Get out of here.
He's leaving!
Going to say hello to his friends in the factory.
My friend is going away!
- Say goodbye. - "Aufwiedersehen".
- "Aufwiedersehen".
- Get out of here.
Wonderful!
How many things can you do with a nice rug?
Everything!
A rug warms the ambience of a room, you can invite your clients it's soft, it's fluffy, and you can even sit on it.
The Turks use them for everything.
They eat, they drink, they sleep, "Slafen".
"Gut Slafen!".
Feel how soft it is.
Feel how marvellous they are...
Will you buy them?
- "Kapi tapisc"?
- Oh, yes!
- Yes, how many?
"Eins, zwei, drei, vier..." all of them?
- All of them!
- All of them?
!
Hahaha!
Mario?
Give me a smoke.
- So?
It went well then?
You're all set?
- I hope so!
I only started this morning.
You know, it's our fault as well.
We need to move, to be given things to do.
There are lots of jobs in the world, you know.
Not just the pickaxe.
Did you know that salesman earn, in one day the same that we earn in a month!
And they all have their own car!
- Hey, what can I say?
They are educated people.
- No, they hired me!
Are you sure that they don't work too much?
Because if you're earning that much, in a hurry...
- They what they're doing!
- Then they're lucky!
- They don't give in like us, like sheep.
- Yeah...
That will be my friend.
See, that's my friend.
Look at the car he has.
- Now I have to go, I can't make my friend wait.
Bye!
- Bye!
Bye, Mario!
Bye, Lucchese.
Are you still making statues?
One day I'll sell them for you!
- Don't you forget us!
- I'll be back soon.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Hey, Pugliese!
Sing, if that relieves your heavy heart!
Sing
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Thank God one of us has been lucky.
- Yeah...
Take it, this is the what you deserve, your cut, because you took me there.
What's right is right.
- Thank you!
- Don't thank me, count!
- Oh!
But this is 50 marks!
- Yeah "Funfzig" marks, you would usually earn that much in a week!
Damn...
Oh!
Christ!
Do you see what that damn woman...
- You see?
The fairy from Pinocchio.
- But, what?
- What?
!
Be quiet!
They must have something on us.
- Who?
!
- Who?
!
You don't see them?
!
God damn it!
Damn pigs!
Just for one day it could go well!
Here they are, they've already caught up.
There's nothing we can do.
We have to stop.
Come on.
Another shock like that...
So it's what I thought.
What you do is scam people!
- Well?
- Well, I've never been in trouble with the police.
Well, I have.
I was looking for work.
If I wanted to be a con artist, I would have stayed at home.
And who are you?
What are you saying?
What do you know about me or why I'm here?
You live like beasts just to be judged by others.
But yeah, you have to preach honesty because... you work in a factory.
Just as long as there is a factory, everything is fine but if one day that factory is missing, will you know how to survive?
I might be a con-artist but I know how to survive!
Hey, I'm 35 years old and I want to live well!
I realised that late on, but at least I realised it!
I'd like to see someone like you speak like this when you have a nice shirt on your back or when you're eating well every day or when you're in the company of a beautiful woman, have you ever seen a beautiful woman close up?
!
- Hey, wake up!
Totonno says we have to go.
- But, wait...
- Wait for what?
For you?
!
Come on, what are you thinking, eh?
Come on. "Bitte", excuse me.
"Fräulein", get up.
Eh, you're sitting down again?
I asked you to get up!
Well, you're really kind gentlemen!
"Money"?
Go see the Americans, it's those who have the "Money"!
What do you want?
You don't want me to dance or to buy me a drink...
You just drank a cup of champagne!
Get out of here!
Stop wasting my time!
Enough!
I told you to go away!
If you don't get out of here I'll call the owner!
- You're sending her away?
- No, I'm marrying her!
She is a professional!
Come on, let's go.
- "Buonasera"!
- Were you worried about us?
- Right, "Bitte"!
What are you drinking?
- The usual "drinken", "Fräulein".
- A bottle of whisky.
- Get me a cigarette.
- A "lit", right away.
- Okay, gentlemen!
Good night!
- Every night!
- It's his age!
- What are you doing, leaving?
You're leaving me on my own?
- Yeah, what do you want?
Find something to do, choose a girl!
Marlene, find him a girl!
- A girl for my friend, here.
You guys take care of it.
- Of course!
- Hey, Ridi!
- Mario, come here and sit down.
Put your feet up!
Oh, excuse me!
We haven't even introduced you.
These are our girlfriends.
Marlene, Ursula, Annalise...
Mario is a friend of ours.
He's a handsome boy, eh?
Cute?
You're right!
What am I thinking?
I'll sort it out.
Hey, Frida!
Come here!
- What are you doing?
Where are you sending me?
!
- No, it's her that I'm bringing to you!
- Tell me something, they still haven't paid the bail money to get Salvatore out?
- No.
- Frida, what are you up to?
- Me?
Nothing.
- Are you on your own?
- Yes.
- Here, sit with us!
- Thank you.
Frida, why don't you get to know our friend here?
- And Salvatore?
- Just go with him for one night!
- Who cares about him anyway?
!
- Mario, do you like her?
Frida, do you like Mario?
See?
They like each other!
- You're found your calling, a pimp!
- You can talk, short ass!
What?
!
I'm 1 meter and 55 tall!
Who do you think you are?
!
Ha!
I don't know how you got into the club, you're so short!
- Look who's talking!
- Why, you think you're taller than me?
- Let's measure!
Ah, Tango!
Fräulein, come here.
- Do you want to dance?
- Yes.
- "Tanzen"?
- I don't know how to dance the tango.
- It's easy, I'll lead you along.
- "Wie heist du"?
- Eh?
- "Wie heist du"?
- What your name?
I Frida.
- Ah, my name?
- Yes.
- Mario Balducci.
- Ah, "Balduccio".
- No, Balducci.
- Yes "Balduccio".
Good morning!
- Who's that?
- He's some kid, a new one.
- In Naples it's pouring.
- Why, is it sunny here?
- There should be three.
- Don Gennaro, check it over.
The "Scassate"!
No, we're just fixing it!
- Has Totonno been in?
- I don't know, have you guys seen Totò?
- No.
- Could you tell me where he lives?
Last night we went out together then lost each other.
We need to go to work.
- Totonno has left.
- What, what do you mean "left"?
- He will have gone to run the usual route...
- No, he left.
I don't think he'll be back any time soon, he was leaving with all his suitcases.
- Ah, he always does this.
Seven days here, seven days there.
- With his suitcases?
I'm sure he managed to cram it all in!
I'm just saying what I saw, he left.
When he comes back, you'll see.
And if he doesn't come back, it could be that he wanted to make it on his own!
To the health of Herr Mayer and the lovely lady...
And if you'll allow me, my own.
And to all of you.
Once we have transferred to Hamburg, you'll see.
You're now part of the commercial organization of Herr Mayer the most important in all of "Deutschland".
The only thing is that this chance I'm giving you will need to be earned.
You will have fortune and good health, the goods in advance for 10% less than what you pay Don Raffaele and you will be staying in Hamburg, a lovely city... naked woman...
Though use them sparingly because I'm responsible for the whole thing!
I've been made guarantor for you by Mr. Mayer.
Raise your glasses gentlemen, and laugh!
And I don't want to have to worry about the right to sell, is that clear?
Mr. Mayer says that they all need to be in order with their rights to sell.
- Yes.
- Of course, that's the most important thing.
- Look who's talking, he who never has his on him!
I don't understand them.
Are you sure that they're all Italians?
No, Miss, they're not Italians, they're Neapolitans.
They speak a different language.
- Just think, it's 10 years that I've had to listen to them and I don't understand one bit!
- Yeah, when it's convenient.
- Yes.
Ah, here is our Rodolfo Valentino.
He's a good dancer, no?
Mr. Mayer needs good salesmen and the lady needs good dancers.
- Hermann?
- Get out of here.
- First you pull me over here, then you don't need me.
- Mr. Mayer is very much in love with his wife.
- Yeah, of course!
You would be, too... with those thighs.
Leave her alone, Peter Lorre, I'll show you what life is.
- Is she really his wife?
- Yeah, when it suits her.
There's nobody here?
What happened?
- Don Raffaele is breaking the china.
- What?
- Shh, listen to her.
When she went to Brooklyn she made even the best gangsters cry.
- Gilda Mignonette, do you know her?
- No.
- Ah, what do you know?
- Are you not going to tell me what happened?
- Totonno wants to compete against Don Raffaele.
He's delivered the best Neapolitan salesmen to a German Boss.
- Totonno is back?
Where is he?
- They're all at the Copacabana.
Kitty... at least you and I are here together!
You all knew?
And what did you do?
Everyone knew everything.
Everybody knew what Totonno was up to, but nobody did a thing.
He worked without being disturbed because there's always Don Raffaele to deal with it!
Don Raffaele dresses you, Don Raffaele pays your bail money, to get you out of jail when you've been messing around.
I should send all your broke asses back to Naples!
Do you remember when I put the first cut of material in your hands?
For the devotion that I have for that beautiful "Mother of Pompeii" this time I'll get Totonno back, I won't just try to cover it up.
- Or I'll die trying, God help me!
- Don Raffaele!
So how does this woman understand Italian so well?
She fought in the Italian Campaign with Kesselring.
So did you do anything with her in Hamburg?
- And why would I tell you?
- Why not?
- Because you're ugly.
- Ah, come on!
Vincenzo, come here a minute.
- Are you sure that we'll be better off with Totonno?
- Well first we need to decide...
- My wife is coming here, though.
- You need to leave her in Naples, like I did with mine.
- Yeah, but I love my wife.
- Are you saying I don't love mine?
So you want be the adventurer with your wife following along?
What do you mean, "adventurer"?
- So, what did the others decide?
- They would do it, but they're afraid to lose their jobs with Don Raffaele.
- They want to know your conditions and then afterwards...
- Afterwards?
When, afterwards?
I'm offering the better deal, they're either in or not.
The conditions are those I've made for you.
- And what does that guy want?
- What do I know?
- Nobody knows anything, eh?
Yes, yes.
You know nothing, too.
- An American cigarette, please?
- No, thanks, I smoke these.
- Paula, when are the men getting to Hamburg?
- My husband says...
- Yeah, yeah, I understand.
- Come with me.
- I can't.
- It's better to avoid them coming here.
- My wife would like some ivory.
- One moment, one moment, please.
He doesn't need to understand German.
Totonno, we had better clear this up now.
- I don't need to explain myself to anyone.
- It'll take a quarter of an hour come with me, speak to who you need to speak to, and put everything right.
Then come back here to your friends.
What do you think, I'm married to Don Raffaele?
He can do what he wants to do, I'll do the same.
I didn't force anyone, they all came here of their own accord.
Federico, I'm in a rush, I can't discuss this all night.
I'm going back in.
Bye!
- You will not offend Don Raffaele in this way!
- What do you want?
!
- Totò!
Let's get out of here!
The car!
We've met each other before.
Ah, I remember you.
Sorry?
- What are you doing?
Spying on me from all the doors in Hannover?
- Me?
Always without shoes...
without a jacket.
What did he do?
Let me see.
Look, look!
- Who was that?
- I don't know.
Yes, it's true.
I've seen you before.
A morning, in a hotel.
Ah!
It's not nice to forget that you've seen a woman.
But it is good to forget where you saw her
- Understand?
- No.
- We will move from here, but we want to be sure.
- You need to give us security.
Eh, I don't care about their threats.
If you want to work, you come.
The rest is none of my problem, okay?
He always has to shout!
They're mad... always want to talk...
Ah... you're better?
What were you doing in the middle of the street?
I thought you had gone home.
- No, I want to sell.
- To sell?
- Us two are old friends.
- Oh, really?
We're friends, too.
He's a good boy.
I'll with Mr. Mayer in one moment, Miss.
- Is he coming to Hamburg, too?
- Perhaps.
So, looks like I'm taking you with me to Hamburg.
Are you happy?
I need someone I can trust, a friend like you.
Here.
Damn, look what they did to you!
Looks like you were born in that shirt!
See, if I make a fortune then so do you.
But we won't send you to sell, because that's not for you.
You can do better, you know.
For example... the assistant to the wife of the Boss.
What are you doing?
Are you looking at me?
But you need to be careful around her, you know?
Because otherwise you'll be in trouble.
She's the Boss's wife.
Here, smoke a cigarette.
- Where do you know her from?
- I don't know, I saw her one day...
- Ciccì!
- Hey, Arma'!
- Armando is here!
- What happened to you?
- What a trip!
It was snowing, my wife was vomiting, the boy needed to pee.
- What a city!
This is like New York!
- Ah, you've seen nothing yet!
- Here things are made of gold!
- Where are they?
- Armando's here!
- Hey, how are you?
- How's it going?
- Armando!
- How are you?
- You're beautiful!
- I thought you'd never get here.
- Of course I'm here!
- He got lost in the middle of the snow.
- Did you not follow the route?
- What route?
This guy doesn't know how to drive!
- So how are we going to sell all this stuff?
- We need to sell it!
- Armando!
- Totò, hi!
- What happened to you?
- Ah, you've no idea!
Ah, I knew it.
He got jumped by Cossacks!
- Totò, I've been travelling for three days.
And you know, it's all German restaurants!
"Würstel and Cartoffole, Cartoffole and Würstel!"
Instead, here it's organized by Totonno:
Spaghetti and clams!
- Tell him.
- It's true!
You know what they have here?
To eat with combined the...
Don't make a story out of it, wrap it up.
Tell him what he needs to do, come on!
Hold on!
I left my wife outside!
Where are we going to sleep?
We've organised you a Palace Suite but I should show you the way, otherwise we'll lose you in the rubble.
- Armando!
- What do you want?
- What do you want?
- Come here!
- I'm coming!
Let's go.
- Yes.
- Arma'!
They popped the car tyres!
- What are you saying?
The tyres popped, just like that?
!
I was in the car, and some guy on a motorbike went past and I heard it pop.
What kind of nonsense are you talking?
Let's have a look.
It looks like it was done with a knife.
Who could it have been?
Who do you think?
Some kid.
- And why didn't you call for me?
- I don't know, I was in the car watching the boy.
You came from Naples and brought the street urchins with you.
- Totò, come and see how much fun the German street urchins are.
- What?
It wasn't a street urchin, just a man on a motorcycle.
- Yeah, a man having fun with my tyres.
- What happened?
- They cut my tyres.
- Help me out here, what happened?
They cut his tyres!
- Everything okay?
- "Alles gut".
- "Gut Morgen".
They're having fun with tyres.
- Sorry?
- They cut a car tyre.
- why don't you put the car inside.
- I don't know, it's them that...
- Is my husband here?
What's she up to?
Did she come to check up on us?
- Ah, okay, he's out.
Will he be back today?
- I don't know.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
She's right, you know.
There's the garage, but you leave the car here!
You'll never understand each other like that.
You should all speak at the same time, not individually!
She didn't know that her husband wasn't in Hamburg.
Go and tell her, eh!
Take my shoes to the shop...
Tomorrow morning.
Goodbye.
- And who will give him money?
- I think that he'll need to pay.
What, are you still speaking about tyres?
Don't chat, we have visitors.
Excuse them, Miss.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Yeah, I'll show you a good evening.
- Shut it!
She understands Italian, you know!
- Yeah, it's better if she understands.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- I don't like this paper, you know.
- Yeah, you're right.
When you try to tie it, it always rips.
- Ah you want to make a mess about paper, now?
- Just wrap the packages.
- For you we do nothing but packages!
So?
Do you like Hamburg?
Shall we go for a drink?
When you don't have money, you come crying to me.
Go on, go!
What are you waiting for?
Yeah, go!
- It's different from Naples, don't you think?
- I don't know, I've never been there.
So you're not like the others.
- You're not Neapolitan?
- No, I'm from Grosseto.
- Grosseto?
- Where's that?
- In Tuscany.
- Ah, I know Tuscany.
I love Florence.
- In Italy they make you pay a fine.
- What is a fine?
You pay, "verboten"... for the kisses.
- You pay for kisses?
- For kissing in public?
- Ah!
Kisses in public!
It's not easy, this kind of life.
- Good evening.
- But I'm not complaining.
Two beers, please.
Come on, sit down.
Do you like it here?
I grew up in the middle of these people.
- In the middle of these people?
- Yes.
I was born here, in this quarter, the poorest quarter in Hamburg.
Think how strange it is, that you came to Germany to find fortune and I went to work in Italy to eat and to be less cold.
- I didn't have this.
- In Italy?
Where?
- Sad times...
Ah, a Rotamint!
I love them.
Oh, I don't have any change!
Can you change this, please.
Excuse me, excuse me!
Hey kid, stay a while and talk with me.
You're so young!
Come on, stay with me for a while.
- Yes.
- The meat may be old but the desire is still young.
- You don't understand?
- No!
What's she saying, I don't understand her.
- You're right!
- Leave him in peace.
Yeah, yeah, It's true.
I'm old!
But the only difference between me and this lady here is age!
Come and drink a while with us!
What do they want?
What did that woman say?
She said that if you're a whore, then so am I and that the only difference between her and me is a difference in age.
You know what I remember?
The War in Grosseto.
What were you doing in that hotel in Hannover?
The same thing we're doing here.
Today we work, but we need to make them pay for those tires.
- Yeah!
Alright, we get it.
- We all know it, but it won't always be like this.
- You're still here?
- Casanova has arrived, fresh from his escapade.
- Come here.
- Congratulations.
- What are you, the office joker?
How did it go?
Did it go well?
Did you show her what Italians know how to do?
- What Italians?
What are you talking about?
- Hey, I want to know everything.
- What do you want to know?
What do I need to tell you?
- What, are you trying to be crafty with me?
- Totò, are we going?
Yes or no?
- Yeah, I'm coming.
I can't talk now.
You stay here, but you need to tell me everything.
- Well, are you done?
- Yeah, we're done, we're done.
- What's going on with these tyres?
- They're putting them right.
First it was Ciccì, now it's Pasquale, so they must have some problem with us!
God damn it!
No, you knew it, because it was you who dealt with that German guy.
You were here to be the boss and we were out in the open.
Tyres slashed, a car into a pole, and who knows what will happen next!
What do you want?
This trade has its problems.
You put us in this situation, and you need to get us out of it.
You told us: "Come to Hamburg and work for me, I'm offering you better conditions".
I work, so the rest is your problem.
If you don't know what to do, why not call Don Raffaele he would know what to do.
Break it up, break it up!
- What a mess, for the work of a few Polish gypsies
- That's what I was just saying.
- Polish?
- Yes.
- And who are these Polish?
- Mr. Mayer already told you.
Here, before, there was a man called Stefanowski, a Pole.
It was him who dealt with the sellers, the Polish, Spanish, Hungarians...
One moment, please.
- Ah, so you knew it!
- You're trying to be clever.
- But you didn't tell us anything.
And what should I be telling you, that there were others before us selling stuff?
What a surprise!
Why would someone want to put their friends in such a mess?
At least give us some idea of what's going on.
That's what you promised us: better conditions than with Don Raffaele. "Quiet and well-being".
And we've been quiet!
Waiting for this mess with the tyres to pass.
But now things are getting worse.
- You could speak to Mr. Mayer.
- Of course I'm going to.
- But first go to that... what was he called, that Pole?
- Stefanowski.
He has a bar.
- Never!
- Why not?
- No!
What do you want to do, ask these guys to let us work?
No, you tell him that he needs to leave us alone.
Show them that we're not scared of anyone.
Mr. Mayer wanted to inform you that he will be back tomorrow morning instead of tonight.
- You had an appointment with Mr. Mayer?
- Me?
No.
- Totò, so we're agreed?
- On what?
- On Stefanowski.
- Yeah.
- Are we all going?
- Yeah.
- I want to meet whoever put me into that pole!
Hey Totò, did you hear that?
He said that the local Spaniards and Poles are over there.
- So it's divided by nations?
- Yeah, a nation for every street.
- We'll see.
Who knows what we're going to see!
- Nothing here, either.
- I knew it.
- A show with nude women.
- Let's stay here then, and search afterwards
- Listen to him!
- I want to get it while I still can!
- Come on, let's go.
- What does he want?
Come on!
Nothing here, either.
Just drunks and whores.
- So let's go, okay?
- Where?
- Further down.
- There's an Italian café.
Let's go and get a coffee!
You want a coffee, now?
Ah, yes, if you Neapolitans don't get your coffee, Vesuvius weeps!
- Is coffee better in Rome, then?
- No, it's not that it's better... ah, you wouldn't understand.
- Hey, have you seen my passport?
I've been everywhere!
China, Japan...
- But not Rome.
- In Rome, they don't stamp your passport...
- In Rome, they would take your passport away!
Yeah, hilarious!
Hey, Totonno!
What are you doing?
We should speak to this guy.
- But I was dancing...
- Cut it out!
- Are you Italian?
- Yes, I'm Italian.
- Have you been living here long?
- For 50 years.
- Wow!
So you must know everyone around here!
- I know enough.
- Do you know where the gypsies hang out?
- Gypsies?
- Yeah.
How should I know if someone's a gypsy?
They are gypsies that work with a certain Stefanowski, they're Polish.
Polish?
Yeah, on the same street that the Polish café is on.
- Yeah?
- Further down.
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.
- Did you put sugar in?
- Next, please!
- "Bitte", Amiro Stefanowski.
- He's not here.
- Not here.
- Will he back?
Maybe, maybe not.
- What shall we do?
- Let's wait to see if he comes in tonight.
- When he arrives, tell him we're here, okay?
- Yes.
Okay, let's wait for him.
Let's sit down.
Waiter!
Bring us beers... one, two, three, four, five beers.
Eight beers!
Waiter!
- Hey, Rodolfo Valentì, what do you want?
- I'm going.
- Where?
- I'm going for a walk, to get some air.
- Ah, stay here, where are you going?
I'm going to make a telephone call.
There's no telephone in this dive.
Then tell us to begin with!
He's going to make a call, get it?
Go on!
- I'm going as well.
- Well done.
- But I'm coming back.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Are you going as well?
Well done!
We've come to their place but I'm waiting for Stefanowski on my own!
What?
- See how cute that girl is?
- Her?
- The one who's dancing with the jacket, there.
Damn!
Is he dancing as well?
What's he doing?
He looks like a log trying to dance.
Here the men don't know how to dance.
Look how he's dancing the "Rock and Roll"...
He's the rock!
Get your hands off, filthy pig!
Stop that!
We'll have no trouble here!
Yeah, keep laughing!
He was right!
I didn't want to come here with you because I knew it would end up like this.
I'm off!
Bye!
- Where are you going?
- Totò!
- Are you mad?
- Come back here!
- Stop being so jumpy!
We've been waiting for ages...
- For someone we don't even know.
- What do you want us to do?
!
- You're lucky we're still here with you!
You're all clowns.
Why should I have to explain myself to people like you?
!
Who's running off over here, running off over there...
- You're all laughing like jokers!
- Who's laughing?
Who's running off?
Continue with your laughs and jokes, I can't stay with you anymore!
- I'm going for a walk!
- Where are you going?
- How should I know?
!
- Why don't you tell me where the other two are?
!
- Totò!
- Ah, let him go.
Where are you from, baby?
Hey there, why don't you come in?
Hello!
What are you doing all alone?
You don't want to try something new?
You'll see, I'll get rid of all your troubles.
- Mrs. Erika!
- Yes?
- I she new?
- Yes.
- She's from Sweden?
- Yes.
- Like the cat with nine tails?
- Yes.
- Damn!
My friend Stefanowski, I've waiting for you, But here there's a cat with nine tails.
#At midnight he goes...
To forget all his woes...#
Please, make yourself comfortable.
- This is the fifth sausage I've eaten.
- Yeah, yeah, you're hungry.
Those guys must have seen us and gotten scared.
- Scared of you?
- Of me, of you, of all of us together.
- Did you see all those gypsies?
Shut up and eat, then!
- Get out of here!
Hey!
Last night Totò got angry and stormed off.
Where is he?
- Who has seen him since?
- He's sleeping, I bet.
Open the garage.
And tell your wife to tell Totò that we didn't go inside sleep, we went out to work.
- What a night!
My son didn't sleep a wink.
- It must be the air.
- "Marì"!
He must have gone back to sleep.
- Lucky him.
Close the door.
Vincenzo, get the car ready.
Armando!
Armando!
Help!
Are you mad?
!
- Police!
- Police!
Go!
Go!
It looks like we're going to end up on strike like real workers.
Tell me something.
You know what it's like to work are the strikes really to make an impression or is it just a big scam?
The boss doesn't earn anything, but neither do you.
It's a sacrifice, to make the boss sweat.
And Totonno is the worst boss we could have.
- Evening.
- Hi.
Don Gaetano...
- So, your answer?
- How many times do I have to say it?
In Monaco there's nothing for you.
Maybe you could find something in Frankfurt, but it's not for everyone.
The main square in Frankfurt is already full.
Well I can't carry on living like this, always having to be on guard...
At the end of the day, you realise that you've earned no more than a common worker who has earned so little, but always little.
I ask myself why my Mother didn't have me learn a trade, you know?
She didn't even send me to school.
We were born on the street and on the street we will leave our blood.
I know how to be a salesman and I'm going to carry on, with or without the permission of others.
So then you tomorrow you can all get back to work!
Yes, but first you need to pay the gypsies and sort everything out.
- Don Gaetano, will you do my beard?
- Get yourselves up, I'll be right down.
- Vincenzo, are you coming?
- What am I doing here?
And you?
Mario, you going to have to ask her for money.
- Ask who?
- Whoever gave you this.
- If you won't ask, I'll do it for you.
- What?
- Yeah...
If I ask her for money, she'll give it to me.
She has to.
If not, I'll tell her husband that...
- What is this, blackmail?
- Yes.
Did you see what they're like?
They don't say hello, they just make threats.
If I can't get money now, I'm done.
But if I can just pay the gypsies, the situation will be reversed from this, to this.
Mayer!
What do you want to do?
Are you going to call or shall I?
- Hello, Mrs. Mayer.
- Are you mad?
- Are you going to talk to her or am I?
Hello?
- Hello?
It's me.
- Tell her that you want to see her tonight.
I wanted to ask if, tonight...
- She hung up.
She couldn't speak.
- But she said yes.
So let's go, not waste time.
And don't worry about it, she will be happy to help you.
It might not be the gentlemanly thing to do, but it's what has to be done.
That's why we're going Going to see the lady.
Let's go!
Are you sure that she said to meet here?
Hey!
Are you making fun of me?
- If you don't believe it then do what you want
- Oh yeah?
Let's call her then, but if the lady is not at home, I'm calling the husband.
- Let's go and call them, come on.
- Totò!
You're a friend, you've always helped me...
- I knew it!
You're trying to con me!
- No, it's like I told you...
This is the place, it's just, she must not be able to leave the house.
Let's go and find out why, then.
Give her a call... come on!
Come on, let's go.
- Taxi!
- Coward!
Where are you going?
So now we're arriving late for dates, are we?
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.
With that voice?
You don't know how to tell lies.
How extraordinary!
Come here, I want to see the face of this person who doesn't know how to lie.
So?
You don't want to tell me what happened to you?
- So?
- Nothing happened.
It just so happens that someone might be onto us.
I felt like I was being followed so drove around for a while.
Who was it?
Martinez?
Or one of your friends?
No, it can't be Martinez, he's a crook.
And Mayer knows everything he's up to.
Once he tried to put his nose into my business and I showed him what I thought of that.
He won't give us any trouble.
Don't be so down.
Laugh, Mario!
Do you think it's one of your friends?
Someone who wants to... blackmail me?
- Is it true?
- No, nobody wants to blackmail you!
- I only said that someone is onto us.
- I understand very well!
It's useless for you to defend him.
I knew straight away who it was.
Do you know what a blackmailer does when he loses track of his victim?
He goes to wait for them outside their house, to intimidate them.
But I know all these things.
Don't worry, I know you're defending me...
And laugh, Mario.
We'll have lots of time together.
I don't want it to be my fault...
Perhaps one day something will happen to us but I don't think so, I don't know.
And even if something does happen, it won't matter to me.
- I love you so much.
- Love you too.
You're so sweet to me!
You're afraid...
You're always afraid...
I was like you so poor so alone so young... and honest.
Mistaken love...
Martinez, there's no-one here.
Do you wish to speak to me?
This son of a...
No, I came to speak with Mr. Mayer.
- My husband is not at home tonight.
- You can see him tomorrow.
Mr. Mayer has told me to gather you and your men together at 9:00 tomorrow morning.
If you have something urgent to tell him, you can tell me.
I will see Mr. Mayer later on.
No, it's nothing, thank you.
You should know that Mr. Tramontano and I are now partners.
From now on orders will be given solely from Mr. Tramontano.
From tomorrow work will carry on as usual.
Mr. Mayer would like to tell you that he is now partners with Mr. Tramontano.
From today the orders will come from Mr. Tramontano.
From tomorrow you will continue with your work as usual.
Vincenzo...
Rodolfo Valentino...
Armando...
Ciro "the Short"...
"The Boxer"...
We don't need to say anything because we already know one another we all do the same job but you do yours and I'll do mine.
Our trade is an old one and it has its rules.
The first rule is that you need a Don Raffaele.
For what to we need a Don Raffaele?
Don Raffaele is a bank.
I treat you like a bank...
And I want to be treated like a bank!
I deal with all your needs.
But I will want interest, from you.
You will regain your jobs for me, with the same conditions as before.
And we will put those gypsies in their place as well.
You're staying with us.
To you I have to say but two words when the man doesn't have the shoulders or the wallet to be a man then he shouldn't even try.
If that's what you think.
That doesn't convince you?
Are you a man?
Take it... shoot.
Shoot... shoot!
Shoot!
Get lost!
Totò, wait!
Perhaps it's my fault, you know?
But I couldn't take that money.
Listen, you son of a bitch!
You could have lifted your finger and avoided all this, but you didn't.
I've been so naive!
My young friend, the honest worker!
I believed in you and instead you sold me out.
Sold me out with that face of yours!
You didn't care about me, but you were happy enough to take her money and buy the protection of Martinez...
But be careful, the party won't last very long.
They'll sort you out...
You'll never be a salesman, anyway.
May as well get back to that whore of yours!
- Oh yeah?
- The only think you can be is a crook!
- Totò!"
Get off!
Can you believe this jerk?
Go and do something good with your life, go on!
"I want to work!" Come on then, come and work with me!
I clean you up, I show you how to make money and then "Thank you", you say. "Thank you!"
I don't deserve it!
Damn it!
And that other Neapolitan idiot, with the pistol...
"Shoot... shoot!
Shoot!" What do you mean, "shoot"?
What, I have to shoot for you?
!
I shoot, you shoot...
What, are we at the "'OK Corral"?
!
"Ta, ta, ta, ta!"
"Don Raffaele Tramontano!" And who are you?
What do you want?
!
Without those guys you would die of hunger.
Who do you think you are?
!
And you tell me "get lost"?
You tell me "get lost"?
!
You don't need to tell me anything because I'm out of here!
I'm out of here!
Excuse me, where are you going?
Wherever I want!
To Moscow, Brussels, Paris!
Where I want!
No!
I'm leaving Europe!
I don't want to work in Europe anymore!
I'm going to Japan!
I could sell nylon as silk to the Japanese!
When someone has a brain and know all these languages...
Who do I need?
I have enough stuff anyway.
You'll see!
I'm taking the stuff away with me!
Old Peter Lorre will fall over when he sees that I've taken it!
What?
!
"Totonno stole everything!
The wool, the silk, the cotton..."
Did you really think that you couldn't work without him?
!
Oh!
I can make money wherever I find work!
Oh God, who's this?
Excellent!
They are relatives...
It's true...
If I stay, everything will be over for you...
The protection from Martinez!
And all your money.
And this is why I'm leaving.
Until I have the courage to do it...
Think how excited I would be to take away all Mayer's money and give it to you.
I've always earned money with my hands.
I've always been around people who do the same.
What's so important about money?
- But I love you.
- I love you too.
To stay with you I would do anything.
I would become worse than those men.
And this is why I'm leaving.
You can't come with me?
No... not even for one day.
It wish I could say "yes".
I showed you where I grew up I spoke to you about cold and hunger.
It's not easy to make a fortune, even if you decide to do it without honesty.
And even if you make it even if your name is Mayer...
You have no idea what kind of man he is.
I won't turn back...
I can't do it anymore.
Mario?
It's better that we say goodbye here.
THE END
THE MAGLIARI
- Hi there, what would you like?
- Please... a...
- A würstel?
- Yes.
Hey, hey!
You forgot your würstel!
Such lovely pasta!
- Please, sit.
- Why here?
- The place is full, Sir, don't you see?
I'm paying and have the right to be served like everybody else.
- Sir, have you read the prices?
- Yeah, I've read them!
I've read them!
- Hey, you're not at the market!
You want me to show you the money?
It's a restaurant.
I'm paying so I'll sit where I want!
The tables are all empty!
- What's all this shouting?
- No idea.
- Get me Umberto.
Oh, I understand, it bothers you if I sit in the middle of everyone else.
- But I'm out of here!
I'm out of here!
- Kid.
What is it?
They're giving you trouble?
- Where are you going?
Come and sit with me.
Guys!
There's an Italian here...
- Oysters to table 15!
- Excellent!
- He's our guest.
- Your guest?
- No, our guest!
- This guy runs things with other peoples' pockets.
- Thanks but won't disturb you.
- I need to get to the station anyway, the train leaves early tomorrow morning.
- Hey, what are you saying?
!
Sit yourself down.
Pietruccio, take this gentleman's coat.
Hand me your bag.
- We're just kidding.
- Sit down.
- Your pocket, my pocket...
Drink, warm yourself up.
It's Chianti, Italian wine.
- We're all friends here.
- To good health!
- You're a northerner, eh?
- Yes, from Tuscany.
Ah, good!
Then we represent all of Italy!
The Tuscan, the Roman and the Neapolitan!
- Eh, we're never short of Neapolitans!
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Drink.
Maybe I went too far before.
When you've seen what I've seen...
Go to work abroad!
Yeah, and wait for 3 years for them to accept you and then...
After six months I couldn't even...
Ah, no!
Eh!
Your problems... "Zip!" We don't want to hear them.
And you don't need to say anything, it's written all over your face.
Right, now let's eat!
- Bring out the spaghetti!
- Let's eat.
- He's right.
- Yeah.
- If it's overcooked I won't eat it!
- Yeah, you'll drink it.
- Hey, what's this?
It needs to be cooked well, with a bit of cheese.
- Hey, sing "Napoli"!
Hey, another plate of spaghetti for the kid.
He's eating with us.
- Let's eat, eh?
- Bring me the cheese!
Ah, Don Raffaele!
'Scuse us, we invited this guy to sit with us.
He's in a strange country, you know, far from home...
Christ, he never smiles!
This is how it works, you know.
First they entice people over then, when the poor workers arrive, they ignore them!
So then what am I meant to do?
Go back to Italy?
With the one thing I did manage to obtain.
Here!
A kilo of documents and a passport!
Yeah, for us that's difficult.
Just to renew a passport you have to kill...
Come on!
Eat, eat!
Don't think about it, you still have your health.
Drink up!
- A drop for me, too.
- Hey.
- What?
- There's a shady-looking gentleman.
- Where?
- Walking slowly...
Good evening.
Could I please speak to the owner?
Hey!
He's going back to Italy and he's moaning!
Tomorrow he'll open the window of the train and see the Italian sun!
Going back to Italy and he's moaning!
Tomorrow he'll see the Italian sun!
- Going back to Italy and...
- What are you singing, disco?
!
I know that Ferdinando Magliulo frequents this place.
Ferdinando Magliulo?
I don't know him.
Are you sure?
Please think carefully.
Hey, forget about all those troubles!
You're bringing us all down...
- Hey!
What are you doing?
!
- Here, let me wipe that off.
- That's okay...
- It's nothing.
Look at me!
You've ruined a new pair of trousers.
- "The dog barks at he who is dressed badly."
- It's nothing...
- Do you know a certain Ferdinando Magliulo?
- No!
- Hey, this is wine from the carton.
It comes out easily.
- It's already gone.
- Just go to the bathroom and dry yourself off.
- Bathroom?
No, I'll just run home.
In five minutes I'll be there and back.
I can't stay wet now, can I?
I'll just run home and change.
I'll see you afterwards at the "Copacabana".
Wait for me there.
- Excuse me, a small formality...
This gentleman wishes to check your documents.
- Yes...
- Here you go!
What's this novelty?
Now you're asking to see documents?
- It's just a formality.
Did something happen?
Before you never asked, now you're asking... "Danke schön!"
- I must see the passports of all Italian clients.
- Yes, please...
- This gentleman wishes to verify your documents.
- Yes, of course.
It that okay? "Gut"?
I had my passport right here.
I only just took it out...
But... where did that Roman guy go?
I showed it to him.
- You're all witnesses.
- Witnesses?
What witnesses?
!
- What?
- Kid, which of us do you know?
- What do you mean, who do I know?
- Follow me.
- I... have... passport!
I want to find that Roman guy, where did he go?
!
Kid, nobody needs your passport.
Just go with this gentleman and sort everything out.
I have... my passport!
Tell him!
You all saw my passport, no?
!
- Follow me.
- Go on, go on.
Explain it to him.
- Sure, I'll explain it!
I had a passport and I want it back!
This doesn't end here!
I'm going to...
I'll come back and find you!
I want my passport back!
I don't like this rubbish, mister.
First you feed him and then...
Tell Totonno to sort himself out or not to set foot in here again.
Kid?
"Psst!" Hey, kid!
- Damn... thieving bastard!
- Quiet!
- You're going to shout like that right here in front of the consulate?
!
- I don't care!
- You're mad, you know?
!
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'll kill you!
Here, take it!
Here you go!
Damn!
Last night I came back to give it to you but couldn't find you anymore.
I was surprised, you know?
I thought: "Where has he gone, this guy?"
What, you don't believe I came looking for you?
I needed a passport because they took mine away when I was in Belgium.
It's a disgrace.
They keep it and laugh in your face.
But for you workers they'll give it back straight away.
- First I'll whack you in the face and then I'll report you!
- Calm down!
Calm... calm down!
What do you mean, report?
You don't even know my name!
You don't understand!
I found the passport on the floor and was bringing it to the consulate, okay?
!
- No, you stole it!
You already said that!
- Yeah?
Alright, go to the police!
- Yeah, I'm going?
- Go, go!
Go to the police, go to the consulate!
Who'll listen to you?
!
Ah, look at this poor kid, dying of hunger.
Came here but couldn't achieve anything, now he's going back to Italy more miserable than when he arrived and makes a huge deal about spending 3 hours in lock-up.
Here you go;
I'll pay you for those 3 hours!
Don't you see?
!
Here you go!
And now what are you doing?
What, are you crying?
Hey!
- Damn, you big... here, take it!
- I don't want your money.
- Ah, come on, take it!
We're friends, no?
Come on, get in.
Why are you crying, eh?
- Take it.
- I don't want it.
- You don't want it?
It's not the money...
I want to work.
I want to earn it for myself.
I've made so many sacrifices.
How is it possible that I can't find a job?
A single job, I say!
Yeah, but for you with these nice clothes...
This nice car...
What could you ever know about someone like me?
Why, you think I was born in this car?
If someone doesn't have work, we can invent it.
- What do you mean, "invent" it?
- We'll invent it.
Salesman.
Here, take one
Salesman... with this car?
Even as a salesman you can get a car like this.
- So, I can do it too!
- Why not?
If you want to...
You need to know how, though.
You can't just 'become' a salesman, this is an art!
I'm very willing.
Ha, willing is enough!
Hey, now I'll try to get you in.
If I introduce you, maybe they'll give you a job.
Damn it's cold out here!
I'm not promising anything, though.
It's up to Don Raffaele and whoever has the stuff to sell.
What would we sell if it weren't for them?
Here all the Italians are Neapolitan.
And it's freemasonry, you know?
There are Greeks, Spanish...
There's a Turk... who can ever understand him?
Me, I'm independent.
Either I work for me or I don't work at all, you know?
Isn't God Almighty funny, eh?
First he puts you in Rome, with that beautiful sunshine...
00:13:46,049 -- 00:13:50,406 ... then, to make a living he throws you out here in Germany, with the polar ice caps!
- Totò!
- Yeah?
- Napoli-Roma, 3-nil!
- Who cares?
!
Let's go.
Ah, and how am I supposed to introduce you with that face?
In this profession you need to keep your eyes and ears open, to understand the language...
- But I don't even speak German
- Who cares?
!
You speak English, French, Turkish, Tuscan you know...
- Hello!
- Hey, Totò!
They're all good guys, all friends.
You'll see, you'll see!
- Why do you have to give it to me?
- Who wants to give it to you?
Wrap it up.
Wrap it, wrap it!
- Hey, you, new guy, tell me something.
You like this stuff?
- Yes.
- And could you make clothes from this stuff?
- I wish!
- Well done, give it a try.
- See how it's good stuff?
Now if you want it you'll have to give me 30 marks.
- What?
!
30 marks!
- Let's see it!
- Ah, look what we have here today!
- See how fine it is!
- Fine?
!
In my day it was difficult to make this stuff.
And now it's easy, give thanks to God Almighty!
And who asked you?
!
- Ah, Totò is right.
I'm sorry, I really am!
It's just that you hate progress.
- What progress?
!
- You sleep with your pipe in your mouth...
- And you sleep with the cigarette!
Now you're making trouble that I'll have to put right.
Ah, you always make it hard!
Let him work, what are you going to lose?
Anyway, Gennaro, this guy doesn't know how to do anything.
In 2 days he'll be going back to Italy, I'm telling you.
Yeah, and what do I tell Don Raffaele?
- Who knows this guy?
- What are you talking about?
Yeah, but if he were Neapolitan it would be alright, eh?
Come here!
Help me out, Gennaro.
Today I'll show him the ropes but you'll have to help him settle in.
You'll have to clean him up, look after him.
Come here!
I'll introduce you to Don Gennaro, come on.
He's a real youngster, eh?
At the moment he looks like a tramp with this big ol' coat but Gennaro just look at this guy, clean him up and he'll look better than anyone!
You're convinced?
He's convinced.
We're okay?
Okay, enough talking.
Get yourself a shave.
You're being difficult with me?
After all I've done for you?
- You really had to bring this to me?
- Don't worry kid, don't be afraid.
Don Gennaro is like a pitbull sometimes, but he has the heart of a Neapolitan.
Get him a shave, Gennaro.
- Where are we going?
- You like it?
It's beautiful, eh?
- Don't we need to get to work?
- Why, we're not working?
- Here?
- Listen to the little birds, listen!
- Yeah, the little birds...
Quiet a moment.
There they are, let's go.
What do you want to do?
This is a cemetery.
"Herr Professor Gustav Stüdendorf."
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Professor Stüdendorf.
- Sorry?
- Professor Gustav Stüdendorf.
- One moment.
- Excuse me!
- I've an appointment with Herr Professor Gustav Stüdendorf.
- Please, one moment.
- Thank you.
She's gone to...
What are you doing, you're outside?
Come in, let's go.
Madam!
- Hey, what do I have to do?
- What do I know?
Quiet, here he comes.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Herr Professor Gustav Stüdendorf?
Herr Professor Gustav Stüdendorf?
!
- And who are you?
I'm the representative of an important Italian textile firm - excuse me, I don't speak good German - that produces wool, silk and cotton.
- Please.
- Thank you.
- Please!
- Thank you!
My firm has put me in charge of delivering 3 cuts of material that Herr Professor Gustav Stüdendorf has ordered.
Bring me the bag.
We'll show the various cuts of material to this kind gentleman.
Herr Professor Gustav Stüdendorf in his good taste has ordered 3 cuts of material.
First, a black "Smoke of London"; show him...
"Smoke of London" is black, what kind of white...
The "Smoke of London" is for ceremonies and such.
That's it, we want to get the right one for you.
Second, a youthful colour to be used on afternoon occasions...
And a third, in "Prince of Wales" to be used on travels.
Encase the professor ever decides to take a journey anywhere.
Very durable and the fabric used is ideal.
- One moment.
- Thank you.
- What a nice guy, he's already hooked.
I know it...
- Gertrud!
Here's another hook!
Good morning, kind lady.
Good morning!
This gentleman has brought material that Gustav had ordered...
Yes, kind lady.
Please excuse me if I don't speak perfect German.
I represent an Italian textile firm that makes wool, silk and cotton.
The good professor ordered this "Prince of Wales" which is the perfect representation of Italy there's the blue of the sky, then the mandolins and macaroni...
What happened?
Gertrud, I'm sorry that your pain is still so real...
Our good professor Gustav is no longer with us... he's dead!
- No!
- Yes.
Did you hear?
Herr Professor Gustav Stüdendorf, he's dead!
Herr Professor Gustav Stüdendorf, in all his politeness, in all his wonderful gaiety.
Kind lady, I offer my condolences, the mortality of death...
Keep crying...
And now what do we do?
He factory has already marked these as sold, I've already bought the material.
The professor has already paid twenty marks up front.
And anyway, a lovely cut of wool is never a personal item.
No, no, no.
I inherited four shirts from my poor father!
And we must always remember that the memory of the dead is always present in the clothes they leave behind.
Here, if you keep these close to you you'll always feel that he, too, is close.
The memory of the great Herr professor Gustav Stüdendorf.
That'll be 410 Marks, 20 you've already paid up front so that comes to 390.
Three, nine, zero!
To whom should I make out the invoice?
The full title, please.
Sir, Lady, please?
Gertrud, you see that the material is already here, perhaps we ought to...
Thank you!
It's my right to take care of the wishes of my late husband.
- I'll go and fetch the money
- Thank you, kind lady, thank you.
She'll be very happy with this product Going to get the "grain", she is.
Eh, I'll never be good enough to do what you do.
You seemed like a different person.
If to sell things every day you must be always able to improvise, then I'll never manage it.
I don't have what it takes.
- So now you don't want to work?
!
- If you can call it work!
So tell me something.
In the factory where you worked, how many people were working there?
What, are you mad?
You want to sell to them?
They don't even have enough money for cigarettes!
- So what?
It's one piece of material per person.
Waiter!
Bill please!
- 2 marks and 20.
So over there is it just factories and workers?
Are there not, I don't know, families, houses, shops...?
- There's a restaurant and also a beautiful lady.
- Yeah?
So what are we waiting for, let's go!
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- What's this?
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?
- I told you.
- It seems like a fairytale village.
- So where is this restaurant with your beautiful lady?
- There it is.
- So go.
- On my own?
What can I do?
- Go and say hello, it's so long since you last saw her.
Say to her: "Wie gez Frau, Gutte Morgen".
Do you know how to say "Gutte Morgen"?
- Uhuh.
So go and say "Gutte Morgen" to her.
Go on!
Go on!
I'm coming as well.
Oh!
What are you doing, spying?
Do you have a "pennetta"?
Where are you from, the alps?
Go away, now.
Go home!
The girl, miss.
The girl...
Damn, how am I meant to make her understand me?
I would like to help, but I do not understand.
I... met... a waitress here.
You know?
A beautiful lady!
- I do not understand.
- No?
- Here you are, I finally found you... oh God!
- Oh my God!
- What's that?
!
Who's there?
- Oh God!
What's wrong with me?
It's my spinal column!
"Vertebralisc colonisc"!
Goodness, my backbone!
Be careful, have mercy!
I will be disabled for the rest of my life.
It hurts so much, how unlucky could I possibly be!
?
I was in such good shape!
God damn you!
Slowly, put him down here.
"Lndorsalisc spinosa".
"Lncolonisc verterbralisc"!
Oh, "Mein Frau", if only you knew how bad it felt.
Such terrible pain!
I have been abandoned in a strange land.
Please help me, you who are so merciful!
- You don't have a miracle remedy?
- No.
- An ointment?
- Yes!
- Yes, you have an ointment!
Fetch it!
Help me!
- Where does it hurt?
- "Hilfe, hilfe, mein Frau".
- Totò, answer me!
- "Hilfe, hilfe"!
- Has she gone?
- So...
- So what?
What do you want, are you mad?
- Come on, roll it out.
- So you haven't hurt yourself?
- Hurt?
What, do you want me to hurt you?
!
Oh my God, such terrible pain!
Quickly!
Get those rugs on the ground, we need to leave her the whole pack.
Oh, God!
It hurts!
When she comes down we really need her to see all the rugs.
Quiet!
Here she is.
Oh God!
Damn it, I've really hurt myself this time.
"Hilfe, hilfe, mein Frau"!
I can't feel my "indorsalisc spinosa" any more.
It will encumber me for the rest of my life.
Oh God, I've messed up.
I'm lying in a different position.
Oh, that's much better.
Get rid of that sickness!
It's okay, she hasn't noticed anything.
- "Mein liebe Frau", help me! "Hilfe, mein Frau".
- Just a moment.
This man came to find the nice lady and I've gone and hurt myself.
It's all his fault.
If he didn't need to come, none of this would have happened.
- Sorry?
- My friend here knows a girl who works here.
- Ah, what a nice young man!
- Thank you. "Danke."
- Oh, my goodness!
"Grazie?" What are you doing, go and sort out the rugs, you're a real idiot.
- Oh God! "Oh, mein Gott"!
- That's it, you're doing well.
- "Mein Gott", such pain!
- You will see, soon it will be better.
- You can't imagine ... how much I'm suffering!
Should I be worried about this pain?
Will I be able to get married, to have kids?
Such misfortune!
Hey, tell her that I'm a merchant.
Tell her I've got lots of problems.
Such misfortune I have!
"Frissioné", please rub it!
Save this young man.
Save me and I will give you anything!
Tell her that she should take a look at the rugs, I would ask you to show her but I don't trust you.
Would you like to see some nice rugs?
"In bukara", "in persiano"?
- Of course.
- Ah!
She said she would.
Thank you...
She said that she would take a look.
My God, such heavy hands!
Slowly...
"In delicatessen frizione".
Slowly...
lightly...
- Does it hurt here, too?
- Like that, lightly.
Oh, stay here, don't leave me.
How beautiful you are, how soft.
Who are you, the fairy from Pinocchio?
You have the wonderful blue eyes, blonde hair.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, it's a miracle! "Miraculo"!
"Ich spazire", I'm walking!
The pain is gone.
It must have been the ointment!
- Yes, the ointment!
It's wonderful!
- I'm jumping for joy!
I'm dancing the Strauss waltz!
Look!
I'm doing push-ups!
"Eins, zwei, drei, vier..."
- Oh, such beautiful rugs!
- "Eins, zwei, drei, vier..."
Ah!
Now you noticed, you ugly oaf!
These are my rugs!
With rugs nobody will ever slip over again!
"Nicht Kaput!".
Haha!
And what does a rug cost, but 150 marks?
- 150 marks!
- So little?
- Yes!
150 marks!
My head is worth more than 150 marks.
This way my head will not go "kaput".
What are you doing?
Put a rug in front of the door.
You're standing there like a statue!
We will demonstrate just how great our rug would look in front of your door.
What are you doing, walking over it?
That isn't your rug!
Get out of here.
He's leaving!
Going to say hello to his friends in the factory.
My friend is going away!
- Say goodbye. - "Aufwiedersehen".
- "Aufwiedersehen".
- Get out of here.
Wonderful!
How many things can you do with a nice rug?
Everything!
A rug warms the ambience of a room, you can invite your clients it's soft, it's fluffy, and you can even sit on it.
The Turks use them for everything.
They eat, they drink, they sleep, "Slafen".
"Gut Slafen!".
Feel how soft it is.
Feel how marvellous they are...
Will you buy them?
- "Kapi tapisc"?
- Oh, yes!
- Yes, how many?
"Eins, zwei, drei, vier..." all of them?
- All of them!
- All of them?
!
Hahaha!
Mario?
Give me a smoke.
- So?
It went well then?
You're all set?
- I hope so!
I only started this morning.
You know, it's our fault as well.
We need to move, to be given things to do.
There are lots of jobs in the world, you know.
Not just the pickaxe.
Did you know that salesman earn, in one day the same that we earn in a month!
And they all have their own car!
- Hey, what can I say?
They are educated people.
- No, they hired me!
Are you sure that they don't work too much?
Because if you're earning that much, in a hurry...
- They what they're doing!
- Then they're lucky!
- They don't give in like us, like sheep.
- Yeah...
That will be my friend.
See, that's my friend.
Look at the car he has.
- Now I have to go, I can't make my friend wait.
Bye!
- Bye!
Bye, Mario!
Bye, Lucchese.
Are you still making statues?
One day I'll sell them for you!
- Don't you forget us!
- I'll be back soon.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Hey, Pugliese!
Sing, if that relieves your heavy heart!
Sing
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Thank God one of us has been lucky.
- Yeah...
Take it, this is the what you deserve, your cut, because you took me there.
What's right is right.
- Thank you!
- Don't thank me, count!
- Oh!
But this is 50 marks!
- Yeah "Funfzig" marks, you would usually earn that much in a week!
Damn...
Oh!
Christ!
Do you see what that damn woman...
- You see?
The fairy from Pinocchio.
- But, what?
- What?
!
Be quiet!
They must have something on us.
- Who?
!
- Who?
!
You don't see them?
!
God damn it!
Damn pigs!
Just for one day it could go well!
Here they are, they've already caught up.
There's nothing we can do.
We have to stop.
Come on.
Another shock like that...
So it's what I thought.
What you do is scam people!
- Well?
- Well, I've never been in trouble with the police.
Well, I have.
I was looking for work.
If I wanted to be a con artist, I would have stayed at home.
And who are you?
What are you saying?
What do you know about me or why I'm here?
You live like beasts just to be judged by others.
But yeah, you have to preach honesty because... you work in a factory.
Just as long as there is a factory, everything is fine but if one day that factory is missing, will you know how to survive?
I might be a con-artist but I know how to survive!
Hey, I'm 35 years old and I want to live well!
I realised that late on, but at least I realised it!
I'd like to see someone like you speak like this when you have a nice shirt on your back or when you're eating well every day or when you're in the company of a beautiful woman, have you ever seen a beautiful woman close up?
!
- Hey, wake up!
Totonno says we have to go.
- But, wait...
- Wait for what?
For you?
!
Come on, what are you thinking, eh?
Come on. "Bitte", excuse me.
"Fräulein", get up.
Eh, you're sitting down again?
I asked you to get up!
Well, you're really kind gentlemen!
"Money"?
Go see the Americans, it's those who have the "Money"!
What do you want?
You don't want me to dance or to buy me a drink...
You just drank a cup of champagne!
Get out of here!
Stop wasting my time!
Enough!
I told you to go away!
If you don't get out of here I'll call the owner!
- You're sending her away?
- No, I'm marrying her!
She is a professional!
Come on, let's go.
- "Buonasera"!
- Were you worried about us?
- Right, "Bitte"!
What are you drinking?
- The usual "drinken", "Fräulein".
- A bottle of whisky.
- Get me a cigarette.
- A "lit", right away.
- Okay, gentlemen!
Good night!
- Every night!
- It's his age!
- What are you doing, leaving?
You're leaving me on my own?
- Yeah, what do you want?
Find something to do, choose a girl!
Marlene, find him a girl!
- A girl for my friend, here.
You guys take care of it.
- Of course!
- Hey, Ridi!
- Mario, come here and sit down.
Put your feet up!
Oh, excuse me!
We haven't even introduced you.
These are our girlfriends.
Marlene, Ursula, Annalise...
Mario is a friend of ours.
He's a handsome boy, eh?
Cute?
You're right!
What am I thinking?
I'll sort it out.
Hey, Frida!
Come here!
- What are you doing?
Where are you sending me?
!
- No, it's her that I'm bringing to you!
- Tell me something, they still haven't paid the bail money to get Salvatore out?
- No.
- Frida, what are you up to?
- Me?
Nothing.
- Are you on your own?
- Yes.
- Here, sit with us!
- Thank you.
Frida, why don't you get to know our friend here?
- And Salvatore?
- Just go with him for one night!
- Who cares about him anyway?
!
- Mario, do you like her?
Frida, do you like Mario?
See?
They like each other!
- You're found your calling, a pimp!
- You can talk, short ass!
What?
!
I'm 1 meter and 55 tall!
Who do you think you are?
!
Ha!
I don't know how you got into the club, you're so short!
- Look who's talking!
- Why, you think you're taller than me?
- Let's measure!
Ah, Tango!
Fräulein, come here.
- Do you want to dance?
- Yes.
- "Tanzen"?
- I don't know how to dance the tango.
- It's easy, I'll lead you along.
- "Wie heist du"?
- Eh?
- "Wie heist du"?
- What your name?
I Frida.
- Ah, my name?
- Yes.
- Mario Balducci.
- Ah, "Balduccio".
- No, Balducci.
- Yes "Balduccio".
Good morning!
- Who's that?
- He's some kid, a new one.
- In Naples it's pouring.
- Why, is it sunny here?
- There should be three.
- Don Gennaro, check it over.
The "Scassate"!
No, we're just fixing it!
- Has Totonno been in?
- I don't know, have you guys seen Totò?
- No.
- Could you tell me where he lives?
Last night we went out together then lost each other.
We need to go to work.
- Totonno has left.
- What, what do you mean "left"?
- He will have gone to run the usual route...
- No, he left.
I don't think he'll be back any time soon, he was leaving with all his suitcases.
- Ah, he always does this.
Seven days here, seven days there.
- With his suitcases?
I'm sure he managed to cram it all in!
I'm just saying what I saw, he left.
When he comes back, you'll see.
And if he doesn't come back, it could be that he wanted to make it on his own!
To the health of Herr Mayer and the lovely lady...
And if you'll allow me, my own.
And to all of you.
Once we have transferred to Hamburg, you'll see.
You're now part of the commercial organization of Herr Mayer the most important in all of "Deutschland".
The only thing is that this chance I'm giving you will need to be earned.
You will have fortune and good health, the goods in advance for 10% less than what you pay Don Raffaele and you will be staying in Hamburg, a lovely city... naked woman...
Though use them sparingly because I'm responsible for the whole thing!
I've been made guarantor for you by Mr. Mayer.
Raise your glasses gentlemen, and laugh!
And I don't want to have to worry about the right to sell, is that clear?
Mr. Mayer says that they all need to be in order with their rights to sell.
- Yes.
- Of course, that's the most important thing.
- Look who's talking, he who never has his on him!
I don't understand them.
Are you sure that they're all Italians?
No, Miss, they're not Italians, they're Neapolitans.
They speak a different language.
- Just think, it's 10 years that I've had to listen to them and I don't understand one bit!
- Yeah, when it's convenient.
- Yes.
Ah, here is our Rodolfo Valentino.
He's a good dancer, no?
Mr. Mayer needs good salesmen and the lady needs good dancers.
- Hermann?
- Get out of here.
- First you pull me over here, then you don't need me.
- Mr. Mayer is very much in love with his wife.
- Yeah, of course!
You would be, too... with those thighs.
Leave her alone, Peter Lorre, I'll show you what life is.
- Is she really his wife?
- Yeah, when it suits her.
There's nobody here?
What happened?
- Don Raffaele is breaking the china.
- What?
- Shh, listen to her.
When she went to Brooklyn she made even the best gangsters cry.
- Gilda Mignonette, do you know her?
- No.
- Ah, what do you know?
- Are you not going to tell me what happened?
- Totonno wants to compete against Don Raffaele.
He's delivered the best Neapolitan salesmen to a German Boss.
- Totonno is back?
Where is he?
- They're all at the Copacabana.
Kitty... at least you and I are here together!
You all knew?
And what did you do?
Everyone knew everything.
Everybody knew what Totonno was up to, but nobody did a thing.
He worked without being disturbed because there's always Don Raffaele to deal with it!
Don Raffaele dresses you, Don Raffaele pays your bail money, to get you out of jail when you've been messing around.
I should send all your broke asses back to Naples!
Do you remember when I put the first cut of material in your hands?
For the devotion that I have for that beautiful "Mother of Pompeii" this time I'll get Totonno back, I won't just try to cover it up.
- Or I'll die trying, God help me!
- Don Raffaele!
So how does this woman understand Italian so well?
She fought in the Italian Campaign with Kesselring.
So did you do anything with her in Hamburg?
- And why would I tell you?
- Why not?
- Because you're ugly.
- Ah, come on!
Vincenzo, come here a minute.
- Are you sure that we'll be better off with Totonno?
- Well first we need to decide...
- My wife is coming here, though.
- You need to leave her in Naples, like I did with mine.
- Yeah, but I love my wife.
- Are you saying I don't love mine?
So you want be the adventurer with your wife following along?
What do you mean, "adventurer"?
- So, what did the others decide?
- They would do it, but they're afraid to lose their jobs with Don Raffaele.
- They want to know your conditions and then afterwards...
- Afterwards?
When, afterwards?
I'm offering the better deal, they're either in or not.
The conditions are those I've made for you.
- And what does that guy want?
- What do I know?
- Nobody knows anything, eh?
Yes, yes.
You know nothing, too.
- An American cigarette, please?
- No, thanks, I smoke these.
- Paula, when are the men getting to Hamburg?
- My husband says...
- Yeah, yeah, I understand.
- Come with me.
- I can't.
- It's better to avoid them coming here.
- My wife would like some ivory.
- One moment, one moment, please.
He doesn't need to understand German.
Totonno, we had better clear this up now.
- I don't need to explain myself to anyone.
- It'll take a quarter of an hour come with me, speak to who you need to speak to, and put everything right.
Then come back here to your friends.
What do you think, I'm married to Don Raffaele?
He can do what he wants to do, I'll do the same.
I didn't force anyone, they all came here of their own accord.
Federico, I'm in a rush, I can't discuss this all night.
I'm going back in.
Bye!
- You will not offend Don Raffaele in this way!
- What do you want?
!
- Totò!
Let's get out of here!
The car!
We've met each other before.
Ah, I remember you.
Sorry?
- What are you doing?
Spying on me from all the doors in Hannover?
- Me?
Always without shoes...
without a jacket.
What did he do?
Let me see.
Look, look!
- Who was that?
- I don't know.
Yes, it's true.
I've seen you before.
A morning, in a hotel.
Ah!
It's not nice to forget that you've seen a woman.
But it is good to forget where you saw her
- Understand?
- No.
- We will move from here, but we want to be sure.
- You need to give us security.
Eh, I don't care about their threats.
If you want to work, you come.
The rest is none of my problem, okay?
He always has to shout!
They're mad... always want to talk...
Ah... you're better?
What were you doing in the middle of the street?
I thought you had gone home.
- No, I want to sell.
- To sell?
- Us two are old friends.
- Oh, really?
We're friends, too.
He's a good boy.
I'll with Mr. Mayer in one moment, Miss.
- Is he coming to Hamburg, too?
- Perhaps.
So, looks like I'm taking you with me to Hamburg.
Are you happy?
I need someone I can trust, a friend like you.
Here.
Damn, look what they did to you!
Looks like you were born in that shirt!
See, if I make a fortune then so do you.
But we won't send you to sell, because that's not for you.
You can do better, you know.
For example... the assistant to the wife of the Boss.
What are you doing?
Are you looking at me?
But you need to be careful around her, you know?
Because otherwise you'll be in trouble.
She's the Boss's wife.
Here, smoke a cigarette.
- Where do you know her from?
- I don't know, I saw her one day...
- Ciccì!
- Hey, Arma'!
- Armando is here!
- What happened to you?
- What a trip!
It was snowing, my wife was vomiting, the boy needed to pee.
- What a city!
This is like New York!
- Ah, you've seen nothing yet!
- Here things are made of gold!
- Where are they?
- Armando's here!
- Hey, how are you?
- How's it going?
- Armando!
- How are you?
- You're beautiful!
- I thought you'd never get here.
- Of course I'm here!
- He got lost in the middle of the snow.
- Did you not follow the route?
- What route?
This guy doesn't know how to drive!
- So how are we going to sell all this stuff?
- We need to sell it!
- Armando!
- Totò, hi!
- What happened to you?
- Ah, you've no idea!
Ah, I knew it.
He got jumped by Cossacks!
- Totò, I've been travelling for three days.
And you know, it's all German restaurants!
"Würstel and Cartoffole, Cartoffole and Würstel!"
Instead, here it's organized by Totonno:
Spaghetti and clams!
- Tell him.
- It's true!
You know what they have here?
To eat with combined the...
Don't make a story out of it, wrap it up.
Tell him what he needs to do, come on!
Hold on!
I left my wife outside!
Where are we going to sleep?
We've organised you a Palace Suite but I should show you the way, otherwise we'll lose you in the rubble.
- Armando!
- What do you want?
- What do you want?
- Come here!
- I'm coming!
Let's go.
- Yes.
- Arma'!
They popped the car tyres!
- What are you saying?
The tyres popped, just like that?
!
I was in the car, and some guy on a motorbike went past and I heard it pop.
What kind of nonsense are you talking?
Let's have a look.
It looks like it was done with a knife.
Who could it have been?
Who do you think?
Some kid.
- And why didn't you call for me?
- I don't know, I was in the car watching the boy.
You came from Naples and brought the street urchins with you.
- Totò, come and see how much fun the German street urchins are.
- What?
It wasn't a street urchin, just a man on a motorcycle.
- Yeah, a man having fun with my tyres.
- What happened?
- They cut my tyres.
- Help me out here, what happened?
They cut his tyres!
- Everything okay?
- "Alles gut".
- "Gut Morgen".
They're having fun with tyres.
- Sorry?
- They cut a car tyre.
- why don't you put the car inside.
- I don't know, it's them that...
- Is my husband here?
What's she up to?
Did she come to check up on us?
- Ah, okay, he's out.
Will he be back today?
- I don't know.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
She's right, you know.
There's the garage, but you leave the car here!
You'll never understand each other like that.
You should all speak at the same time, not individually!
She didn't know that her husband wasn't in Hamburg.
Go and tell her, eh!
Take my shoes to the shop...
Tomorrow morning.
Goodbye.
- And who will give him money?
- I think that he'll need to pay.
What, are you still speaking about tyres?
Don't chat, we have visitors.
Excuse them, Miss.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Yeah, I'll show you a good evening.
- Shut it!
She understands Italian, you know!
- Yeah, it's better if she understands.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- I don't like this paper, you know.
- Yeah, you're right.
When you try to tie it, it always rips.
- Ah you want to make a mess about paper, now?
- Just wrap the packages.
- For you we do nothing but packages!
So?
Do you like Hamburg?
Shall we go for a drink?
When you don't have money, you come crying to me.
Go on, go!
What are you waiting for?
Yeah, go!
- It's different from Naples, don't you think?
- I don't know, I've never been there.
So you're not like the others.
- You're not Neapolitan?
- No, I'm from Grosseto.
- Grosseto?
- Where's that?
- In Tuscany.
- Ah, I know Tuscany.
I love Florence.
- In Italy they make you pay a fine.
- What is a fine?
You pay, "verboten"... for the kisses.
- You pay for kisses?
- For kissing in public?
- Ah!
Kisses in public!
It's not easy, this kind of life.
- Good evening.
- But I'm not complaining.
Two beers, please.
Come on, sit down.
Do you like it here?
I grew up in the middle of these people.
- In the middle of these people?
- Yes.
I was born here, in this quarter, the poorest quarter in Hamburg.
Think how strange it is, that you came to Germany to find fortune and I went to work in Italy to eat and to be less cold.
- I didn't have this.
- In Italy?
Where?
- Sad times...
Ah, a Rotamint!
I love them.
Oh, I don't have any change!
Can you change this, please.
Excuse me, excuse me!
Hey kid, stay a while and talk with me.
You're so young!
Come on, stay with me for a while.
- Yes.
- The meat may be old but the desire is still young.
- You don't understand?
- No!
What's she saying, I don't understand her.
- You're right!
- Leave him in peace.
Yeah, yeah, It's true.
I'm old!
But the only difference between me and this lady here is age!
Come and drink a while with us!
What do they want?
What did that woman say?
She said that if you're a whore, then so am I and that the only difference between her and me is a difference in age.
You know what I remember?
The War in Grosseto.
What were you doing in that hotel in Hannover?
The same thing we're doing here.
Today we work, but we need to make them pay for those tires.
- Yeah!
Alright, we get it.
- We all know it, but it won't always be like this.
- You're still here?
- Casanova has arrived, fresh from his escapade.
- Come here.
- Congratulations.
- What are you, the office joker?
How did it go?
Did it go well?
Did you show her what Italians know how to do?
- What Italians?
What are you talking about?
- Hey, I want to know everything.
- What do you want to know?
What do I need to tell you?
- What, are you trying to be crafty with me?
- Totò, are we going?
Yes or no?
- Yeah, I'm coming.
I can't talk now.
You stay here, but you need to tell me everything.
- Well, are you done?
- Yeah, we're done, we're done.
- What's going on with these tyres?
- They're putting them right.
First it was Ciccì, now it's Pasquale, so they must have some problem with us!
God damn it!
No, you knew it, because it was you who dealt with that German guy.
You were here to be the boss and we were out in the open.
Tyres slashed, a car into a pole, and who knows what will happen next!
What do you want?
This trade has its problems.
You put us in this situation, and you need to get us out of it.
You told us: "Come to Hamburg and work for me, I'm offering you better conditions".
I work, so the rest is your problem.
If you don't know what to do, why not call Don Raffaele he would know what to do.
Break it up, break it up!
- What a mess, for the work of a few Polish gypsies
- That's what I was just saying.
- Polish?
- Yes.
- And who are these Polish?
- Mr. Mayer already told you.
Here, before, there was a man called Stefanowski, a Pole.
It was him who dealt with the sellers, the Polish, Spanish, Hungarians...
One moment, please.
- Ah, so you knew it!
- You're trying to be clever.
- But you didn't tell us anything.
And what should I be telling you, that there were others before us selling stuff?
What a surprise!
Why would someone want to put their friends in such a mess?
At least give us some idea of what's going on.
That's what you promised us: better conditions than with Don Raffaele. "Quiet and well-being".
And we've been quiet!
Waiting for this mess with the tyres to pass.
But now things are getting worse.
- You could speak to Mr. Mayer.
- Of course I'm going to.
- But first go to that... what was he called, that Pole?
- Stefanowski.
He has a bar.
- Never!
- Why not?
- No!
What do you want to do, ask these guys to let us work?
No, you tell him that he needs to leave us alone.
Show them that we're not scared of anyone.
Mr. Mayer wanted to inform you that he will be back tomorrow morning instead of tonight.
- You had an appointment with Mr. Mayer?
- Me?
No.
- Totò, so we're agreed?
- On what?
- On Stefanowski.
- Yeah.
- Are we all going?
- Yeah.
- I want to meet whoever put me into that pole!
Hey Totò, did you hear that?
He said that the local Spaniards and Poles are over there.
- So it's divided by nations?
- Yeah, a nation for every street.
- We'll see.
Who knows what we're going to see!
- Nothing here, either.
- I knew it.
- A show with nude women.
- Let's stay here then, and search afterwards
- Listen to him!
- I want to get it while I still can!
- Come on, let's go.
- What does he want?
Come on!
Nothing here, either.
Just drunks and whores.
- So let's go, okay?
- Where?
- Further down.
- There's an Italian café.
Let's go and get a coffee!
You want a coffee, now?
Ah, yes, if you Neapolitans don't get your coffee, Vesuvius weeps!
- Is coffee better in Rome, then?
- No, it's not that it's better... ah, you wouldn't understand.
- Hey, have you seen my passport?
I've been everywhere!
China, Japan...
- But not Rome.
- In Rome, they don't stamp your passport...
- In Rome, they would take your passport away!
Yeah, hilarious!
Hey, Totonno!
What are you doing?
We should speak to this guy.
- But I was dancing...
- Cut it out!
- Are you Italian?
- Yes, I'm Italian.
- Have you been living here long?
- For 50 years.
- Wow!
So you must know everyone around here!
- I know enough.
- Do you know where the gypsies hang out?
- Gypsies?
- Yeah.
How should I know if someone's a gypsy?
They are gypsies that work with a certain Stefanowski, they're Polish.
Polish?
Yeah, on the same street that the Polish café is on.
- Yeah?
- Further down.
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.
- Did you put sugar in?
- Next, please!
- "Bitte", Amiro Stefanowski.
- He's not here.
- Not here.
- Will he back?
Maybe, maybe not.
- What shall we do?
- Let's wait to see if he comes in tonight.
- When he arrives, tell him we're here, okay?
- Yes.
Okay, let's wait for him.
Let's sit down.
Waiter!
Bring us beers... one, two, three, four, five beers.
Eight beers!
Waiter!
- Hey, Rodolfo Valentì, what do you want?
- I'm going.
- Where?
- I'm going for a walk, to get some air.
- Ah, stay here, where are you going?
I'm going to make a telephone call.
There's no telephone in this dive.
Then tell us to begin with!
He's going to make a call, get it?
Go on!
- I'm going as well.
- Well done.
- But I'm coming back.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Are you going as well?
Well done!
We've come to their place but I'm waiting for Stefanowski on my own!
What?
- See how cute that girl is?
- Her?
- The one who's dancing with the jacket, there.
Damn!
Is he dancing as well?
What's he doing?
He looks like a log trying to dance.
Here the men don't know how to dance.
Look how he's dancing the "Rock and Roll"...
He's the rock!
Get your hands off, filthy pig!
Stop that!
We'll have no trouble here!
Yeah, keep laughing!
He was right!
I didn't want to come here with you because I knew it would end up like this.
I'm off!
Bye!
- Where are you going?
- Totò!
- Are you mad?
- Come back here!
- Stop being so jumpy!
We've been waiting for ages...
- For someone we don't even know.
- What do you want us to do?
!
- You're lucky we're still here with you!
You're all clowns.
Why should I have to explain myself to people like you?
!
Who's running off over here, running off over there...
- You're all laughing like jokers!
- Who's laughing?
Who's running off?
Continue with your laughs and jokes, I can't stay with you anymore!
- I'm going for a walk!
- Where are you going?
- How should I know?
!
- Why don't you tell me where the other two are?
!
- Totò!
- Ah, let him go.
Where are you from, baby?
Hey there, why don't you come in?
Hello!
What are you doing all alone?
You don't want to try something new?
You'll see, I'll get rid of all your troubles.
- Mrs. Erika!
- Yes?
- I she new?
- Yes.
- She's from Sweden?
- Yes.
- Like the cat with nine tails?
- Yes.
- Damn!
My friend Stefanowski, I've waiting for you, But here there's a cat with nine tails.
#At midnight he goes...
To forget all his woes...#
Please, make yourself comfortable.
- This is the fifth sausage I've eaten.
- Yeah, yeah, you're hungry.
Those guys must have seen us and gotten scared.
- Scared of you?
- Of me, of you, of all of us together.
- Did you see all those gypsies?
Shut up and eat, then!
- Get out of here!
Hey!
Last night Totò got angry and stormed off.
Where is he?
- Who has seen him since?
- He's sleeping, I bet.
Open the garage.
And tell your wife to tell Totò that we didn't go inside sleep, we went out to work.
- What a night!
My son didn't sleep a wink.
- It must be the air.
- "Marì"!
He must have gone back to sleep.
- Lucky him.
Close the door.
Vincenzo, get the car ready.
Armando!
Armando!
Help!
Are you mad?
!
- Police!
- Police!
Go!
Go!
It looks like we're going to end up on strike like real workers.
Tell me something.
You know what it's like to work are the strikes really to make an impression or is it just a big scam?
The boss doesn't earn anything, but neither do you.
It's a sacrifice, to make the boss sweat.
And Totonno is the worst boss we could have.
- Evening.
- Hi.
Don Gaetano...
- So, your answer?
- How many times do I have to say it?
In Monaco there's nothing for you.
Maybe you could find something in Frankfurt, but it's not for everyone.
The main square in Frankfurt is already full.
Well I can't carry on living like this, always having to be on guard...
At the end of the day, you realise that you've earned no more than a common worker who has earned so little, but always little.
I ask myself why my Mother didn't have me learn a trade, you know?
She didn't even send me to school.
We were born on the street and on the street we will leave our blood.
I know how to be a salesman and I'm going to carry on, with or without the permission of others.
So then you tomorrow you can all get back to work!
Yes, but first you need to pay the gypsies and sort everything out.
- Don Gaetano, will you do my beard?
- Get yourselves up, I'll be right down.
- Vincenzo, are you coming?
- What am I doing here?
And you?
Mario, you going to have to ask her for money.
- Ask who?
- Whoever gave you this.
- If you won't ask, I'll do it for you.
- What?
- Yeah...
If I ask her for money, she'll give it to me.
She has to.
If not, I'll tell her husband that...
- What is this, blackmail?
- Yes.
Did you see what they're like?
They don't say hello, they just make threats.
If I can't get money now, I'm done.
But if I can just pay the gypsies, the situation will be reversed from this, to this.
Mayer!
What do you want to do?
Are you going to call or shall I?
- Hello, Mrs. Mayer.
- Are you mad?
- Are you going to talk to her or am I?
Hello?
- Hello?
It's me.
- Tell her that you want to see her tonight.
I wanted to ask if, tonight...
- She hung up.
She couldn't speak.
- But she said yes.
So let's go, not waste time.
And don't worry about it, she will be happy to help you.
It might not be the gentlemanly thing to do, but it's what has to be done.
That's why we're going Going to see the lady.
Let's go!
Are you sure that she said to meet here?
Hey!
Are you making fun of me?
- If you don't believe it then do what you want
- Oh yeah?
Let's call her then, but if the lady is not at home, I'm calling the husband.
- Let's go and call them, come on.
- Totò!
You're a friend, you've always helped me...
- I knew it!
You're trying to con me!
- No, it's like I told you...
This is the place, it's just, she must not be able to leave the house.
Let's go and find out why, then.
Give her a call... come on!
Come on, let's go.
- Taxi!
- Coward!
Where are you going?
So now we're arriving late for dates, are we?
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.
With that voice?
You don't know how to tell lies.
How extraordinary!
Come here, I want to see the face of this person who doesn't know how to lie.
So?
You don't want to tell me what happened to you?
- So?
- Nothing happened.
It just so happens that someone might be onto us.
I felt like I was being followed so drove around for a while.
Who was it?
Martinez?
Or one of your friends?
No, it can't be Martinez, he's a crook.
And Mayer knows everything he's up to.
Once he tried to put his nose into my business and I showed him what I thought of that.
He won't give us any trouble.
Don't be so down.
Laugh, Mario!
Do you think it's one of your friends?
Someone who wants to... blackmail me?
- Is it true?
- No, nobody wants to blackmail you!
- I only said that someone is onto us.
- I understand very well!
It's useless for you to defend him.
I knew straight away who it was.
Do you know what a blackmailer does when he loses track of his victim?
He goes to wait for them outside their house, to intimidate them.
But I know all these things.
Don't worry, I know you're defending me...
And laugh, Mario.
We'll have lots of time together.
I don't want it to be my fault...
Perhaps one day something will happen to us but I don't think so, I don't know.
And even if something does happen, it won't matter to me.
- I love you so much.
- Love you too.
You're so sweet to me!
You're afraid...
You're always afraid...
I was like you so poor so alone so young... and honest.
Mistaken love...
Martinez, there's no-one here.
Do you wish to speak to me?
This son of a...
No, I came to speak with Mr. Mayer.
- My husband is not at home tonight.
- You can see him tomorrow.
Mr. Mayer has told me to gather you and your men together at 9:00 tomorrow morning.
If you have something urgent to tell him, you can tell me.
I will see Mr. Mayer later on.
No, it's nothing, thank you.
You should know that Mr. Tramontano and I are now partners.
From now on orders will be given solely from Mr. Tramontano.
From tomorrow work will carry on as usual.
Mr. Mayer would like to tell you that he is now partners with Mr. Tramontano.
From today the orders will come from Mr. Tramontano.
From tomorrow you will continue with your work as usual.
Vincenzo...
Rodolfo Valentino...
Armando...
Ciro "the Short"...
"The Boxer"...
We don't need to say anything because we already know one another we all do the same job but you do yours and I'll do mine.
Our trade is an old one and it has its rules.
The first rule is that you need a Don Raffaele.
For what to we need a Don Raffaele?
Don Raffaele is a bank.
I treat you like a bank...
And I want to be treated like a bank!
I deal with all your needs.
But I will want interest, from you.
You will regain your jobs for me, with the same conditions as before.
And we will put those gypsies in their place as well.
You're staying with us.
To you I have to say but two words when the man doesn't have the shoulders or the wallet to be a man then he shouldn't even try.
If that's what you think.
That doesn't convince you?
Are you a man?
Take it... shoot.
Shoot... shoot!
Shoot!
Get lost!
Totò, wait!
Perhaps it's my fault, you know?
But I couldn't take that money.
Listen, you son of a bitch!
You could have lifted your finger and avoided all this, but you didn't.
I've been so naive!
My young friend, the honest worker!
I believed in you and instead you sold me out.
Sold me out with that face of yours!
You didn't care about me, but you were happy enough to take her money and buy the protection of Martinez...
But be careful, the party won't last very long.
They'll sort you out...
You'll never be a salesman, anyway.
May as well get back to that whore of yours!
- Oh yeah?
- The only think you can be is a crook!
- Totò!"
Get off!
Can you believe this jerk?
Go and do something good with your life, go on!
"I want to work!" Come on then, come and work with me!
I clean you up, I show you how to make money and then "Thank you", you say. "Thank you!"
I don't deserve it!
Damn it!
And that other Neapolitan idiot, with the pistol...
"Shoot... shoot!
Shoot!" What do you mean, "shoot"?
What, I have to shoot for you?
!
I shoot, you shoot...
What, are we at the "'OK Corral"?
!
"Ta, ta, ta, ta!"
"Don Raffaele Tramontano!" And who are you?
What do you want?
!
Without those guys you would die of hunger.
Who do you think you are?
!
And you tell me "get lost"?
You tell me "get lost"?
!
You don't need to tell me anything because I'm out of here!
I'm out of here!
Excuse me, where are you going?
Wherever I want!
To Moscow, Brussels, Paris!
Where I want!
No!
I'm leaving Europe!
I don't want to work in Europe anymore!
I'm going to Japan!
I could sell nylon as silk to the Japanese!
When someone has a brain and know all these languages...
Who do I need?
I have enough stuff anyway.
You'll see!
I'm taking the stuff away with me!
Old Peter Lorre will fall over when he sees that I've taken it!
What?
!
"Totonno stole everything!
The wool, the silk, the cotton..."
Did you really think that you couldn't work without him?
!
Oh!
I can make money wherever I find work!
Oh God, who's this?
Excellent!
They are relatives...
It's true...
If I stay, everything will be over for you...
The protection from Martinez!
And all your money.
And this is why I'm leaving.
Until I have the courage to do it...
Think how excited I would be to take away all Mayer's money and give it to you.
I've always earned money with my hands.
I've always been around people who do the same.
What's so important about money?
- But I love you.
- I love you too.
To stay with you I would do anything.
I would become worse than those men.
And this is why I'm leaving.
You can't come with me?
No... not even for one day.
It wish I could say "yes".
I showed you where I grew up I spoke to you about cold and hunger.
It's not easy to make a fortune, even if you decide to do it without honesty.
And even if you make it even if your name is Mayer...
You have no idea what kind of man he is.
I won't turn back...
I can't do it anymore.
Mario?
It's better that we say goodbye here.
THE END
At 4..00 a.m. on Friday, May 10, 1940, Hitler invaded Holland.
So began a weekend destined to become one of the most momentous in history.
The following day, Saturday, May 1 1, Winston Churchill became Prime Minister.
24 hours later, on Sunday, May 12... a mission was mounted with such speed and secrecy... that no written word of it ever appeared in the official files of the War Cabinet.
The purpose of the mission... to get all the industrial diamonds out of Amsterdam... before the Germans took over the city.
In a room above a shop in one of London's back streets... two of the three men chosen for such a dangerous task... met for their final briefing.
One was Walter Keyser... a Dutch diamond expert... a quiet man who'd lived in England for 10 years.
The other, Maj. Dillon... an experienced intelligence officer, who was to be in charge of the party.
But the key man on Operation Amsterdam was Jan Smit... a friend of Walter Keyser, and another diamond expert... who knew practically every Dutch merchant in Amsterdam.
He was also a man in love with life.
Jan Smit knew that the value of the stocks held in Amsterdam... was between 9 and 10 million pounds.
He also knew there was no figure big enough... to describe their worth to the German war effort.
For without industrial diamonds to cut and bore... tanks and airplanes could not be built.
Sorry I'm late, sir.
You know CounciIor De Mattos of the netherlands Legation.
Of course.
Maj. DiIIon, here, will be in charge of the party.
How do you do?
-Have you heard from your father?
-Nothing from holland.
AII we know is German agents give great prices for industrial diamonds.
The time is short, gentlemen, so I'II get straight to the point.
Operation Amsterdam has been given the highest possible priority.
The government considers it so important, they're placing a destroyer at your disposal.
It will take you to Ijmuiden.
That's the nearest port to Amsterdam.
Magnetic mines have been sown at all the harbor entrances... and German parachutists are established around three sides of The Hague.
A number of them have been killed already, in Amsterdam.
Many were wearing Dutch uniforms.
Fifth columnists are everywhere.
It can no Ionger be assumed... that a Dutch uniform contains a loyal Dutch soldier.
One final thing, gentlemen.
We know the German troops have been ordered to cut off Amsterdam by tomorrow.
incidentally... if you're caught... we cannot help you.
DiIIon.
Your job is to get the Amsterdam stocks.
My job is to bring you and the diamonds back safely.
And I want no dead heroes on this trip.
gentlemen, these documents state... that your journey is at the request of the British Government... and has the full approval of the netherlands Legation, here in London.
May I, for the benefit of both our peoples... wish you Godspeed and success to your mission.
-Going on holiday, Major?
-I've got another little job to do.
But don't worry, it won't interfere with our plans.
-shall I take the cases?
-No, thanks, I can manage.
Very well, sir.
If you'II follow me, gentlemen.
What do you suppose our guests are up to, sir?
I don't know.
DiIIon's easy enough to place.
But the two Dutchmen....
Can you see a light ahead, Number One?
Dead ahead, sir.
Let's hope it's the mole.
slow ahead, both.
Slow ahead, both, sir.
Steady as you go.
Steady as you go, sir.
The approach is mined.
Watch out for strays.
Are you going to take her in, sir?
It's worth a try.
-Port, 10.
-Port, 10, sir.
Steady as you go.
Steady as you go, sir.
It's too quiet.
-Stop both.
-Stop both, sir.
Take charge, Number One.
I'm going to see our guests off.
Aye, aye, sir.
AII ready, sir.
They'II drop more mines during the day.
I'II lie outside the outer harbor at 2000.
You should get a boat.
We'II manage.
It's 0600.
That gives you 1 4 hours.
If you don't turn up, I'II come back the same time tomorrow night.
Save the fuel.
If we're not here tonight, go back to england.
If you do not hurry up, they'II be back.
Thank you for a safe voyage.
They're up early.
See you at 8:00 tonight, sir.
careful!
Let's get out of here.
half ahead, both.
You did well.
Save your money for those who'II take it.
We've been paid already.
I don't understand you.
Last night, another British ship was here.
She took our Princess and her children to safety.
This makes us very happy.
We've been well paid.
-We're going back to england tonight.
-You'II want to be rowed out to the ship?
7:30.
-I'II be here.
-Good.
please, you must take them.
Look at this young girl.
-No.
-Look, please.
German parachutists.
You three!
Who are you?
What do you want?
We've just landed from a British destroyer.
Can you tell us where the port commander is?
How do I know you aren't parachutists or fifth columnists?
We have identification papers.
So had they.
We shoot the lot.
You understand?
Nobody can be trusted.
Your commander will understand.
Take us to him.
AII right.
But I place you under arrest.
You understand?
Now, get in front of me.
Toward the building with the steps.
Up!
These men are parachutists or fifth columnists.
The others had papers.
Maj. DiIIon, I am Bussemaker.
I know many of your family.
I watched your destroyer arrive.
I hoped she was going to land some troops.
I'm afraid we were the only passengers, sir.
We have to get to Amsterdam.
It's not very difficult to guess why you're here.
Do you mind if I add my little authority to these?
Pieces of paper can help on these occasions.
certainly.
-I say they are fifth columnists.
-Put your gun away.
They should be shot like the others.
Second wave.
It's like this all the time.
-You all right?
-Yes.
I see our spy-shooting friend's left us.
There have been thousands of them out there.
Everybody wants to get to england.
The trawlers are too few, and, each raid, we lose more.
could we take one of those cars on the quay?
help yourself.
They belong to the refugees.
I hope you find one that works.
We don't leave much to the enemy.
-Thank you.
-Not at all.
Good-bye.
Good luck.
Those are the lucky ones.
Bowerman was right about the mines.
Is that all you can say?
There's nothing we can do to help.
Come on.
One of them must work.
Smit!
Stop that car!
Leave me alone!
We need the car.
We must get into Amsterdam.
-What did you want to do that for?
-well?
-This young woman wants to take her life.
-Why did you stop me?
Because we need your car.
I'm a British officer.
These gentlemen are Dutch.
We came here in a British destroyer.
We were sent by your government and mine.
How do I know you tell the truth?
I belong to the firm of J.K. Smit, Amsterdam.
AII right.
How much is that worth?
It's quite pretty.
It's not worth much.
It has flaws, and the setting is poor.
Get in.
I'II take you.
Reverse.
No water.
I promised to take you.
I keep my word.
Damn that man!
Leave this to me.
AII right.
Let them through.
I work in a branch of the War Ministry in Amsterdam.
I have a pass, that's all.
We were lucky to find you.
Amsterdam, 84205.
Even the windmills have stopped turning.
How bad is the news?
Who knows?
Some say the Germans are being beaten back.
Others say they've already occupied Amsterdam.
There is no truth left in holland.
What's your name?
Anna.
What were you doing in Ijmuiden?
I was getting Joseph's parents off to england.
Who's Joseph?
Joseph's my fiancé.
He's a Jew.
He's away in the army.
He asked me to save his parents, if the Germans attacked.
I did.
I put them on a boat.
It was just a small boat.
One of the three....
You mean, the three fishing trawlers in the mine?
If I hadn't put them on that boat, they'd be still alive.
Who knows, then it might have been worse for them.
It's not your fault.
Thank you for trying to help.
They're wearing Dutch uniforms.
Think they're all right?
We won't stop to find out.
Keep going, Anna, fast.
Now, we'II never know.
well done!
It's strange to be back.
I can't believe the Germans are so near.
It's much too quiet.
What's that thing called?
How long since you were here, Major?
I'd almost forgotten they existed.
In holland, you can't celebrate Whitmonday without a pierement.
Even this Whitmonday.
Good luck!
-Do you want me to wait?
-please.
Perhaps you better come inside.
We may be some time.
-It's not safe to leave the car.
-As you will.
You're sure it's all right for you to stay with us?
It's all right.
It'II take my mind off other things.
If there's any trouble, toot the horn.
Promise?
-AII right.
-Don't run away.
-Mijnheer Jan.
-Mientje, is my father inside?
hello.
-Who is it?
-hello, Father.
Jan!
WaIter Keyser!
What are you doing here?
How did you get here?
Came on a British destroyer to collect all the diamonds we can.
-We don't want the Germans to get them.
-Of course.
Father, this is Maj. DiIIon.
He's in charge of the party.
This isn't just a British raid, sir.
We have the full approval of the Dutch Legation in London.
This will help, but it will not be easy.
Are you willing to help us, Father?
-What else did you expect?
-What you just said.
Now, we must make plans.
Coffee for our guests, please.
Yes, sir.
naturally, you will take all our remaining stocks back to england with you.
But I can only speak for myself, not for the other traders.
-Thank you.
-Everything all right?
I don't know.
That officer, he wants to know what we are up to.
Do you think he's a German?
A fifth columnist?
How do I know?
will you be much longer?
A little while, we still have some shopping to do.
Remember... toot the horn if there's any trouble.
Get hold of young Leyden, and between you... see that all our remaining stocks are packeted and properly numbered.
Yes, sir.
The Germans mustn't get our stocks.
What we are doing is right for holland, as well as the firm.
I understand, sir.
It's worse for the young ones.
They don't know what to expect.
That'II be SchiphoI.
-It must be the airport again.
-That's where waiter's mother lives.
Anna's getting nervous.
There's a Dutch officer been asking her questions.
We ought to be making a move.
How will you contact the other merchants?
Today is a holiday.
It's possible some of them may be at the club.
Do you think you could find room in one of your safes for my cases?
I think so, Major.
May I, please?
It's my gas mask.
-We shan't be long.
Don't leave the office.
-Yes, sir.
-What's the matter?
-The car's gone.
And the Lieutenant.
I hope Anna's not in any trouble.
I hope we're not in any trouble.
-I hope there's somebody inside.
-That's the Lieutenant's car.
Try it again.
It's Johan Smit.
Open the door, hurry.
Sorry to frighten you, Frederik.
-Mijnheer Jan, it's good to see you.
-Thank you.
-Any members here?
-A few, sir, in the clubroom.
We'II go up.
Don't let any strangers in.
You are worried about that Lieutenant outside, Major.
-He may be part of a reception committee.
-Let's hope you're wrong.
This is Jan Smit!
WaIter Keyser!
-Jan.
-donald!
How are you?
WaIter, this is a miracle.
gentlemen, I have something of importance to tell you.
My son and Mijnheer Keyser came over this morning with Maj. DiIIon.
They're here at the request of Mr. ChurchiII and the netherlands Legation in London.
They want to prevent our diamonds, particularly our industrial stocks... from falling into enemy hands.
Are you suggesting we send our diamond stocks to england for safekeeping?
Yes, gentlemen.
You must decide whether to send them to england with my son... or overland to Paris or switzerland.
The other alternative is to keep them here for the Germans.
How do we know the Germans will take the city?
Amsterdam will faII within a few hours.
Tonight, at the latest.
How do you propose returning to england?
Have you a plane?
Mr. ChurchiII has given them a destroyer.
That is the value he places on our diamonds.
This is a very grave issue, gentlemen.
I suggest we call all the board for a meeting at noon.
I needn't stress the urgency.
-We are agreed to call a board meeting.
-Good.
That Lieutenant has a disturbing habit of disappearing.
Do you think Anna's a traitor?
What do you think?
She's a Dutch girl in love with a Jewish soldier.
A girl who'd rather commit suicide than face the hurt in her fiancé's eyes.
It's hardly the role of a collaborator.
I suppose she was going to commit suicide.
WaIter Keyser...
Jan Smit...
Maj. DiIIon.
It's not difficult to guess what they're after.
You've done well.
-Thank you, colonel.
-I want you to get back.
Keep in touch with me, and don't worry about the Lieutenant.
I'II try and make some arrangements in the Smit area.
We must afford our guests every hospitality.
I'II have the outposts warned at Ijmuiden, ready for tonight.
What's the number of your car?
GZ-6231 .
Take great care.
Trust no one.
And don't do anything silly, Iike shooting yourself.
Is there any news of Joseph's unit?
It was overrun last night.
And Joseph?
casualty lists have stopped coming through.
Joseph's a brave man.
He'II be all right.
You'II see.
Sometimes people can be too brave, colonel.
Good luck.
gentlemen, this is an emergency meeting.
Mijnheer Smit.
You've all had time to speak with the Major, WaIter and my son.
You know why they're here, and why you are here.
Do you realize what you're asking us to do, Johan?
only too well.
What will you do with your stock?
I shall send every stone I possess to england.
If we give our diamonds to your son and his friends to take to London... how will they be covered?
What about insurance?
I have not insured my son.
Even in a destroyer, it wouId be a great risk.
surely it is safer overland to Paris.
holland may faII.
But it is inconceivable that the French army will be beaten.
gentlemen, the noise you can hear is the German army.
There is no safe overland route to Paris.
The only road out of Amsterdam leads to the sea...
-and it may be cut at any moment.
-What do you think, WaIter?
It's a question of faith... and courage.
I'II call this afternoon... and hand over my entire stocks.
unfortunately, many members have their stocks in the vaults.
Today is Whitmonday.
The vaults will be under time lock until tomorrow.
Then blow them out.
Isaac?
Johan, my friend... in the eyes of the Nazis, many of us here have already committed one crime... that of being a Jew.
Life under the occupation will be bad enough.
But if they discover that we have sent all our diamonds to england... we can expect no mercy.
If we give you our diamonds... we may be giving you our lives.
You must decide for yourselves.
Those who wish to follow Spier's example will find me in my office this afternoon.
You can't blame them, Father, for feeling as they do.
I don't blame them.
-More people about.
-More troops, you mean.
There she is, back, Major.
Where have you been?
I thought you deserted me.
No shopping?
Come inside, Anna.
I'II stay in the car.
If you don't get out, I'II shoot you.
I'II take that.
Why did you go away, Anna?
Come on, we're wasting time.
This wasn't in your bag this morning.
Where did you get it?
while you were being so sorry for me on the quay...
-did you search my bag?
-Time's running short.
I've a Iot to do here, before returning to Ijmuiden.
My dear, if you are a patriot, you have nothing to fear.
You are amongst friends.
tell the Major what he wants to know.
I don't like being threatened.
But you're the one who told us not to trust anyone.
Do you think I would help those who killed Joseph?
When did this happen?
Last night.
His unit was overrun.
He may still be alive.
probably a prisoner.
Who gave you the information?
I went to see col.
Jansen at the War Ministry.
I told you I work there.
-I went there to try to get help for you.
-Does he know why we're here?
He can guess.
-Did he give you this?
-Yes.
What about the soldiers in the street?
I told him about the Lieutenant... so they were sent in case of trouble.
The colonel also promised to warn the outposts at Ijmuiden... so that we can get through tonight.
Anna, you're wonderful.
Isn't she, Major?
Yes, she's done very well.
Very well.
We're all sorry about Joseph.
Thank you.
will you tell me what your plans are, Major?
I have friends in Amsterdam.
I've got some things to arrange.
Now?
-Taking your suitcases with you, of course.
-Yes.
I'II get them.
You staying with us, Anna?
I came back to help.
What do waiter and I do?
Sit here all day, waiting for the merchants to show up?
I want you both to visit the vaults.
Study the building, see what the chances are of getting in.
I feel happy about it now, don't you, WaIter?
I'II feel better when we fill the shopping bags.
Spier has promised to come.
I hope some of the others will, too.
This morning, I was hopeful.
But now....
Don't worry, Father.
You've done all you can.
-Who knows, by the time we return--
-I hope so, Jan.
We shall all be back by 4:30, sir.
Jan, take care of that girl.
Let's hope your colonel sent those men.
Drive to the center of the town.
You still don't trust me.
Better have your guns ready, just in case.
I was wrong about you.
I'm sorry.
would you have shot me?
Of course.
Now, drive to the VijzeIstraat.
Our soldiers have to dig them out.
The fifth columnists are everywhere.
These are the people who stay to fight.
There are many of us like that.
I'm glad you feel that way now.
Where to now, Major?
flower Market, please.
They're getting closer.
You're sure you don't want us to come with you?
No, thanks.
-I'II see you at 4:30.
-Right.
Orange rose.
-Good-bye, Anna.
-Good luck, Major.
Twenty cents, please.
Thank you.
Your House of Orange looks very strong.
I'm DiIIon.
alex is expecting me.
What's wrong?
We have company.
Can you lose him?
I think so.
I'II drop you around the corner, in the square.
Then I'II drive on, and come back in 20 minutes.
will you be all right?
Don't worry, I know Amsterdam.
She'II be all right.
Anna's a very remarkable young woman.
I don't like the look of that.
There's nothing much we can do now.
I think we'II be safer if we wait in the café.
I can manage now.
You must go home.
There's nothing more you can do.
will you be all right, sir?
Thank you.
I'm expecting a few friends, that's all.
Leave the outer door open.
See that she gets safely home.
We'd better wait outside for Anna.
We don't want to miss her.
They say a Iot of the German parachutists are mere boys.
When captured, they cry for their mothers.
In WaaIhaven they dropped some, disguised as nuns.
This morning, I saw some police beating up two nuns.
The only trouble was they were real nuns.
That's all right.
Lock it.
Sorry.
aims please, gentlemen.
Don't forget the pierement.
Keep to the rear of the organ.
Stop!
Come back!
Drive on, anywhere.
-What's funny?
-My father asked me to look after you.
The Major was right about the reception committee.
They're early.
Shopping bag's still empty.
The Lieutenant wouldn't know that.
He may try again.
I think it's a good idea if we keep away from the office for a while.
WaIter, how would you Iike to pay a visit to your mother?
Come right through, please.
-Are you alone?
-Yes.
I see you have already had visitors.
Just one.
Spier.
The others are mine.
I would Iike to add mine to those... but I must make up my mind.
It's not easy, you know.
My wife's not well.
Her lungs are bad.
With proper treatment, the doctor thinks she might stand a chance.
I do not try to bribe, you understand, Johan.
If they send her to a labor camp, it will kill her.
I'm frightened, but only for my wife.
They separate you, you know.
What are you trying to say, my friend?
I'II give you all my diamonds.
AII I ask in exchange is that the British destroyer... takes Miriam to england.
impossible.
The British Captain is under naval orders.
He'd have to refuse.
Don't you see?
If he took one passenger, he'd have to take a thousand.
I thought I'd try.
You understand?
I must think.
I'II speak to Miriam.
-Have they been, Father?
-Just Spier.
They're on the desk.
-Who's this?
-His name's WiIIem.
His parents were neighbors of my mother's.
They were killed in an air raid this morning.
My mother found him.
He wants to get to EngIand--
The Lieutenant had a go at us this afternoon.
Did he?
Perhaps he thought you were trying to leave.
-Did you have any luck at the bank?
-No, it's like a fortress.
There's no caretaker.
Did you get rid of the suitcases?
Yes, they were delivered.
At least we've got something to take back.
Such a Iong way for so little.
You mustn't blame yourself, Father.
while you're waiting, you might like to eat.
There's some food in my room.
It doesn't look as though they're coming.
I owe you all an apology.
This morning, when you arrived, I was too optimistic.
-Your friends have arrived, Father.
-Let's hope they've decided well.
It's all right.
They're not leaving yet.
Come in, gentlemen.
We know we're late, we apologize.
But it wasn't easy to make up our minds.
What have you decided?
We have brought you our diamonds.
They must go to england.
I don't know what to say.
You've risked your lives by coming here today.
You risked them again by the decision you made.
But it's the right one.
Miriam thinks these diamonds ought to go to england.
I'II give you all receipts, before you leave.
No receipts, please.
It would incriminate everybody.
As you see, very few of us came.
The others have their stocks under time lock, in the vaults.
There was no point in their coming.
Instead, they sent a message.
They, too, would Iike their stocks to go to england.
Good-bye, gentlemen.
Good-bye.
This is better.
Thank you, sir.
Jan, from now on, the head office of the family firm will be in London.
You will be in charge.
I suppose there's no point in asking you to leave Amsterdam?
-I'm part of holland.
-Major, patrol has been changed.
The flashes are different.
Can you check?
Amsterdam, 63505, please.
col.
Jansen, this is Anna.
please, listen carefully.
Have you just replaced those troops you sent?
I thought not.
Their flashes are different.
He will try and send help.
He wants 15 minutes.
We can manage that.
Thank you.
colonel... have you any news of Joseph?
I understand.
Thank you.
Don't worry, the colonel won't let you down.
-Your reception committee, Major?
-Looks like it.
Any earlier, they could have grabbed the diamonds from the merchants.
-The Lieutenant's not in the street.
-Maybe he's gathering more friends.
It seems a pity to leave the other diamonds in the vaults.
Can you blow a safe?
No.
Can your friends?
Yes, they may be able to help.
Dead?
-will you forget about the bank?
-No.
The Vredenburg is north of the flower Market.
How long will it take you to get there without the car?
-Ten, twelve minutes.
-Right.
At the Rembrandt Pottery Works, ask for alex.
tell him I want him to get inside those vaults.
tell him it might be a big party.
He'II understand.
I see.
You may be searched by the soldiers.
You better hand over your Ministry pass.
Are you mad, sending a woman?
She won't make the corner.
Send one of us.
We may have to fight for it.
I'II need you and waiter.
But it doesn't make sense.
It's too risky.
We can visit alex after we leave in the car.
We're trying to beat the clock and the Germans.
Every second counts.
I'II give your colonel till 5:30.
Then I shall make a break for it.
And with any luck, we'II see you and alex at the bank.
Major, you have no right to make her go.
She's not one of us.
Nobody's making me go.
please be careful.
They've stopped her.
Look at him pawing her.
-Don't be a fool!
Stay here.
-How do you think she feels?
I'm not concerned with feelings, only with results.
They've let her go.
-Sorry, Major.
-We leave at 5:30, sharp.
Time's up.
We'II go without the colonel.
-Good-bye, sir.
-Good-bye, Major.
-Good-bye, Johan.
-WaIter.
You're going without me.
You promised you'd ask.
Don't leave me, please.
please, I'II grow.
I couId be a soldier, I couId fight for england.
I'II do anything, please.
please, Mijnheer Keyser.
Better let him come with us.
He might be able to find a boat at Ijmuiden.
-Good-bye, Father.
-Jan.
I've got something for you.
These diamonds belong to you.
I got them for you when you were a little boy.
Take them, please.
Be careful.
I couldn't leave this.
You guard that with your life, WaIter.
Turn her round.
Take it easy till we find out what the form is.
There are too many of them.
Take your pick, Major.
Now, Jan, quick!
The colonel cut that pretty close.
You three all right?
You were right, it is a fortress.
There's the bell.
-Haven't you done enough for one day?
-This job's urgent.
-Is there a caretaker?
-No.
That bell can only be stopped from inside.
When it goes off, it'II wake the dead.
-We'II have to risk it.
-The organ's still here.
That'II make enough noise to drown all the bells.
-Get it, Jan, will you?
-WiIIem.
Come on.
Are you ready with that thing yet?
-You know how it works?
-Yes.
Get it going.
Make it faster.
Stand back.
Keep going.
If there's any trouble, change the tune.
You wait in the bank.
I'd rather wait by the car, in case you want to leave in a hurry.
Okay.
How long?
-It'II take time, I'm afraid.
-30 minutes, maybe more.
First, Peter has to play with the combination dials.
Then, the time lock must be blown.
Get back, under the stairs.
Listen.
-The time lock's still holding.
-will it free itself?
Can't tell with these things.
Might be minutes or hours.
-Let's try another charge.
-There's no time.
We'II give it five minutes.
It's time, Major.
Thanks for trying.
She's gone.
Thanks, Peter.
Let's finish the shopping.
Quiet, all of you.
-The tune's changed.
-What do you mean?
It's WiIIem's signal that something's wrong.
Take alex and the others, and see what the trouble is.
We'II follow.
I'd hate to leave anything, now that we've got this far.
WiIIem, get down!
-Who is he?
-The Lieutenant.
-How about him?
-Is he all right?
His leg.
It's nothing serious.
-How many of them out there?
-About 20.
alex, I've got to leave here with my friends, now.
We'II cover you.
You should have no trouble.
Don't worry, we'II take care of him.
What's your other name, WiIIem?
Lubke.
I'II remember that.
-AII ready?
-Yes.
Wait till I give the signal.
You won't be leaving for a while, Major.
There's another truck full of them.
-How many charges to move it?
-Four.
-String them together.
Short fuse.
-Rudi.
-I'II see to the truck for you.
-That's my job.
It's also your job to see the diamonds get through.
The other side of the road will give you more cover.
Use the empty shop.
Once you've lit it, get rid of it.
We'II help you from this side.
You, take the second window.
Stay here.
kill them.
Come on.
-What the devil have you been doing?
-The Lieutenant paid us a visit.
Twenty minutes, Anna.
will you make it?
If nothing holds us up.
Get through them.
Get out of the way!
Keep going.
Stop her.
Come on.
Where are the tools?
Under the bonnet.
Thanks.
Marieke!
No, Anna!
That ship won't wait.
Let's move.
-Your names?
-Maj.
DiIIon.
-Jan Smit.
-WaIter Keyser.
What is the number of this car?
GZ-6231 .
col.
Jansen's compliments.
We are to see you safely through to the harbor.
Thank you, Captain.
Get out of the way!
We made good time.
Ask her, Jan, while I go and find our boatman.
I'II come with you.
What did the Major mean?
We want you to come to england.
Without you, we couldn't have managed.
You risked everything to help us.
Dear, kind Jan.
What can I say?
-It would be so easy to say yes.
-Why don't you?
AII I know is that I must stay here.
This is where I can help.
holland will need all the help she can get.
But you've done enough already.
What do you want to give?
Your life?
If necessary.
You know... that we all love you.
will you look for Joseph?
If he's alive somewhere...
I shall find him somehow.
I shall never forget us, Jan.
bless you.
Did you find him?
Yes, he kept his promise.
But he was dead.
Air raid.
-What about the boat?
-Gone.
Let's try the other end of the quay, we might find one of the harbor tugs.
They're usually over there.
Is she coming with us?
I have already explained.
Sure you won't change your mind?
believe me, I'm very grateful... but I can't.
We have a Iot to thank you for.
-Good-bye.
-Good-bye.
Don't be angry.
I want you to have this.
It's from all of us.
You've all been very kind to me.
May I take this with me?
It will wilt before the morning.
But holland will grow strong again.
We're going to requisition your tug.
It's a matter of military urgency.
I'm not taking this old tub out again tonight for anyone, mister.
We haven't got time to argue.
We're meeting a British destroyer outside the harbor at 8:00.
When you find Joseph, tell him... that I'm coming back to steal his best girl.
May God see you safely all back home.
Cast off, WaIter.
And you.
Now, tug master, the destroyer.
That's for your trouble, Skipper.
What the devil's that?
The Batavia shell oil dumps, in Amsterdam.
You've had a busy day, Major.
I think we've all had a busy day.
including Anna.
She's a brave woman.
There'II be many Annas in holland before it's all over.
THE TIGER OF ESCHNAPUR
What's wrong?
It's the hour of the tiger.
A man eater?
A demon, a thing of evil.
He's attacked over two dozen people.
Don't.
Stop it.
Which of us shall it be?
Don't.
Leave me alone.
Too good for us, are you?
Give me the pail.
Give it to me!
Don't bother with the water.
Thank you, sahib.
Hey, what are you doing with my toothpaste?
Give it to me!
It doesn't taste good.
Come on now.
That's better.
Good evening.
My name is Harald Berger.
I'm going to Eschnapur to work on some building projects... hospitals, schools and so on.
I want to thank you, sahib.
You protected my servant Bharani from the impudent soldiers.
She just wanted some water for the frangipani blossoms.
May the gods give you a bowl of water at an hour of great thirst.
Good night.
The tiger must be...
They say the tiger has eaten many people.
If you're going to Eschnapur, it's wise to go together.
It's still a day's journey from here.
Rarely have I seen so strong a man.
A six man escort.
Quite an honor for a dancer.
It's because of the tiger.
They say it has a murderer's spirit.
Here they come!
We'll water the horses.
It's the last waterhole.
Good.
Thank you.
Bharani, go and tell the ox drivers to hurry.
Yes, mistress.
Are you hurt?
It was a miracle, sahib.
Tigers are scared of fire.
It was a miracle.
I saw two tigers fighting each other.
They were fighting over me.
For my life.
You know, sahib, you're part of India now.
And the other tiger?
The other tiger is the other India.
The Maharani's death has affected Chandra strangely.
Is he still mourning her?
I don't think so.
He should have cared for my sister better.
What's this about a dancer from the South?
He saw her in the temple of Benares.
He's been searching for her.
The temple priests think the Prince's thoughts are too often in foreign worlds since he went to Europe.
He has his own ideas on how to serve his people.
I don't like Chandra's Western ideas.
Do you, Ramigani?
I do not rule Eschnapur, Prince Padhu.
I am just my brother's servant.
He is a good prince but many people think it was wrong to pass you over in the succession.
You are older.
Bhowana is right.
The priests are upset that Prince Chandra has asked the Europeans here.
My brother in law is in charge of the project.
He's joining me later.
Have you been to Europe?
Your gods are not worshipped through dance.
I would be out of place.
I'd like to see you dance.
Foreigners are not allowed in our temples.
How about outside the temple?
I'm the Maharaja's guest.
The guards at the city gates report the arrival of the foreigner.
I'd hoped that as a guest of the Maharaja you'd be in the palace near me.
I shall always think of you with gratitude, sahib.
Gratitude!
I hope you'll remember me for something other than a burning branch and a tiger.
May I visit you?
This is an inn, sahib.
I'm sure it's open to the Maharaja's special guests.
Mem sahib.
Welcome to Eschnapur.
Did the Maharaja send you?
No.
Prince Ramigani, the Prince's brother, sent me to escort you.
Ramigani,
I was waiting for other guests.
This is new to me, Chandra.
Didn't you say that Mr. Rhode should stay in Calcutta until the preparations were complete?
Welcome to Eschnapur.
Thank you.
This reception is a great honor for a man who can only do his best.
That is a great deal.
In Europe I saw what you and Mr. Rhode have built.
Your people say "Make yourself at home."
I doubt that you could here.
You'd need an Indian soul.
So I shall say "May you be happy in Eschnapur."
Thank you, Your Highness.
You'll be living and working here for a long time.
Arrange everything as you wish.
There can be no carpets on account of the cobras.
Yes, you're in India now.
I hope you'll feel comfortable here.
This is your workroom.
Are the models in there?
I think so.
Yes, it's the models.
When can I show them to you?
There's plenty of time.
For a project like this?
What is time in the lifespan of the world?
What is an hour in the stream of eternity?
I'm European, Your Highness.
We count in hours.
You must be tired, Mr. Berger.
Good night.
Good night, Your Highness.
A pity to damage this beautiful model.
I was tempted to open the crates though it would have been improper.
I could have closed them without a mark.
I learned that in Europe.
Thank you, Mr...
Asagara, sahib.
I've been asked to assist you.
I studied architecture in Berlin and Paris.
His Highness thinks I may be of use.
I'm delighted.
Your support will be invaluable.
I can't begin properly until Mr. Rhode arrives.
His Highness is worried about the condition of the palace.
The foundations have been shifting.
The palace was built on top of old Mogul passages.
Water has come in and the walls have cracks.
We'll inspect it tomorrow.
Today I want to see the town.
Stop.
The tabla sets the tempo, not you.
Two tabla beats and then you come in...
The tabla speeds up and you follow the tempo.
May I?
At first just strum, then play a double stop.
So you don't go against the rhythm.
Let's try again.
One, two, three, four.
One... two... three... four.
Good.
Mistress, the foreign sahib is here to see you.
That's enough for today.
Thank you.
Show him in, Bharani.
Yes.
Good morning.
I wanted to see where you're staying.
Did you sleep well?
How did you find me so quickly?
I noted every street, house and stone between here and the palace.
You know that tune?
My father used to sing it.
There used to be words too... but I've forgotten them.
It's an Irish folksong.
The lasses who go to the well...
Only think of Pat
The lasses who stand at the well
And see themselves reflected there
Only wait for Pat
Pat Murphy lies in a watery grave
And yearning is in vain
The lasses who go to the shore
And keep a watch for distant sails
Only hope for him
Sahib, I've found the words again.
But it's an Irish folksong.
Seetha, who was your father?
My origins are obscure and shadowy like the nights of the moon goddess.
I was very young when my parents died.
The priests raised me.
Did your father have a pale face like mine?
I can't remember his face.
I was very ill.
We were all ill.
Vultures circled over the houses and jackals came to the doors.
A lot of people died then.
My parents too.
One second.
Wait.
This is all I have left.
It belonged to my father.
It's a European instrument.
For Joe from Frank.
Cambridge, 1800 and...
I can't read it.
Joe?
Joe...
There was a man who used to visit us.
He had red hair and a deep voice.
I was scared of him.
Go on.
He called my father Joe.
Your father was European.
Perhaps.
See for yourself...
Look at your face.
Is that an Indian face?
Don't be afraid.
It was a stone thrown over the wall, or a fish jumping.
A stone, a fish, or the hand of God...
This is India.
Go now.
And take care.
Why isn't the dancer staying here?
The festival starts tonight.
It wasn't worth it.
I hope she'll stay longer.
Are those the soldiers who fled?
Yes, they've been whipped as you ordered.
I wish to speak to you, Chandra.
I care greatly about who takes the Maharani's place.
So do I.
My sister loved you very much.
Speak out, Padhu.
After she died, you spent time in Europe.
I don't want you to bring foreign ways to Eschnapur.
I don't need your advice, Padhu.
Europe did you no good.
You no longer know what is good for your people.
What is to be done with the soldiers, Chandra?
Set them free.
They can thank the gods the foreigner saved Seetha from the tiger.
His Highness.
Mr. Berger, I've only just heard about... your adventure on the way here.
You're very brave, Mr. Berger.
It was nothing.
I acted instinctively.
Tigers fear fire.
An escort of six soldiers fled.
Their horses were frightened.
Will you take this ring as a token of my gratitude?
Your Highness...
So precious a jewel?
The life of this woman is the most precious thing in all India.
What is an emerald in comparison?
Mr. Berger, you have won a friend.
I can think of nothing that could destroy our friendship.
Bharani, he can scare a man eating tiger with only a branch.
A burning branch, mistress.
The flame was tiny.
No higher than this...
What tricks our memory plays.
I thought it was so high...
So you're the one chosen to dance in the temple?
I am but a humble dancer.
The Maharaja cannot be pleased with me to place such a task on my frail shoulders.
Prince Chandra may expect more of you.
If you are unsure if your path leads you to the right goal ask the goddess or her servants.
How much?
8 meters 40.
Eight forty.
27 degrees.
North northwest.
Asagara!
The ladder.
And the torch.
How old is all this, Asagara?
It's hard to say.
It probably dates back to the first Mogul Emperor.
There's a lot of water.
We must be very close to the lake.
A secret passage.
How mysterious.
Give me a new torch.
We only have two left.
Scared?
Yes, but it doesn't matter.
We're right next to the temple.
Does a passage connect the palace and the temple?
Sahib...
If a European enters the temple it spells his death.
I'm not going to enter the temple but we must chart these underground passages.
Sahib!
Please.
All right, you win.
I don't want to upset you.
Investigate that passage.
I'll go down this one.
Asagara!
Asagara, who are those creatures?
They are lepers.
Haven't you noticed there are no sick in Eschnapur?
It's to stop them infecting others.
You leave the sick to rot in that hole?
Weren't you brought here to build hospitals?
And the dead guard?
Isn't it more merciful to have a dead man watch over the dying?
I saw the white sahib in the temple.
How could that be?
He stood high above everyone else.
And then the goddess' face darkened.
And when I looked up at him again, he'd gone.
Your thoughts dwell too much on him.
Perhaps.
But it is possible that he was there and the goddess was protecting him.
A stranger who had invaded our holy temple?
No, mistress.
Her face darkened in anger.
My brother the Maharaja is pleased with you.
Your dance gladdened his lonely heart.
It is his wish that you move to the palace so you can dance for him.
A palanquin is waiting.
Your Highness...
We have a few humble possessions at the inn...
I've already had them taken to the palace.
She's left?
I told you, sahib.
For Madras?
Or Calcutta?
She must have said where.
Where do birds fly?
Where does the wind blow?
Mistress...
It's like a dream.
Do you think it's pure gold, mistress?
I hope you'll feel at home here, Seetha.
Your Highness...
Is this not a mirror?
How lucky he is.
Seetha, there is no cage for you in Eschnapur.
And this is not a chain...
It is but a gift from a man hoping for a woman's love.
You aren't here by chance.
I saw you dance in the Temple of Benares and I had them look for you.
I won't rush anything.
Haste is a European vice.
Isn't it better to ask a woman than to order her?
Is love not richer coming from the heart, born of affection and respect?
I could fill this room with pearls, emeralds and rubies but all that would be nothing compared to how I feel.
So I lay the most precious gift of all at your feet... my heart.
One day we will all end up dependent on the foreigners.
It is only my deep concern for Eschnapur which makes me raise these matters.
Isn't it because you want the throne, Ramigani?
I have long known Prince Ramigani.
His deep love for his brother...
I don't approve of stabbing a prince in the back.
What would you do, Prince?
It is your business, not mine.
He gave the dancer the Maharani's jewels... the emerald necklace, which she loved so much.
Perhaps she'll reach for her crown soon too.
Defend your dead sister's honor.
Is she to be supplanted by a dancer?
Let us not speak with the tongues of jackals.
There is much discontent in Eschnapur.
Chandra has sent for his foreign devils.
Ramigani wants Chandra's throne.
All that is none of my business.
No, Ramigani.
Do not count on the lances of my soldiers.
If Chandra should ever dare to tarnish the memory of the Maharani... then it will be my business.
Prince Padhu is leaving Eschnapur, sahib.
Don't call me "sahib".
We're colleagues.
We both studied in Europe.
Thank you, Mr. Berger.
That's very kind.
Imagine missing the tiger hunt, Padhu.
You're growing old.
You're avoiding danger.
You think you're getting any younger?
You're ignoring the danger.
The festival is over.
The flowers picked for my arrival have wilted.
Follow on.
The German engineer should be here with us but he said he was too busy.
We're both grateful to him for saving your life.
He's a very brave man.
I'm glad he's my friend.
Would you like to travel, Seetha?
To Europe, perhaps?
Europe...
Your Highness...
The tiger is in the trap.
Seetha...
before sunrise tomorrow the tiger which terrified you will be laid at your feet.
Europe...
The lasses who stand at the shore...
And keep a watch for distant sails...
Only hope for him.
Your horses are fast but they must be spared.
We've ridden for 14 hours, often through water.
The shikaris will find us.
They'd need to fly to catch us.
Chandra is crazed with love.
I'm going to teach him a lesson.
You think he'll still want you to take my sister's place when I send you back because you're not even good enough for my soldiers?
The horses need at least an hour's rest.
I must have some fun out of this.
Yakmis and Palawar, come here and fight for her.
My best soldiers are fighting for your favors.
Don't you want to watch?
Take her.
Go on.
You must understand.
It was just...
Over there lives a holy man who can see into the future.
I want to consult him.
About the future, Your Highness?
I owe you my life.
It belongs to you.
I don't want your life.
I want your love.
What could the gods tell you, Prince Chandra?
I have known you for so short a while.
Perhaps you're right.
What do the gods know of two people's hearts?
Bharani!
I've been looking for you...
Take me to her.
It's dangerous here.
Follow me.
The rift between the Maharaja and Padhu suits me well but it's not enough.
Only if the dancer is crowned, has Chandra lost.
What can we do?
I can see it... outraged soldiers and priests, the gods filled with fury and the mob angrily tearing down the walls.
It will take a while, but we will get what we want.
Bharani?
She has been crying.
She's worried about you.
I'll take you to her.
Seetha.
At last...
You shouldn't have come here.
You don't want me to be in danger and I don't want you to be in danger.
I've been looking for you.
I had to see you.
And now you've found me.
I want to know what you are.
A guest?
The Maharaja's mistress?
A prisoner?
I owe gratitude to the Prince.
He saved my life.
I know, but only because I...
Sorry.
What right has he to ask more than me?
Chandra saved me from more than death.
He doesn't demand.
He asks.
What will you reply?
Sahib Berger...
I am Indian.
You're half European.
Listen to what I'm saying.
For foreigners India is like an intoxicating drink but when they leave India they return to sober reality.
It's like a magic spell that quickly wears off.
Mistress!
It's getting late.
Go now and be patient.
My thoughts are with you.
I'll pray to the gods for you every day at sunset.
If someone picked your most precious bloom how would you punish them?
Speak plainly.
At night the white sahib crosses the lake to see the dancer from the South.
You're lying.
Your Highness... may your sword and the wrath of the gods strike me if I lie.
Who saw them?
The goddess has many eyes watching over your happiness and that of Eschnapur.
Morning Asagara.
Good morning.
Here's the letter.
Mr. Rhode will want to know the details so I need you as messenger.
I want to hold a banquet.
In honor of Seetha and the German engineer.
You pay them a high honor.
Are you implying they're not worthy?
How could I?
Seetha brought a servant to Eschnapur.
I'd like to ask her a few questions.
But it can wait until after the banquet.
That meddlesome priest has been talking.
He's a valuable ally.
He's threatening my plans.
The dancer must not fall from grace with Chandra.
I must prevent my brother from questioning the servant about the friendship between the foreigner and the temple dancer.
Mr. Asagara, what has happened?
The lady Mr. Berger saved from the tiger is a... a special guest of the Maharaja's.
Mr. Berger won His Highness' friendship.
He mustn't lose it.
What is the relationship between my brother and this woman?
He entered the inner temple to see her.
I've not been here long.
Is that very bad?
Mrs. Rhode, Eschnapur is not Calcutta.
One mustn't anger the gods or the Prince.
This doesn't sound good, Mr. Asagara.
I still have a few things to do here but I think we'd better leave today.
I'm sorry I'm late.
We had problems at the building site.
In Eschnapur you must always expect surprises, Mr. Berger.
This is the heart of India.
Ah yes, you know each other.
Of course.
You know each other very well.
I haven't forgotten your feat with the tiger.
You mustn't exaggerate.
I was lucky.
May luck never desert you.
You've arrived just in time to see the fakir.
The magic rope.
Come down.
Come back.
Come down, I tell you.
You won't escape.
Come on, then.
I'll teach you to obey.
Catch me if you can.
I'll get you.
Come on, then.
Just you wait.
Come back, I tell you.
Have you seen that before?
I've heard of this trick.
It must take years of practice.
Perhaps it's not a trick.
Perhaps it's an illusion or a suggestion of the mind.
I'm not easily taken in by such things.
Really?
Gowardan...
The white sahib doubts the power of the yoga which gave Gowadan magical skills.
Bharani is slim and supple.
She won't find it unpleasant in the basket.
Come here.
Your Highness, no...
Must I?
I'll speak on your behalf.
I beg of you, Your Highness...
Spare my servant Bharani.
She's terrified.
I don't need any proof.
However it was done, it was magnificent.
Why scare her unnecessarily?
What happens in Eschnapur without my will prevailing?
Nothing.
But servants must obey my brother.
Go.
Spare her.
Prince Ramigani is only doing this for me...
You're European, Mr. Berger.
Your concern for servants is exaggerated.
Ramigani.
Gowardan.
Sorry, Your Highness.
The boy has taken the rope.
I'll run and fetch it.
The bungler!
Ramigani.
Your Highness, Bharani is dead.
Fetch the fakir.
This is a bad start to a banquet.
I'm sorry...
Instead of happiness you feel pain and sorrow.
You'll wish to withdraw.
The women's quarters are at your disposal.
Didn't you say only your will prevailed?
I already said it...
I'm sorry.
Your Highness, this was murder.
I hope you had no part in it.
Mr. Berger...
I'm glad you think so highly of Indian hospitality that you rely on it so completely.
Good night.
The courtyard, the staircase up...
The women's courtyard, more stairs...
The women's quarters.
The fakir has vanished.
My best men are looking for him.
He won't get away.
Ramigani, remove the guard from the women's quarters.
I want to know for sure.
That's not all...
Seetha, we must leave Eschnapur.
Bharani...
You mustn't dwell on it.
Maybe it was an accident.
It was murder.
We must get out of Eschnapur, and India.
Highness.
You must come away with me, Seetha.
Prince Chandra rules from the hills to the sea.
Every passage of this palace, every door and gate is guarded.
There's an underground passage out of here.
Meet me in the temple at dusk.
I'm very frightened.
But I want to go with you.
There he is.
It was a tiger which won you my friendship.
A tiger shall tear you from my heart.
You've robbed and betrayed me.
I don't want to be a murderer.
Fight for your life!
The man eaters!
Raise the gate!
You have from sunrise to sunset to leave Eschnapur.
May the wind cover your trail as fast as your betrayal ruined our friendship.
The foreigner has gone into town.
Shouldn't we send someone after him...
No.
He's free to go.
Never say his name in my presence again.
The dancer asked if she might go to the temple to pray.
Have guards accompany her to the door.
Her fate is still undecided.
But I won't stop her talking to the goddess.
Seetha!
Come on, we must be quick.
There's a shikari uniform.
Put it on quickly.
We have an hour's start.
Chandra will follow us.
I'll hide our trail.
We have good horses.
The dog!
The treacherous dog!
I told you not to let him go.
I offered to...
Enough!
You spoke out for her.
You said she should go to the temple.
Be just.
She had guards.
I had the doors watched too.
No one saw her leave the temple.
I know their horses.
You talk like an idiot.
Listen, take the hunters who can follow a tiger's trail.
Take my fastest horsemen.
Just bring her back...
alive.
The German's head will do.
If you fail, Ramigani, you will pay the price.
All visitors to Eschnapur are checked thoroughly but you and Mr. Rhode, as special guests, won't wait long.
Tonight Prince Chandra will give a banquet in your honor.
I'm looking forward to seeing my brother.
I am too.
See, we can enter now.
My brother Chandra did not realize you would honor us so soon.
We set out earlier than planned.
I'm sorry that no rooms have been prepared for you.
If meanwhile you could use Mr. Berger's rooms yours will be ready tomorrow.
Affairs of state detain Prince Chandra.
Where's my brother?
It's strange he isn't here to meet us.
He didn't know of your arrival.
He's on a tiger hunt.
My brother's gone hunting?
That's a new passion.
India awakens many a passion.
I bid you good night.
My brother will look after you tomorrow.
I am going on a journey.
I hope, however, that it won't be very long.
How cold the nights can be in India.
We must go on, Seetha.
We can't light a fire.
They'd see it from afar.
It doesn't matter.
The sun will soon be up.
Stop.
Shikaris, look for their trail.
We mustn't rest.
Not in the cool of the morning.
Look here.
Tracks.
One horse...
Two horses.
Tell Prince Ramigani we've found the trail.
My horse needs a rest.
We must go on.
It can't.
Let me see.
Nothing we can do.
It's lame.
We'll have to walk if we want to reach the caravan route.
Come down.
Take my horse.
Two half full waterbags for one horse and two people.
Come on.
Dismount, Seetha.
Poor animal.
What should we do?
It's no good.
Please...
Go over there.
Are you very tired?
I'd like to propose the following for the first phase...
I'm going to disappoint you.
I haven't changed my mind but this must wait for a while.
I want you first to build...
a tomb.
A tomb?
Such as the world has never seen before.
Made from purest marble, the most precious jewels... jade, alabaster, turquoise, coral, emeralds and rubies.
It will be the tomb of my beloved.
I've lost the woman... who was very close to my heart.
Excuse me, Highness, but...
I thought the Maharani died some years ago.
I'm not talking of the Maharani.
Please accept my condolences for the loss of someone who loved you dearly.
Who said that the woman of whom I spoke loved me?
And if I lost her, must she be dead?
Then... she's still alive?
Yes.
You're building a tomb for a living person?
One day she will be dead.
To be precise, she'll die when the tomb is complete.
I must have misunderstood you.
May I have an explanation?
How can you explain that a woman who was wrapped in love like a golden cloak cast my love aside...
and tossed it to a dog?
To a man who betrayed his friend?
You don't want a tomb, Your Highness.
You want an execution site.
There's nothing about this in my contract.
I'm leaving.
You can't leave Eschnapur without my permission and my protection.
You will build the tomb, Mr. Rhode.
And I shall bury my love in that tomb.
Name your price.
Go as high as you like.
Just start work straight away.
For the first time in my life
I'm experiencing your European impatience.
Seetha!
THE MIRACULOUS RESCUE OF THE TWO LOVERS
CAN BE SEEN IN THE SEQUEL TO THIS FILM...
THE INDIAN TOMB
EVEN MORE EXCITING
EVEN MORE POWERFUL
EVEN MORE STUPENDOUS
What's wrong?
It's the hour of the tiger.
A man eater?
A demon, a thing of evil.
He's attacked over two dozen people.
Don't.
Stop it.
Which of us shall it be?
Don't.
Leave me alone.
Too good for us, are you?
Give me the pail.
Give it to me!
Don't bother with the water.
Thank you, sahib.
Hey, what are you doing with my toothpaste?
Give it to me!
It doesn't taste good.
Come on now.
That's better.
Good evening.
My name is Harald Berger.
I'm going to Eschnapur to work on some building projects... hospitals, schools and so on.
I want to thank you, sahib.
You protected my servant Bharani from the impudent soldiers.
She just wanted some water for the frangipani blossoms.
May the gods give you a bowl of water at an hour of great thirst.
Good night.
The tiger must be...
They say the tiger has eaten many people.
If you're going to Eschnapur, it's wise to go together.
It's still a day's journey from here.
Rarely have I seen so strong a man.
A six man escort.
Quite an honor for a dancer.
It's because of the tiger.
They say it has a murderer's spirit.
Here they come!
We'll water the horses.
It's the last waterhole.
Good.
Thank you.
Bharani, go and tell the ox drivers to hurry.
Yes, mistress.
Are you hurt?
It was a miracle, sahib.
Tigers are scared of fire.
It was a miracle.
I saw two tigers fighting each other.
They were fighting over me.
For my life.
You know, sahib, you're part of India now.
And the other tiger?
The other tiger is the other India.
The Maharani's death has affected Chandra strangely.
Is he still mourning her?
I don't think so.
He should have cared for my sister better.
What's this about a dancer from the South?
He saw her in the temple of Benares.
He's been searching for her.
The temple priests think the Prince's thoughts are too often in foreign worlds since he went to Europe.
He has his own ideas on how to serve his people.
I don't like Chandra's Western ideas.
Do you, Ramigani?
I do not rule Eschnapur, Prince Padhu.
I am just my brother's servant.
He is a good prince but many people think it was wrong to pass you over in the succession.
You are older.
Bhowana is right.
The priests are upset that Prince Chandra has asked the Europeans here.
My brother in law is in charge of the project.
He's joining me later.
Have you been to Europe?
Your gods are not worshipped through dance.
I would be out of place.
I'd like to see you dance.
Foreigners are not allowed in our temples.
How about outside the temple?
I'm the Maharaja's guest.
The guards at the city gates report the arrival of the foreigner.
I'd hoped that as a guest of the Maharaja you'd be in the palace near me.
I shall always think of you with gratitude, sahib.
Gratitude!
I hope you'll remember me for something other than a burning branch and a tiger.
May I visit you?
This is an inn, sahib.
I'm sure it's open to the Maharaja's special guests.
Mem sahib.
Welcome to Eschnapur.
Did the Maharaja send you?
No.
Prince Ramigani, the Prince's brother, sent me to escort you.
Ramigani,
I was waiting for other guests.
This is new to me, Chandra.
Didn't you say that Mr. Rhode should stay in Calcutta until the preparations were complete?
Welcome to Eschnapur.
Thank you.
This reception is a great honor for a man who can only do his best.
That is a great deal.
In Europe I saw what you and Mr. Rhode have built.
Your people say "Make yourself at home. "
I doubt that you could here.
You'd need an Indian soul.
So I shall say "May you be happy in Eschnapur. "
Thank you, Your Highness.
You'll be living and working here for a long time.
Arrange everything as you wish.
There can be no carpets on account of the cobras.
Yes, you're in India now.
I hope you'll feel comfortable here.
This is your workroom.
Are the models in there?
I think so.
Yes, it's the models.
When can I show them to you?
There's plenty of time.
For a project like this?
What is time in the lifespan of the world?
What is an hour in the stream of eternity?
I'm European, Your Highness.
We count in hours.
You must be tired, Mr. Berger.
Good night.
Good night, Your Highness.
A pity to damage this beautiful model.
I was tempted to open the crates though it would have been improper.
I could have closed them without a mark.
I learned that in Europe.
Thank you, Mr...
Asagara, sahib.
I've been asked to assist you.
I studied architecture in Berlin and Paris.
His Highness thinks I may be of use.
I'm delighted.
Your support will be invaluable.
I can't begin properly until Mr. Rhode arrives.
His Highness is worried about the condition of the palace.
The foundations have been shifting.
The palace was built on top of old Mogul passages.
Water has come in and the walls have cracks.
We'll inspect it tomorrow.
Today I want to see the town.
Stop.
The tabla sets the tempo, not you.
Two tabla beats and then you come in...
The tabla speeds up and you follow the tempo.
May I?
At first just strum, then play a double stop.
So you don't go against the rhythm.
Let's try again.
One, two, three, four.
One... two... three... four.
Good.
Mistress, the foreign sahib is here to see you.
That's enough for today.
Thank you.
Show him in, Bharani.
Yes.
Good morning.
I wanted to see where you're staying.
Did you sleep well?
How did you find me so quickly?
I noted every street, house and stone between here and the palace.
You know that tune?
My father used to sing it.
There used to be words too... but I've forgotten them.
It's an Irish folksong.
The lasses who go to the well...
Only think of Pat
The lasses who stand at the well
And see themselves reflected there
Only wait for Pat
Pat Murphy lies in a watery grave
And yearning is in vain
The lasses who go to the shore
And keep a watch for distant sails
Only hope for him
Sahib, I've found the words again.
But it's an Irish folksong.
Seetha, who was your father?
My origins are obscure and shadowy like the nights of the moon goddess.
I was very young when my parents died.
The priests raised me.
Did your father have a pale face like mine?
I can't remember his face.
I was very ill.
We were all ill.
Vultures circled over the houses and jackals came to the doors.
A lot of people died then.
My parents too.
One second.
Wait.
This is all I have left.
It belonged to my father.
It's a European instrument.
For Joe from Frank.
Cambridge, 1800 and...
I can't read it.
Joe?
Joe...
There was a man who used to visit us.
He had red hair and a deep voice.
I was scared of him.
Go on.
He called my father Joe.
Your father was European.
Perhaps.
See for yourself...
Look at your face.
Is that an Indian face?
Don't be afraid.
It was a stone thrown over the wall, or a fish jumping.
A stone, a fish, or the hand of God...
This is India.
Go now.
And take care.
Why isn't the dancer staying here?
The festival starts tonight.
It wasn't worth it.
I hope she'll stay longer.
Are those the soldiers who fled?
Yes, they've been whipped as you ordered.
I wish to speak to you, Chandra.
I care greatly about who takes the Maharani's place.
So do I.
My sister loved you very much.
Speak out, Padhu.
After she died, you spent time in Europe.
I don't want you to bring foreign ways to Eschnapur.
I don't need your advice, Padhu.
Europe did you no good.
You no longer know what is good for your people.
What is to be done with the soldiers, Chandra?
Set them free.
They can thank the gods the foreigner saved Seetha from the tiger.
His Highness.
Mr. Berger, I've only just heard about... your adventure on the way here.
You're very brave, Mr. Berger.
It was nothing.
I acted instinctively.
Tigers fear fire.
An escort of six soldiers fled.
Their horses were frightened.
Will you take this ring as a token of my gratitude?
Your Highness...
So precious a jewel?
The life of this woman is the most precious thing in all India.
What is an emerald in comparison?
Mr. Berger, you have won a friend.
I can think of nothing that could destroy our friendship.
Bharani, he can scare a man eating tiger with only a branch.
A burning branch, mistress.
The flame was tiny.
No higher than this...
What tricks our memory plays.
I thought it was so high...
So you're the one chosen to dance in the temple?
I am but a humble dancer.
The Maharaja cannot be pleased with me to place such a task on my frail shoulders.
Prince Chandra may expect more of you.
If you are unsure if your path leads you to the right goal ask the goddess or her servants.
How much?
8 meters 40.
Eight forty.
27 degrees.
North northwest.
Asagara!
The ladder.
And the torch.
How old is all this, Asagara?
It's hard to say.
It probably dates back to the first Mogul Emperor.
There's a lot of water.
We must be very close to the lake.
A secret passage.
How mysterious.
Give me a new torch.
We only have two left.
Scared?
Yes, but it doesn't matter.
We're right next to the temple.
Does a passage connect the palace and the temple?
Sahib...
If a European enters the temple it spells his death.
I'm not going to enter the temple but we must chart these underground passages.
Sahib!
Please.
All right, you win.
I don't want to upset you.
Investigate that passage.
I'll go down this one.
Asagara!
Asagara, who are those creatures?
They are lepers.
Haven't you noticed there are no sick in Eschnapur?
It's to stop them infecting others.
You leave the sick to rot in that hole?
Weren't you brought here to build hospitals?
And the dead guard?
Isn't it more merciful to have a dead man watch over the dying?
I saw the white sahib in the temple.
How could that be?
He stood high above everyone else.
And then the goddess' face darkened.
And when I looked up at him again, he'd gone.
Your thoughts dwell too much on him.
Perhaps.
But it is possible that he was there and the goddess was protecting him.
A stranger who had invaded our holy temple?
No, mistress.
Her face darkened in anger.
My brother the Maharaja is pleased with you.
Your dance gladdened his lonely heart.
It is his wish that you move to the palace so you can dance for him.
A palanquin is waiting.
Your Highness...
We have a few humble possessions at the inn...
I've already had them taken to the palace.
She's left?
I told you, sahib.
For Madras?
Or Calcutta?
She must have said where.
Where do birds fly?
Where does the wind blow?
Mistress...
It's like a dream.
Do you think it's pure gold, mistress?
I hope you'll feel at home here, Seetha.
Your Highness...
Is this not a mirror?
How lucky he is.
Seetha, there is no cage for you in Eschnapur.
And this is not a chain...
It is but a gift from a man hoping for a woman's love.
You aren't here by chance.
I saw you dance in the Temple of Benares and I had them look for you.
I won't rush anything.
Haste is a European vice.
Isn't it better to ask a woman than to order her?
Is love not richer coming from the heart, born of affection and respect?
I could fill this room with pearls, emeralds and rubies but all that would be nothing compared to how I feel.
So I lay the most precious gift of all at your feet... my heart.
One day we will all end up dependent on the foreigners.
It is only my deep concern for Eschnapur which makes me raise these matters.
Isn't it because you want the throne, Ramigani?
I have long known Prince Ramigani.
His deep love for his brother...
I don't approve of stabbing a prince in the back.
What would you do, Prince?
It is your business, not mine.
He gave the dancer the Maharani's jewels... the emerald necklace, which she loved so much.
Perhaps she'll reach for her crown soon too.
Defend your dead sister's honor.
Is she to be supplanted by a dancer?
Let us not speak with the tongues of jackals.
There is much discontent in Eschnapur.
Chandra has sent for his foreign devils.
Ramigani wants Chandra's throne.
All that is none of my business.
No, Ramigani.
Do not count on the lances of my soldiers.
If Chandra should ever dare to tarnish the memory of the Maharani... then it will be my business.
Prince Padhu is leaving Eschnapur, sahib.
Don't call me "sahib".
We're colleagues.
We both studied in Europe.
Thank you, Mr. Berger.
That's very kind.
Imagine missing the tiger hunt, Padhu.
You're growing old.
You're avoiding danger.
You think you're getting any younger?
You're ignoring the danger.
The festival is over.
The flowers picked for my arrival have wilted.
Follow on.
The German engineer should be here with us but he said he was too busy.
We're both grateful to him for saving your life.
He's a very brave man.
I'm glad he's my friend.
Would you like to travel, Seetha?
To Europe, perhaps?
Europe...
Your Highness...
The tiger is in the trap.
Seetha...
before sunrise tomorrow the tiger which terrified you will be laid at your feet.
Europe...
The lasses who stand at the shore...
And keep a watch for distant sails...
Only hope for him.
Your horses are fast but they must be spared.
We've ridden for 14 hours, often through water.
The shikaris will find us.
They'd need to fly to catch us.
Chandra is crazed with love.
I'm going to teach him a lesson.
You think he'll still want you to take my sister's place when I send you back because you're not even good enough for my soldiers?
The horses need at least an hour's rest.
I must have some fun out of this.
Yakmis and Palawar, come here and fight for her.
My best soldiers are fighting for your favors.
Don't you want to watch?
Take her.
Go on.
You must understand.
It was just...
Over there lives a holy man who can see into the future.
I want to consult him.
About the future, Your Highness?
I owe you my life.
It belongs to you.
I don't want your life.
I want your love.
What could the gods tell you, Prince Chandra?
I have known you for so short a while.
Perhaps you're right.
What do the gods know of two people's hearts?
Bharani!
I've been looking for you...
Take me to her.
It's dangerous here.
Follow me.
The rift between the Maharaja and Padhu suits me well but it's not enough.
Only if the dancer is crowned, has Chandra lost.
What can we do?
I can see it... outraged soldiers and priests, the gods filled with fury and the mob angrily tearing down the walls.
It will take a while, but we will get what we want.
Bharani?
She has been crying.
She's worried about you.
I'll take you to her.
Seetha.
At last...
You shouldn't have come here.
You don't want me to be in danger and I don't want you to be in danger.
I've been looking for you.
I had to see you.
And now you've found me.
I want to know what you are.
A guest?
The Maharaja's mistress?
A prisoner?
I owe gratitude to the Prince.
He saved my life.
I know, but only because I...
Sorry.
What right has he to ask more than me?
Chandra saved me from more than death.
He doesn't demand.
He asks.
What will you reply?
Sahib Berger...
I am Indian.
You're half European.
Listen to what I'm saying.
For foreigners India is like an intoxicating drink but when they leave India they return to sober reality.
It's like a magic spell that quickly wears off.
Mistress!
It's getting late.
Go now and be patient.
My thoughts are with you.
I'll pray to the gods for you every day at sunset.
If someone picked your most precious bloom how would you punish them?
Speak plainly.
At night the white sahib crosses the lake to see the dancer from the South.
You're lying.
Your Highness... may your sword and the wrath of the gods strike me if I lie.
Who saw them?
The goddess has many eyes watching over your happiness and that of Eschnapur.
Morning Asagara.
Good morning.
Here's the letter.
Mr. Rhode will want to know the details so I need you as messenger.
I want to hold a banquet.
In honor of Seetha and the German engineer.
You pay them a high honor.
Are you implying they're not worthy?
How could I?
Seetha brought a servant to Eschnapur.
I'd like to ask her a few questions.
But it can wait until after the banquet.
That meddlesome priest has been talking.
He's a valuable ally.
He's threatening my plans.
The dancer must not fall from grace with Chandra.
I must prevent my brother from questioning the servant about the friendship between the foreigner and the temple dancer.
Mr. Asagara, what has happened?
The lady Mr. Berger saved from the tiger is a... a special guest of the Maharaja's.
Mr. Berger won His Highness' friendship.
He mustn't lose it.
What is the relationship between my brother and this woman?
He entered the inner temple to see her.
I've not been here long.
Is that very bad?
Mrs. Rhode, Eschnapur is not Calcutta.
One mustn't anger the gods or the Prince.
This doesn't sound good, Mr. Asagara.
I still have a few things to do here but I think we'd better leave today.
I'm sorry I'm late.
We had problems at the building site.
In Eschnapur you must always expect surprises, Mr. Berger.
This is the heart of India.
Ah yes, you know each other.
Of course.
You know each other very well.
I haven't forgotten your feat with the tiger.
You mustn't exaggerate.
I was lucky.
May luck never desert you.
You've arrived just in time to see the fakir.
The magic rope.
Come down.
Come back.
Come down, I tell you.
You won't escape.
Come on, then.
I'll teach you to obey.
Catch me if you can.
I'll get you.
Come on, then.
Just you wait.
Come back, I tell you.
Have you seen that before?
I've heard of this trick.
It must take years of practice.
Perhaps it's not a trick.
Perhaps it's an illusion or a suggestion of the mind.
I'm not easily taken in by such things.
Really?
Gowardan...
The white sahib doubts the power of the yoga which gave Gowadan magical skills.
Bharani is slim and supple.
She won't find it unpleasant in the basket.
Come here.
Your Highness, no...
Must I?
I'll speak on your behalf.
I beg of you, Your Highness...
Spare my servant Bharani.
She's terrified.
I don't need any proof.
However it was done, it was magnificent.
Why scare her unnecessarily?
What happens in Eschnapur without my will prevailing?
Nothing.
But servants must obey my brother.
Go.
Spare her.
Prince Ramigani is only doing this for me...
You're European, Mr. Berger.
Your concern for servants is exaggerated.
Ramigani.
Gowardan.
Sorry, Your Highness.
The boy has taken the rope.
I'll run and fetch it.
The bungler!
Ramigani.
Your Highness, Bharani is dead.
Fetch the fakir.
This is a bad start to a banquet.
I'm sorry...
Instead of happiness you feel pain and sorrow.
You'll wish to withdraw.
The women's quarters are at your disposal.
Didn't you say only your will prevailed?
I already said it...
I'm sorry.
Your Highness, this was murder.
I hope you had no part in it.
Mr. Berger...
I'm glad you think so highly of Indian hospitality that you rely on it so completely.
Good night.
The courtyard, the staircase up...
The women's courtyard, more stairs...
The women's quarters.
The fakir has vanished.
My best men are looking for him.
He won't get away.
Ramigani, remove the guard from the women's quarters.
I want to know for sure.
That's not all...
Seetha, we must leave Eschnapur.
Bharani...
You mustn't dwell on it.
Maybe it was an accident.
It was murder.
We must get out of Eschnapur, and India.
Highness.
You must come away with me, Seetha.
Prince Chandra rules from the hills to the sea.
Every passage of this palace, every door and gate is guarded.
There's an underground passage out of here.
Meet me in the temple at dusk.
I'm very frightened.
But I want to go with you.
There he is.
It was a tiger which won you my friendship.
A tiger shall tear you from my heart.
You've robbed and betrayed me.
I don't want to be a murderer.
Fight for your life!
The man eaters!
Raise the gate!
You have from sunrise to sunset to leave Eschnapur.
May the wind cover your trail as fast as your betrayal ruined our friendship.
The foreigner has gone into town.
Shouldn't we send someone after him...
No.
He's free to go.
Never say his name in my presence again.
The dancer asked if she might go to the temple to pray.
Have guards accompany her to the door.
Her fate is still undecided.
But I won't stop her talking to the goddess.
Seetha!
Come on, we must be quick.
There's a shikari uniform.
Put it on quickly.
We have an hour's start.
Chandra will follow us.
I'll hide our trail.
We have good horses.
The dog!
The treacherous dog!
I told you not to let him go.
I offered to...
Enough!
You spoke out for her.
You said she should go to the temple.
Be just.
She had guards.
I had the doors watched too.
No one saw her leave the temple.
I know their horses.
You talk like an idiot.
Listen, take the hunters who can follow a tiger's trail.
Take my fastest horsemen.
Just bring her back...
alive.
The German's head will do.
If you fail, Ramigani, you will pay the price.
All visitors to Eschnapur are checked thoroughly but you and Mr. Rhode, as special guests, won't wait long.
Tonight Prince Chandra will give a banquet in your honor.
I'm looking forward to seeing my brother.
I am too.
See, we can enter now.
My brother Chandra did not realize you would honor us so soon.
We set out earlier than planned.
I'm sorry that no rooms have been prepared for you.
If meanwhile you could use Mr. Berger's rooms yours will be ready tomorrow.
Affairs of state detain Prince Chandra.
Where's my brother?
It's strange he isn't here to meet us.
He didn't know of your arrival.
He's on a tiger hunt.
My brother's gone hunting?
That's a new passion.
India awakens many a passion.
I bid you good night.
My brother will look after you tomorrow.
I am going on a journey.
I hope, however, that it won't be very long.
How cold the nights can be in India.
We must go on, Seetha.
We can't light a fire.
They'd see it from afar.
It doesn't matter.
The sun will soon be up.
Stop.
Shikaris, look for their trail.
We mustn't rest.
Not in the cool of the morning.
Look here.
Tracks.
One horse...
Two horses.
Tell Prince Ramigani we've found the trail.
My horse needs a rest.
We must go on.
It can't.
Let me see.
Nothing we can do.
It's lame.
We'll have to walk if we want to reach the caravan route.
Come down.
Take my horse.
Two half full waterbags for one horse and two people.
Come on.
Dismount, Seetha.
Poor animal.
What should we do?
It's no good.
Please...
Go over there.
Are you very tired?
I'd like to propose the following for the first phase...
I'm going to disappoint you.
I haven't changed my mind but this must wait for a while.
I want you first to build...
a tomb.
A tomb?
Such as the world has never seen before.
Made from purest marble, the most precious jewels... jade, alabaster, turquoise, coral, emeralds and rubies.
It will be the tomb of my beloved.
I've lost the woman... who was very close to my heart.
Excuse me, Highness, but...
I thought the Maharani died some years ago.
I'm not talking of the Maharani.
Please accept my condolences for the loss of someone who loved you dearly.
Who said that the woman of whom I spoke loved me?
And if I lost her, must she be dead?
Then... she's still alive?
Yes.
You're building a tomb for a living person?
One day she will be dead.
To be precise, she'll die when the tomb is complete.
I must have misunderstood you.
May I have an explanation?
How can you explain that a woman who was wrapped in love like a golden cloak cast my love aside...
and tossed it to a dog?
To a man who betrayed his friend?
You don't want a tomb, Your Highness.
You want an execution site.
There's nothing about this in my contract.
I'm leaving.
You can't leave Eschnapur without my permission and my protection.
You will build the tomb, Mr. Rhode.
And I shall bury my love in that tomb.
Name your price.
Go as high as you like.
Just start work straight away.
For the first time in my life
I'm experiencing your European impatience.
- What's wrong?
- It's the hour of the tiger.
- A man-eater?
- A demon, a thing of evil.
He's attacked over two dozen people.
Bring her over here.
The trees bent their branches over the path.
Shiny fruit was hanging from them, made of precious...
Don't.
Stop it.
- Which of us shall it be?
- Don't.
- Leave me alone.
- Too good for us, are you?
Give me the pail.
Give it to me!
Don't bother with the water.
Thank you, sahib.
Hey, what are you doing with my toothpaste?
Give it to me!
It doesn't taste good.
Come on now.
That's better.
Good evening.
My name is Harald Berger.
I'm going to Eschnapur to work on some building projects... hospitals, schools and so on.
I want to thank you, sahib.
You protected my servant Bharani from the impudent soldiers.
She just wanted some water for the frangipani blossoms.
May the gods give you a bowl of water at an hour of great thirst.
Good night.
Dara!
Dara!
Dara!
Come here!
Come here!
Dara!
Dara!
Come here!
The tiger must be...
They say the tiger has eaten many people.
If you're going to Eschnapur, it's wise to go together.
It's still a day's journey from here.
Rarely have I seen so strong a man.
A six-man escort.
Quite an honor for a dancer.
It's because of the tiger.
They say it has a murderer's spirit.
Here they come!
We'll water the horses.
It's the last waterhole.
Good.
Thank you.
Bharani, go and tell the ox-drivers to hurry.
Yes, mistress.
Are you hurt?
It was a miracle, sahib.
- Tigers are scared of fire.
- It was a miracle.
I saw two tigers fighting each other.
They were fighting over me.
For my life.
You know, sahib, you're part of India now.
And the other tiger?
The other tiger is the other India.
The Maharani's death has affected Chandra strangely.
- Is he still mourning her?
- I don't think so.
He should have cared for my sister better.
What's this about a dancer from the South?
He saw her in the temple of Benares.
He's been searching for her.
The temple priests think the Prince's thoughts are too often in foreign worlds since he went to Europe.
He has his own ideas on how to serve his people.
I don't like Chandra's Western ideas.
Do you, Ramigani?
I do not rule Eschnapur, Prince Padhu.
I am just my brother's servant.
He is a good prince.
But many people think it was wrong to pass you over in the succession.
- You are older.
- Bhowana is right.
The priests are upset that Prince Chandra has asked the Europeans here.
My brother-in-law is in charge of the project.
He's joining me later.
Have you been to Europe?
Your gods are not worshipped through dance.
I would be out of place.
I'd like to see you dance.
Foreigners are not allowed in our temples.
How about outside the temple?
I'm the Maharaja's guest.
The guards at the city gates report the arrival of the foreigner.
I'd hoped that as a guest of the Maharaja you'd be in the palace near me.
I shall always think of you with gratitude, sahib.
Gratitude!
I hope you'll remember me for something other than a burning branch and a tiger.
May I visit you?
This is an inn, sahib.
I'm sure it's open to the Maharaja's special guests.
Memsahib.
- Welcome to Eschnapur.
- Did the Maharaja send you?
No.
Prince Ramigani, the Prince's brother, sent me 1.10 escort YOU.
Ramigani,
I was waiting for other guests.
This is new to me, Chandra.
Didn't you say that Mr Rhode should stay in Calcutta until the preparations were complete?
Welcome to Eschnapur.
Thank you.
This reception is a great honor for a man who can only do his best.
That is a great deal.
In Europe I saw what you and Mr Rhode have built.
Your people say "Make yourself at home."
I doubt that you could here.
You'd need an Indian soul.
So I shall say "May you be happy in Eschnapur."
Thank you, Your Highness.
You'll be living and working here for a long time.
Arrange everything as you wish.
There can be no carpets on account of the cobras.
Yes, you're in India now.
I hope you'll feel comfortable here.
This is your workroom.
- Are the models in there?
- I think so.
Yes, it's the models.
When can I show them to you?
- There's plenty of time.
- For a project like this?
What is time in the lifespan of the world?
What is an hour in the stream of eternity?
I'm European, Your Highness.
We count in hours.
You must be tired, Mr Berger.
Good night.
Good night, Your Highness.
A pity to damage this beautiful model.
I was tempted to open the crates though it would have been improper.
I could have closed them without a mark.
I learned that in Europe.
- Thank you, Mr...
- Asagara, sahib.
I've been asked to assist you.
I studied architecture in Berlin and Paris.
His Highness thinks I may be of use.
I'm delighted.
Your support will be invaluable.
I can't begin properly until Mr Rhode arrives.
His Highness is worried about the condition of the palace.
The foundations have been shifting.
The palace was built on top of old Mughal passages.
Water has come in and the walls have cracks.
We'll inspect it tomorrow.
Today I want to see the town.
Stop.
The tabla sets the tempo, not you.
Two tabla beats and then you come in...
The tabla speeds up and you follow the tempo.
May I?
At first just strum, then play a double-stop.
So you don't go against the rhythm.
Let's try again.
One, two, three, four.
One...two...three...four.
Good.
Mistress, the foreign sahib is here to see you.
That's enough for today.
Thank you.
- Show him in, Bharani.
- Yes.
Good morning.
I wanted to see where you're staying.
Did you sleep well?
How did you find me so quickly?
I noted every street, house and stone between here and the palace.
- You know that tune?
- My father used to sing it.
There used to be words too... but I've forgotten them.
It's an Irish folk song.
The lasses who go to the well only think of Pat.
The lasses who stand at the well and see themselves reﬂected there only wait for Pat.
Pat Murphy lies in a watery grave and yearning is in vain.
The lasses who go to the shore and keep a watch for distant sail
only hope for him.
Only hope for him.
Sahib, I've found the words again.
But it's an Irish folk song.
Seetha, who was your father?
My origins are obscure and shadowy like the nights of the moon goddess.
I was very young when my parents died.
The priests raised me.
Did your father have a pale face like mine?
I can't remember his face.
I was very ill.
We were all ill.
Vultures circled over the houses and jackals came to the doors.
A lot of people died then.
My parents too.
One second.
Wait.
This is all I have left.
It belonged to my father.
It's a European instrument.
"For Joe from Frank."
"Cambridge, 1800 and..." I can't read it.
Joe?
Joe...
There was a man who used to visit us.
He had red hair and a deep voice.
- I was scared of him.
- Go on.
- He called my father Joe.
- Your father was European.
Perhaps.
See for yourself...
Look at your face.
Is that an Indian face?
Don't be afraid.
It was a stone thrown over the wall, or a fish jumping.
A stone, a fish, or the hand of God...
This is India.
Go now.
And take care.
Why isn't the dancer staying here?
The festival starts tonight.
It wasn't worth it.
I hope she'll stay longer.
Are those the soldiers who fled?
Yes, they've been whipped as you ordered.
I wish to speak to you, Chandra.
I care greatly about who takes the Maharani's place.
So do I.
My sister loved you very much.
Speak out, Padhu.
After she died, you spent time in Europe.
I don't want you to bring foreign ways to Eschnapur.
I don't need your advice, Padhu.
Europe did you no good.
You no longer know what is good for your people.
What is to be done with the soldiers, Chandra?
Set them free.
They can thank the gods the foreigner saved Seetha from the tiger.
His Highness.
Mr Berger, I've only just heard about... your adventure on the way here.
- You're very brave, Mr Berger.
- It was nothing.
I acted instinctively.
Tigers fear fire.
An escort of six soldiers fled.
Their horses were frightened.
Will you take this ring as a token of my gratitude?
Your Highness...
So precious a jewel?
The life of this woman is the most precious thing in all India.
What is an emerald in comparison?
Mr Berger, you have won a friend.
I can think of nothing that could destroy our friendship.
Bharani, he can scare a man-eating tiger with only a branch.
A burning branch, mistress.
The flame was tiny.
No higher than this...
What tricks our memory plays.
I thought it was so high...
So you're the one chosen to dance in the temple?
I am but a humble dancer.
The Maharaja cannot be pleased with me to place such a task on my frail shoulders.
Prince Chandra may expect more of you.
If you are unsure if your path leads you to the right goal ask the goddess or her servants.
- How much?
- 8 meters 40.
Eight forty.
27 degrees.
North-Northwest.
Asagara!
The ladder.
And the torch.
How old is all this, Asagara?
It's hard to say.
It probably dates back to the first Mughal Emperor.
There's a lot of water.
We must be very close to the lake.
A secret passage.
How mysterious.
- Give me a new torch.
- We only have two left.
Scared?
Yes, but it doesn't matter.
We're right next to the temple.
Does a passage connect the palace and the temple?
Sahib...
If a European enters the temple it spells his death.
I'm not going to enter the temple, but we must chart these underground passages.
Sahib!
Please.
All right, you win.
I don't want to upset you.
Investigate that passage.
I'll go down this one.
Asagara!
Asagara!
Asagara!
Asagara, who are those creatures?
They are lepers.
Haven't you noticed there are no sick in Eschnapur?
It's to stop them infecting others.
You leave the sick to rot in that hole?
Weren't you brought here to build hospitals?
And the dead guard?
Isn't it more merciful to have a dead man watch over the dying?
I saw the white sahib in the temple.
How could that be?
He stood high above everyone else.
And then the goddess' face darkened.
And when I looked up at him again, he'd gone.
Your thoughts dwell too much on him.
Perhaps.
But it is possible that he was there and the goddess was protecting him.
A stranger who had invaded our holy temple?
No, mistress.
Her face darkened in anger.
My brother the Maharaja is pleased with you.
Your dance gladdened his lonely heart.
It is his wish that you move to the palace, so you can dance for him.
A palanquin is waiting.
Your Highness...
We have a few humble possessions at the inn...
I've already had them taken to the palace.
- She's left?
- I told you, sahib.
For Madras?
Or Calcutta?
She must have said where.
Where do birds fly?
Where does the wind blow?
Mistress..
It's like a dream.
Do you think it's pure gold, mistress?
I hope you'll feel at home here, Seetha.
Your Highness...
Is this not a mirror?
How lucky he is.
Seetha, there is no cage for you in Eschnapur.
And this is not a chain...
It is but a gift from a man hoping for a woman's love.
You aren't here by chance.
I saw you dance in the Temple of Benares and I had them look for you.
I won't rush anything.
Haste is a European vice.
Isn't it better to ask a woman than to order her?
Is love not richer coming from the heart, born of affection and respect?
I could fill this room with pearls, emeralds and rubies but all that would be nothing compared to how I feel.
Sol lay the most precious gift of all at your feet... my heart.
One day we will all end up dependent on the foreigners.
It is only my deep concern for Eschnapur which makes me raise these matters.
Isn't it because you want the throne, Ramigani?
I have long known Prince Ramigani.
His deep love for his brother...
I don't approve of stabbing a prince in the back.
What would you do, Prince?
It is your business, not mine.
He gave the dancer the Maharani's jewels... the emerald necklace, which she loved so much.
Perhaps she'll reach for her crown soon too.
Defend your dead sister's honor.
Is she to be supplanted by a dancer?
Let us not speak with the tongues of jackals.
There is much discontent in Eschnapur.
Chandra has sent for his foreign devils.
Ramigani wants Chandra's throne.
All that is none of my business.
No, Ramigani.
Do not count on the lances of my soldiers.
If Chandra should ever dare to tarnish the memory of the Maharani... then it will be my business.
Prince Padhu is leaving Eschnapur, sahib.
Don't call me "sahib".
We're colleagues.
We both studied in Europe.
Thank you, Mr Berger.
That's very kind.
Imagine missing the tiger hunt, Padhu.
You're growing old.
You're avoiding danger.
You think you're getting any younger?
You're ignoring the danger.
The festival is over.
The flowers picked for my arrival have wilted.
Follow on.
The German engineer should be here with us, but he said he was too busy.
We're both grateful to him for saving your life.
- He's a very brave man.
- I'm glad he's my friend.
Would you like to travel, Seetha?
To Europe, perhaps?
Europe...
Your Highness...
The tiger is in the trap.
Seetha...
before sunrise tomorrow the tiger which terrified you will be laid at your feet.
Europe...
The lasses who stand at the shore...
And keep a watch for distant sails...
Only hope for him.
Your horses are fast, but they must be spared.
We've ridden for 14 hours, often through water.
The shikaris will find us.
They'd need to fly to catch us.
Chandra is crazed with love.
I'm going to teach him a lesson.
You think he'll still want you to take my sister's place when I send you back because you're not even good enough for my soldiers?
The horses need at least an hour's rest.
I must have some fun out of this.
Yakmis and Palawar, come here and fight for her.
My best soldiers are fighting for your favors.
Don't you want to watch?
Take her.
Go on.
You must understand.
It was just...
Over there lives a holy man who can see into the future.
I want to consult him.
About the future, Your Highness?
I owe you my life.
It belongs to you.
I don't want your life.
I want your love.
What could the gods tell you, Prince Chandra?
I have known you for so short a while.
Perhaps you're right.
What do the gods know of two people's hearts?
Bharani!
I've been looking for you...
- Take me to her.
- It's dangerous here.
Follow me.
The rift between the Maharaja and Padhu suits me well, but it's not enough.
Only if the dancer is crowned, has Chandra lost.
- What can we do?
- I can see it...
Outraged soldiers and priests, the gods filled with fury and the mob angrily tearing down the walls.
It will take a while, but we will get what we want.
Bharani?
She has been crying.
She's worried about you.
I'll take you to her.
Seetha.
At last...
You shouldn't have come here.
You don't want me to be in danger, and I don't want you to be in danger.
I've been looking for you.
I had to see you.
And now you've found me.
I want to know what you are.
A guest?
The Maharaja's mistress?
A prisoner?
I owe gratitude to the Prince.
- He saved my life.
- I know, but only because I...
Sorry.
What right has he to ask more than me?
Chandra saved me from more than death.
He doesn't demand.
He asks.
What will you reply?
Sahib Berger...
- I am Indian.
- You're half European.
Listen to what I'm saying.
For foreigners, India is like an intoxicating drink but when they leave India they return to sober reality.
It's like a magic spell that quickly wears off.
Mistress!
It's getting late.
Go now and be patient.
My thoughts are with you.
I'll pray to the gods for you every day at sunset.
If someone picked your most precious bloom how would you punish them?
Speak plainly.
At night the white sahib crosses the lake to see the dancer from the South.
You're lying.
Your Highness...
May your sword and the wrath of the gods strike me if I lie.
Who saw them?
The goddess has many eyes watching over your happiness and that of Eschnapur.
- Morning Asagara.
- Good morning.
Here's the letter.
Mr Rhode will want to know the details, so I need you as messenger.
I want to hold a banquet.
In honor of Seetha and the German engineer.
You pay them a high honor.
Are you implying they're not worthy?
How could I?
Seetha brought a servant to Eschnapur.
I'd like to ask her a few questions.
But it can wait until after the banquet.
That meddlesome priest has been talking.
He's a valuable ally.
He's threatening my plans.
The dancer must not fall from grace with Chandra.
I must prevent my brother from questioning the servant about the friendship between the foreigner and the temple dancer.
Mr Asagara, what has happened?
The lady Mr Berger saved from the tiger is a... a special guest of the Maharaja's.
Mr Berger won His Highness' friendship.
He mustn't lose it.
What is the relationship between my brother and this woman?
He entered the inner temple to see her.
I've not been here long Is that very bad?
Mrs Rhode, Eschnapur is not Calcutta.
One mustn't anger the gods or the Prince.
This doesn't sound good, Mr Asagara.
I still have a few things to do here, but I think we'd better leave today.
I'm sorry I'm late.
We had problems at the building site.
In Eschnapur you must always expect surprises, Mr Berger.
This is the heart of India.
Ah yes, you know each other.
He should have known there'd be issues.
Of course.
You know each other very well.
I haven't forgotten your feat with the tiger.
You mustn't exaggerate.
I was lucky.
May luck never desert you.
You've arrived just in time to see the fakir.
The magic rope.
Come down.
Come back.
Come down, I tell you.
You won't escape.
Come on, then.
- I'll teach you to obey.
- Catch me if you can.
I'll get you.
- Come on, then.
- Just you wait.
Come back, I tell you.
Have you seen that before?
I've heard of this trick.
It must take years of practice.
Perhaps it's not a trick.
Perhaps it's an illusion or a suggestion of the mind.
I'm not easily taken in by such things.
Really?
Gowardan...
The white sahib doubts the power of the yoga which gave Gowardan magical skills.
Bharani is slim and supple.
She won't find it unpleasant in the basket.
- Come here.
- Your Highness, no...
- Must I?
- I'll speak on your behalf.
I beg of you, Your Highness...
Spare my servant Bharani She's terrified.
I don't need any proof.
However it was done, it was magnificent.
Why scare her unnecessarily?
What happens in Eschnapur without my will prevailing?
Nothing.
But servants must obey my brother.
- Go.
- Spare her.
Prince Ramigani is only doing this for me...
You're European, Mr Berger.
Your concern for servants is exaggerated.
Ramigani.
Gowardan.
Sorry, Your Highness.
The boy has taken the rope.
I'll run and fetch it.
- The bungler!
- Ramigani.
Your Highness, Bharani is dead.
Fetch the fakir.
This is a bad start to a banquet.
I'm sorry...
Instead of happiness you feel pain and sorrow.
You'll wish to withdraw.
The women's quarters are at your disposal.
Didn't you say only your will prevailed?
I already said it...
I'm sorry.
Your Highness, this was murder.
I hope you had no part in it.
Mr Berger...
I'm glad you think so highly of Indian hospitality that you rely on it so completely.
Good night.
The courtyard, the staircase up...
The women's courtyard, more stairs...
The women's quarters.
The fakir has vanished.
My best men are looking for him.
He won't get away.
Ramigani, remove the guard from the women's quarters.
I want to know for sure.
That's not all...
Seetha, we must leave Eschnapur.
- Bharani...
- You mustn't dwell on it.
- Maybe it was an accident.
- It was murder.
We must get out of Eschnapur, and India.
Highness.
You must come away with me, Seetha.
Prince Chandra rules from the hills to the sea.
Every passage of this palace, every door and gate is guarded.
There's an underground passage out of here.
Meet me in the temple at dusk.
I'm very frightened.
But I want to go with you.
There he is.
It was a tiger which won you my friendship.
A tiger shall tear you from my heart.
You've robbed and betrayed me.
I don't want to be a murderer.
Fight for your life!
The man-eater!
Raise the gate!
You have from sunrise to sunset to leave Eschnapur.
May the wind cover your trail as fast as your betrayal ruined our friendship.
The foreigner has gone into town.
Shouldn't we send someone after him...
No.
He's free to go.
Never say his name in my presence again.
The dancer asked if she might go to the temple to pray.
Have guards accompany her to the door.
Her fate is still undecided.
But I won't stop her talking to the goddess.
Seetha!
Come on, we must be quick.
There's a shikari uniform.
Put it on quickly.
- We have an hour's start.
- Chandra will follow us.
I'll hide our trail.
We have good horses.
The dog!
The treacherous dog!
I told you not to let him go.
- I offered to...
- Enough!
You spoke out for her.
You said she should go to the temple.
Be just.
She had guards.
I had the doors watched too.
No one saw her leave the temple.
- I know their horses.
- You talk like an idiot.
Listen, take the hunters who can follow a tiger's trail.
Take my fastest horsemen.
Just bring her back... alive.
The German's head will do.
If you fail, Ramigani, you will pay the price.
All visitors to Eschnapur are checked thoroughly, but you and Mr Rhode, as special guests, won't wait long.
Tonight Prince Chandra will give a banquet in your honor.
I'm looking forward to seeing my brother.
I am too.
See, we can enter now.
My brother Chandra did not realize you would honor us so soon.
We set out earlier than planned.
I'm sorry that no rooms have been prepared for you.
If meanwhile you could use Mr Berger's rooms yours will be ready tomorrow.
Affairs of state detain Prince Chandra.
Where's my brother?
It's strange he isn't here to meet us.
He didn't know of your arrival.
He's on a tiger hunt.
My brother's gone hunting?
That's a new passion.
India awakens many a passion.
I bid you good night.
My brother will look after you tomorrow.
I am going on a journey.
I hope, however, that it won't be very long.
How cold the nights can be in India.
We must go on, Seetha.
We can't light a fire.
They'd see it from afar.
It doesn't matter.
The sun will soon be up.
Stop.
Shikaris, look for their trail.
We mustn't rest.
Not in the cool of the morning.
Look here.
Tracks.
- One horse...
- Two horses.
Tell Prince Ramigani we've found the trail.
- My horse needs a rest.
- We must go on.
- It can't.
- Let me see.
Nothing we can do.
It's lame.
We'll have to walk if we want to reach the caravan route.
Come down.
Take my horse.
Two half-full water bags for one horse and two people.
Come on.
Dismount, Seetha.
Poor animal.
What should we do?
It's no good.
Please...
Go over there.
Are you very tired?
I'd like to propose the following for the first phase...
I'm going to disappoint you.
I haven't changed my mind, but this must wait for a while.
I want you first to build... a tomb.
A tomb?
Such as the world has never seen before.
Made from purest marble, the most precious jewels... jade, alabaster, turquoise, coral, emeralds and rubies.
It will be the tomb of my beloved.
I've lost the woman... who was very close to my heart.
Excuse me, Highness, but...
I thought the Maharani died some years ago.
I'm not talking of the Maharani.
Please accept my condolences for the loss of someone who loved you dearly.
Who said that the woman of whom I spoke loved me?
And if I lost her, must she be dead?
Then... she's still alive?
YES.
You're building a tomb for a living person?
One day she will be dead.
To be precise, she'll die when the tomb is complete.
I must have misunderstood you.
May I have an explanation?
How can you explain that a woman who was wrapped in love like a golden cloak cast my love aside... and tossed it to a dog?
To a man who betrayed his friend?
You don't want a tomb, Your Highness.
You want an execution site.
There's nothing about this in my contract.
I'm leaving.
You can't leave Eschnapur without my permission and my protection.
You will build the tomb, Mr Rhode.
And I shall bury my love in that tomb.
Name your price.
Go as high as you like.
Just start work straight away.
For the first time in my life I'm experiencing your European impatience.
Seetha!
It cost Commander Robert Peary... 20 years of unremitting hardship and misery... to reach the North Pole finally in 1909.
It would have astounded Peary to learn that by the late 1950s and early '60s... the vast, frozen top of the world he pioneered... had become a vital highway for world travel and commerce.
Not just in the skies... but also deep under the ice... in the frigid five-million-square-mile depths of the Arctic Ocean.
Here, great passenger and cargo-carrying atomic submarines... glided by the dozens back and forth across the Pole... until a series of mysterious undersea disasters... threatened to close the Arctic route forever.
The decisive moment came May 3 at 1315 hours... when the undersea atomic liner, Sturgeon, largest of them all... reached 87 degrees, 10 minutes north latitude... only a few miles from the North Pole itself.
According to the official reports... the next phase of the life-and-death drama... occurred May 10 in Washington... at a hush-hush super-secret meeting... of the Arctic theater war room.
Gentlemen, this is the man we've been waiting for.
The skipper of the atom killer sub, Tiger Shark.
Commander Dan Wendover.
This is Justin Murdock, secretary of defense.
- Mr. Murdock.
- Commander.
And I know you've heard a lot of Dr. Clifford Kent, Dan.
- Doctor.
- Commander.
Dr. Kent had a lot to do with the development and design of your boat.
Sir Ian Hunt just flew in from London.
The Dr. Hunt, winner of the Nobel Prize for oceanography?
Oh, let's just say I took the bow for a team of very brilliant associates.
Uh, sit down.
Gentlemen, to begin, let me read you just one line... from a detailed staff study prepared for the Joint Chiefs.
"In our judgment, these Arctic disasters... may prove the gravest emergency in all history."
Any comments on that statement?
A bit fanciful, isn't it, sir?
Possibly.
Let me read you, uh, a partial list of observed phenomena.
"Destruction of four surface vessels.
Largest, 10,000 tons.
"Radioactivity in Arctic waters, flow ice and bergs.
"Reculiar television images preceding each distress call.
"Seven polar atom subs... vanished without a trace. "
"Fanciful," did you say, uh, Sir Ian?
And now, Dan, we come to you.
You skipper the Tiger Shark... the most advanced, the deadliest killer sub in the fleet.
Right now she's undergoing emergency around-the-clock modification... in the Bremerton Navy Yard.
The orders call for special observation and testing instruments here... removal of all but two atomic torpedoes... special launching equipment for water-to-air ballistic missiles... and a special escape hatch in the keel for the Lungfish.
The Lungfish?
Yes.
Uh, a deep exploration device, sort of an animated diving bell.
The mission of the Tiger Shark... is to hunt down and identify the cause of these Arctic disasters.
If humanly possible... you will remove it.
Not that I don't think Lieutenant Commander Holloway... is the finest exec in the entire sub fleet, Julie... and not that he isn't the best friend that I have -
Come on, Dave.
You talk too much.
Now be quiet, little mother.
I
- I feel behooved to warn you... our friend Reef is no less than the number one howl in the entire sub wolf pack.
Nuclear powered.
And when it comes to women-Well... he has got a built-in sonar detector that -
Dave, you know you're exaggerating, old buddy-buddy.
You know it.
Yes, you are.
You know, on most boats, a certain loyalty exists... between the exec and his navigation and firing officer... but in the case of Lieutenant David Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself-
But Ju...
She's a nice girl.
Uh, I've seen you work.
I think she deserves a fighting chance.
Helen, I appeal to you.
Dave, look at me.
I'm the mother of your three children.
Will you please take me home to them at once?
There you are.
Just drop in anytime.
Don't bother to call.
Just
-Just drop in.
That's my way of life.
Dave is exaggerating, you know.
I mean, a man spends three months in a deep freeze... it'll take his whole leave just to thaw him out.
By that time, he's ready to report back.
It won't take me long to defrost.
Not around you.
What was I saying about thawing out icebergs?
Yeah, you, uh - You never can tell about icebergs.
Only show one-ninth above water.
After that kiss, I'd say that's about right.
- Do you feel anything?
- Are you kidding?
No, I mean that this is just the beginning of something.
That we didn't just meet accidentally.
Oh, that's original.
Doesn't the next chorus go something like...
"Let's not waste one precious golden moment.
Any second there could be a knock on the door and -"
Well, I've seen stranger things happen.
It happens all the time to heroes on television, plays, motion pictures.
The hero gets his leave canceled, and he's -
And she spends the rest of her life wishing that she'd -
Oh, honey.
Let's not waste one precious moment then.
What's that pounding?
Need I say more?
Mmm.
Reef, look.
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?
What is it?
Oh, no.
Reef.
- They caught you too, huh?
- At the worst possible moment.
Tomorrow's Janie's birthday.
Poor little kid's been looking forward two whole months to having her daddy home.
- Now -
- That's the worst possible moment?
What could be worse than disappointing a little girl?
Disappointing a big girl.
Julie?
Really tough, old buddy.
Oh, really tough.
Skipper, I thought you were going to Washington.
I did.
Just got back.
Reef, I want you to meet a couple of our passengers.
Sir Ian Hunt and Dr. Clifford Kent.
My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
- Glad to know you, sir.
- How do you do?
- Dr. Kent.
Met you before.
- Yes indeed, Commander.
You gentlemen are going with us.
What for?
We'll discuss that later.
Roberts.
- Have Chief Griffin report to me as soon as the crew's aboard.
- Yes, sir.
- Watkins.
- Yes, sir.
- Will you show these gentlemen to their quarters?
- Aye, aye, sir.
This way.
Well.
Sorry we had to cut your leave short.
- Yeah.
- Come at the wrong time?
Yeah.
Will do.
- Oh, it's you.
- Yeah.
Griff, what's the scoop?
Hauled out in the middle of the night, all leaves canceled.
We going to war, or what?
Don't you worry, Chester.
When the skipper wants you to know what's going on, he'll tell ya.
Okay?
- I don't like it.
I mean, this is all mighty funny.
- Ah, isn't it, though?
Suppose you get aboard anyway.
- I don't like it.
- What did you say?
I like it.
I like it.
Hey.
Well, skipper, I think I'll stow my gear.
- Well, Reef, I got some bad news for ya.
- Oh, yeah?
- You're gonna have to share quarters this trip.
- Who with?
- Dr. Neilson.
- Dr. Neilson?
When did that happen?
- Huh?
- Oh, it's all right.
We're old friends.
Dave, stand by to shove off as soon as Griff reports the crew aboard.
Right, skipper.
Well, looks like we're gonna share quarters, skipper.
Been a long -
Carl.
You?
Oh, of course.
I should have suspected when I heard that "doctor."
- I thought it was your father.
- It was supposed to be.
- Dad had a heart attack two days ago.
- He what?
It was mild.
He'll be all right.
But it was out of the question his coming along.
And they thought you could replace the skipper, huh?
There was no choice.
Dad and I developed the Lungfish together.
Except for him, I'm the only one qualified to dive in it.
- You could have trained somebody else.
- Not in two days.
Look, do you think I wanted to come?
If it didn't mean so much to Dad, proving his depth explorer, I certainly wouldn't be here.
That I can believe.
The Tiger Shark left her dock at Bremerton at 0335 hours... the morning of May 11... on what was to prove the strangest, most fearful voyage ever made by a submarine... atomic or otherwise.
Simultaneously with the Shark's departure... and with his crew still in the dark concerning their secret, fateful mission...
Skipper Wendover made the first notation in the log.
The men would remain unbriefed for two hours... until the Tiger Shark cleared Puget Sound... and was headed for open sea.
Who the devil belongs to this gear?
Uh, we do, Chief.
Oh.
You two guys, huh?
And just what do you do around here?
Underwater demolition.
Seaman First Class Powell, and I'm Carney.
Yeah, I know.
So you're frogmen.
Yeah, we're off tin cans.
We've, uh, looked the pig-boat over from, uh, fore to aft... but can't seem to find an empty locker, uh, to store our stuff in.
An empty locker?
In a sub?
Are you kiddin'?
This whole deal is makin' less and less sense to me.
What are frogmen doin' aboard the Tiger Shark?
Following orders, like everyone else in the navy.
Beats me.
But orders are orders.
Yeah, well, uh, in the meantime, where do you want us to stash these gizmos?
Come on.
Shortly before dawn... the Tiger Shark, running submerged at better than 30 knots... had left the sound behind... and was headed for open sea.
Here are our orders, Reef.
Look 'em over while I fill in the crew.
Now hear this.
This is the captain speaking.
I know you're wondering about all the mystery.
Well, our job had to be kept absolutely secret.
Our mission is to find out what caused the disasters under the Arctic ice.
Once we cross the Arctic Circle, any command you hear will be the real thing.
Rlease remember it.
That's about it.
Now you know as much as I or anybody else does, for that matter.
Oh, incidentally, I assured Washington... that this was the best sub crew in the fleet.
I know you won't make a liar out of me.
Carry on.
That's it.
What do you think?
I think I should have joined the air force.
A week later, the Tiger Shark was still running due north at cruising speed.
So far, the voyage was routine, uneventful.
But the nearer they came to the Arctic Circle... the more the tension increased... the more tiny irritations were magnified into bitter feuds... the more the crewmen pondered their possible fate.
On the morning of May 20... the Tiger Shark crossed the Arctic Circle into the critical area.
You're always asking me why I stay a bachelor.
There goes one of the best reasons I can think of.
- Huh?
- Yeah.
I might have a son like that.
I don't get it.
What goes with you two?
I guess his father, Skipper Neilson, retired before you enrolled at the academy, didn't he?
I guess.
One of the finest men and officers alive.
A real hero in the best sense of the word.
World War II.
Taught engineering and design at the academy.
- Fought like a demon for atomic subs.
- So?
So, when his only son dropped out of school, began making statements... all sounding like borrowed propaganda -
"Ban the atomic test." "Junk the nuclear subs."
"Spend the military budget for peace."
Well, it just about broke the old man's heart.
Then when the newspapers picked it up... called Carl the honest, sincere son of a warmongering father... well, Captain Neilson resigned from the navy.
Oh, he still keeps his hand in with projects like the Lungfish... but it broke him all the same.
Have, uh
- Have you talked to Carl?
Tried to get his side?
His side?
He's all front with no back.
How can he have a side?
Either of you men seen Dr. Neilson?
He's in here, sir.
Oh, uh, Tuttle, Powell, would you men mind leaving us alone for a few minutes?
Sure, Mr. Holloway.
Dr. Neilson.
What is it?
You are out.
This came for you.
- My father?
- Dead?
No.
As a matter of fact, he's a lot better.
Just got out of the hospital.
- What did you mean I'm out?
- Your father can be in Nome, Alaska tomorrow.
We have two choices.
We can ask them to bring him out by helicopter and take you off... or we can put the Shark back into Nome.
You trade school boys are all alike, aren't you?
Anybody who doesn't think like a little gold-braided puppet is ipso facto a coward.
You said it.
I didn't.
Well, wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, Commander.
It just so happens I'm not a coward - physical or mental.
And before I'd risk my father's life -
- We're all risking our lives.
- That may be... but Dad stays where he is, and I'm staying here.
Oh, you are a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
Well, perhaps.
But the idea of willingly going to school... to spend my life at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder lizards -
I'm referring to war- that strikes me as the worst cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow.
- You mean nothing's worth fighting for?
- Peace.
The dignity of man, destiny of human spirit.
Now, you show me a man who says you win these fighting wars, and I'll show you an idiot.
Oh, Carl, you talk like so many young men I've
- I've known.
You talk well.
Literately, intelligently- even brilliantly sometimes.
But you're all talk.
What do you do about your ideas... your ideals?
You mentioned my uniform.
These are my work clothes.
They represent what I'm willing to do... how hard I'm willing to work for what I believe in.
I doubt your willingness for anything... except talk about what you're against.
That talk darn near killed your father.
Mr. Holloway to the Conn, please.
The instruments have all gone crazy, and take a look at the screen.
Incredible.
Absolutely incredible.
- What hit us?
- It doesn't seem possible... but could it be an electric storm center?
Underwater?
High-intensity arcs will burn submerged... and millions of volts discharged in random directions.
Is there any way out of this?
Seems all around.
What about down?
- I don't know.
- Take her down.
- Maximum angle, maximum depth.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Take her down.
Maximum angle, maximum depth.
Sir Ian has evolved a theory.
At first I wasn't about to buy it... but we have eliminated one by one every other logical explanation.
Mmm.
It is rather fantastic.
But, uh... here... is a chart of the Arctic region.
On it I've plotted every instant of these peculiar phenomena... the sinkings, electrical storms... our own experiences.
Now, uh... here is where we encountered the electrical storm.
The Sturgeon was lost about here.
The others here, here... and here.
- Do you see it?
- See what?
The pattern.
The pattern.
Each incident occurred almost precisely 1,000 statute miles from the Pole.
A line drawn through the points of occurrence... makes almost a complete circle around the Pole.
Which adds up to what, Sir Ian?
I cannot accept the idea that these phenomena were... either random or natural.
I believe they were motivated by... some sort of intelligence.
Do you mean that somebody is -
I didn't mean to imply a human intelligence.
Well, what on earth kind of intelligence is it, Sir Ian?
Oh, perhaps...
it's not an intelligence on Earth.
Perhaps it's an intelligence from beyond the Earth.
What can we do about it, sir?
I've been thinking about that.
As you see, these occurrences were on this line... almost a perfect circle around the Pole.
However, there may be a significant break in that ring... here in the area of the Queen Victoria Sea near Franz Josef Land... north of Murmansk and Finland.
Supposing your theorizing is correct... then this could be the next danger point.
Yes.
Yes.
But supposing we, uh, anticipated a little.
Supposing... the Tiger Shark was lurking there, waiting.
He could be right.
We'll chart our course right straight across the Pole and bring us here.
The Queen Victoria Sea.
So, swiftly, implacably... the Tiger Shark moved across the top of the world... toward a rendezvous with what?
We've been running due south along the 30th degree of longitude.
By my reckoning we should be about here, just short of our planned position.
- And that should be..
-Just about the critical point, if we're on the right track.
- Prepare to surface.
Flank speed.
- Aye.
Prepare to surface.
Flank speed.
Mr. Milburn.
Quick, look at this.
Skipper, Reef!
Those chunks of ice are coming right at us.
Dive!
Dive!
Dive!
Dive!
- Determine extent of damage.
- Aft to torpedo room, report.
This is Griff, Captain.
Moderate leak in overhead plates.
Damage to main drive shaft housing.
Forced to full stop.
- We're dead in the water.
- Captain.
Whatever it is, it certainly can travel.
Course and speed.
Speed, about 22 knots.
Course, due north.
Directly toward the Pole.
- Are you two flounders about set?
- We're ready.
Now, try and remember, you're not going out to rehearse a water ballet.
- We need a damage report.
- I never should have volunteered.
If I had enough sense, I would have -
Hey, uh, look out for the sharks, huh?
A pure oval shape... with this cyclops-like eye, or turret, on top.
I'd estimate its diameter at, oh, 300 feet.
No discernible orifices.
The eye of Cyclops.
What did you say, Sir Ian?
Just musing about our one-eyed adversary... and the Homer legend.
The Cyclopes were the sons of heaven... who forged the thunderbolts thrown by Zeus.
Our own cyclops throws quite a thunderbolt itself.
I knew there was something familiar.
Take a look.
This picture was taken by an amateur astronomer over New Mexico.
I've had it since I served on the Air Force Evaluation Board... for U.F.O. Reports.
"Unidentified flying objects."
Then this is a flying saucer.
That was the popular designation, yes.
Weren't all the sightings in the sky, not underwater?
This would explain why there were never any reports of landings.
It's quite possible that whoever or... whatever inhabits this craft... is not a land creature at all... but some form of marine life.
That would make our little green men actually little green fish.
Undersea flying saucers.
- Excuse me, skipper.
- Yeah, Griff?
All internal repairs completed, and frogmen report exterior damage minor.
- Good.
- Then we can get under way, huh?
- Right, sir.
- Dave, you plotted the course of Cyclops?
Then that's our course.
Where he goes, we go until we get him.
Or perhaps until he gets us.
So the Tiger Shark began relentlessly stalking her space enemy.
Up to the Pole, back to the Arctic Circle, again and again.
A week, a fortnight, a month.
Never a glimpse of their enemy, but there were reports.
New disasters, new ships and lives lost.
Invariably, the Tiger Shark made for the scene... only to arrive after Cyclops had left.
For all its desperation, the pursuit seemed fruitless.
And then on July 3, Dr. Kent and Sir Ian... held an urgent discussion with Reef and the skipper.
Why does Cyclops invariably turn to the Pole between attacks?
Never two in succession.
Always away and back, away and back.
We've asked ourselves that over and over a thousand times.
But answers are what we need, not more questions.
We think now we have them.
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.
But suppose it isn't at all.
What if it is magnetic?
Yes.
Yes.
We harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.
Supposing Cyclops does it on a super-scale?
The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all: the Earth itself.
What you're getting at is that you think our saucer friend... must return to the Pole regularly to recharge his batteries.
That may be oversimplifying it.
But, uh -
Now, uh, our present tactics are useless.
But suppose we place ourselves between Cyclops and the Pole.
In such a way as to prevent him returning to the Pole to... as you put it, recharge his batteries.
If we are lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted.
Then we polish him off with an atomic fish.
We wait till the next report of trouble, and then we lie in wait for him... right in his path, and bushwhack him.
- "Bushwhack"?
- Yes, it's an American tactical expression.
Oh.
So, a change of tactics.
Now the Tiger Shark cruised almost over the North Pole... waiting for the radio report that would put the plan into effect.
On July 13, at 1600 hours, it came.
- We got it, Reef.
- Cyclops?
Sounds like a distress signal from a small freighter between Ellesmere Island and Greenland.
- One Mayday, then nothing.
- Where's the skipper?
Already in the Conn.
- We're here.
- All right.
This is where Cyclops knocked off the freighter.
This is the way he has to head for home - the Pole.
Here we are, right in his path.
Sonar and TV-scan the bottom.
Find a good place to hide and lie in wait for him... maybe a cave or a valley.
Rig for silent running.
As soon as we're on the bottom, secure everything that hums or buzzes.
- I want absolute silence.
- Very well.
Rig for silent running.
Hour upon hour, the Tiger Shark lay in its deep-six ambush.
The Arctic depths were as still and silent as an uninhabited world.
And then at 0600 hours -
Skipper, Dr. Kent.
- What is it?
- That's him.
It has to be.
22 miles.
I give it 14 knots.
His radiation level is very low.
That would confirm our theory about having to return to the Pole.
It better be correct.
- Get me a setup on the T.D.C. - about seven miles.
Reef, arm atomic warheads.
Load Tubes 1 and 2, and report to the Conn.
- Sounds like we mean business.
- Yeah.
Griff, you arm number two.
I'll handle number one.
Load one and two.
Open outer doors.
Stand by for action.
Now 15 miles.
- You sure it's Cyclops?
- Take a look.
14.5 miles.
Griff to skipper.
Tubes 1 and 2 loaded.
Outer doors open.
Ready to fire.
Stand by.
Eight miles.
73/ 4 miles.
Zero minus 10... nine, eight... seven, six, five... four, three, two... one, target zero.
Fire 1.
- Number one, fired.
- Fire 2.
Number two, fired.
- How are they running?
- Hot, straight and normal.
Number one missed.
How could it?
We're dead on the target with the homing first.
- What's that?
- A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing and caught our torpedo.
It must function like a degaussing field.
We'll never get a torpedo through that.
Maybe not a torpedo.
Blow all main ballast tanks.
Reactor room, stand by.
As soon as we're off the bottom, I want all ahead, flank.
- What course, skipper?
- Right at our one-eyed friend.
- Right at him?
- That's what I said.
- But what can we accomplish?
- We can ram him.
You've weighed the consequences, Captain, the lives involved?
Doctor, I've weighed the destruction that the Cyclops has done already... and what he'll do in the future unless we stop him right now.
- There must be some other means.
- What other means?
If the Tiger Shark can't stop him, no power on Earth can.
Now brace yourselves.
Sound the collision alarm.
We got him, skipper.
Drove right into him.
Look at that.
Speared him like a fish.
We did it, boys.
Dove right through the saucer's side.
Reactor room, give me all reverse, full.
We're stuck tight.
Skipper, take a look at this depth gauge.
180 fathoms?
We can't be sinking that fast.
It's our screws, skipper.
At our declination angle, running in reverse... they're pulling the shark and cyclops right to the bottom.
And we're at safe maximum depth already.
- Full stop.
- Full stop.
Hours later, the two titanic craft were still locked together... in an apparent death grip... on the bottom of the Arctic Ocean... nearly 1200 feet below the surface.
Well, anybody got any ideas?
Anything's better than lying here.
Suppose there's some kind of atmosphere inside the Cyclops.
What do you mean?
Well, maybe we could get inside the saucer.
We could use our torches...
- to cut the Shark loose.
- That's all very well, young man.
How would one go about getting inside Cyclops?
Through the eye using the depth explorer.
Yes.
The explorer was built to operate at even greater depths.
Yeah, but suppose there isn't any atmosphere inside the saucer.
Well, then the idea's no good.
But we're no worse off than we are now.
- You've gotta let us try, skipper.
- Us?
Reef and I could take the explorer down, clamp it onto the eye -
No.
You can't, but I can.
I can deliver you to the eye.
Then you -
A little out of your line, isn't it?
Why don't you stay aboard and make a speech?
Maybe you could get them to ban flying saucers.
Listen, Holloway.
However our ideas disagree, I've said before, I'm not a coward.
And it happens you have no choice.
Either I take you down there in the Lungfish...
- or you don't get there.
- I'd sooner swim.
- That's enough, both of you.
- Very well, sir.
No use making the odds any longer than they are.
It so happens that Dr. Neilson's right.
Get the explorer in the air lock and prepare for launching.
- Better take Carney and Powell with you.
- The frogmen?
That's right.
Their underwater experience might make them invaluable.
- You'll need sidearms.
- Sidearms?
The saucer's dead.
- You hope.
- We better get ready.
Girls, you go everywhere I go.
All right, Carl.
There's still time.
- You wanna show me how?
- Get in.
Ready to open air lock door, Captain.
Go ahead, Griff.
- What now?
- What do you say, Doctor?
- Shall we take a chance?
- That's what we came for.
You all stay here.
I'm gonna take a look inside.
Not alone, you're not.
Better breathe your oxygen, just in case.
- Air, pure air, under pressure.
- That's a relief.
Well, we won't need these tanks.
Good luck, men.
All right, let's go.
The bow drilled through her, but she sealed herself right up.
Yeah, there's our problem.
The saw-teeth of the ram are caught in the break.
Now, if we can cut it away, the Shark can pull herself loose.
- I think you're right.
- Powell, go back to Dr. Neilson.
Tell him to report to the skipper.
All right, let's get to work.
We read you, Doctor.
Go ahead.
They're inside the Cyclops.
It's full of breathable air.
- Wonderful.
- That's great, Doctor.
Reef thinks that he can clear the Shark's bow so we can pull ourselves loose.
What's it like inside the Cyclops?
This is a priceless opportunity to -
Doctor, tell Reef to make sure that you're in the clear before we make another move.
Right.
Over.
- We may get out of this yet.
- Skipper.
- Could you take a look here?
- What's wrong, Griff?
The inertial navigation system must've been knocked out in the crash.
We're dead in the water, but it indicates we're moving.
- That's impossible.
- The radiation level from the saucer is rising.
What direction does the system indicate?
Due north at five knots.
No, six.
Toward the Pole.
But that Cyclops is dead.
We killed it, didn't we?
Beats me.
- Dave.
- Yeah?
Do you hear anything?
I don't hear anything.
You've been down here too long.
You better go topside and rest.
Strange you don't hear it.
- Reef.
- Huh?
You know something?
I think it's getting lighter in here.
Yeah.
Yeah, it is.
If I didn't know better...
I'd swear we were moving.
Well, let's get back to work, and maybe we will be soon.
I'm getting an impression of movement, Captain.
Is that possible?
We get the same reaction up here.
Now they're feeling it down below.
The radiation level, constantly rising.
As we near the Pole.
There's got to be an explanation.
I think there is.
I believe our friend Cyclops is returning to life.
Commander Holloway, listen.
- Dave.
- Commander Holloway, make no resistance.
Did you hear it?
That sound again?
This time it was a voice.
It called my name.
Look, why don't you go topside?
You will see-that avails nothing.
Where do you think the sound was coming from?
Down there somewhere.
Carney!
Carney, help me!
Carney!
Help me, Carney!
Help me!
Carney!
Carney, help!
Remove your weapons, Commander.
And come here below.
- Come where?
- To me, here.
That voice again?
It wants me to go alone.
Oh, it does, does it?
You better stay here.
So, Commander Holloway, as you Earth inhabitants would express it... we meet, face-to-face.
That's a face?
Roint of view is everything.
To us, your form of life is ugly... as we appear to you.
Tell me something.
Why is it that I can hear you and the others can't?
You do not hear me.
Our individual brain frequencies are now attuned... and we exchange wave-thoughts.
You mean, extrasensory perception?
Whatever your Earth term may be... the principle is ancient and very simple.
It is not necessary for you to speak.
Your thought response will suffice.
My mission is to study various solar systems and planets.
Select the most suitable for colonization.
For horrors like yourself?
Of course.
It may interest you to know I have visited hundreds of other worlds... and of all of them, your Earth seems most suitable.
Swell.
Your friend was to remain where he was.
- He did.
- I am afraid not.
- Dave.
- What's going on in here, lad?
What -
Stand away from him, Commander.
He wants you back.
So this is your headquarters.
Well, you've sunk your last ship, you -
Why not me?
What am I, the closing act?
On the contrary.
I want you unharmed, perfect.
Why?
I have selected you to return with me... along with several other specimens for study.
We will examine you and the others... discover desirable features to incorporate in our Earth colonizers.
And you just build them in, huh?
Of course.
Evolution is much too slow a process.
On Earth, you build with inanimate material.
We employ living tissue.
This space vehicle, for example.
It is a living thing.
When damaged- you would say "wounded" - it immediately heals itself.
Oh, that's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you.
Of course.
But it is time to begin the return voyage.
To navigate, won't you have to see your way?
Obviously.
It'll be rough!
- Back to the Shark, right now.
- What about Dave and the others?
Fortunes of war.
Skipper, this is Reef from the depth explorer.
- Pull loose!
- Right, Reef.
Reactor room, get me all back.
Emergency.
- Well, what about the -
- Skipper, we didn't kill it.
And if that thing ever gets back to where it came from... the Earth is doomed and everybody on it.
We've pulled loose, Captain.
We're free!
There it goes.
Headed straight for the Pole, 50 knots.
Nothing we can do.
Excuse me, Captain.
There may be one last desperate chance.
What's that?
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the I.C.B.M... so it would home on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
What about the time?
The Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge its power banks.
Well, it's worth a chance.
Reef, take over as navigator and see if you can find us an air hole in the ice.
- Let's go.
- Very well.
Adapt a complicated guidance system to a huge ballistic rocket.
Convert it to a water-to-air interceptor missile.
It was foolish.
It was insane.
It was fantastic.
But it was their only hope... and the Earth's only hope.
- Ready?
- As ready as we can be.
I'll report to the skipper.
Skipper... we found our hole in the ice.
What's the corrected bearing to the magnetic pole?
357 degrees.
Prepare the I.C.B.M. for firing.
Well, that's about all we can do until our space friend decides to blast off.
Skipper, I think it's -
Fire!
Fire!
Attention, all hands.
We got him.
Cigarette?
Ah, they're so remote, the stars.
- Hmm.
- Cold and beautiful.
- Now I wonder.
- Yeah?
Which is the one?
The one we have to worry about?
Well, we have enough ills here to worry about.
But maybe, just maybe... when their ship doesn't return, they'll decide not to come here after all.
But if they do?
- Well.
- Oh, I wouldn't worry.
Knowing we have boats like the Tiger Shark... men like you, skipper...
Dave, Sir Ian, Kent, and my father-
And his egghead son.
We'll give 'em a rough reception, won't we?
You know, I think I lost my little black book on that lousy thing.
[Man Narrating] It cost Commander Robert Reary... 20 years of unremitting hardship and misery... to reach the North Role finally in 1909.
It would have astounded Reary to learn that by the late 1 950s and early '60s... the vast, frozen top of the world he pioneered... had become a vital highway for world travel and commerce.
Not just in the skies... but also deep under the ice... in the frigid five-million-square-mile depths of the Arctic Ocean.
Here, great passenger-and cargo-carrying atomic submarines... glided by the dozens back and forth across the Role... until a series of mysterious undersea disasters... threatened to close the Arctic route forever.
The decisive moment came May 3 at 13 15 hours... when the undersea atomic liner, Sturgeon, largest of them all... reached 87 degrees, 10 minutes north latitude... only a few miles from the North Role itself.
[Electricity Crackling]
[Narrator] According to the official reports... the next phase of the life-and-death drama... occurred May 1 0 in Washington... at a hush-hush supersecret meeting... of the Arctic theater war room.
Gentlemen, this is the man we've been waiting for.
The skipper of the atom killer sub, Tiger Shark.
Commander Dan Wendover.
This is Justin Murdock, secretary of defense.
- Mr. Murdock.
- Commander.
And I know you've heard a lot of Dr. Clifford Kent, Dan.
- Doctor.
- Commander.
Dr. Kent had a lot to do with the development and design of your boat.
Sir Ian Hunt just flew in from London.
The Dr. Hunt, winner of the Nobel Prize for oceanography?
Oh, let's just say I took the bow for a team of very brilliant associates.
Uh, sit down.
Gentlemen, to begin, let me read you just one line... from a detailed staff study prepared for theJoint Chiefs.
"In our judgment, these Arctic disasters... may prove the gravest emergency in all history."
Any comments on that statement?
A bit fanciful, isn't it, sir?
Possibly.
Let me read you, uh, a partial list of observed phenomena.
"Destruction of four surface vessels.
Largest, 1 0,000 tons.
"Radioactivity in Arctic waters, flow ice and bergs.
"Reculiar television images preceding each distress call.
"Seven polar atom subs... vanished without a trace. "
"Fanciful," did you say, uh, Sir Ian?
[Chuckles]
And now, Dan, we come to you.
You skipper the Tiger Shark... the most advanced, the deadliest killer sub in the fleet.
Right now she's undergoing emergency around-the-clock modification... in the Bremerton Navy Yard.
The orders call for special observation and testing instruments here... removal of all but two atomic torpedoes... special launching equipment for water-to-air ballistic missiles... and a special escape hatch in the keel for the Lungfish.
The Lungfish?
Yes.
Uh, a deep exploration device, sort of an animated diving bell.
The mission of the Tiger Shark... is to hunt down and identify the cause of these Arctic disasters.
If humanly possible... you will remove it.
[Man] Not that I don't think Lieutenant Commander Holloway... is the finest exec in the entire sub fleet,Julie... and not that he isn't the best friend that I have -
Come on, Dave.
You talk too much.
Now be quiet, little mother.
I
- I feel behooved to warn you... our friend Reef is no less than the number one howl in the entire sub wolf pack.
Nuclear powered.
And when it comes to women
- Well... he has got a built-in sonar detector that -
Dave, you know you're exaggerating, old buddy-buddy.
You know it.
Yes, you are.
You know, on most boats, a certain loyalty exists... between the exec and his navigation and firing officer... but in the case of Lieutenant David Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself-
But su
- She's a nice girl.
Uh, I've seen you work.
I think she deserves a fighting chance.
Helen, I appeal to you.
Dave, look at me.
I'm the mother of your three children.
Will you please take me home to them at once?
There you are.
Just drop in anytime.
Don't bother to call.Just
-Just drop in.
That's my way of life.
[Sighs]
Dave is exaggerating, you know.
I mean, a man spends three months in a deep freeze... it'll take his whole leave just to thaw him out.
By that time, he's ready to report back.
It won't take me long to defrost.
Not around you.
What was I saying about thawing out icebergs?
Yeah, you, uh - You never can tell about icebergs.
Only show one-ninth above water.
After that kiss, I'd say that's about right.
- Do you feel anything?
- Are you kidding?
No, I mean that this is just the beginning of something.
That we didn't just meet accidentally.
Oh, that's original.
Doesn't the next chorus go something like...
"Let's not waste one precious golden moment.
Any second there could be a knock on the door and -"
Well, I've seen stranger things happen.
It happens all the time to heroes on television, plays, motion pictures.
The hero gets his leave canceled, and he's -
And she spends the rest of her life wishing that she'd -
Oh, honey.
Let's not waste one precious moment then.
[Knocking On Door]
What's that pounding?
Need I say more?
Mmm.
Reef, look.
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?
What is it?
Oh, no.
[Dave] Reef.
- They caught you too, huh?
- At the worst possible moment.
Tomorrow's Janie's birthday.
Poor little kid's been looking forward two whole months to having her daddy home.
- Now -
- That's the worst possible moment?
What could be worse than disappointing a little girl?
Disappointing a big girl.
Julie?
[Laughing]
Really tough, old buddy.
[Laughing]
Oh, really tough.
[Laughing]
Skipper, I thought you were going to Washington.
I did.Just got back.
Reef, I want you to meet a couple of our passengers.
Sir Ian Hunt and Dr. Clifford Kent.
My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
- Glad to know you, sir.
- How do you do?
- Dr. Kent.
Met you before.
- Yes indeed, Commander.
You gentlemen are going with us.
What for?
We'll discuss that later.
Roberts.
- Have Chief Griffin report to me as soon as the crew's aboard.
- Yes, sir.
- Watkins.
- Yes, sir.
- Will you show these gentlemen to their quarters?
- Aye, aye, sir.
This way.
Well.
Sorry we had to cut your leave short.
- Yeah.
- Come at the wrong time?
Yeah.
Will do.
- Oh, it's you.
- Yeah.
Griff, what's the scoop?
Hauled out in the middle of the night, all leaves canceled.
We going to war, or what?
Don't you worry, Chester.
When the skipper wants you to know what's going on, he'll tell ya.
Okay?
- I don't like it.
I mean, this is all mighty funny.
- Ah, isn't it, though?
Suppose you get aboard anyway.
- I don't like it.
- What did you say?
I like it.
I like it.
Hey.
Well, skipper, I think I'll stow my gear.
- Well, Reef, I got some bad news for ya.
- Oh, yeah?
- You're gonna have to share quarters this trip.
- Who with?
- Dr. Neilsen.
- Dr. Neilsen?
When did that happen?
- Huh?
- Oh, it's all right.
We're old friends.
Dave, stand by to shove off as soon as Griff reports the crew aboard.
Right, skipper.
Well, looks like we're gonna share quarters, skipper.
Been a long -
Carl.
You?
Oh, of course.
I should have suspected when I heard that "doctor."
- I thought it was your father.
- It was supposed to be.
- Dad had a heart attack two days ago.
- He what?
It was mild.
He'll be all right.
But it was out of the question his coming along.
And they thought you could replace the skipper, huh?
There was no choice.
Dad and I developed the Lungfish together.
Except for him, I'm the only one qualified to dive in it.
- You could have trained somebody else.
- Not in two days.
Look, do you think I wanted to come?
If it didn't mean so much to Dad, proving his depth explorer, I certainly wouldn't be here.
That I can believe.
[Narrator] The Tiger Shark left her dock at Bremerton at 0335 hours... the morning of May 1 1... on what was to prove the strangest, most fearful voyage ever made by a submarine... atomic or otherwise.
Simultaneously with the Shark's departure... and with his crew still in the dark concerning their secret, fateful mission...
Skipper Wendover made the first notation in the log.
The men would remain unbriefed for two hours... until the Tiger Shark cleared Ruget Sound... and was headed for open sea.
Who the devil belongs to this gear?
[Man] Uh, we do, Chief.
Oh.
You two guys, huh?
And just what do you do around here?
Underwater demolition.
Seaman First Class Powell, and I'm Carney.
Yeah, I know.
So you're frogmen.
Yeah, we're off tin cans.
We've, uh, looked the pigboat over from, uh, fore to aft... but can't seem to find an empty locker, uh, to store our stuff in.
An empty locker?
In a sub?
Are you kiddin'?
This whole deal is makin' less and less sense to me.
What are frogmen doin'aboard the Tiger Shark?
Following orders, like everyone else in the navy.
Beats me.
But orders are orders.
Yeah, well, uh, in the meantime, where do you want us to stash these gizmos?
Come on.
[Narrator] Shortly before dawn... the Tiger Shark, running submerged at better than 30 knots... had left the sound behind... and was headed for open sea.
Here are our orders, Reef.
Look 'em over while I fill in the crew.
Now hear this.
This is the captain speaking.
I know you're wondering about all the mystery.
[Wendover On P.A.] Well, our job had to be kept absolutely secret.
Our mission is to find out what caused the disasters under the Arctic ice.
Once we cross the Arctic Circle, any command you hear will be the real thing.
Rlease remember it.
That's about it.
Now you know as much as I or anybody else does, for that matter.
Oh, incidentally, I assured Washington... that this was the best sub crew in the fleet.
I know you won't make a liar out of me.
Carry on.
That's it.
What do you think?
I think I should have joined the air force.
[Narrator] A week later, the Tiger Shark was still running due north at cruising speed.
So far, the voyage was routine, uneventful.
But the nearer they came to the Arctic Circle... the more the tension increased... the more tiny irritations were magnified into bitter feuds... the more the crewmen pondered their possible fate.
On the morning of May 20... the Tiger Shark crossed the Arctic Circle into the critical area.
You're always asking me why I stay a bachelor.
There goes one of the best reasons I can think of.
- Huh?
- Yeah.
I might have a son like that.
I don't get it.
What goes with you two?
I guess his father, Skipper Neilsen, retired before you enrolled at the academy, didn't he?
I guess.
One of the finest men and officers alive.
A real hero in the best sense of the word.
World War II.
Taught engineering and design at the academy.
- Fought like a demon for atomic subs.
- So?
So, when his only son dropped out of school, began making statements... all sounding like borrowed propaganda -
"Ban the atomic test." "Junk the nuclear subs."
"Spend the military budget for peace."
Well, it just about broke the old man's heart.
Then when the newspapers picked it up... called Carl the honest, sincere son of a warmongering father... well, Captain Neilsen resigned from the navy.
Oh, he still keeps his hand in with projects like the Lungfish... but it broke him all the same.
Have, uh
- Have you talked to Carl?
Tried to get his side?
His side?
He's all front with no back.
How can he have a side?
Either of you men seen Dr. Neilsen?
He's in here, sir.
Oh, uh, Tuttle, Powell, would you men mind leaving us alone for a few minutes?
Sure, Mr. Holloway.
Dr. Neilsen.
What is it?
You are out.
This came for you.
- My father?
- Dead?
No.
As a matter of fact, he's a lot better.
Just got out of the hospital.
- What did you mean I'm out?
- Your father can be in Nome, Alaska tomorrow.
We have two choices.
We can ask them to bring him out by helicopter and take you off... or we can put the Shark back into Nome.
You trade school boys are all alike, aren't you?
Anybody who doesn't think like a little gold-braided puppet is ipso facto a coward.
You said it.
I didn't.
Well, wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, Commander.
It just so happens I'm not a coward - physical or mental.
And before I'd risk my father's life -
- We're all risking our lives.
- That may be... but Dad stays where he is, and I'm staying here.
Oh, you are a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
Well, perhaps.
But the idea of willingly going to school... to spend my life at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder lizards -
I'm referring to war- that strikes me as the worst cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow.
- You mean nothing's worth fighting for?
- Peace.
The dignity of man, destiny of human spirit.
Now, you show me a man who says you win these fighting wars, and I'll show you an idiot.
Oh, Carl, you talk like so many young men I've
- I've known.
You talk well.
Literately, intelligently- even brilliantly sometimes.
But you're all talk.
What do you do about your ideas... your ideals?
You mentioned my uniform.
These are my work clothes.
They represent what I'm willing to do... how hard I'm willing to work for what I believe in.
I doubt your willingness for anything... except talk about what you're against.
That talk darn near killed your father.
[Loud Bang]
- [Man On R.A.] Mr. Holloway to the conn, please.
- [Alarm Blaring]
[Dave] The instruments have all gone crazy, and take a look at the screen.
Incredible.
Absolutely incredible.
- What hit us?
- It doesn't seem possible... but could it be an electric storm center?
Underwater?
[Dr. Kent] High-intensity arcs will burn submerged... and millions of volts discharged in random directions.
Is there any way out of this?
Seems all around.
What about down?
- I don't know.
- Take her down.
- Maximum angle, maximum depth.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Take her down.
Maximum angle, maximum depth.
Sir Ian has evolved a theory.
At first I wasn't about to buy it... but we have eliminated one by one every other logical explanation.
Mmm.
It is rather fantastic.
But, uh... here... is a chart of the Arctic region.
On it I've plotted every instant of these peculiar phenomena... the sinkings, electrical storms... our own experiences.
Now, uh... here is where we encountered the electrical storm.
The Sturgeon was lost about here.
The others here, here... and here.
- Do you see it?
- See what?
The pattern.
The pattern.
Each incident occurred almost precisely 1 ,000 statute miles from the Pole.
A line drawn through the points of occurrence... makes almost a complete circle around the Pole.
Which adds up to what, Sir Ian?
I cannot accept the idea that these phenomena were... either random or natural.
I believe they were motivated by... some sort of intelligence.
Do you mean that somebody is -
I didn't mean to imply a human intelligence.
Well, what on earth kind of intelligence is it, Sir Ian?
Oh, perhaps...
it's not an intelligence on Earth.
Perhaps it's an intelligence from beyond the Earth.
What can we do about it, sir?
I've been thinking about that.
As you see, these occurrences were on this line... almost a perfect circle around the Pole.
However, there may be a significant break in that ring... here in the area of the Queen Victoria Sea near FranzJosef Land... north of Murmansk and Finland.
Supposing your theorizing is correct... then this could be the next danger point.
Yes.
Yes.
But supposing we, uh, anticipated a little.
Supposing... the Tiger Shark was lurking there, waiting.
He could be right.
We'll chart our course right straight across the Pole and bring us here.
The Queen Victoria Sea.
[Narrator] So, swiftly, implacably... the Tiger Shark moved across the top of the world... toward a rendezvous with what?
We've been running due south along the 30th degree of longitude.
By my reckoning we should be about here, just short of our planned position.
- And that should be -
-Just about the critical point, if we're on the right track.
- Prepare to surface.
Flank speed.
- Aye.
Prepare to surface.
Flank speed.
Mr. Milburn.
Quick, look at this.
Skipper, Reef!
Those chunks of ice are coming right at us.
Dive!
Dive!
Dive!
Dive!
- Determine extent of damage.
- Aft to torpedo room, report.
This is Griff, Captain.
Moderate leak in overhead plates.
Damage to main driveshaft housing.
Forced to full stop.
- We're dead in the water.
- [Dave] Captain.
[Reef] Whatever it is, it certainly can travel.
Course and speed.
Speed, about 22 knots.
Course, due north.
Directly toward the Pole.
- Are you two flounders about set?
- We're ready.
Now, try and remember, you're not going out to rehearse a water ballet.
- We need a damage report.
- I never should have volunteered.
If I had enough sense, I would have -
Hey, uh, look out for the sharks, huh?
A pure oval shape... with this cyclops-like eye, or turret, on top.
I'd estimate its diameter at, oh, 300 feet.
No discernible orifices.
The eye of Cyclops.
What did you say, Sir Ian?
Just musing about our one-eyed adversary... and the Homer legend.
The Cyclopes were the sons of heaven... who forged the thunderbolts thrown by Zeus.
Our own cyclops throws quite a thunderbolt itself.
I knew there was something familiar.
Take a look.
This picture was taken by an amateur astronomer over New Mexico.
I've had it since I served on the Air Force Evaluation Board... for U.F.O. Reports.
"Unidentified flying objects."
Then this is a flying saucer.
That was the popular designation, yes.
Weren't all the sightings in the sky, not underwater?
This would explain why there were never any reports of landings.
It's quite possible that whoever or... whatever inhabits this craft... is not a land creature at all... but some form of marine life.
That would make our little green men actually little green fish.
Undersea flying saucers.
- Excuse me, skipper.
- Yeah, Griff?
All internal repairs completed, and frogmen report exterior damage minor.
- Good.
- Then we can get under way, huh?
- Right, sir.
- Dave, you plotted the course of Cyclops?
Then that's our course.
Where he goes, we go until we get him.
Or perhaps until he gets us.
[Narrator] So the Tiger Shark began relentlessly stalking her space enemy.
Up to the Role, back to the Arctic Circle, again and again.
A week, a fortnight, a month.
[Narrator] Never a glimpse of their enemy, but there were reports.
New disasters, new ships and lives lost.
Invariably, the Tiger Shark made for the scene... only to arrive after Cyclops had left.
For all its desperation, the pursuit seemed fruitless.
And then on July 3, Dr. Kent and Sir Ian... held an urgent discussion with Reef and the skipper.
Why does Cyclops invariably turn to the Pole between attacks?
Never two in succession.
Always away and back, away and back.
We've asked ourselves that over and over a thousand times.
But answers are what we need, not more questions.
We think now we have them.
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.
But suppose it isn't at all.
What if it is magnetic?
Yes.
Yes.
We harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.
Supposing Cyclops does it on a superscale?
The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all: the Earth itself.
What you're getting at is that you think our saucer friend... must return to the Pole regularly to recharge his batteries.
That may be oversimplifying it.
But, uh -
Now, uh, our present tactics are useless.
But suppose we place ourselves between Cyclops and the Pole.
In such a way as to prevent him returning to the Pole to... as you put it, recharge his batteries.
If we are lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted.
Then we polish him off with an atomic fish.
We wait till the next report of trouble, and then we lie in wait for him... right in his path, and bushwhack him.
- "Bushwhack"?
- Yes, it's an American tactical expression.
Oh.
[Narrator] So, a change of tactics.
Now the Tiger Shark cruised almost over the North Role... waiting for the radio report that would put the plan into effect.
On July 1 3, at 1 600 hours, it came.
- We got it, Reef.
- Cyclops?
Sounds like a distress signal from a small freighter between Ellesmere Island and Greenland.
- One Mayday, then nothing.
- Where's the skipper?
Already in the conn.
- [Dave] We're here.
-[Wendover] All right.
This is where Cyclops knocked off the freighter.
This is the way he has to head for home - the Pole.
Here we are, right in his path.
Sonar and TV-scan the bottom.
Find a good place to hide and lie in wait for him... maybe a cave or a valley.
Rig for silent running.
As soon as we're on the bottom, secure everything that hums or buzzes.
- I want absolute silence.
- Very well.
Rig for silent running.
[Narrator] Hour upon hour, the Tiger Shark lay in its deep-six ambush.
The Arctic depths were as still and silent as an uninhabited world.
And then at 0600 hours -
[Clicking]
Skipper, Dr. Kent.
- What is it?
- That's him.
It has to be.
Range: 22 miles.
Speed:
I give it 1 4 knots.
His radiation level is very low.
That would confirm our theory about having to return to the Pole.
It better be correct.
Get me a setup on the T.D.C. Range: about seven miles.
Reef, arm atomic warheads.
Load Tubes 1 and 2, and report to the conn.
- Sounds like we mean business.
- Yeah.
Griff, you arm number two.
I'll handle number one.
[Machinery Whirring, Beeping]
Load one and two.
Open outer doors.
Stand by for action.
Range: now 1 5 miles.
- You sure it's Cyclops?
- Take a look.
Range: 1 4.5 miles.
Griff to skipper.
Tubes 1 and 2 loaded.
Outer doors open.
Ready to fire.
Stand by.
[Beeping]
Range: eight miles.
Range: 7 3/ 4 miles.
Zero minus 1 0... nine, eight... seven, six, five... four, three, two... one, target zero.
Fire 1 .
- Number one, fired.
- Fire 2.
Number two, fired.
- How are they running?
- Hot, straight and normal.
Number one missed.
How could it?
We're dead on the target with the homing first.
- What's that?
- A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing and caught our torpedo.
It must function like a degaussing field.
We'll never get a torpedo through that.
Maybe not a torpedo.
Blow all main ballast tanks.
Reactor room, stand by.
As soon as we're off the bottom, I want all ahead, flank.
-[Dave] What course, skipper?
- Right at our one-eyed friend.
- Right at him?
- That's what I said.
- But what can we accomplish?
- We can ram him.
You've weighed the consequences, Captain, the lives involved?
Doctor, I've weighed the destruction that the Cyclops has done already... and what he'll do in the future unless we stop him right now.
- There must be some other means.
- What other means?
If the Tiger Shark can't stop him, no power on Earth can.
Now brace yourselves.
Sound the collision alarm.
[Siren Blaring]
[Rumbling]
We got him, skipper.
Drove right into him.
Look at that.
Speared him like a fish.
We did it, boys.
Dove right through the saucer's side.
Reactor room, give me all reverse, full.
We're stuck tight.
Skipper, take a look at this depth gauge.
1 80 fathoms?
We can't be sinking that fast.
It's our screws, skipper.
At our declination angle, running in reverse... they're pulling the shark and cyclops right to the bottom.
And we're at safe maximum depth already.
- Full stop.
- Full stop.
[Thuds]
[Narrator] Hours later, the two titanic craft were still locked together... in an apparent death grip... on the bottom of the Arctic Ocean... nearly 1 200 feet below the surface.
Well, anybody got any ideas?
Anything's better than lying here.
Suppose there's some kind of atmosphere inside the Cyclops.
What do you mean?
Well, maybe we could get inside the saucer.
We could use our torches...
- to cut the Shark loose.
- That's all very well, young man.
How would one go about getting inside Cyclops?
Through the eye using the depth explorer.
Yes.
The explorer was built to operate at even greater depths.
Yeah, but suppose there isn't any atmosphere inside the saucer.
Well, then the idea's no good.
But we're no worse off than we are now.
-[Dave] You've gotta let us try, skipper.
- Us?
Reef and I could take the explorer down, clamp it onto the eye -
[Neilsen] No.
You can't, but I can.
I can deliver you to the eye.
Then you -
A little out of your line, isn't it?
Why don't you stay aboard and make a speech?
Maybe you could get them to ban flying saucers.
Listen, Holloway.
However our ideas disagree, I've said before, I'm not a coward.
And it happens you have no choice.
Either I take you down there in the Lungfish...
- or you don't get there.
- I'd sooner swim.
- That's enough, both of you.
- Very well, sir.
No use making the odds any longer than they are.
It so happens that Dr. Neilsen's right.
Get the explorer in the air lock and prepare for launching.
- Better take Carney and Powell with you.
- The frogmen?
That's right.
Their underwater experience might make them invaluable.
- You'll need sidearms.
- Sidearms?
The saucer's dead.
- You hope.
- We better get ready.
Girls, you go everywhere I go.
All right, Carl.
There's still time.
- You wanna show me how?
- Get in.
[Griff On R.A.] Ready to open air lock door, Captain.
Go ahead, Griff.
- What now?
- What do you say, Doctor?
- Shall we take a chance?
- That's what we came for.
You all stay here.
I'm gonna take a look inside.
Not alone, you're not.
Better breathe your oxygen, just in case.
- Air, pure air, under pressure.
- That's a relief.
Well, we won't need these tanks.
Good luck, men.
All right, let's go.
The bow drilled through her, but she sealed herself right up.
Yeah, there's our problem.
The sawteeth of the ram are caught in the break.
Now, if we can cut it away, the Shark can pull herself loose.
- I think you're right.
- Powell, go back to Dr. Neilsen.
Tell him to report to the skipper.
All right, let's get to work.
We read you, Doctor.
Go ahead.
They're inside the Cyclops.
It's full of breathable air.
- Wonderful.
- That's great, Doctor.
Reef thinks that he can clear the Shark's bow so we can pull ourselves loose.
What's it like inside the Cyclops?
This is a priceless opportunity to -
Doctor, tell Reef to make sure that you're in the clear before we make another move.
Right.
Over.
- We may get out of this yet.
-Skipper.
- Could you take a look here?
- What's wrong, Griff?
The inertial navigation system must've been knocked out in the crash.
We're dead in the water, but it indicates we're moving.
- That's impossible.
- The radiation level from the saucer is rising.
What direction does the system indicate?
Due north at five knots.
No, six.
Toward the Pole.
But that Cyclops is dead.
We killed it, didn't we?
Beats me.
- Dave.
- Yeah?
Do you hear anything?
I don't hear anything.
You've been down here too long.
You better go topside and rest.
Strange you don't hear it.
- Reef.
- Huh?
You know something?
I think it's getting lighter in here.
Yeah.
Yeah, it is.
If I didn't know better...
I'd swear we were moving.
Well, let's get back to work, and maybe we will be soon.
I'm getting an impression of movement, Captain.
Is that possible?
We get the same reaction up here.
Now they're feeling it down below.
The radiation level, constantly rising.
As we near the Pole.
There's got to be an explanation.
I think there is.
I believe our friend Cyclops is returning to life.
[Male Voice] Commander Holloway, listen.
- Dave.
- Commander Holloway, make no resistance.
Did you hear it?
That sound again?
This time it was a voice.
It called my name.
Look, why don't you go topside?
[Voice] You will see- that avails nothing.
Where do you think the sound was coming from?
Down there somewhere.
[Low-pitched Hum]
[Hum Continues]
[High-pitched Hum]
[Loud Hum]
Carney!
Carney, help me!
CarneyI Help me, CarneyI Help meI
[Hum Increases]
CarneyI Carney, helpI
[Hum Continues]
[Grunting]
- [Cracking] - [Gasping]
[Retching]
[Voice] Remove your weapons, Commander.
And come here below.
- Come where?
- To me, here.
That voice again?
It wants me to go alone.
Oh, it does, does it?
You better stay here.
So, Commander Holloway, as you Earth inhabitants would express it... we meet, face-to-face.
That's a face?
Roint of view is everything.
To us, your form of life is ugly... as we appear to you.
Tell me something.
Why is it that I can hear you and the others can't?
You do not hear me.
Our individual brain frequencies are now attuned... and we exchange wave-thoughts.
You mean, extrasensory perception?
Whatever your Earth term may be... the principle is ancient and very simple.
It is not necessary for you to speak.
Your thought response will suffice.
My mission is to study various solar systems and planets.
Select the most suitable for colonization.
[Thinking] For horrors like yourself?
Of course.
It may interest you to know I have visited hundreds of other worlds... and of all of them, your Earth seems most suitable.
[Thinking] Swell.
[Creature] Your friend was to remain where he was.
- [Thinking] He did.
-I am afraid not.
- Dave.
- What's going on in here, lad?
What -
Stand away from him, Commander.
He wants you back.
So this is your headquarters.
Well, you've sunk your last ship, you -
[High-pitched Hum]
[Low Hum]
[Screaming]
[Thinking] Why not me?
What am I, the closing act?
On the contrary.
I want you unharmed, perfect.
[Thinking] Why?
I have selected you to return with me... along with several other specimens for study.
We will examine you and the others... discover desirable features to incorporate in our Earth colonizers.
[Thinking] And you just build them in, huh?
Of course.
Evolution is much too slow a process.
On Earth, you build with inanimate material.
We employ living tissue.
This space vehicle, for example.
It is a living thing.
When damaged- you would say "wounded"- it immediately heals itself.
[Thinking] Oh, that's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you.
Of course.
But it is time to begin the return voyage.
[Thinking] To navigate, won't you have to see your way?
Obviously.
It'll be rough!
[Clicks]
[Clicks]
- Back to the Shark, right now.
- What about Dave and the others?
Fortunes of war.
Skipper, this is Reef from the depth explorer.
- Rull looseI
- Right, Reef.
Reactor room, get me all back.
Emergency.
- Well, what about the -
- Skipper, we didn't kill it.
And if that thing ever gets back to where it came from...
- the Earth is doomed and everybody on it.
- [Rumbling]
[Man On R.A.] We've pulled loose, Captain.
We're freeI
[Reef] There it goes.
Headed straight for the Role, 50 knots.
Nothing we can do.
Excuse me, Captain.
There may be one last desperate chance.
What's that?
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the I.C.B.M.... so it would home on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
What about the time?
The Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge its power banks.
Well, it's worth a chance.
Reef, take over as navigator and see if you can find us an air hole in the ice.
- Let's go.
- Very well.
[Narrator] Adapt a complicated guidance system to a huge ballistic rocket.
Convert it to a water-to-air interceptor missile.
It was foolish.
It was insane.
It was fantastic.
But it was their only hope... and the Earth's only hope.
- Ready?
- As ready as we can be.
I'll report to the skipper.
Skipper... we found our hole in the ice.
What's the corrected bearing to the magnetic pole?
3 57 degrees.
Prepare the I.C.B.M. for firing.
Well, that's about all we can do until our space friend decides to blast off.
Skipper, I think it's -
[Rumbling]
[Buzzing]
Fire!
Fire!
[Explosion Continues]
Attention, all hands.
We got him.
Cigarette?
Ah, they're so remote, the stars.
-[Reef] Hmm.
- Cold and beautiful.
- Now I wonder.
- Yeah?
Which is the one?
The one we have to worry about?
Well, we have enough ills here to worry about.
But maybe,just maybe... when their ship doesn't return, they'll decide not to come here after all.
But if they do?
- Well.
- Oh, I wouldn't worry.
Knowing we have boats like the Tiger Shark... men like you, skipper...
Dave, Sir Ian, Kent, and my father-
And his egghead son.
We'll give 'em a rough reception, won't we?
You know, I think I lost my little black book on that lousy thing.
It cost Commander Robert Peary... 20 years of unremitting hardship and misery... to reach the North Role finally in 1909.
It would have astounded Peary to learn that by the late 1950s and early '60s... the vast, frozen top of the world he pioneered... had become a vital highway for world travel and commerce.
Not just in the skies... but also deep under the ice... in the frigid five-million-square-mile depths of the Arctic Ocean.
Here, great passenger-and cargo-carrying atomic submarines... glided by the dozens back and forth across the Role... until a series of mysterious undersea disasters... threatened to close the Arctic route forever.
The decisive moment came May 3 at 1315 hours... when the undersea atomic liner, Sturgeon, largest of them all... reached 87 degrees, 10 minutes north latitude... only a few miles from the North Role itself.
According to the official reports... the next phase of the life-and-death drama... occurred May 10 in Washington... at a hush-hush supersecret meeting... of the Arctic theater war room.
Gentlemen, this is the man we've been waiting for.
The skipper of the atom killer sub, Tiger Shark.
Commander Dan Wendover.
This is Justin Murdock, secretary of defense.
- Mr. Murdock.
- Commander.
And I know you've heard a lot of Dr. Clifford Kent, Dan.
- Doctor.
- Commander.
Dr. Kent had a lot to do with the development and design of your boat.
Sir Ian Hunt just flew in from London.
The Dr. Hunt, winner of the Nobel Prize for oceanography?
Oh, let's just say I took the bow for a team of very brilliant associates.
Uh, sit down.
Gentlemen, to begin, let me read you just one line... from a detailed staff study prepared for the Joint Chiefs.
"In our judgment, these Arctic disasters... may prove the gravest emergency in all history."
Any comments on that statement?
A bit fanciful, isn't it, sir?
Possibly.
Let me read you, uh, a partial list of observed phenomena.
"Destruction of four surface vessels.
Largest, 10,000 tons.
"Radioactivity in Arctic waters, flow ice and bergs.
"Reculiar television images preceding each distress call.
"Seven polar atom subs... vanished without a trace. "
"Fanciful," did you say, uh, Sir Ian?
And now, Dan, we come to you.
You skipper the Tiger Shark... the most advanced, the deadliest killer sub in the fleet.
Right now she's undergoing emergency around-the-clock modification... in the Bremerton Navy Yard.
The orders call for special observation and testing instruments here... removal of all but two atomic torpedoes... special launching equipment for water-to-air ballistic missiles... and a special escape hatch in the keel for the Lungfish.
The Lungfish?
Yes.
Uh, a deep exploration device, sort of an animated diving bell.
The mission of the Tiger Shark... is to hunt down and identify the cause of these Arctic disasters.
If humanly possible... you will remove it.
Not that I don't think Lieutenant Commander Holloway... is the finest exec in the entire sub fleet,Julie... and not that he isn't the best friend that I have -
Come on, Dave.
You talk too much.
Now be quiet, little mother.
I
- I feel behooved to warn you... our friend Reef is no less than the number one howl in the entire sub wolf pack.
Nuclear powered.
And when it comes to women-Well... he has got a built-in sonar detector that -
Dave, you know you're exaggerating, old buddy-buddy.
You know it.
Yes, you are.
You know, on most boats, a certain loyalty exists... between the exec and his navigation and firing officer... but in the case of Lieutenant David Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself-
But su
- She's a nice girl.
Uh, I've seen you work.
I think she deserves a fighting chance.
Helen, I appeal to you.
Dave, look at me.
I'm the mother of your three children.
Will you please take me home to them at once?
There you are.
Just drop in anytime.
Don't bother to call.Just
-Just drop in.
That's my way of life.
Dave is exaggerating, you know.
I mean, a man spends three months in a deep freeze... it'll take his whole leave just to thaw him out.
By that time, he's ready to report back.
It won't take me long to defrost.
Not around you.
What was I saying about thawing out icebergs?
Yeah, you, uh - You never can tell about icebergs.
Only show one-ninth above water.
After that kiss, I'd say that's about right.
- Do you feel anything?
- Are you kidding?
No, I mean that this is just the beginning of something.
That we didn't just meet accidentally.
Oh, that's original.
Doesn't the next chorus go something like...
"Let's not waste one precious golden moment.
Any second there could be a knock on the door and -"
Well, I've seen stranger things happen.
It happens all the time to heroes on television, plays, motion pictures.
The hero gets his leave canceled, and he's -
And she spends the rest of her life wishing that she'd -
Oh, honey.
Let's not waste one precious moment then.
What's that pounding?
Need I say more?
Mmm.
Reef, look.
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?
What is it?
Oh, no.
Reef.
- They caught you too, huh?
- At the worst possible moment.
Tomorrow's Janie's birthday.
Poor little kid's been looking forward two whole months to having her daddy home.
- Now -
- That's the worst possible moment?
What could be worse than disappointing a little girl?
Disappointing a big girl.
Julie?
Really tough, old buddy.
Oh, really tough.
Skipper, I thought you were going to Washington.
I did.Just got back.
Reef, I want you to meet a couple of our passengers.
Sir Ian Hunt and Dr. Clifford Kent.
My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
- Glad to know you, sir.
- How do you do?
- Dr. Kent.
Met you before.
- Yes indeed, Commander.
You gentlemen are going with us.
What for?
We'll discuss that later.
Roberts.
- Have Chief Griffin report to me as soon as the crew's aboard.
- Yes, sir.
- Watkins.
- Yes, sir.
- Will you show these gentlemen to their quarters?
- Aye, aye, sir.
This way.
Well.
Sorry we had to cut your leave short.
- Yeah.
- Come at the wrong time?
Yeah.
Will do.
- Oh, it's you.
- Yeah.
Griff, what's the scoop?
Hauled out in the middle of the night, all leaves canceled.
We going to war, or what?
Don't you worry, Chester.
When the skipper wants you to know what's going on, he'll tell ya.
Okay?
- I don't like it.
I mean, this is all mighty funny.
- Ah, isn't it, though?
Suppose you get aboard anyway.
- I don't like it.
- What did you say?
I like it.
I like it.
Hey.
Well, skipper, I think I'll stow my gear.
- Well, Reef, I got some bad news for ya.
- Oh, yeah?
- You're gonna have to share quarters this trip.
- Who with?
- Dr. Neilsen.
- Dr. Neilsen?
When did that happen?
- Huh?
- Oh, it's all right.
We're old friends.
Dave, stand by to shove off as soon as Griff reports the crew aboard.
Right, skipper.
Well, looks like we're gonna share quarters, skipper.
Been a long -
Carl.
You?
Oh, of course.
I should have suspected when I heard that "doctor."
- I thought it was your father.
- It was supposed to be.
- Dad had a heart attack two days ago.
- He what?
It was mild.
He'll be all right.
But it was out of the question his coming along.
And they thought you could replace the skipper, huh?
There was no choice.
Dad and I developed the Lungfish together.
Except for him, I'm the only one qualified to dive in it.
- You could have trained somebody else.
- Not in two days.
Look, do you think I wanted to come?
If it didn't mean so much to Dad, proving his depth explorer, I certainly wouldn't be here.
That I can believe.
The Tiger Shark left her dock at Bremerton at 0335 hours... the morning of May 11... on what was to prove the strangest, most fearful voyage ever made by a submarine... atomic or otherwise.
Simultaneously with the Shark's departure... and with his crew still in the dark concerning their secret, fateful mission...
Skipper Wendover made the first notation in the log.
The men would remain unbriefed for two hours... until the Tiger Shark cleared Ruget Sound... and was headed for open sea.
Who the devil belongs to this gear?
Uh, we do, Chief.
Oh.
You two guys, huh?
And just what do you do around here?
Underwater demolition.
Seaman First Class Powell, and I'm Carney.
Yeah, I know.
So you're frogmen.
Yeah, we're off tin cans.
We've, uh, looked the pigboat over from, uh, fore to aft... but can't seem to find an empty locker, uh, to store our stuff in.
An empty locker?
In a sub?
Are you kiddin'?
This whole deal is makin' less and less sense to me.
What are frogmen doin' aboard the Tiger Shark?
Following orders, like everyone else in the navy.
Beats me.
But orders are orders.
Yeah, well, uh, in the meantime, where do you want us to stash these gizmos?
Come on.
Shortly before dawn... the Tiger Shark, running submerged at better than 30 knots... had left the sound behind... and was headed for open sea.
Here are our orders, Reef.
Look 'em over while I fill in the crew.
Now hear this.
This is the captain speaking.
I know you're wondering about all the mystery.
Well, our job had to be kept absolutely secret.
Our mission is to find out what caused the disasters under the Arctic ice.
Once we cross the Arctic Circle, any command you hear will be the real thing.
Please remember it.
That's about it.
Now you know as much as I or anybody else does, for that matter.
Oh, incidentally, I assured Washington... that this was the best sub crew in the fleet.
I know you won't make a liar out of me.
Carry on.
That's it.
What do you think?
I think I should have joined the air force.
A week later, the Tiger Shark was still running due north at cruising speed.
So far, the voyage was routine, uneventful.
But the nearer they came to the Arctic Circle... the more the tension increased... the more tiny irritations were magnified into bitter feuds... the more the crewmen pondered their possible fate.
On the morning of May 20... the Tiger Shark crossed the Arctic Circle into the critical area.
You're always asking me why I stay a bachelor.
There goes one of the best reasons I can think of.
- Huh?
- Yeah.
I might have a son like that.
I don't get it.
What goes with you two?
I guess his father, Skipper Neilsen, retired before you enrolled at the academy, didn't he?
I guess.
One of the finest men and officers alive.
A real hero in the best sense of the word.
World War II.
Taught engineering and design at the academy.
- Fought like a demon for atomic subs.
- So?
So, when his only son dropped out of school, began making statements... all sounding like borrowed propaganda -
"Ban the atomic test." "Junk the nuclear subs."
"Spend the military budget for peace."
Well, it just about broke the old man's heart.
Then when the newspapers picked it up... called Carl the honest, sincere son of a warmongering father... well, Captain Neilsen resigned from the navy.
Oh, he still keeps his hand in with projects like the Lungfish... but it broke him all the same.
Have, uh
- Have you talked to Carl?
Tried to get his side?
His side?
He's all front with no back.
How can he have a side?
Either of you men seen Dr. Neilsen?
He's in here, sir.
Oh, uh, Tuttle, Powell, would you men mind leaving us alone for a few minutes?
Sure, Mr. Holloway.
Dr. Neilsen.
What is it?
You are out.
This came for you.
- My father?
- Dead?
No.
As a matter of fact, he's a lot better.
Just got out of the hospital.
What did you mean I'm out?
- Your father can be in Nome, Alaska tomorrow.
We have two choices.
We can ask them to bring him out by helicopter and take you off... or we can put the Shark back into Nome.
You trade school boys are all alike, aren't you?
Anybody who doesn't think like a little gold-braided puppet is ipso facto a coward.
You said it.
I didn't.
Well, wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, Commander.
It just so happens I'm not a coward - physical or mental.
And before I'd risk my father's life -
- We're all risking our lives.
- That may be... but Dad stays where he is, and I'm staying here.
Oh, you are a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
Well, perhaps.
But the idea of willingly going to school... to spend my life at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder lizards -
I'm referring to war- that strikes me as the worst cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow.
- You mean nothing's worth fighting for?
- Peace.
The dignity of man, destiny of human spirit.
Now, you show me a man who says you win these fighting wars, and I'll show you an idiot.
Oh, Carl, you talk like so many young men I've
- I've known.
You talk well.
Literately, intelligently- even brilliantly sometimes.
But you're all talk.
What do you do about your ideas... your ideals?
You mentioned my uniform.
These are my work clothes.
They represent what I'm willing to do... how hard I'm willing to work for what I believe in.
I doubt your willingness for anything... except talk about what you're against.
That talk darn near killed your father.
Mr. Holloway to the Conn, please.
The instruments have all gone crazy, and take a look at the screen.
Incredible.
Absolutely incredible.
- What hit us?
- It doesn't seem possible... but could it be an electric storm center?
Underwater?
High-intensity arcs will burn submerged... and millions of volts discharged in random directions.
Is there any way out of this?
Seems all around.
What about down?
- I don't know.
- Take her down.
- Maximum angle, maximum depth.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Take her down.
Maximum angle, maximum depth.
Sir Ian has evolved a theory.
At first I wasn't about to buy it... but we have eliminated one by one every other logical explanation.
Mmm.
It is rather fantastic.
But, uh... here... is a chart of the Arctic region.
On it I've plotted every instant of these peculiar phenomena... the sinkings, electrical storms... our own experiences.
Now, uh... here is where we encountered the electrical storm.
The Sturgeon was lost about here.
The others here, here... and here.
- Do you see it?
- See what?
The pattern.
The pattern.
Each incident occurred almost precisely 1,000 statute miles from the Pole.
A line drawn through the points of occurrence... makes almost a complete circle around the Pole.
Which adds up to what, Sir Ian?
I cannot accept the idea that these phenomena were... either random or natural.
I believe they were motivated by... some sort of intelligence.
Do you mean that somebody is -
I didn't mean to imply a human intelligence.
Well, what on earth kind of intelligence is it, Sir Ian?
Oh, perhaps...
it's not an intelligence on Earth.
Perhaps it's an intelligence from beyond the Earth.
What can we do about it, sir?
I've been thinking about that.
As you see, these occurrences were on this line... almost a perfect circle around the Pole.
However, there may be a significant break in that ring... here in the area of the Queen Victoria Sea near Franz Josef Land... north of Murmansk and Finland.
Supposing your theorizing is correct... then this could be the next danger point.
Yes.
Yes.
But supposing we, uh, anticipated a little.
Supposing... the Tiger Shark was lurking there, waiting.
He could be right.
We'll chart our course right straight across the Pole and bring us here.
The Queen Victoria Sea.
So, swiftly, implacably... the Tiger Shark moved across the top of the world... toward a rendezvous with what?
We've been running due south along the 30th degree of longitude.
By my reckoning we should be about here, just short of our planned position.
- And that should be -
- Just about the critical point, if we're on the right track.
- Prepare to surface.
Flank speed.
- Aye.
Prepare to surface.
Flank speed.
Mr. Milburn.
Quick, look at this.
Skipper, Reef!
Those chunks of ice are coming right at us.
Dive!
Dive!
Dive!
Dive!
- Determine extent of damage.
- Aft to torpedo room, report.
This is Griff, Captain.
Moderate leak in overhead plates.
Damage to main driveshaft housing.
Forced to full stop.
- We're dead in the water.
- Captain.
Whatever it is, it certainly can travel.
Course and speed.
Speed, about 22 knots.
Course, due north.
Directly toward the Pole.
- Are you two flounders about set?
- We're ready.
Now, try and remember, you're not going out to rehearse a water ballet.
- We need a damage report.
- I never should have volunteered.
If I had enough sense, I would have -
Hey, uh, look out for the sharks, huh?
A pure oval shape... with this cyclops-like eye, or turret, on top.
I'd estimate its diameter at, oh, 300 feet.
No discernible orifices.
The eye of Cyclops.
What did you say, Sir Ian?
Just musing about our one-eyed adversary... and the Homer legend.
The Cyclopes were the sons of heaven... who forged the thunderbolts thrown by Zeus.
Our own cyclops throws quite a thunderbolt itself.
I knew there was something familiar.
Take a look.
This picture was taken by an amateur astronomer over New Mexico.
I've had it since I served on the Air Force Evaluation Board... for U.F.O. Reports.
"Unidentified flying objects."
Then this is a flying saucer.
That was the popular designation, yes.
Weren't all the sightings in the sky, not underwater?
This would explain why there were never any reports of landings.
It's quite possible that whoever or... whatever inhabits this craft... is not a land creature at all... but some form of marine life.
That would make our little green men actually little green fish.
Undersea flying saucers.
- Excuse me, skipper.
- Yeah, Griff?
All internal repairs completed, and frogmen report exterior damage minor.
- Good.
- Then we can get under way, huh?
- Right, sir.
- Dave, you plotted the course of Cyclops?
Then that's our course.
Where he goes, we go until we get him.
Or perhaps until he gets us.
So the Tiger Shark began relentlessly stalking her space enemy.
Up to the Role, back to the Arctic Circle, again and again.
A week, a fortnight, a month.
Never a glimpse of their enemy, but there were reports.
New disasters, new ships and lives lost.
Invariably, the Tiger Shark made for the scene... only to arrive after Cyclops had left.
For all its desperation, the pursuit seemed fruitless.
And then on July 3, Dr. Kent and Sir Ian... held an urgent discussion with Reef and the skipper.
Why does Cyclops invariably turn to the Pole between attacks?
Never two in succession.
Always away and back, away and back.
We've asked ourselves that over and over a thousand times.
But answers are what we need, not more questions.
We think now we have them.
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.
But suppose it isn't at all.
What if it is magnetic?
Yes.
Yes.
We harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.
Supposing Cyclops does it on a superscale?
The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all: the Earth itself.
What you're getting at is that you think our saucer friend... must return to the Pole regularly to recharge his batteries.
That may be oversimplifying it.
But, uh -
Now, uh, our present tactics are useless.
But suppose we place ourselves between Cyclops and the Pole.
In such a way as to prevent him returning to the Pole to... as you put it, recharge his batteries.
If we are lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted.
Then we polish him off with an atomic fish.
We wait till the next report of trouble, and then we lie in wait for him... right in his path, and bushwhack him.
- "Bushwhack"?
- Yes, it's an American tactical expression.
Oh.
So, a change of tactics.
Now the Tiger Shark cruised almost over the North Role... waiting for the radio report that would put the plan into effect.
On July 13, at 1600 hours, it came.
- We got it, Reef.
- Cyclops?
Sounds like a distress signal from a small freighter between Ellesmere Island and Greenland.
- One Mayday, then nothing.
- Where's the skipper?
Already in the Conn.
- We're here.
- All right.
This is where Cyclops knocked off the freighter.
This is the way he has to head for home - the Pole.
Here we are, right in his path.
Sonar and TV-scan the bottom.
Find a good place to hide and lie in wait for him... maybe a cave or a valley.
Rig for silent running.
As soon as we're on the bottom, secure everything that hums or buzzes.
- I want absolute silence.
- Very well.
Rig for silent running.
Hour upon hour, the Tiger Shark lay in its deep-six ambush.
The Arctic depths were as still and silent as an uninhabited world.
And then at 0600 hours -
Skipper, Dr. Kent.
- What is it?
- That's him.
It has to be.
Range: 22 miles.
Speed:
I give it 14 knots.
His radiation level is very low.
That would confirm our theory about having to return to the Pole.
It better be correct.
Get me a setup on the T.D.C. Range: about seven miles.
Reef, arm atomic warheads.
Load Tubes 1 and 2, and report to the Conn.
- Sounds like we mean business.
- Yeah.
Griff, you arm number two.
I'll handle number one.
Load one and two.
Open outer doors.
Stand by for action.
Range: now 15 miles.
- You sure it's Cyclops?
- Take a look.
Range: 14.5 miles.
Griff to skipper.
Tubes 1 and 2 loaded.
Outer doors open.
Ready to fire.
Stand by.
Range: eight miles.
Range: 73/ 4 miles.
Zero minus 10... nine, eight... seven, six, five... four, three, two... one, target zero.
Fire 1.
- Number one, fired.
- Fire 2.
Number two, fired.
- How are they running?
- Hot, straight and normal.
Number one missed.
How could it?
We're dead on the target with the homing first.
- What's that?
- A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing and caught our torpedo.
It must function like a degaussing field.
We'll never get a torpedo through that.
Maybe not a torpedo.
Blow all main ballast tanks.
Reactor room, stand by.
As soon as we're off the bottom, I want all ahead, flank.
- What course, skipper?
- Right at our one-eyed friend.
- Right at him?
- That's what I said.
- But what can we accomplish?
- We can ram him.
You've weighed the consequences, Captain, the lives involved?
Doctor, I've weighed the destruction that the Cyclops has done already... and what he'll do in the future unless we stop him right now.
- There must be some other means.
- What other means?
If the Tiger Shark can't stop him, no power on Earth can.
Now brace yourselves.
Sound the collision alarm.
We got him, skipper.
Drove right into him.
Look at that.
Speared him like a fish.
We did it, boys.
Dove right through the saucer's side.
Reactor room, give me all reverse, full.
We're stuck tight.
Skipper, take a look at this depth gauge.
180 fathoms?
We can't be sinking that fast.
It's our screws, skipper.
At our declination angle, running in reverse... they're pulling the shark and cyclops right to the bottom.
And we're at safe maximum depth already.
- Full stop.
- Full stop.
Hours later, the two titanic craft were still locked together... in an apparent death grip... on the bottom of the Arctic Ocean... nearly 1200 feet below the surface.
Well, anybody got any ideas?
Anything's better than lying here.
Suppose there's some kind of atmosphere inside the Cyclops.
What do you mean?
Well, maybe we could get inside the saucer.
We could use our torches...
- to cut the Shark loose.
- That's all very well, young man.
How would one go about getting inside Cyclops?
Through the eye using the depth explorer.
Yes.
The explorer was built to operate at even greater depths.
Yeah, but suppose there isn't any atmosphere inside the saucer.
Well, then the idea's no good.
But we're no worse off than we are now.
- You've gotta let us try, skipper.
- Us?
Reef and I could take the explorer down, clamp it onto the eye -
No.
You can't, but I can.
I can deliver you to the eye.
Then you -
A little out of your line, isn't it?
Why don't you stay aboard and make a speech?
Maybe you could get them to ban flying saucers.
Listen, Holloway.
However our ideas disagree, I've said before, I'm not a coward.
And it happens you have no choice.
Either I take you down there in the Lungfish...
- or you don't get there.
- I'd sooner swim.
- That's enough, both of you.
- Very well, sir.
No use making the odds any longer than they are.
It so happens that Dr. Neilsen's right.
Get the explorer in the air lock and prepare for launching.
- Better take Carney and Powell with you.
- The frogmen?
That's right.
Their underwater experience might make them invaluable.
- You'll need sidearms.
- Sidearms?
The saucer's dead.
- You hope.
- We better get ready.
Girls, you go everywhere I go.
All right, Carl.
There's still time.
- You wanna show me how?
- Get in.
Ready to open air lock door, Captain.
Go ahead, Griff.
- What now?
- What do you say, Doctor?
- Shall we take a chance?
- That's what we came for.
You all stay here.
I'm gonna take a look inside.
Not alone, you're not.
Better breathe your oxygen, just in case.
- Air, pure air, under pressure.
- That's a relief.
Well, we won't need these tanks.
Good luck, men.
All right, let's go.
The bow drilled through her, but she sealed herself right up.
Yeah, there's our problem.
The sawteeth of the ram are caught in the break.
Now, if we can cut it away, the Shark can pull herself loose.
- I think you're right.
- Powell, go back to Dr. Neilsen.
Tell him to report to the skipper.
All right, let's get to work.
We read you, Doctor.
Go ahead.
They're inside the Cyclops.
It's full of breathable air.
- Wonderful.
- That's great, Doctor.
Reef thinks that he can clear the Shark's bow so we can pull ourselves loose.
What's it like inside the Cyclops?
This is a priceless opportunity to -
Doctor, tell Reef to make sure that you're in the clear before we make another move.
Right.
Over.
- We may get out of this yet.
- Skipper.
- Could you take a look here?
- What's wrong, Griff?
The inertial navigation system must've been knocked out in the crash.
We're dead in the water, but it indicates we're moving.
- That's impossible.
- The radiation level from the saucer is rising.
What direction does the system indicate?
Due north at five knots.
No, six.
Toward the Pole.
But that Cyclops is dead.
We killed it, didn't we?
Beats me.
- Dave.
- Yeah?
Do you hear anything?
I don't hear anything.
You've been down here too long.
You better go topside and rest.
Strange you don't hear it.
- Reef.
- Huh?
You know something?
I think it's getting lighter in here.
Yeah.
Yeah, it is.
If I didn't know better...
I'd swear we were moving.
Well, let's get back to work, and maybe we will be soon.
I'm getting an impression of movement, Captain.
Is that possible?
We get the same reaction up here.
Now they're feeling it down below.
The radiation level, constantly rising.
As we near the Pole.
There's got to be an explanation.
I think there is.
I believe our friend Cyclops is returning to life.
Commander Holloway, listen.
- Dave.
- Commander Holloway, make no resistance.
Did you hear it?
That sound again?
This time it was a voice.
It called my name.
Look, why don't you go topside?
You will see-that avails nothing.
Where do you think the sound was coming from?
Down there somewhere.
Carney!
Carney, help me!
Carney!
Help me, Carney!
Help Mel
Carney!
Carney, help!
Remove your weapons, Commander.
And come here below.
- Come where?
- To me, here.
That voice again?
It wants me to go alone.
Oh, it does, does it?
You better stay here.
So, Commander Holloway, as you Earth inhabitants would express it... we meet, face-to-face.
That's a face?
Point of view is everything.
To us, your form of life is ugly... as we appear to you.
Tell me something.
Why is it that I can hear you and the others can't?
You do not hear me.
Our individual brain frequencies are now attuned... and we exchange wave-thoughts.
You mean, extrasensory perception?
Whatever your Earth term may be... the principle is ancient and very simple.
It is not necessary for you to speak.
Your thought response will suffice.
My mission is to study various solar systems and planets.
Select the most suitable for colonization.
For horrors like yourself?
Of course.
It may interest you to know I have visited hundreds of other worlds... and of all of them, your Earth seems most suitable.
Swell.
Your friend was to remain where he was.
- He did.
- I am afraid not.
- Dave.
- What's going on in here, lad?
What -
Stand away from him, Commander.
He wants you back.
So this is your headquarters.
Well, you've sunk your last ship, you -
Why not me?
What am I, the closing act?
On the contrary.
I want you unharmed, perfect.
Why?
I have selected you to return with me... along with several other specimens for study.
We will examine you and the others... discover desirable features to incorporate in our Earth colonizers.
And you just build them in, huh?
Of course.
Evolution is much too slow a process.
On Earth, you build with inanimate material.
We employ living tissue.
This space vehicle, for example.
It is a living thing.
When damaged- you would say "wounded"- it immediately heals itself.
Oh, that's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you.
Of course.
But it is time to begin the return voyage.
To navigate, won't you have to see your way?
Obviously.
It'll be rough!
- Back to the Shark, right now.
- What about Dave and the others?
Fortunes of war.
Skipper, this is Reef from the depth explorer.
- Pull loose!
- Right, Reef.
Reactor room, get me all back.
Emergency.
- Well, what about the -
- Skipper, we didn't kill it.
And if that thing ever gets back to where it came from... the Earth is doomed and everybody on it.
We've pulled loose, Captain.
We're free!
There it goes.
Headed straight for the Role, 50 knots.
Nothing we can do.
Excuse me, Captain.
There may be one last desperate chance.
What's that?
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the I.C.B.M... so it would home on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
What about the time?
The Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge its power banks.
Well, it's worth a chance.
Reef, take over as navigator and see if you can find us an air hole in the ice.
- Let's go.
- Very well.
Adapt a complicated guidance system to a huge ballistic rocket.
Convert it to a water-to-air interceptor missile.
It was foolish.
It was insane.
It was fantastic.
But it was their only hope... and the Earth's only hope.
- Ready?
- As ready as we can be.
I'll report to the skipper.
Skipper... we found our hole in the ice.
What's the corrected bearing to the magnetic pole?
357 degrees.
Prepare the I.C.B.M. for firing.
Well, that's about all we can do until our space friend decides to blast off.
Skipper, I think it's -
Fire!
Fire!
Attention, all hands.
We got him.
Cigarette?
Ah, they're so remote, the stars.
- Hmm.
- Cold and beautiful.
- Now I wonder.
- Yeah?
Which is the one?
The one we have to worry about?
Well, we have enough ills here to worry about.
But maybe,just maybe... when their ship doesn't return, they'll decide not to come here after all.
But if they do?
- Well.
- Oh, I wouldn't worry.
Knowing we have boats like the Tiger Shark... men like you, skipper...
Dave, Sir Ian, Kent, and my father-
And his egghead son.
We'll give 'em a rough reception, won't we?
You know, I think I lost my little black book on that lousy thing.
[Man Narrating] It cost Commander Robert Reary... 20 years of unremitting hardship and misery... to reach the North Role finally in 1909.
It would have astounded Reary to learn that by the late 1 950s and early '60s... the vast, frozen top of the world he pioneered... had become a vital highway for world travel and commerce.
Not just in the skies... but also deep under the ice... in the frigid five-million-square-mile depths of the Arctic Ocean.
Here, great passenger-and cargo-carrying atomic submarines... glided by the dozens back and forth across the Role... until a series of mysterious undersea disasters... threatened to close the Arctic route forever.
The decisive moment came May 3 at 13 15 hours... when the undersea atomic liner, Sturgeon, largest of them all... reached 87 degrees, 10 minutes north latitude... only a few miles from the North Role itself.
[Electricity Crackling]
[Narrator] According to the official reports... the next phase of the life-and-death drama... occurred May 1 0 in Washington... at a hush-hush supersecret meeting... of the Arctic theater war room.
Gentlemen, this is the man we've been waiting for.
The skipper of the atom killer sub, Tiger Shark.
Commander Dan Wendover.
This is Justin Murdock, secretary of defense.
- Mr. Murdock.
- Commander.
And I know you've heard a lot of Dr. Clifford Kent, Dan.
- Doctor.
- Commander.
Dr. Kent had a lot to do with the development and design of your boat.
Sir Ian Hunt just flew in from London.
The Dr. Hunt, winner of the Nobel Prize for oceanography?
Oh, let's just say I took the bow for a team of very brilliant associates.
Uh, sit down.
Gentlemen, to begin, let me read you just one line... from a detailed staff study prepared for theJoint Chiefs.
"In our judgment, these Arctic disasters... may prove the gravest emergency in all history."
Any comments on that statement?
A bit fanciful, isn't it, sir?
Possibly.
Let me read you, uh, a partial list of observed phenomena.
"Destruction of four surface vessels.
Largest, 1 0,000 tons.
"Radioactivity in Arctic waters, flow ice and bergs.
"Reculiar television images preceding each distress call.
"Seven polar atom subs... vanished without a trace. "
"Fanciful," did you say, uh, Sir Ian?
[Chuckles]
And now, Dan, we come to you.
You skipper the Tiger Shark... the most advanced, the deadliest killer sub in the fleet.
Right now she's undergoing emergency around-the-clock modification... in the Bremerton Navy Yard.
The orders call for special observation and testing instruments here... removal of all but two atomic torpedoes... special launching equipment for water-to-air ballistic missiles... and a special escape hatch in the keel for the Lungfish.
The Lungfish?
Yes.
Uh, a deep exploration device, sort of an animated diving bell.
The mission of the Tiger Shark... is to hunt down and identify the cause of these Arctic disasters.
If humanly possible... you will remove it.
[Man] Not that I don't think Lieutenant Commander Holloway... is the finest exec in the entire sub fleet,Julie... and not that he isn't the best friend that I have -
Come on, Dave.
You talk too much.
Now be quiet, little mother.
I
- I feel behooved to warn you... our friend Reef is no less than the number one howl in the entire sub wolf pack.
Nuclear powered.
And when it comes to women
- Well... he has got a built-in sonar detector that -
Dave, you know you're exaggerating, old buddy-buddy.
You know it.
Yes, you are.
You know, on most boats, a certain loyalty exists... between the exec and his navigation and firing officer... but in the case of Lieutenant David Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself-
But su
- She's a nice girl.
Uh, I've seen you work.
I think she deserves a fighting chance.
Helen, I appeal to you.
Dave, look at me.
I'm the mother of your three children.
Will you please take me home to them at once?
There you are.
Just drop in anytime.
Don't bother to call.Just
-Just drop in.
That's my way of life.
[Sighs]
Dave is exaggerating, you know.
I mean, a man spends three months in a deep freeze... it'll take his whole leave just to thaw him out.
By that time, he's ready to report back.
It won't take me long to defrost.
Not around you.
What was I saying about thawing out icebergs?
Yeah, you, uh - You never can tell about icebergs.
Only show one-ninth above water.
After that kiss, I'd say that's about right.
- Do you feel anything?
- Are you kidding?
No, I mean that this is just the beginning of something.
That we didn't just meet accidentally.
Oh, that's original.
Doesn't the next chorus go something like...
"Let's not waste one precious golden moment.
Any second there could be a knock on the door and -"
Well, I've seen stranger things happen.
It happens all the time to heroes on television, plays, motion pictures.
The hero gets his leave canceled, and he's -
And she spends the rest of her life wishing that she'd -
Oh, honey.
Let's not waste one precious moment then.
[Knocking On Door]
What's that pounding?
Need I say more?
Mmm.
Reef, look.
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?
What is it?
Oh, no.
Skipper, I thought you were going to Washington.
I did.Just got back.
Reef, I want you to meet a couple of our passengers.
Sir Ian Hunt and Dr. Clifford Kent.
My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
- Glad to know you, sir.
- How do you do?
- Dr. Kent.
Met you before.
- Yes indeed, Commander.
You gentlemen are going with us.
What for?
We'll discuss that later.
Roberts.
- Have Chief Griffin report to me as soon as the crew's aboard.
- Yes, sir.
- Watkins.
- Yes, sir.
- Will you show these gentlemen to their quarters?
- Aye, aye, sir.
This way.
Well.
Sorry we had to cut your leave short.
- Yeah.
- Come at the wrong time?
Yeah.
Will do.
- Oh, it's you.
- Yeah.
Griff, what's the scoop?
Hauled out in the middle of the night, all leaves canceled.
We going to war, or what?
Don't you worry, Chester.
When the skipper wants you to know what's going on, he'll tell ya.
Okay?
- I don't like it.
I mean, this is all mighty funny.
- Ah, isn't it, though?
Suppose you get aboard anyway.
- I don't like it.
- What did you say?
I like it.
I like it.
Hey.
Well, skipper, I think I'll stow my gear.
- Well, Reef, I got some bad news for ya.
- Oh, yeah?
- You're gonna have to share quarters this trip.
- Who with?
- Dr. Neilsen.
- Dr. Neilsen?
When did that happen?
- Huh?
- Oh, it's all right.
We're old friends.
Dave, stand by to shove off as soon as Griff reports the crew aboard.
Right, skipper.
Well, looks like we're gonna share quarters, skipper.
Been a long -
Carl.
You?
Oh, of course.
I should have suspected when I heard that "doctor."
- I thought it was your father.
- It was supposed to be.
- Dad had a heart attack two days ago.
- He what?
It was mild.
He'll be all right.
But it was out of the question his coming along.
And they thought you could replace the skipper, huh?
There was no choice.
Dad and I developed the Lungfish together.
Except for him, I'm the only one qualified to dive in it.
- You could have trained somebody else.
- Not in two days.
Look, do you think I wanted to come?
If it didn't mean so much to Dad, proving his depth explorer, I certainly wouldn't be here.
That I can believe.
[Narrator] The Tiger Shark left her dock at Bremerton at 0335 hours... the morning of May 1 1... on what was to prove the strangest, most fearful voyage ever made by a submarine... atomic or otherwise.
Simultaneously with the Shark's departure... and with his crew still in the dark concerning their secret, fateful mission...
Skipper Wendover made the first notation in the log.
The men would remain unbriefed for two hours... until the Tiger Shark cleared Ruget Sound... and was headed for open sea.
Who the devil belongs to this gear?
[Man] Uh, we do, Chief.
Oh.
You two guys, huh?
And just what do you do around here?
Underwater demolition.
Seaman First Class Powell, and I'm Carney.
Yeah, I know.
So you're frogmen.
Yeah, we're off tin cans.
We've, uh, looked the pigboat over from, uh, fore to aft... but can't seem to find an empty locker, uh, to store our stuff in.
An empty locker?
In a sub?
Are you kiddin'?
This whole deal is makin' less and less sense to me.
What are frogmen doin'aboard the Tiger Shark?
Following orders, like everyone else in the navy.
Beats me.
But orders are orders.
Yeah, well, uh, in the meantime, where do you want us to stash these gizmos?
Come on.
[Narrator] Shortly before dawn... the Tiger Shark, running submerged at better than 30 knots... had left the sound behind... and was headed for open sea.
Here are our orders, Reef.
Look 'em over while I fill in the crew.
Now hear this.
This is the captain speaking.
I know you're wondering about all the mystery.
[Wendover On P.A.] Well, our job had to be kept absolutely secret.
Our mission is to find out what caused the disasters under the Arctic ice.
Once we cross the Arctic Circle, any command you hear will be the real thing.
Rlease remember it.
That's about it.
Now you know as much as I or anybody else does, for that matter.
Oh, incidentally, I assured Washington... that this was the best sub crew in the fleet.
I know you won't make a liar out of me.
Carry on.
That's it.
What do you think?
I think I should have joined the air force.
[Narrator] A week later, the Tiger Shark was still running due north at cruising speed.
So far, the voyage was routine, uneventful.
But the nearer they came to the Arctic Circle... the more the tension increased... the more tiny irritations were magnified into bitter feuds... the more the crewmen pondered their possible fate.
On the morning of May 20... the Tiger Shark crossed the Arctic Circle into the critical area.
You're always asking me why I stay a bachelor.
There goes one of the best reasons I can think of.
- Huh?
- Yeah.
I might have a son like that.
I don't get it.
What goes with you two?
I guess his father, Skipper Neilsen, retired before you enrolled at the academy, didn't he?
I guess.
One of the finest men and officers alive.
A real hero in the best sense of the word.
World War II.
Taught engineering and design at the academy.
- Fought like a demon for atomic subs.
- So?
So, when his only son dropped out of school, began making statements... all sounding like borrowed propaganda -
"Ban the atomic test." "Junk the nuclear subs."
"Spend the military budget for peace."
Well, it just about broke the old man's heart.
Then when the newspapers picked it up... called Carl the honest, sincere son of a warmongering father... well, Captain Neilsen resigned from the navy.
Oh, he still keeps his hand in with projects like the Lungfish... but it broke him all the same.
Have, uh
- Have you talked to Carl?
Tried to get his side?
His side?
He's all front with no back.
How can he have a side?
Either of you men seen Dr. Neilsen?
He's in here, sir.
Oh, uh, Tuttle, Powell, would you men mind leaving us alone for a few minutes?
Sure, Mr. Holloway.
Dr. Neilsen.
What is it?
You are out.
This came for you.
- My father?
- Dead?
No.
As a matter of fact, he's a lot better.
Just got out of the hospital.
- What did you mean I'm out?
- Your father can be in Nome, Alaska tomorrow.
We have two choices.
We can ask them to bring him out by helicopter and take you off... or we can put the Shark back into Nome.
You trade school boys are all alike, aren't you?
Anybody who doesn't think like a little gold-braided puppet is ipso facto a coward.
You said it.
I didn't.
Well, wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, Commander.
It just so happens I'm not a coward - physical or mental.
And before I'd risk my father's life -
- We're all risking our lives.
- That may be... but Dad stays where he is, and I'm staying here.
Oh, you are a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
Well, perhaps.
But the idea of willingly going to school... to spend my life at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder lizards -
I'm referring to war- that strikes me as the worst cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow.
- You mean nothing's worth fighting for?
- Peace.
The dignity of man, destiny of human spirit.
Now, you show me a man who says you win these fighting wars, and I'll show you an idiot.
Oh, Carl, you talk like so many young men I've
- I've known.
You talk well.
Literately, intelligently- even brilliantly sometimes.
But you're all talk.
What do you do about your ideas... your ideals?
You mentioned my uniform.
These are my work clothes.
They represent what I'm willing to do... how hard I'm willing to work for what I believe in.
I doubt your willingness for anything... except talk about what you're against.
That talk darn near killed your father.
[Loud Bang]
- [Man On R.A.] Mr. Holloway to the conn, please.
- [Alarm Blaring]
[Dave] The instruments have all gone crazy, and take a look at the screen.
Incredible.
Absolutely incredible.
- What hit us?
- It doesn't seem possible... but could it be an electric storm center?
Underwater?
[Dr. Kent] High-intensity arcs will burn submerged... and millions of volts discharged in random directions.
Is there any way out of this?
Seems all around.
What about down?
- I don't know.
- Take her down.
- Maximum angle, maximum depth.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Take her down.
Maximum angle, maximum depth.
Sir Ian has evolved a theory.
At first I wasn't about to buy it... but we have eliminated one by one every other logical explanation.
Mmm.
It is rather fantastic.
But, uh... here... is a chart of the Arctic region.
On it I've plotted every instant of these peculiar phenomena... the sinkings, electrical storms... our own experiences.
Now, uh... here is where we encountered the electrical storm.
The Sturgeon was lost about here.
The others here, here... and here.
- Do you see it?
- See what?
The pattern.
The pattern.
Each incident occurred almost precisely 1 ,000 statute miles from the Pole.
A line drawn through the points of occurrence... makes almost a complete circle around the Pole.
Which adds up to what, Sir Ian?
I cannot accept the idea that these phenomena were... either random or natural.
I believe they were motivated by... some sort of intelligence.
Do you mean that somebody is -
I didn't mean to imply a human intelligence.
Well, what on earth kind of intelligence is it, Sir Ian?
Oh, perhaps...
it's not an intelligence on Earth.
Perhaps it's an intelligence from beyond the Earth.
What can we do about it, sir?
I've been thinking about that.
As you see, these occurrences were on this line... almost a perfect circle around the Pole.
However, there may be a significant break in that ring... here in the area of the Queen Victoria Sea near FranzJosef Land... north of Murmansk and Finland.
Supposing your theorizing is correct... then this could be the next danger point.
Yes.
Yes.
But supposing we, uh, anticipated a little.
Supposing... the Tiger Shark was lurking there, waiting.
He could be right.
We'll chart our course right straight across the Pole and bring us here.
The Queen Victoria Sea.
[Narrator] So, swiftly, implacably... the Tiger Shark moved across the top of the world... toward a rendezvous with what?
We've been running due south along the 30th degree of longitude.
By my reckoning we should be about here, just short of our planned position.
- And that should be -
-Just about the critical point, if we're on the right track.
- Prepare to surface.
Flank speed.
- Aye.
Prepare to surface.
Flank speed.
Mr. Milburn.
Quick, look at this.
Skipper, Reef!
Those chunks of ice are coming right at us.
Dive!
Dive!
Dive!
Dive!
- Determine extent of damage.
- Aft to torpedo room, report.
This is Griff, Captain.
Moderate leak in overhead plates.
Damage to main driveshaft housing.
Forced to full stop.
- We're dead in the water.
- [Dave] Captain.
[Reef] Whatever it is, it certainly can travel.
Course and speed.
Speed, about 22 knots.
Course, due north.
Directly toward the Pole.
- Are you two flounders about set?
- We're ready.
Now, try and remember, you're not going out to rehearse a water ballet.
- We need a damage report.
- I never should have volunteered.
If I had enough sense, I would have -
Hey, uh, look out for the sharks, huh?
A pure oval shape... with this cyclops-like eye, or turret, on top.
I'd estimate its diameter at, oh, 300 feet.
No discernible orifices.
The eye of Cyclops.
What did you say, Sir Ian?
Just musing about our one-eyed adversary... and the Homer legend.
The Cyclopes were the sons of heaven... who forged the thunderbolts thrown by Zeus.
Our own cyclops throws quite a thunderbolt itself.
I knew there was something familiar.
Take a look.
This picture was taken by an amateur astronomer over New Mexico.
I've had it since I served on the Air Force Evaluation Board... for U.F.O. Reports.
"Unidentified flying objects."
Then this is a flying saucer.
That was the popular designation, yes.
Weren't all the sightings in the sky, not underwater?
This would explain why there were never any reports of landings.
It's quite possible that whoever or... whatever inhabits this craft... is not a land creature at all... but some form of marine life.
That would make our little green men actually little green fish.
Undersea flying saucers.
- Excuse me, skipper.
- Yeah, Griff?
All internal repairs completed, and frogmen report exterior damage minor.
- Good.
- Then we can get under way, huh?
- Right, sir.
- Dave, you plotted the course of Cyclops?
Then that's our course.
Where he goes, we go until we get him.
Or perhaps until he gets us.
[Narrator] So the Tiger Shark began relentlessly stalking her space enemy.
Up to the Role, back to the Arctic Circle, again and again.
A week, a fortnight, a month.
[Narrator] Never a glimpse of their enemy, but there were reports.
New disasters, new ships and lives lost.
Invariably, the Tiger Shark made for the scene... only to arrive after Cyclops had left.
For all its desperation, the pursuit seemed fruitless.
And then on July 3, Dr. Kent and Sir Ian... held an urgent discussion with Reef and the skipper.
Why does Cyclops invariably turn to the Pole between attacks?
Never two in succession.
Always away and back, away and back.
We've asked ourselves that over and over a thousand times.
But answers are what we need, not more questions.
We think now we have them.
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.
But suppose it isn't at all.
What if it is magnetic?
Yes.
Yes.
We harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.
Supposing Cyclops does it on a superscale?
The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all: the Earth itself.
What you're getting at is that you think our saucer friend... must return to the Pole regularly to recharge his batteries.
That may be oversimplifying it.
But, uh -
Now, uh, our present tactics are useless.
But suppose we place ourselves between Cyclops and the Pole.
In such a way as to prevent him returning to the Pole to... as you put it, recharge his batteries.
If we are lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted.
Then we polish him off with an atomic fish.
We wait till the next report of trouble, and then we lie in wait for him... right in his path, and bushwhack him.
- "Bushwhack"?
- Yes, it's an American tactical expression.
Oh.
[Narrator] So, a change of tactics.
Now the Tiger Shark cruised almost over the North Role... waiting for the radio report that would put the plan into effect.
On July 1 3, at 1 600 hours, it came.
- We got it, Reef.
- Cyclops?
Sounds like a distress signal from a small freighter between Ellesmere Island and Greenland.
- One Mayday, then nothing.
- Where's the skipper?
Already in the conn.
- [Dave] We're here.
-[Wendover] All right.
This is where Cyclops knocked off the freighter.
This is the way he has to head for home - the Pole.
Here we are, right in his path.
Sonar and TV-scan the bottom.
Find a good place to hide and lie in wait for him... maybe a cave or a valley.
Rig for silent running.
As soon as we're on the bottom, secure everything that hums or buzzes.
- I want absolute silence.
- Very well.
Rig for silent running.
[Narrator] Hour upon hour, the Tiger Shark lay in its deep-six ambush.
The Arctic depths were as still and silent as an uninhabited world.
And then at 0600 hours -
[Clicking]
Skipper, Dr. Kent.
- What is it?
- That's him.
It has to be.
Range: 22 miles.
Speed:
I give it 1 4 knots.
His radiation level is very low.
That would confirm our theory about having to return to the Pole.
It better be correct.
Get me a setup on the T.D.C. Range: about seven miles.
Reef, arm atomic warheads.
Load Tubes 1 and 2, and report to the conn.
- Sounds like we mean business.
- Yeah.
Griff, you arm number two.
I'll handle number one.
[Machinery Whirring, Beeping]
Load one and two.
Open outer doors.
Stand by for action.
Range: now 1 5 miles.
- You sure it's Cyclops?
- Take a look.
Range: 1 4.5 miles.
Griff to skipper.
Tubes 1 and 2 loaded.
Outer doors open.
Ready to fire.
Stand by.
[Beeping]
Range: eight miles.
Range: 7 3/ 4 miles.
Zero minus 1 0... nine, eight... seven, six, five... four, three, two... one, target zero.
Fire 1 .
- Number one, fired.
- Fire 2.
Number two, fired.
- How are they running?
- Hot, straight and normal.
Number one missed.
How could it?
We're dead on the target with the homing first.
- What's that?
- A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing and caught our torpedo.
It must function like a degaussing field.
We'll never get a torpedo through that.
Maybe not a torpedo.
Blow all main ballast tanks.
Reactor room, stand by.
As soon as we're off the bottom, I want all ahead, flank.
-[Dave] What course, skipper?
- Right at our one-eyed friend.
- Right at him?
- That's what I said.
- But what can we accomplish?
- We can ram him.
You've weighed the consequences, Captain, the lives involved?
Doctor, I've weighed the destruction that the Cyclops has done already... and what he'll do in the future unless we stop him right now.
- There must be some other means.
- What other means?
If the Tiger Shark can't stop him, no power on Earth can.
Now brace yourselves.
Sound the collision alarm.
[Siren Blaring]
[Rumbling]
We got him, skipper.
Drove right into him.
Look at that.
Speared him like a fish.
We did it, boys.
Dove right through the saucer's side.
Reactor room, give me all reverse, full.
We're stuck tight.
Skipper, take a look at this depth gauge.
1 80 fathoms?
We can't be sinking that fast.
It's our screws, skipper.
At our declination angle, running in reverse... they're pulling the shark and cyclops right to the bottom.
And we're at safe maximum depth already.
- Full stop.
- Full stop.
[Thuds]
[Narrator] Hours later, the two titanic craft were still locked together... in an apparent death grip... on the bottom of the Arctic Ocean... nearly 1 200 feet below the surface.
Well, anybody got any ideas?
Anything's better than lying here.
Suppose there's some kind of atmosphere inside the Cyclops.
What do you mean?
Well, maybe we could get inside the saucer.
We could use our torches...
- to cut the Shark loose.
- That's all very well, young man.
How would one go about getting inside Cyclops?
Through the eye using the depth explorer.
Yes.
The explorer was built to operate at even greater depths.
Yeah, but suppose there isn't any atmosphere inside the saucer.
Well, then the idea's no good.
But we're no worse off than we are now.
-[Dave] You've gotta let us try, skipper.
- Us?
Reef and I could take the explorer down, clamp it onto the eye -
[Neilsen] No.
You can't, but I can.
I can deliver you to the eye.
Then you -
A little out of your line, isn't it?
Why don't you stay aboard and make a speech?
Maybe you could get them to ban flying saucers.
Listen, Holloway.
However our ideas disagree, I've said before, I'm not a coward.
And it happens you have no choice.
Either I take you down there in the Lungfish...
- or you don't get there.
- I'd sooner swim.
- That's enough, both of you.
- Very well, sir.
No use making the odds any longer than they are.
It so happens that Dr. Neilsen's right.
Get the explorer in the air lock and prepare for launching.
- Better take Carney and Powell with you.
- The frogmen?
That's right.
Their underwater experience might make them invaluable.
- You'll need sidearms.
- Sidearms?
The saucer's dead.
- You hope.
- We better get ready.
Girls, you go everywhere I go.
All right, Carl.
There's still time.
- You wanna show me how?
- Get in.
[Griff On R.A.] Ready to open air lock door, Captain.
Go ahead, Griff.
- What now?
- What do you say, Doctor?
- Shall we take a chance?
- That's what we came for.
You all stay here.
I'm gonna take a look inside.
Not alone, you're not.
Better breathe your oxygen, just in case.
- Air, pure air, under pressure.
- That's a relief.
Well, we won't need these tanks.
Good luck, men.
All right, let's go.
The bow drilled through her, but she sealed herself right up.
Yeah, there's our problem.
The sawteeth of the ram are caught in the break.
Now, if we can cut it away, the Shark can pull herself loose.
- I think you're right.
- Powell, go back to Dr. Neilsen.
Tell him to report to the skipper.
All right, let's get to work.
We read you, Doctor.
Go ahead.
They're inside the Cyclops.
It's full of breathable air.
- Wonderful.
- That's great, Doctor.
Reef thinks that he can clear the Shark's bow so we can pull ourselves loose.
What's it like inside the Cyclops?
This is a priceless opportunity to -
Doctor, tell Reef to make sure that you're in the clear before we make another move.
Right.
Over.
- We may get out of this yet.
-Skipper.
- Could you take a look here?
- What's wrong, Griff?
The inertial navigation system must've been knocked out in the crash.
We're dead in the water, but it indicates we're moving.
- That's impossible.
- The radiation level from the saucer is rising.
What direction does the system indicate?
Due north at five knots.
No, six.
Toward the Pole.
But that Cyclops is dead.
We killed it, didn't we?
Beats me.
- Dave.
- Yeah?
Do you hear anything?
I don't hear anything.
You've been down here too long.
You better go topside and rest.
Strange you don't hear it.
- Reef.
- Huh?
You know something?
I think it's getting lighter in here.
Yeah.
Yeah, it is.
If I didn't know better...
I'd swear we were moving.
Well, let's get back to work, and maybe we will be soon.
I'm getting an impression of movement, Captain.
Is that possible?
We get the same reaction up here.
Now they're feeling it down below.
The radiation level, constantly rising.
As we near the Pole.
There's got to be an explanation.
I think there is.
I believe our friend Cyclops is returning to life.
[Male Voice] Commander Holloway, listen.
- Dave.
- Commander Holloway, make no resistance.
Did you hear it?
That sound again?
This time it was a voice.
It called my name.
Look, why don't you go topside?
[Voice] You will see- that avails nothing.
Where do you think the sound was coming from?
Down there somewhere.
[Low-pitched Hum]
[Hum Continues]
[High-pitched Hum]
[Loud Hum]
Carney!
Carney, help me!
CarneyI Help me, CarneyI Help meI
[Hum Increases]
CarneyI Carney, helpI
[Hum Continues]
[Grunting]
- [Cracking] - [Gasping]
[Retching]
[Voice] Remove your weapons, Commander.
And come here below.
- Come where?
- To me, here.
That voice again?
It wants me to go alone.
Oh, it does, does it?
You better stay here.
So, Commander Holloway, as you Earth inhabitants would express it... we meet, face-to-face.
That's a face?
Roint of view is everything.
To us, your form of life is ugly... as we appear to you.
Tell me something.
Why is it that I can hear you and the others can't?
You do not hear me.
Our individual brain frequencies are now attuned... and we exchange wave-thoughts.
You mean, extrasensory perception?
Whatever your Earth term may be... the principle is ancient and very simple.
It is not necessary for you to speak.
Your thought response will suffice.
My mission is to study various solar systems and planets.
Select the most suitable for colonization.
[Thinking] For horrors like yourself?
Of course.
It may interest you to know I have visited hundreds of other worlds... and of all of them, your Earth seems most suitable.
[Thinking] Swell.
[Creature] Your friend was to remain where he was.
- [Thinking] He did.
-I am afraid not.
- Dave.
- What's going on in here, lad?
What -
Stand away from him, Commander.
He wants you back.
So this is your headquarters.
Well, you've sunk your last ship, you -
[High-pitched Hum]
[Low Hum]
[Screaming]
[Thinking] Why not me?
What am I, the closing act?
On the contrary.
I want you unharmed, perfect.
[Thinking] Why?
I have selected you to return with me... along with several other specimens for study.
We will examine you and the others... discover desirable features to incorporate in our Earth colonizers.
[Thinking] And you just build them in, huh?
Of course.
Evolution is much too slow a process.
On Earth, you build with inanimate material.
We employ living tissue.
This space vehicle, for example.
It is a living thing.
When damaged- you would say "wounded"- it immediately heals itself.
[Thinking] Oh, that's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you.
Of course.
But it is time to begin the return voyage.
[Thinking] To navigate, won't you have to see your way?
Obviously.
It'll be rough!
[Clicks]
[Clicks]
- Back to the Shark, right now.
- What about Dave and the others?
Fortunes of war.
Skipper, this is Reef from the depth explorer.
- Rull looseI
- Right, Reef.
Reactor room, get me all back.
Emergency.
- Well, what about the -
- Skipper, we didn't kill it.
And if that thing ever gets back to where it came from...
- the Earth is doomed and everybody on it.
- [Rumbling]
[Man On R.A.] We've pulled loose, Captain.
We're freeI
[Reef] There it goes.
Headed straight for the Role, 50 knots.
Nothing we can do.
Excuse me, Captain.
There may be one last desperate chance.
What's that?
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the I.C.B.M.... so it would home on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
What about the time?
The Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge its power banks.
Well, it's worth a chance.
Reef, take over as navigator and see if you can find us an air hole in the ice.
- Let's go.
- Very well.
[Narrator] Adapt a complicated guidance system to a huge ballistic rocket.
Convert it to a water-to-air interceptor missile.
It was foolish.
It was insane.
It was fantastic.
But it was their only hope... and the Earth's only hope.
- Ready?
- As ready as we can be.
I'll report to the skipper.
Skipper... we found our hole in the ice.
What's the corrected bearing to the magnetic pole?
3 57 degrees.
Prepare the I.C.B.M. for firing.
Well, that's about all we can do until our space friend decides to blast off.
Skipper, I think it's -
[Rumbling]
[Buzzing]
Fire!
Fire!
[Explosion Continues]
Attention, all hands.
We got him.
Cigarette?
Ah, they're so remote, the stars.
-[Reef] Hmm.
- Cold and beautiful.
- Now I wonder.
- Yeah?
Which is the one?
The one we have to worry about?
Well, we have enough ills here to worry about.
But maybe,just maybe... when their ship doesn't return, they'll decide not to come here after all.
But if they do?
- Well.
- Oh, I wouldn't worry.
Knowing we have boats like the Tiger Shark... men like you, skipper...
Dave, Sir Ian, Kent, and my father-
And his egghead son.
We'll give 'em a rough reception, won't we?
You know, I think I lost my little black book on that lousy thing.
Gaillardia?
Gaillardia.
Well?
Archives.
Yes?
I found gaillardia, sir.
It comes under the department of miscellaneous territories.
Mr. Carlton-Browne.
Cadogan, your tea.
Thank you, mother.
Arthur, drink yours before it gets cold.
Is the news any brighter this morning?
They've buried Hartington.
Hartington?
They had Istanbul when we had Belgrade.
How many paragraphs?
Two.
Only two?
Poor Mildred.
She will be disappointed.
What'd they say?
I paid for your copy of the "times,"
But I'm damned if I'm gonna read it for you.
Oh, now look what you've done.
All right, I'll answer it.
Oh, leave it.
Leave it.
I didn't do it on purpose.
Accidents will happen.
Yes, indeed.
Cadogan.
Cadogan, you're wanted at the ministry.
They say it's urgent.
Urgent?
Surely not.
Overworked and understaffed as you claim to be,
It is conceivable that even in your department
Something might arise.
I should therefore advise you to go.
Yes, sir.
Get out;
Get out while the furniture's still intact.
You haven't forgotten the Tursingtons written down
Today with Angela.
She'll want to see you.
But when?
I'm lunching at the club between 12:00 and 3:00,
And I'm playing squash with Bink at 5:00.
I suppose I could go for tea at Fortnums around 4:00.
Tell her to bring her raincoat.
Why?
It's quite a nice day out.
Oh, get out.
Sometimes I wonder exactly what I've sired.
He needs someone like Angela.
She'll take him in hand, but he shows absolutely no interest.
Except for stylish affairs.
Something can be done about that.
The fact is he completely lacks ambition.
I've done what I can for him.
But they must think something of him to give him
That department.
Miscellaneous territories?
In my day, it was known as the dust bin.
Ah-ha.
Carlton-Browne?
Yes.
The ministers have been waiting to see you.
- Me?
- Since 10:00.
Is this a leg-pull?
There's an urgent dispatch from gaillardia.
What's that?
It was a colony.
Oh, well, in that case, it's not my pigeon, is it?
Apparently, it is now.
Oh, then who's our fellow out there?
That's just it.
There shouldn't be anyone there.
The dispatch is signed "Davidson,"
But he ought to have returned in 1916.
I see.
I wonder if there's anything wrong.
I mean, he's simply not on the ball, is he?
Rodgers, what's the last thing we have on the file?
A message of loyalty on the ascension of the queen, C.B.
I see.
That's frightfully slack.
Nearly six years.
Oh, not this queen.
Victoria.
Come in.
Ah, the decode.
What's happened to the tea?
I'll find out, C.B.
Listen to this.
"Three members of Cossack dance troupe now touring here
"on official visit observed to be constantly out of step, stop.
"Am informed one is eminent scientists,
Other two mining engineers."
Engineers, dancing?
Isn't that a bit fishy?
I should have thought so.
There's a second item, C.B.
"Would appreciate instructions and something
On account of salary."
Oh, not more trouble.
Haven't we paid him?
Not for the last 40 years.
Oh, that's frightfully slack.
Remind me to send a counsel rocket,
And do find out what's happened to the tea.
Yes, C.B.
Now, am I to tell the minister you're on your way or what?
I suppose so.
Just a minute.
Where is this gaillardia?
Yes, I should find that out if I were you.
It's the sort of thing he's likely to ask.
And where exactly is gaillardia?
Why, the 33rd parallel, sir.
Mm.
We have a most favored nations clause, sir,
In the self-determination treaty.
What about the king?
Is he dependable?
All the evidence points to it.
He has his clothes made here.
Hardly sufficient, is it?
Well, his younger son is at Oxford.
In fact, he's lived here since he was a boy.
Mm, these Cossack fellas are obviously up to something.
Is there anything there?
We ever had a survey?
Have we?
Was there ever a survey?
There's a reference to one made in 1870, sir,
But it's gone.
Gone?
Who had it?
The rats, sir.
Scandalous.
Not ours.
Colonial office rats, sir.
The big questions in the house.
If there's anything there worth having,
We should have it, not the Russians.
We'll have to get our own experts in right away,
But how?
Well, come along, Carlton-Browne,
It's your baby, your miscellaneous territories.
Well, then, they can hardly go in as Cossack dancers,
Can they, sir.
I appreciate that.
What I should like from you would be
A constructive suggestion.
Well, I was thinking, sir.
Good.
Couldn't the British council help us?
How?
How.
Well, a council mission.
Maybe they could put on some sort of a show,
And our experts could travel with them.
Yes, that might be a way, but on no account let
The British council know what we're up to.
Right, see to it.
And tell the British council to put on a show that's
Really impressive.
Try to keep in time, sir John, if you can.
I see no women.
There are no women parts.
Yeah, these British.
I don't know how you feel, but I'm ready to go.
"Flash: 'Prabda today' puts finger on west.
Claims British agents pulled tabs on loris and junior."
"'The times leader' today asks whether death of the"
Late king loris might be attributable to the
"furtherance of eastern imperialist designs."
Just about the worst half hour in the house I've ever
Experienced, and the opposition have tabled four
More questions for tomorrow.
Now, Beaverbrook's demanding that we close down the
British council.
And as if that's not enough, he's a cable from U.N.O.
Calling for a full report.
Idiotic idea sending those people out there anyway.
Who suggested it?
Wasn't it the colonial office, minister?
It was not, Carlton-Browne.
It was you.
Me, sir?
Yes, you, sir.
And what about those experts of yours?
What do they say?
Nothing.
Why not?
They seem to have disappeared.
What's Davidson doing?
Davidson?
The fellow who should've come back in 1916.
Oh, nothing.
Apparently, he's in bed with gout.
In bed with gout.
Then who are we dealing with?
Well, it's a bit complicated, minister.
You see, there's the new king who's lived here since
A child.
Now, on the other hand, in the South,
There's his Uncle, the grand Duke Alexis,
Who also claims the throne.
They've been fighting for years.
You know what families are.
Is there any form of government?
Oh, rather, sir, modeled on ours.
The prime minister is a man named Amphibulos.
Rather tricky, apparently.
In what sense?
Well, he's a bit of a politician.
So am I.
What I meant was that he's flexible.
Mm, we'd best see this young king.
That's what I thought, sir.
So I phoned him at Oxford last night.
Oh, you did?
Yes, I arranged a meeting this morning.
He'll be here in 20 minuets.
Well, let me tell you he won't.
He won't, sir?
Not unless he changes planes in midair.
He left London airport at 8:30 this morning.
Think he's incognito.
You'll call him Mr. Jones.
Mr. Jones?
Will you take something to drink, Mr. Jones?
Thank you, yes.
A dry Martini?
Just a beer, thank you.
Who's she?
That's miss Adrianas.
Where's she booked to?
I'll look at the passenger list,
But I don't think she's getting off before Napels.
Mm, we'll see.
A beer for his majesty.
One of the boys, eh?
Not half.
Your beer, sir.
Oh, thank you.
Of course, you're from South gaillardia, aren't you?
How do you know?
All the real pretty girls come from the South.
What were you doing in England?
Oh, trying to speak English.
I will never learn.
Oh, you mustn't.
It's perfect.
Oh, I must.
But really, you speak English very good.
I should.
I was brought up there.
Tell me about it.
About what?
Everything.
Tell me everything you've ever done since you were 12.
That would be very boring.
Anyway, I don't even know your name.
Well, it's a little difficult for someone
Of our nationality.
It's Jones.
What did you actually tell the king?
Why, hardly anything.
I just warned him that the Russians were there.
Well, now we know why he left.
Yes.
Oh, come in, commander.
With you in a moment.
Who exactly is this fellow Carlton-Browne?
How did he come to be in charge of a department?
You remember sir Arthur Carlton-Browne, sir?
Mm.
This is the son.
Oh.
I thought there was something.
All right, we'd better leave it.
Now, commander, what does security have to say
About the young king of gaillardia?
There's a confidential report, minister,
From his college.
Seems quite an ordinary young man.
Two gatings, some minor offenses.
Oh?
Having young women in college, sir.
Oh.
Games?
Doesn't say, sir.
Just having young women.
No, no, field sports.
Cricket, rowing?
Oh, no.
No organized games, sir.
He's a member of the university labor party.
What?
The reigning monarch a member of the labor party?
He wasn't fully paid up, sir.
Maybe not.
But what material if the Russians get hold of him.
We must be there.
We must show the flag.
This young, inexperienced monarch,
One of our oldest allies bound to us by indissoluble
Ties... never let it be said that we failed them in their
Hour of need.
We shall be there beside them, behind them... well,
Beside them... for all the world to see,
Especially U.N.O.
Yes, someone must go at once to LaGuardia.
Gaillardia, sir.
What's that?
Gaillardia.
LaGuardia's an airport, New York City.
Who said anything about airports?
You did, sir.
- You said LaGuar...
- I know what I said.
I said... well, what did I say?
You completely destroyed my train of thought.
Weren't you saying, minister,
That someone must go out there?
Yes, I was.
If there's anything there worth having,
We're having it.
Had you anyone in mind, minister?
As head of the department, I suppose it'll have to be you.
Oh.
Now, look, Carlton-Browne.
We all remember your late father.
Oh, he's not late yet, sir.
Oh, I'm very glad to hear it... a great ambassador anyway.
But this could be of the utmost importance.
If you have any doubt,
Any doubt at all as to your capacity?
Good heavens, no, sir.
Oh, I hope you're right.
We shall give you temporary status as special
Ambassador, and you'll leave at once.
Now, sir?
Is there anything against it?
Well, it'll mean that I shall miss ascot.
There are some sacrifices, Mr. Carlton-Browne,
- Which the servi...
- Of course, sir.
Please don't worry about me.
You'll travel by passenger plane until you transfer.
What then?
Well, that'll be up to the boys on the squad.
We don't even know yet that they've got an airfield on
The island.
I shan't keep you long, sir.
Evening.
Evening.
Bellingham.
Oh, yes, welcome to war house.
Carlton-Browne of the F.O.
How do you do?
Scotch?
Oh, thanks.
Sounds like a sticky wicket.
Yes, it is blowing up a bit.
I meant this gaillardia jaunt.
Oh, that.
Afraid you'll have to put me in the picture.
Satchel's team only said I was military advisor.
Do you like satchel?
No, I don't think I do.
Oh, he's a good bloke satchel.
Tigerline Gore was talking about gaillardia in the club
Last night.
Didn't he marry one of the Tarrington girls?
No, that was Buster.
Tigerman and Cynthia Stowe-Furnace.
Artillery on the mother's side.
Well, the whole lot are gunners.
What did he say?
I beg your pardon?
I wonder what he said about gaillardia.
Who?
Tigerline Gore.
Did he say something?
I thought you said he did.
I don't think tiger would've said anything.
He never does, you know.
I see.
You mentioned tiger's brother Buster.
You didn't mean thruster?
Which thruster?
Thruster Stowe-Furnace, tiger's brother-in-law.
Oh, you mean the one who's A.B.C.
For the D.A.D.N.I.
That's the fella.
No.
No.
Ah, good.
Breakfast, gentlemen?
Ah, breakfast.
Yes, I'll have some porridge,
Fried eggs and bacon, toast, marmalade, and coffee, please.
Yes, sir.
You, c.B.?
Will you be needing your paper bag?
Good lord, no.
We'll be down in half an hour.
Thank goodness for that.
Better get it over with.
I hear the next leg's likely to be rough.
Could you manage a piece of fried bread as well?
Yes, sir.
Perhaps two pieces?
Wait for it.
Thought so.
Ah, I am prime minister Amphibulos.
Excellency, I speak for his majesty king loris that you
Have very loud welcome to gaillardia.
Yes, indeed.
Her majesty's government assure you that gaillardia
Is very much in their thoughts.
Good.
Very, very good.
And you, general, welcome.
Colonel bellingham.
Congratulations.
And now you must meet my brother-in-law, Mr. Nakos,
Minister of agriculture,
Public works, highways, and the transport.
Hello, boys.
My cousin, Mr. archipelagos,
Chief of police, vessel of the admiralty and distilleries.
Hello, boys.
The others do not matter.
Very nice men, but you will meet them later.
And now please you inspect the guards of honor.
We are very proud here that our modern army is founded
On your brigade of guard.
Get up.
Get up.
Why you lie down?
Your carriage.
Well, we meet again soon, eh?
Oh, yes, of course.
Good.
And you, general, eh?
Have a good time.
His excellency the ambassador.
Eh?
Oh, oh, you must excuse me not getting up.
But as you see...
Of course, of course.
May I present colonel bellingham of the bays?
Honor, sir.
Sir.
This is a moment of some emotion for me, gentlemen.
The first official visitors from the mother country
For...
let me see, 57... 59 years.
Yes, will you take a glass of Madeira?
Oh, thank you, splendid idea.
Thank you very much.
Welcome to the island.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Would you be good enough to secure the door?
The door?
We mustn't be overheard.
Oh, I see.
Bellingham, would you mind?
Oh, of course.
Well, they're digging... oh!
So sorry.
Digging, where?
Well, everywhere.
They've made little holes all over the island.
What shape are the holes?
Oh, dear, they didn't say.
Do you hear that there, bellingham?
What?
Little holes all over the island.
Good lord.
Well, the first thing is a map.
Map?
About the holes, sir.
Oh?
Then we can decide exactly... what was in your mind?
Well, nothing, but one always starts with a map.
May give us a line.
Well, personally, gentlemen,
I think they're imposters.
Of course, we know they're not cossacks.
Cossacks?
But I was speaking of the British council.
You don't mean the holes were made by them?
Well, they never stop.
They're like moles.
But the Russians... aren't they digging?
Well, they seem to have stopped,
But I can tell you one thing.
They sent a message to St. Petersburg.
St. Pete...
No, no, please don't get up.
Thank you, sir.
May I present Mr. Carlton-Browne,
The special ambassador?
How do you do?
And, sir, the military attache, colonel bellingham.
Morning.
Your majesty, my government desire me to
Convey their respectful congratulations,
And wish me to assure you that gaillardia still
Retains, in the hearts of the British people,
The warm affection she has so long enjoyed.
Well, that's very nice.
Shall we sit down?
I always think it's harder to make speeches sitting
Down, don't you?
And how about a nice cup of tea?
An English habit I've grown very fond of.
Oh!
Are you all right, sir?
I'm so sorry, yes.
Oh, God, thank you, quite.
Well, now, Mr. Carlton-Browne.
Your majesty, I... my government and the people of
Great Britain feel a very deep concern for this island.
Well, that's very decent of them.
I must say I never met anybody in Britain who'd
Ever heard of us.
Do you smoke?
Given them up?
Yes, sir.
I mean, no thank you, sir.
Your majesty, I must respectfully remind you that
There is in existence a treaty.
Oh, yes, I know about the treaty, yes.
Then, sir, I'm sure you will appreciate the presence
Here of another great power...
Meaning the Russians.
Yes, sir.
Don't be afraid to say so.
If we go on chasing each other around the mulberry
Bush, we shan't get anywhere, shall we?
Oh, yes, sorry, sir.
That's all right.
Before you go on, may I say something?
You see, I'm a new boy here.
Less than a fortnight ago, I was having half a can in Mitre,
Looking forward to several years in London as a medical student.
Suddenly, the phone rings and Amphibulos here tells me
I'm a king.
It'd be a bit of a shock for anyone.
Your majesty...
Just a moment.
I'm over the shock now.
I had a chance to look around, and what do I find?
An awful lot of poverty, Mr. Carlton-Browne.
No education, no hospitals, no roads, no lavatories,
Nothing.
Your majesty, the office of works has...
Just let me finish.
Yes.
On top of all this, I also discovered that two great
Powers have suddenly become very interested in us,
And I wonder why.
Your majesty, my government is solely concerned...
Yes, I'm sure, but you see I'm no politician.
And what I'd like you to tell me in ordinary English
Is exactly what you're after.
Your majesty, we're not after anything.
That is to say if I could convey your majesty's
Agreement, at least in principle,
To the renewal to the strengthening of those
Ties... those bonds which had remained unbroken...
Certainly.
You can tell them that I am most grateful for their good wishes.
Thank you, sir.
And?
Is that all, sir?
Until I know why this out of the way little place has
Suddenly become so important to everybody,
Wouldn't be very sensible for me to commit myself,
Would it?
- No, sir, but...
- Good.
And have a good time while you're here.
Colonel bellingham.
I'm sending you a sun ray lamp I brought back from England.
It might help.
Oh, your majesty is most gracious.
Amphibulos, go see our guests out and then come back.
I'd like a word with you.
Your majesty.
Well, I must say in all my years in the service,
I have...
Look, Mr. Carlton-Browne, please.
You are not to worry.
Everything will be all right.
He will see.
Now, tonight you and the general here will have a
Little private dinner with me.
Everything very friendly with all our cards under the table.
Well, thank you very much.
Good, good.
Then I will see you tonight.
Tonight.
Giovan, my tweed jacket.
Well, that was a waste of time.
If only we could all waste time like that,
It would be very good, you know?
I thought I knew something about diplomacy, but you?
Marvelous.
Congratulations.
Congratulations?
What for?
Well, already you have sent them out thinking the
Russians are in.
So now when they come back, they make a big offer.
Then back come the Russians with a bigger offer.
You and me, we are sitting in the middle.
You have the Rolls-Royce.
I have the Cadillac.
Everybody's happy.
And the people?
What do they get?
The people?
They get the lavatories, all the things you said to
Mr. Carlton-Browne.
They would be very happy with the lavatories.
I see.
Well, now, what are we going to do to entertain our
British guests?
Tonight I give a special dinner for them
To meet the cabinet.
All right, but remember now, no promises.
Be very discreet.
Your majesty, do not worry.
Everything will be very discreet, very dignified.
Oh, what a party.
Come on, c.B., now it's your turn.
Bravo.
What do you do?
No, really, not at the moment.
No, he's gonna party.
He's not tight enough.
That's the trouble.
Then we will help by drinking a toast.
To the greatness of Britain and all she will do for us.
Oh, thank you very much.
No, no, you must drink in one.
Otherwise, you will get a bit, you know?
Delicious.
Yes, yes.
It's called Gozanos.
Not a drop is drunk until it's three weeks old.
And now we will have the musica.
Now we talk, eh?
It's the best party since our boys out at Sandhurst.
Good, I am very happy.
I wanted you to know.
So now you tell me what you want.
Well, our treaty rights...
No, no, no.
What you want.
Me?
Yes.
British foreign service?
Well, nothing like that.
Wonderful.
Congratulations.
If only there was more people like you and me.
I have now to ask you how much you think your
Government will yield.
Yield?
Yes.
Well, that would rather depend on the king's attitude.
The king is very young boy.
He's got no experience, and he does not have no standing
With my men, but you.
You're really a brilliant man who understand perfectly.
So now I have to ask you...
Good show.
Mr. Carlton-Browne.
Hmm?
Oh, I'm so sorry.
You were saying?
That you have understood.
Oh, rather.
Good.
Then the king is no matter.
The real nature is his Uncle the grand Duke.
You know, this man is like... how you say?
The bull in the Chinese ship.
I can tell you that already he's "talking" with the
Russians, you know.
The Russians?
Yes.
We must do something immediately.
C.B., c.B., are you all right?
Did you hear that?
The Russians, they're speaking to the grand Duke.
Are they?
By gum.
We've got to do something.
We've got to show our teeth.
Show our teeth?
Put on a show of strength, old boy.
That's what slasher would advise.
Yes, yes, a show of strength.
Yeah.
And so you see why it is necessary for us to have a
Big show of our strength.
Look, I just don't get the point of this.
Who are we trying to impress anyway, the British?
The Russians?
Are they likely to be fighting my army?
There is the grand Duke.
I know, I know, but isn't it about time we try
Something new?
Couldn't we make a peaceful approach?
Look, your majesty, here I have reports from all over
The South.
Already he has seized machine guns, rifles,
Hand grenades.
I tell you this man is going to make a lot of trouble for you.
Maybe, maybe, but I still think we should have a try.
Anyway, I've asked him to meet me.
When?
This morning.
- Where?
- Here.
- Here?
- Yeah.
I am sorry, your majesty.
The cabinet will never agree to this.
I'm sorry too.
He's coming.
He's coming?
You know, that will be marvelous.
Then we could arrest him.
I've promised him safe conduct.
That's better still.
The safer the conduct, the easier to bump him, eh?
We'll do nothing of the kind.
Right.
He would smell a trap.
He won't come.
Uncle Alex, glad you came.
This is not a courtesy visit.
Now sit down there, Amphibulos,
And don't try any tricks if you know what's good for you.
Uncle, I promised you safe conduct.
You needn't worry.
I don't need your safe conduct.
I have my own out there.
Now, listen to me, boy.
Now that your father is gone and I'm not going to pretend
I'm sorry, I don't intend to go on bickering with you.
Well, that's wonderful.
As a matter of fact, I intended...
Never mind your intentions.
There is only one thing to do.
You must abdicate.
Oh?
In whose favor, yours?
No, there is the rightful heir to the throne:
The princess Ilyena.
Hm, well, it's nice to know the arrangements you're making.
You may not know it, but this Adam is ready to fall
Into my hand like a ripe apple,
Not because the people love me,
But because they are sick to death of this.
The people elected me, your excellency.
Which shows that the people are half-witted.
Your excellency, of course,
Does not favor elections.
You are the best argument against them, Amphibulos.
- Your majesty...
- Shut up.
You've got more on your plate, young man,
Than you realize.
Take my advice:
Abdicate.
I will see that you're provided for.
That's nice of you.
What happens if I say no?
Well, that would be very stupid.
Now, what's it to be?
I shall have to think about it, shan't I?
Till the end of the month.
Uncle Alex, I haven't seen Ilyena for 14 years.
Aren't I going to see her now?
She's in mourning.
Women do not unveil.
Sorry, I was forgetting.
See you don't forget what I've just told you... that's
If you don't want to finish up with the rest of them in
A hotel in Portugal.
Come along.
Well, he did say it wasn't a courtesy visit.
Now you have seen.
Yes.
Yes, perhaps we do need a show of strength.
Amphibulos.
Your majesty.
Who built these stands?
The works minister, your majesty.
Oh, your cousin.
Yes, he's a sort of cousin, but he's given no time.
Or nails.
I will see to it he never forgets this, your majesty.
Do you see who's here?
Hmm?
Admiral, see who just dropped anchor?
We just got here in time, Joe.
Uncle Alex, glad you were able to come.
Thought I might as well see what is your strength.
So did I.
Ilyena, come and sit here.
Chairs.
I want you to sit in the front so that everyone sees
You are behind us.
Sit closer to the king.
The king, the king.
Hello there, good-bye.
You are about to see a grand display of our gallant
Gaillardian forces, each one with meticulous precision in
Front of you at an arranged moment.
And while they are passing, I will decide for you what
It is will happen.
First come the brave pioneers,
The men who build the roads on which the army marches.
Also the holes.
In wars, the army uses many holes for trenches
And other things.
You'd better make a note.
They'll need boots.
And a sergeant major.
These gallant ladies are members of the M.W.S.:
The mobile women's shootsharpers, otherwise known as the
King's own.
Well, I don't know what a sergeant major will do with
That lot.
Or what that lot would do with a sergeant major.
Ah, bravo.
The air forces.
These heroic pilots with their gallant birds are what
We called with pride "a few of the first."
Holy cow.
Amphibulos?
Your majesty?
Your majesty.
Where on earth did you dig these up?
They were a present from Great Britain for our
Glorious part in the first war.
It's good to show, yeah?
Well, you might have showed them flying.
They have no engines.
What?
They are disappeared.
Hello, what come now.
Behind the fighting front comes the fighting behind.
Salute to the brave citizens who guard the home.
Today the fighting men do not walk to battle.
They arrive.
The men and machines of the motorized infantry are the
Finest in the world.
Did you make it clear that this was to be
A show of strength?
Oh, give us a hand, somebody.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry,
But there seems to be a slight technical difficulty.
As minister for war, supplies,
And apparently almost everything else,
I hold you entirely responsible for making us
Look complete idiots.
Whose idea was it anyway?
You made me look an absolute idiot.
The king is an idiot.
The British are idiots.
The timber was very cheap.
I was promised by the contractor they would use it
Only for the public.
They are very dishonest men.
They're not the only ones.
Your cousin must have known the wood was rotten.
How the devil was I to know
The show would be so utterly rotten?
And of all the rotten things in Gaillardia,
The rottenest is Mr. Amphibulos.
Now you have seen why we have to have money.
And so if the British offer enough, you must take it.
Otherwise, the Russians will make your Uncle so strong,
He will come and throw you out.
Just get this into your head, Amphibulos.
There's not going to be any sell-out.
We're not going to be occupied by anyone.
He shouldn't meddle with things he doesn't understand.
He didn't ask to be a king.
He may not have to worry about that much longer.
Poor boy.
What will he do now?
Well, what do we do now?
Of course, our American allies must be laughing
Their heads off.
Oh, I don't think so.
The admiral broke a leg, you know.
Excellency, Mr. Archipelagos would like
To see your excellency.
Who?
The chief of the police, sir.
Really?
Well, then show him in.
Excellency.
Bellingham.
Oh, how do you do?
What can I do for you?
Excellence, as commanding me
In regard to the only hospitals.
Hella!
It's a chap.
Quite.
I think this is more up your street, old boy.
Oh, is it?
Oh, the British council?
Oh, I'm afraid you can't see him.
He's in bed.
You see he's in bed with lumbago.
I'm so sorry.
I mean, lumbago.
No.
Obviously, he doesn't mean the British council, does he?
Hmm?
Remember Amphibulos promised the police would
Find them for us?
So he did.
Do you mean the British council?
You remember, the dancers?
Oh, lord.
They're still digging.
Just a minute.
We better have a map.
Good idea.
You will show us on the map.
No surface deposits.
The last lot, have we analyzed them yet, Griffiths?
Oh, yes, sir John, yes.
Most extraordinary.
Well, what was it?
Epsom salts?
I think there must be a hole in the bottom of my rucksack.
Well, we've riddled the island with holes and found nothing.
If we don't find it down here,
It's been a wild goose chase.
Well, what do we do then, sir John?
We danced our way in.
We'll have to dance our way out.
Shh.
Did you hear that?
Came from over there.
You hang on.
I'll do a quick recce.
C.B.!
C.B., the Ruskies are here.
What, digging?
No, but they must be getting warmer.
There you are.
This must be them.
Hello.
What is it?
Nitroglycerin?
No, Chanel no. 5.
Could that be the British council?
One has heard things.
I must say I'm rather surprised.
Look at that.
The French?
They're at it as well.
Everybody, apparently, except for our chaps.
I say things are getting a bit dicey, aren't they?
My dear fellow , I dare say that
Unless we are very careful,
The balloon is likely to go up at any minute.
Come on.
"Exhaustive search reveals all major powers now"
Digging, stop.
"Informed grand Duke's forces advancing through mountains,
Request guidance."
"Request guidance."
Guidance.
Take a cable.
"Congratulations on transforming minor headache"
"into major crisis, stop."
Men on stop expected to give advice, not ask it, stop.
"What, repeat, what am I to tell U.N.O.
Next week?"
I've got to tell my minister something.
He's making a big speech next week.
Hmm.
You know, I can remember the time when one word from
Great Britain and there would have been a wall
Between the two peoples to keep them apart.
I say, I think I've got it.
A partition.
A partition?
But that's brilliant.
Why, I would never have thought of that.
Oh, congratulations.
Ah, over here, darling.
Gentlemen, it has been well-said that east is east
And west is west.
But so, I venture to suggest, is north and South.
The wolf is already at the door with his... his shoulder
To the wheel.
On the other hand, the lion is not yet prepared to lie
Down with the... the...
Where the devil was I off to?
The lamb.
No, you fool, the notes.
Where are they?
All history shows that a house divided against itself
Cannot stand.
If the people of this unhappy island will not stay
Apart, they must be kept apart.
Gentlemen, for the peace of Gaillardia... nay,
For the peace of the whole world...
We ask that this line of partition be drawn.
On the motion of great Britain that between north
And South a line be drawn.
United States?
Pakistan?
Argentine?
Japan?
U.S.S.R.?
What's gone wrong?
Gentlemen, along the 33rd parallel,
A line will be drawn.
This is the BBC home service.
Here is the 8:00 news.
The king of Gaillardia arrives in London today.
He is coming here at the invitation of the British
Government to discuss future relations between this
Country and the northern half of the island.
The foreign secretary, together with Mr. De Vere
Carlton-Browne, our special ambassador,
Who has himself just returned from Gaillardia,
Will be at London airport to meet him.
I understand he's angry having his country divided
In half.
We shall have to butter him up a bit.
Might be a good idea if we got him married to some
English girl.
I'd thought of that, sir.
Anyone in mind?
Well, I had thought of a cousin of mine...
lady Angela
Gore Chisington... who is, of course,
Related to the Duke of Suffolk.
I have a photograph of her here.
Afraid it's rather blurred.
She's joint master of the picture there.
What, this one?
It is a bad snap, isn't it.
That's one of her hunters.
She's the one on the left.
Extremely wealthy.
She'd need to be.
Yes.
See that he gets the full VIP treatment.
We hope, sir, that you'll be comfortable.
If you should want anything...
There's only one thing that I want.
That's the other half of my country back.
There will be a meeting, sir.
In fact a series of meetings...
Yes, but are you going to give it back?
We're anxious to give every assistance...
I shall still want it back.
Good-bye.
That young man's going to be difficult.
Ah, minister.
Sir John farthing and his team have just arrived, sir.
That's the Canadian ice hockey team?
No, our experts from Gaillardia, sir.
Good heavens, I will see him at once.
Yes, sir.
Ah, captain Slade?
Yes?
Sir John?
Aye?
My dear fellow.
Come and sit down.
Bring a chair.
We've been quite worried about you.
Now, do sit down.
Cigarette?
I have my pipe.
Now, do tell me.
Well, we found it.
No.
I say we did.
Splendid.
There are very large deposits.
There are?
Tremendous deposits, comparatively speaking.
Well, that's wonderful.
Now, tell me, what... what are you going to do with it?
Do with it?
This... this stuff.
The cobalt?
Cobalt.
Ah, yes.
I see.
Yes, of course, that's... stuff you'll find in
Children's paint boxes?
It's what you paint on a hydrogen bomb to get an
Explosion of 93 G.X.Z.
I'm very happy to tell you that you're now in a
Position to blow the entire world to smithereens.
But that's tremendous.
My dear fellow, how can we ever thank you enough?
The minister's called for a map.
Yes, of course.
Help yourself.
We've pulled it off.
We have?
Farthing says we've found enough to blow up
The entire world.
That's terrific.
What a triumph for you.
Congratulations.
Well, one does what one can.
Anything, don't let it go any further.
Oh, of course not.
I have tremendous news.
Yes.
- C.B.'S brought it off.
- He has?
We can blow up the entire universe any time we wish.
What?
But that's appalling.
Do you always have to see the gloomy side of everything?
Ah, here we are, sir John.
Now you just pinpoint the exact position of the deposits...
It's along this area around here.
But that's in the South.
Of course it's in the South.
Are you quite sure?
Naturally I'm sure.
Do you hear that?
We've got the wrong half.
Yes.
Oh, yes, yes.
Yes.
Yes, I appreciate what you say.
Mm, but already his majesty is waiting for two weeks.
You ask him here for urgent talks,
And leave him to talk to himself.
No, thank you.
His majesty does not wish to see the tower of London.
Already he was at Battersea power station yesterday,
And he hates that Albert memorial.
Now, please, please, he wants only to see the
Foreign office.
That's right.
Thank you.
Okay, good-bye.
Well, what's the excuse this time?
The minister's got a cold in the head.
Yesterday his car broke down.
The day before, their advisors went to the wrong ministry.
They say now they try to arrange something quickly.
No, they want to try a bit harder.
There's something very peculiar going on,
And I'd like to know what it is.
I go now to the foreign secretary.
I'll see you when I return.
Yes.
With your majesty's gracious permission,
We will attend to the flowers.
They've just been done.
We regret the inconvenience, your majesty,
But there appears to be some slight misunderstanding.
Is it true that you have the king of Gaillardia staying?
Yes, ma'am, but I understand that he may be
Leaving quite shortly.
We do hope you'll be very happy here.
Well, here we are.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
It is possible... and I use the word advisedly,
Possible... that we might pay something.
I suggest 17 million.
I was going to suggest 2 1/2 million.
You must have a word with the minister at once.
Why?
The king of Gaillardia's just arrived.
But the minister's with the grand Duke.
Well, he insists on seeing him.
He can't.
I don't know what you're going to do about it.
He's in the anteroom.
Where do I find the minister?
Well, not here, sir.
Out that door, turn right, straight down the corridor.
You'll find somebody to direct you.
Thank you, thank you.
Where is he?
Well, he was here.
Where's the king?
The what?
The king of Gaillardia.
The bloke just made off and missed her.
Just left.
There he is.
Sir, sir, I'm so sorry.
It was your coat.
The minister's conference?
Through the door, sir.
Thank you.
Come in.
Your majesty, might I have a word with you?
Not now, Mr. Carlton-Browne.
It's a matter of some urgency.
I'm here to see the minister.
I do understand, but I'm happy at the present moment...
Mr. Carlton-Browne,
Will you kindly get out of my way?
Your majesty, I very much regret...
- So do I.
- Oh!
Your majesty, I really must ask that you...
That's all I wanted to know.
Why on earth did you bring him in here?
Bring?
You will please tell his most gracious excellency the
Grand Duke that there is much I can now do to assist him.
And he is not to worry about the king,
Because the British have dropped him like a bag potato.
So now I think is very simple for all of us.
You will please explain to your Uncle that with me
Behind the throne and him in front of it,
You will be... how do you say, standing pretty.
Then, of course, you will be queen,
And this young man... who in any case is very
Stupid... will be thrown out.
Is that all?
Yes.
Tell him, please.
Very well.
Ilyena?
Ah, Ilyena, you must get yourself ready at once.
What for?
Mr. Carlton-Browne is bringing his cousin to meet
You, the heir to the Duke of Suffolk.
Come in, Amphibulos.
Had a profitable afternoon?
Your majesty, I have been asleep.
He says that the king has been dropped by the British.
I know that.
And he feels that now you could work very well together.
Oh, he does, does he?
And I am beginning to think he's right.
What do you say?
I think what both of you are doing is horrible,
Just horrible.
Please!
Hello.
Miss Adrianas, you remember me?
Yes, of course, Mr. Jones.
Well, here we go again.
That's the first nice thing that's happened.
Oh, and where are you off to?
Nowhere.
May I come too?
So you know that old bird, do you?
Yes, I do.
And Ilyena?
Even better.
I haven't seen her since she was a spotty-faced
Little horror of about ten.
Can we go in here?
Anywhere you like.
The minister's given me exactly three days to settle
The whole matter.
Of course, if you do marry her,
It'll mean living there for part of the year.
Hmm, anything to shoot?
Only the natives.
What fun.
As polling day draws near in the Gosford Green
Bi-election, excitement mounts rapidly to fever pitch.
Thank you, there was someone I didn't want to see.
Shh.
Here at first hand, a typical housewife gives our
Roving camera her views on the burning issues of the day.
What do you think of the cold war, Mrs. Carter?
I beg your pardon?
The international situation.
Do you think it's getting any easier?
Well, I don't really know.
Of course not.
They say that this election will be won on the trade issue.
Do you think we're winning the battle on exports?
Well, I couldn't say.
No, quite.
They're telling me locally that you're all very
Concerned about the provision of new schools.
Oh, yes.
Do you feel strongly about that?
Well, I hadn't really thought about it.
Well, thank you very much indeed, Mrs. Carter.
You've been most helpful.
And I'm sure we all have a clearer idea of what is in
The mind of the British housewife today.
Thank you, Mrs. Carter.
It's quite all right.
From the island of Gaillardia,
Scene of a recent royal assassination,
Important visitors recently arrived at London airport.
We can go now.
No, we must see this.
We didn't pay to listen to you two gossip.
Following closely on the heels of the young king,
The grand Duke Alexis is here for urgent talks with
The government.
High foreign office officials were there to greet him.
He is accompanied by his niece, the princess Ilyena,
Whose grace and charm immediately won the
Affection of all those who met her.
A figure of radiant beauty, her presence here in
England, together with her Uncle the grand Duke,
Will do much to cement relations between two island peoples.
So that's it.
I'm sorry.
I feel terrible about it.
I've had enough of this.
I'm gonna get the manager.
There's no need.
We're going.
Well, miss Adrianas...
I'm sorry.
I never meant to deceive you, Mr. Jones.
Please, if you let me, I will explain.
You'd better.
Taxi.
Uncle Alex is going to be very angry.
Well, that makes it just perfect.
Bring another bottle, will you?
Oui, monsieur.
What's that lounge suit doing here?
He's the king of Gaillardia.
Don't care if he's Billy hill.
We aren't having lounge suits here.
Oh, well, he's ordered another bottle of the best.
Well, don't take a check.
Is your niece likely to be much longer, sir?
I'm sorry.
I can't understand what's keeping her.
Ilyena?
Ilyena?
What's she like to look at?
We'll soon see.
I apologize, gentlemen.
It seems my niece has disappeared.
Ilyena...
Yes?
Suppose you were running a small family concern,
And you learn that a big corporation has decided to
Put you out of business, and then you also discover a
Relative is to be put in your place...
And that your manager is trying to do a deal
With both of them behind your back?
Yes.
That's it.
Well, what would you do?
I don't know.
I wondered... suppose you put to the shareholders.
Ilyena, that's quite an idea at that.
You know, you and I ought to get together.
Good night, your majesty.
Good night, darling.
Did you see the grand Duke?
No.
Can't make it out.
He's being most elusive.
Is that my tea?
Yes.
How about the girl?
That's just the point.
Three days are up, and you haven't even met her yet.
I don't know what the minister's going to say.
Carlton-Browne?
Sir.
Come see me at once.
Yes, sir.
Yes, minister?
What have you been up to now, Carlton-Browne?
I gave you three days to settle this Gaillardia
Affair, and what happens?
The king slips the royal hands,
Returns to the island, and sends me the rudest telegram
I've ever received.
The princess, after one look presumably at your cousin,
Goes after him.
So does the grand Duke.
And to cap everything, we've just had word that a
Revolution has broken out.
Revolution, sir?
Three security slipups, all our negotiations
Wrecked, and a revolution.
How extraordinary.
Extraordinary, yes.
I don't know what it is.
But put you in charge of anything,
And within 24 hours this department is facing a crisis.
We're committed now.
We can't back out.
We shall have to send troops in fast.
Who was that military fellow you had out there?
Bellingham, sir?
He'll have to take charge, knows the country.
I want C.I.G.S., war office, first lord admiralties,
Secretary for air, and the secretary to the cabinet in
That order.
And, Carlton-Browne, although the prospect
Appalls me, with half my staff tied up at the united
Nations and the other half in bed with Haitian flu,
I am reluctantly obliged to place the country's
Interests in the hands of the very last person I'd
Have chosen for a mission of this kind.
Oh, who's that, sir?
You, you...
You half-witted Halibut.
All history shows that a house artificially divided
Against itself cannot stand.
Gentlemen, for the future peace of Gaillardia,
Nay of the whole world, we ask that this line be withdrawn.
On the motion of great Britain that between north
And South the line be withdrawn, United States?
Pakistan?
Argentine.
Japan.
U.S.S.R.?
I thought as much.
What's he saying?
The Soviet supports the spontaneous revolt of the
People against harsh aggression.
They're sending 11 aircraft carriers and 19 cruisers on
A goodwill visit.
And we've sent Carlton-Browne.
All right, can't wait any longer.
Gather round, everybody.
Come on.
Sorry I'm late.
Where have you been?
I had to go back for my earplugs.
All right, pay attention, everybody.
Now, here's a picture.
The revolution started in the north prepping our
Position, then over the line to the South.
Rebel headquarters in this village here.
They have no idea we're in the country,
Which would be pretty good parlay.
Right, we're here then... straight across our
Line of advance.
Our attack goes in at 0200.
20 minutes to mop up advanced posts, consolidate.
1 hour 45 to rebel H.Q., which will be taken by 0440.
That should give us plenty of time to court-martial the
Leaders, shoot them, Polish equipment before breakfast.
Any questions?
Oh, what time is breakfast?
You can have it any time.
Where does one get it?
Well, haven't you brought any?
In all our strength, you know.
Anything else?
All right, synchronize watches.
Make 0135, 15 seconds.
0135, 16 seconds it is, sir.
I said 15.
Yes, sir, but I was aligning the time you were speaking.
But I spoke for more than a second.
Well, sir...
All right, what do you make it now?
0135, 28, sir.
- 29, sir.
- 31, sir.
- Nonsense, my...
- Oh, stop this.
C.B., what do you make of it?
Hmm?
Oh.
I'm afraid mine's stopped.
Everyone will now set their watches at 0136.
D hour is at 0140 minus 2, plus 3.
Got that?
Yes, sir.
All right, fall out.
No smoking.
Didn't you say no smoking?
Hmm?
Follow me.
Bellingham?
Bellingham, what's that?
- What?
- Listen.
Hello, Rolo.
Rolo answering.
Message received and understood.
Off.
Attacking advance post just going in, sir.
Dead on.
They've started.
Nothing to worry about.
We'll fall out about half an hour.
Good.
Hello, Rolo.
Rolo calling.
Report my signals.
Hello, Rolo.
Rolo calling.
Are you receiving me?
Report my signals, over.
What progress?
None, sir.
We've lost contact.
They went off the air in the middle of a message.
Blasted W.T.
Always pecks out just when you want it.
Extraordinary that if one didn't know,
One might think that the shooting was getting nearer.
Nonsense.
Pure illusion.
It must be the mountains.
Quite.
What is it?
There's a force coming at us through the forest, sir.
- From which direction?
- There, sir.
- We're being attacked, sir.
- Where?
- From over here, sir.
- Nonsense.
Where?
There, sir.
Inside quick!
Let me in!
What the devil were you doing out there?
We're being attacked!
Impossible.
There's not a rebel this side of the mountains.
Where did that come from?
Must be a rebel force we haven't heard about.
What do we do?
There's only one thing we can do.
Here, take these.
We'll have to shoot our way out.
But I can't.
I'm a civilian.
If I'm caught with these, I'd be shot on the spot.
If you're caught at all, you'll be shot on the spot.
They wouldn't dare, would they?
Shh.
Listen.
They stopped firing.
Contact again, sir.
Attack progressing.
Advanced post surrounded.
Shut up.
Quick!
Quick, clear this off.
Major Miller, what's the meaning of this?
Surrounding your own headquarters?
Bloody scandal.
Must have gone round in circles, sir.
If you didn't you're going to.
Put yourself under arrest.
Sir.
Captain Bowles...
Sir.
Take these men back to the start line.
The operation will continue.
Sir.
All right, fall in over there.
Follow me.
At the double!
Get these men moving.
Hurry up.
We're lucky they didn't shoot us.
I don't agree.
No sign of "a" company on that flank either, sir.
Can't make it out.
Shouldn't we sit here and wait for them?
Certainly not.
We're already behind schedule.
Anyway, they could be ahead of us.
All right, fall in behind.
Come on.
Bellingham, are all campaigns like this?
Like what?
Well, a shambles.
Nothing of the kind.
Everything's going completely according to plan.
I don't know what you're talking about.
As a matter of fact, if we get there by daybreak,
We can still catch them on the hop.
Important thing is initiative and
Surprise... completely surprise?
Carlton-Browne?
Mr. Carlton-Browne, and you, colonel.
I beg your pardon, brigadier.
I see you've been promoted.
This is quite unexpected.
Where were you two off to?
I, sir... we, sir...
Well, sit down, both of you.
You must be very tired.
I would rather stand.
Thank you, sir.
Well, now, Mr. Carlton-Browne.
Well, sir, we'd... we'd heard that there was a
Revolution, and...
You rushed troops out here to rescue me?
Yes, sir.
Well, that was very considerate.
Weren't you told that I started it?
Started what, sir?
The revolution.
The minister made it clear it was the only thing left
To do, and it's going very well.
No, I'm very glad, sir.
Thank you.
Well, apart from a few of the grand Duke's men,
Seems to be all over.
I think I will sit down if you don't mind, sir.
Certainly.
Excuse me a moment.
Gentlemen, I think you know my fiancee the princess Ilyena.
They've gallantly made the most arduous journey to
Bring us their government's congratulations.
How very brave.
Yes.
I shall have to find some way to express our gratitude
For all they've done.
Of course.
What you have done will be long remembered
In Gaillardia.
We, therefore, do invest you with the star of Elysium,
Third class.
That surprised you, didn't it?
Only one thing clouds our happiness today.
For reasons of health, the grand Duke Alexis has
Decided to spend his remaining years in a hotel
In Portugal.
Mr. Amphibulos, with rare generosity,
Has resolved to accompany him.
And now I'm going to ask Mr. Carlton-Browne to kick
Off for this goodwill football match,
Which will mark the departure of our visitors
From the U.S.A.
And the u.S.S.R.
Thank you, Mr. Carlton-Browne.
Your majesty.
How many paragraphs, Arthur?
- None.
- None?
There's a short reader.
"When Cadogan De Vere Carlton-Browne leaves
"hospital today, he will go straight to Buckingham
"palace for investiture.
"His knighthood is a well-merited reward for his
"services in the cause of world peace.
"His handling of a difficult situation has throughout
Proved a triumph of British diplomacy."
when the green of the jungle was young when our fathers and their fathers and their fathers before them were yet unborn a monster walked this land Hadrian the strong the old the blood of our ancestors poured from the monsters mouth
it poured like the water the great river no one dared battle with him no one but curry without fear as her children are without fear she fought the monster upon this earth and cut him down but from
each drop of his blood a new monster spawn and Kali did battle with each new master and cut him down but from their blood new monsters arose destroy them
Kali knew she must kill without spilling any blood so she gave our ancestors this sacred cloth and said
strangle the monsters there was no blood and when the last one was tangled Kali left these for her children through the
centuries your children have done your work and tonight we bring you more of your sons to do your bidding tonight they join us welcome your son's great khali whom I have raised for you since their boyhood look upon them with favor as you have looked upon us
they seek only to serve you but every displease you send us an omen that we may know of your displeasure Kali embraces her sons
when the harvest is gathered your sons will be ready great khali your sons will be ready
are we all here all except captain Busan will all suffocate before Lewis thumbs up I invited him to dinner once he turned up the following day let's get on with it come on very well now gentlemen we've
asked Patel Charlie to speak for us Patel I am most flattered that my friends should have seen fit to call upon me as their spokesman after all since the Honourable East India Company extended its control to this territory I am the Patel hitman in name only
however the situation is so grave that I feel obliged to speak as if I were the patella walls instead of the patella have become yes chéri get on with it you are most impatient colonel I'm only anxious to get it over so we
can all get away to somewhere a bit cooler cool you want is it we're losing hundreds of pounds all right burns you've agreed to that Patel shall you speak for you I know but I just wanted you to please let him speak
Thank You colonel it will not take long any sign of Lewis no sir

you let me go
- I can find out everything he says I'm only Son I know
my friends are not reluctant to pay for order and stability order stability facilitate commerce they increase Commerce well this in turn increases the text isn't revenues of your company all this being the case my friends are most surprised and disappointed with the order and stability of our territory
surprising disappointed were shocked absolutely shocked one of my shipments to one of my supposed of Medora has completely disappeared now I've traveled pretty extensively than the community and I've never seen a hole large enough to swallow up horses carts of cotton and people it's impossible to police the
entire area between the end of adorable what does not mean am I supposed to forget about my losses there's nothing new is it you've had these disappearances before and that makes it all right does it come to India and
disappear I don't know you look here we are sick of all the talk was being on the subject we don't care what the problems are the extent of the area to be policed the number of soldiers they have those are entirely the problems of
your company I don't ask your company to help me grow my crops oh we knows the situation's becoming intolerable and I won't tolerate it if something isn't done soon I shall put through a report to your
headquarters in Bombay I think mr. burns to be absolutely right sir there you are
I believe that the only person I think we'd better let mr. burns finish finish
I will finish paying my taxes and revenues unless something is done about the situation immediately the harvest will be in soon our caravans must be able to proceed without undue molestation I mean we accept and expect the
occasional robbery but these wholesale disappearances must cease I agree we all agree with mr.
Perez knows nothing further to discuss except perhaps we'd all be better off if cattle challywood hit man again mr. burns you too much nonsense maybe you get something done
good day good day well it's very easy for mr.
Bursch to say he's not interested in our problems there it is an almost impossible situation
I play the governor will find no revenue an even more impossible situation where can a caravan disappear to I mean totally disappear and people I'll resent
Louis and people sir and people are disappear during my time out here I don't know how many people have been reported missing and it's the same in every territories people disappear in
England thousands a year every year how many reported missing persons in our territory alone last year totaled 1119 I sent you a report on it sir you did I send it to London sir I do requests and what a London apply they said they'd be
delighted to tell us should any on the list appearance of James Street huh well you seem to be the expert on missing persons what do you make of it they deserted the family's Indians never desert their families under any circumstances where they gone to comment silver horses and
camels cars and everything else yeah sir speak up Lewis might I make a suggestion sir providing I could hear it and I suggested to a point an officer with a small staff to devote his entire time to finding what does happen and they do be
relieved of all duties exempt finding out it seems to be the most logical thing to do good idea Lewis is there anything else it's too hard to go on with us today I'm just missing
catch the big Cobra he's gone he's gone mmm sobbing did you deliver the letter for the master of course on inside safely to the belt itself good may I be excused to leave Nam inside
it is time for troika supper certainly rounder mr. burns the rest of the planters they said these wholesale disappearances must cease used to chide me for collecting the statistics the number of persons missing remember I suggested to him that he appoints an officer to devote his whole time to investigating these disappearances and
he agreed you darling who's the obvious person to employ it not the expert this is going to be absolutely wonderful you know do you know what it means it means that I can devote my whole time for this in just a few hours stolen after my
regular work and I will there's nothing haphazard about this Mary oh no this is some kind of organized conspiracy I know it and I'll find it out may I interrupt you from emmet remind your son please of course what is it the two had contemplated resigning from the company

the marketplace really the Potter not just the Potter there must be thousands of them living quietly in the city working most of the time and the rest of the time they steal and kill them but will you talk up to Lewis the Potter

your produce in one Caravan the size of the cat Abed will keep its journey safe no one will attack a caravan of this dimension I hope you're right he's all prepared they'll move out at midnight good the cloak of night will cover the
caravans movement out of the city are you sure we shouldn't wait until the company find out who or what is destroying the caravan how long will you wait from what I learned the company has made no progress on this matter battle char is right we've no idea how
long this condition will exist but I can tell you how long we'll all exist we can't continue trading I pray to god they get there
I am confident the caravan will reach its appointed destiny
when this Caravan is reported missing the company will send many many soldiers here after this caravan has been disposed of the children of Kali will be silent for many many months this Caravan contains all after this Caravan disappears they may listen to captain Lewis we cannot run the risk of Lewis
remaining alive it is settled Lewis died his death may arouse normal suspicion in investigation he has spoken of stragglers he will die by the sword his house will be looted captain Colonel Smith will pronounce it a robbery cannot smith is pleased by the
obvious it does not tax his dull mind to be safe Bedell let us rob and kill
Louie's neighbor as well it would then appear that a band of thieves ransacked the area silver speak sensibly Patel so be it
Sydney's dead because of me it's true Mary it's me they wanted to Sydney with justice Ronan as a sacrifice to make it look as though they're robbing everybody

she's out there Carly the murderess they're murdering sons this is only the beginning Mary
you
When the green of the jungle was young when our fathers and their fathers, and their fathers before them were yet unborn, a monster walked this land.
He ate the young, the strong, the old.
The blood of our ancestors poured from the monster's mouth.
It poured like the water in the great river.
No one dared battle with him.
No one but Kali.
Kali.
Kali.
Without fear, as her children are without fear she fought the monster upon this Earth and cut him down.
But from each drop of his blood, a new monster spawned.
And Kali did battle with each new monster and cut them down.
But from their blood, new monsters arose.
To destroy them Kali knew she must kill without spilling any blood.
So she gave our ancestors this sacred cloth, and said, "Kill."
Kill, kill, kill.
They strangled the monsters.
There was no blood.
And when the last one was strangled Kali left these for her children.
Through the centuries, your children have done your work.
And tonight, we bring you more of your sons to do your bidding.
Tonight, they join us.
Welcome your sons, great Kali whom I have raised for you since their boyhood.
Look upon them with favor as you have looked upon us.
They seek only to serve you, but if they displease you send us an omen that we may know of your displeasure.
Kali embraces her sons.
Kali, Kali, Kali.
When the harvest is gathered, your sons will be ready, great Kali.
Your sons will be ready.
Kali, Kali, Kali.
Come on, wake up, then.
-Are we all here?
-All except Captain Lewis, sir.
We'll all suffocate before Lewis turns up.
I invited him to dinner once.
He turned up the following day.
Let's get on with it, colonel.
Very well.
Now, gentlemen?
We've asked Patel Shari to speak for us.
Patel?
I am most flattered that my friends should have seen fit to call upon me as their spokesman.
After all, since the honorable East India Company extended its control to this territory, I am the patel the headman in name only.
However, the situation is so grave that I feel obliged to speak as if I were the patel I was, instead of the patel I have become.
-Yes, yes, Shari, get on with it.
-You are most impatient, colonel.
I'm only anxious to get it over so that we can all get away to somewhere a bit cooler.
Cool, you want, is it?
We're losing hundreds of pounds--
All right, Burns.
You've agreed to let Patel Shari speak for you.
-l know, but I just wanted you--
-Then please let him speak.
Thank you, colonel.
It will not take long.
-Any sign of Lewis?
-No, sir.
-Please, Lewis--
-Not now, Dashi, I'm late.
-But is there any word?
-No word.
-The boy is the only son of my sister.
-We're doing all we can.
-You must find him.
-We'll try.
Burns sahib says the company can find nothing.
Burns sahib--
Mr. Burns is in the meeting now.
If you let me go, I can find out everything he says.
An only son of an only sister.
I know.
My friends are not reluctant to pay for order and stability.
Order and stability facilitate commerce.
They increase commerce.
And this, in turn, increases the taxes and revenues of your company.
All this being the case my friends are most surprised and disappointed with the order and stability of our territory.
Shari's being far too kind, colonel.
Surprised and disappointed?
We're shocked, absolutely shocked.
-One of my shipments to--
-Sorry, sir.
One of my shipments to Bhadora has completely disappeared.
Now, I've traveled extensively in India, Colonel Henderson.
And I've never seen a hole large enough to swallow up horses carts of cotton and people.
It's impossible to police the entire area between here and Bhadora.
What does that mean?
Am I supposed to forget my losses?
This is nothing new.
You've had disappearances before.
That makes it all right, does it?
Come to India and disappear.
-Now, look here, Burns--
-No, you look here.
We're sick of all the talk there's been on this subject.
We don't care what the problems are.
The area to be policed, the number of soldiers you have.
Those are entirely the problems of your company.
I don't ask your company to help me grow my crops.
All we know is the situation is becoming intolerable.
And I won't tolerate it.
If something isn't done soon, I shall put through a report to your headquarters in Bombay.
I think Mr. Burns to be absolutely right, sir.
-There you are.
-The only possible- l think we'd better let Mr. Burns finish.
-Finish l will.
Finish paying my taxes and revenues unless something's done about the situation immediately.
The harvest will be in soon.
Our caravans must be able to proceed without undue molestation.
What do you mean, undue molestation?
I mean that we accept and expect the occasional robbery but these wholesale disappearances must cease.
-l agree.
-We all agree with Mr. Burns.
Then there's nothing further to discuss as far as I'm concerned.
Except perhaps we'd all be better off if Patel Shari were headman again.
Mr. Burns, you flatter me too much.
Nonsense.
Maybe you'd get something done.
-Good day.
-Good day.
-Good day, colonel.
-Good day.
Good day.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Well?
It's very easy for Mr. Burns to say he's not interested in our problems.
But there it is.
An almost impossible situation.
The company will find no revenue an even more impossible situation.
Where can a caravan disappear to?
I mean, totally disappear.
-And people.
-What was that, Lewis?
And people, sir.
-And people what?
-Disappear.
During my time out here, I don't know how many people have been missing.
And it's the same in every territory, sir.
-People disappear in England.
-Thousands a year, every year.
-How many?
-Reported missing persons in our territory alone last year totaled 1 1 1 9.
I sent you a report on it, sir.
-You did?
-l sent it to London, sir.
-At your request.
-And what did London reply?
They said they'd be delighted to tell us should anyone on the list appeared in St. James's Street.
Well, Lewis, you seem to be the expert in missing persons.
What do you make of it?
Have they deserted their families?
Indians never desert their families, sir, under any circumstances.
Well, where have they gone to?
And the cotton and silver.
Horses and camels and carts and everything else.
-What's happened to them?
-Sir.
-Speak up, Lewis.
-Might I make a suggestion, sir?
Providing I can hear it.
Then I suggest that you appoint an officer with a small staff to devote his entire time to finding what does happen.
And that he be relieved of all duties except finding out.
That seems to be the most logical thing to do.
Good idea, Lewis.
is there anything else?
It's too hot to go on with this today, eh?
Dismissed.
Catch the big cobra.
He's going.
Catch him.
Come on, catch him.
There, he's gone.
Oh, memsahib.
Come along, girl.
Did you deliver the letter for the master?
Of course, memsahib.
Safely to the boat itself.
Good.
May I be excused to leave now, memsahib?
-lt is time for Toki's supper.
-Certainly, Ram Das.
Come on, Toki, come.
-Hello, Harry.
-Mary.
Mary.
What is it?
is anything wrong?
Wrong?
Things were never more right.
They had a meeting and put their foot down.
-Who?
-Mr.
Burns and the rest of the planters.
They said these wholesale disappearances must cease.
You used to chide me for collecting the statistics of persons missing, remember?
-Of course.
-Today, I was called the expert on missing persons.
That's what Colonel Henderson called me, expert.
I suggested that he appoints an officer to devote his whole time to investigating these disappearances, and he agreed.
And, darling, who's the obvious person to employ if not the expert?
This is going to be wonderful.
Do you know what it means?
It means I can devote my whole time to this instead of just a few hours stolen after my regular work.
And I will.
There's nothing haphazard about this, Mary, you know.
This is some kind of organized conspiracy.
I know it, and I'll find it out.
May I interrupt you for a moment to remind you of something?
Why, yes, of course.
What is it?
That you had contemplated resigning from the company.
Oh, yes.
You sent a letter to London applying for the Lloyd Shipping Company.
You want me to refuse this chance?
I realize our financial position isn't as good as it might be if I were engaged in private commerce.
And I know I'm not getting any younger.
I know if I'm gonna make a move, now is the time to make it.
But this is something I've been working on for years.
-lt's important to me.
-Yes, I know.
Dashi stopped me in the street.
He asked me for news of his nephew.
Remember the boy who disappeared with Burns' caravan to Bhadora?
How many sad-eyed relatives in the last few years have come up to me?
You think I could take another job for additional money and have these people's faces haunt me all my life?
Oh, Harry, I know it--
You're being unreasonable and selfish in a way I cannot understand.
Somebody's got to get to the bottom of this.
Thousands and thousands of people are disappearing all over India.
And I am better equipped than anyone for this task.
Do you want me to evade my responsibilities?
Darling, all I am trying to say is to send the boy to Darudih to intercept the letter before it leaves for London tomorrow.
Ram Das.
Ram Das.
Bless you.
Ram Das.
Good evening, Flood.
-Ram Das.
-Evening.
He's in here, Harry.
I want you to leave for Darudih and bring back that letter.
-Bring it back?
-Yes, get ready now.
-l'll give you a note to take with you.
-Yes, captain.
Toki.
-lt's all right, leave him.
You get ready.
-Yes, captain.
Yes?
Sir, I have a message from Colonel Henderson.
From Henderson.
Wish me luck.
-Sir.
-Yes?
The message.
Well, the colonel wants to see me, doesn't he?
-ls that all?
-Yes, sir.
-Very well, thank you.
-Sir.
What is it, Harry?
At dawn tomorrow, the colonel wants me to proceed with a detail of men to Feetul to escort a Captain Connaught-Smith to the barracks.
Halt.
Get them.
Search them.
Tie them up.
You stay here with them.
We'll go on and pick up the captain and join you on the way back.
I believe Colonel Henderson mentioned something about dawn.
I'm sorry, Captain Smith, but we--
Captain Connaught-Smith, if you please, captain.
When you're quite cool enough, captain, I'm ready.
Captain sahib!
Good to see you, Christopher.
How's your father?
Extremely well, sir.
He sends you his most affectionate regards.
Good, good. I see you've come prepared for everything.
The finest London has to offer.
-l may ask to borrow some of this.
-Be my pleasure, sir, if you do.
-Did you have a good journey?
-Somewhat delayed.
We were engaged in a skirmish with some goats.
-What?
-l had two prisoners, colonel.
They escaped, I'm afraid, in the market.
I see.
Let me have a full report.
Well, Christopher, you'll have your first assignment.
I knew you'd be the perfect man to investigate our disappearances.
No sooner do you come than we have two of them.
Nothing very mysterious there.
They were two bandits, and they were allowed to escape.
Of course.
Let's get you settled.
There's so much to talk about.
-You're dining with me tonight.
-Thank you, sir.
His father and I were at school together.
And Christopher has followed in our footsteps.
-Yes, sir.
-Tell me about London.
Sir.
-Yes?
-About the two men who disappeared.
Make a report and submit it to Captain Connaught-Smith.
It is good to have you with us.
Come, I'll take you to your quarters.
If they decide to rob on their own for themselves it will be dangerous for us.
There will always be the few who act on their own.
Yes, and those few must be punished.
And their punishment displayed before all the others.
That is the only way that the few shall remain a few.
You have sinned against the goddess Kali.
You set out to steal not for sacrifice to our Great Mother, but to fill your own filthy stomachs.
You have allowed the sacred silk to fall into the hands of an unbeliever.
Those that sin against Kali must suffer the pain of never looking upon her face again nor ever speaking her name.
Kali shows mercy only to her loved children.
Kali shows no mercy to the jackals that sin against her.
That was the first I knew about it.
It isn't fair.
You've been here in service for so many years.
They went to the same school.
Isn't there any way of having Henderson's order overruled?
Well, I could start by learning to play polo.
-Seriously, Harry-- -l'm being perfectly serious.
There is absolutely nothing I can do.
-Captain sahib, I've-- -l see you have, thank you.
-Captain sahib--
-Good job.
You got the letter back in time.
Well done.
-Captain sahib--
-Well done, what more do you want?
-Harry.
-Now be off.
Harry, he's trying to tell you something.
-What is it?
-l passed a caravan.
A small group of seeming traders traveling from Darudih to Bhadora.
And?
-One of them looked like my brother.
-Your brother?
Yes, captain sahib, my brother who disappeared with my beloved mother and father 1 0 years ago.
I rode back and asked for the boy.
The leader of the caravan said there was no boy in the caravan.
I saw him.
Did you tell them you had seen a boy?
They denied it, captain sahib.
They had pitched camp.
I could not search their tents.
What makes you so sure it was your brother?
He was but a child when you saw him last.
The impression of one's own flesh is eternal, captain sahib.
I would like permission to seek the caravan and find my brother.
Why did you not follow them?
Why did you come back?
I thought the letter was important and the captain sahib must have it at once.
Thank you.
-You're quite sure of this, Ram Das?
-l swear.
How will you find him?
I shall find him.
-You have my permission.
-Thank you, captain sahib.
Wait, there are things you must do.
You'll need food and money.
I can only think of my brother.
I pray it is your brother, but don't build your hopes too high.
I've done that a few times and it isn't too pleasant.
-Yes, captain sahib.
-You can take one of my horses.
-l cannot.
-You'll never catch them on foot.
When I come back, you will return this to me.
Now, don't be foolish, I trust you.
Please, captain sahib.
All right.
Now, get your food and money.
I have my own food.
If you are not out of my sight in one moment my sword shall test the hardness of your skin.
It will not prove as hard as you have thought.
-Start again.
-Good day, chosen of the road.
More of a smile, Gopali.
Good day, chosen of the road.
Better.
Good day.
I travel, too, but not so fortunately as you. I travel alone.
One admires and rejoices in the sky and land but people are more pleasant company.
Go away.
I have heard there is great danger along these paths.
Would you not think that the more that travel together, the less danger?
Gopali.
Your mouth is agile, but let your manner become more pathetic when the refusal continues.
At the last moment, you should be close to tears.
You see, we cannot do the work of the Great Mother unless you can enter the caravan.
Now, watch me.
I am Gopali.
You are the traveler.
Oh, traveler.
Oh, I'm fearful.
Look at me.
Do not send me off to tread alone.
Let me cradle in the bosom of safety, which your number ensures.
In return, I shall water your horses.
I shall prepare your tents.
I will not rise until you have blessed me with your approval.
If you behave like this, Gopali, none will deny you.
No one.
Now, try again.
Again and again.
Let the sun shine favorably on you, travelers.
Good.
It will shine favorably on me if you allow my poor humble person alone and fearful, to find safety in your midst.
I will move no further.
I will remain here and die, food for the vultures if you deny me the hospitality of your company.
My life rests on your words.
Move on, pig.
I will trouble you not, travelers.
I will stay here and die.
They will not deny you, Gopali.
And Kali will not be denied.
Master, master.
What is this disturbance?
Do they not know that I'm instructing initiates?
A traveler is approaching.
He is Ram Das from my city.
A servant of the Lewis sahib.
-Captain Lewis.
-Who is this Captain Lewis?
He is the Englishman who has been asking so many questions of late.
The one who has the sacred cloth.
An unbeliever has the sacred cloth?
Yes.
One of these pigs allowed it to fall into the hands of the white man.
Bring this servant to me.
This Captain Lewis must be punished.
Come in.
Oh, it's you.
I suppose Henderson told you I've spent time working on disappearances you've been appointed to investigate.
-He mentioned it.
-l was disappointed not being offered the assignment myself, as I'm sure you'll appreciate.
The important thing is the job should be done.
I'd like you to have the benefit of what I've been doing.
You can leave them here.
These represent two years of hard work.
I'd like to wish you the very best of luck.
Thank you.
Come in.
-Oh, sorry, sahib.
-No, come in, come in.
-Anything else, Lewis?
-No, there's nothing else.
He says he has lived in the city for 40 years but he has never seen anything.
Tell him to stand up.
Now tell him to close his eyes and walk about the room.
Go on, tell him.
Tell him to keep his eyes closed and continue walking.
Now tell him that no one can live anywhere for 40 years without seeing a great deal.
What has he seen?
Well?
He says he has seen 40 harvests and 1 60 changes of season.
There's something I must tell you, it's important.
-Evidently, since you omitted to knock.
-Something I must tell you in private.
-Very well.
Take him out.
-Yes, sahib.
Now, what is it?
I was attacked by men who stole a piece of silk that I picked up from one of the thieves.
-Piece of silk, nothing more.
-What of it?
It doesn't seem peculiar that I was attacked just to recover a piece of silk?
My dear fellow, what does seem peculiar to me is that you burst into my office while I'm conducting an investigation to tell me you've lost a piece of silk.
Experience tells me this silk to be important.
Intelligence tells me otherwise.
May I remind you that for many years, I've worked in lndia-- lt's time you went home.
The sun has obviously affected your mind.
-Gentlemen.
-l'm sorry, sir. lt was entirely my fault.
I came in to report something I consider to be important.
-You had an accident, Lewis?
-Yes.
Well, in a way, sir.
Captain Lewis was robbed, colonel.
-Robbed?
-Yes, sir.
What did they take?
A piece of silk, colonel.
With your permission, colonel, I will return to my quarters to change.
Of course.
-l hope he's all right.
-A touch of fever perhaps, sir.
He's a good man, Christopher.
A little eccentric, but don't dismiss his opinions too lightly.
Didn't see that, did you, Harry?
I say, I haven't done so well in years.
My holiday's a success already.
You know, I may not go tiger hunting at all.
I may just stay here and keep on beating you, Harry.
Another game?
-Another game?
-Yes, yes, of course.
Well, Dorothy, what do you think of your old husband now?
Are you sure you want to continue?
Of course he's sure, I just asked him.
Pay attention, Dorothy.
Would you like another drink, Sidney?
Yes, please.
Excellent whiskey.
None for him, though.
I don't want any excuses tomorrow for my success.
Well, I feel like a boy again.
Ram Das?
Are you all right in there, Mary?
Harry.
Harry.
That's what Connaught-Smith's here for.
You obviously don't understand what I'm saying, sir.
I'm not senile. I understand.
Someone has cut off the hand of your boy.
Any investigation of the matter will be conducted by Connaught-Smith.
Yes, and judging by his progress, he'll find out absolutely nothing.
-You're going too far.
-Sir, this is India.
There are cults and religions that stretch back to the beginning of time.
Ram Das was a Hindu.
Had it been his whole body thrown in my house his people would've buried him after their own fashion.
Burning his body on a funeral pyre.
Then carrying his ashes to scatter them across the waters of the sacred Ganges.
Does Connaught-Smith know this?
No, of course he doesn't.
You can't solve anything, probe into anything behind a desk and bringing people in for questioning, you can't.
I don't need to be reminded that this is India, Lewis.
But I have spent more years of my life in this country than you.
And how have you spent them?
Looking after the business interests of the company, nothing more.
What effort has the company made to stabilize India beyond what was necessary to conduct its business?
Would there be inquiry into these disappearances if it didn't threaten the company's business?
-lf you're dissatisfied with this--
-My dissatisfaction isn't important, sir.
The Indians are dissatisfied.
Mark my words, before years have gone by they'll express dissatisfaction in a way that won't be pretty.
If you want to discuss company policy, we can continue in the morning.
-Good night.
-l am not interested in company policy.
But I am interested in investigating the disappearance of my boy, Ram Das.
And I prefer settling the matter right now.
I am being pushed very hard.
I'm trying to keep telling myself you've been with the company for 20 years.
It's getting harder for me to keep telling myself that.
-Now, good night.
-l don't consider that an answer, sir.
Lewis, I must tell you that I consider your entire behavior tonight both insolent and disrespectful.
I urge you to take hold of yourself.
I urge you and I warn you.
You leave me no alternative but to offer my resignation.
-Don't be a fool.
-This is no sudden decision.
What has happened has brought matters to a head.
Sleep on it.
See me in the morning.
My request will be the same in the morning, sir.
I shall have to submit your resignation to Bombay.
-Of course.
-You're making a terrible mistake.
With respect, sir, it is you who are making the terrible mistake.
Hello, darling.
He wouldn't let me look for Ram Das.
Are you feeling better?
-Yes.
What did he say?
-Connaught-Smith.
-Well, maybe he's right.
-He's not right.
-He's not right, Mary, and you know it.
-Darling, what would you do?
-What are you going to do?
-l've done it.
I've resigned.
-Resigned?
-Effective immediately.
And what are you going to use for money?
Money?
Well, we've got a bit.
-A very small bit.
-Well, something will turn up.
-What a time to act on impulse.
-The right time and the only time.
When someone you care for has been hurt.
You have such a gift for saying the right thing.
Have I?
I'm sorry about the money problem, Mary, but we'll manage.
I'll cut down on....
l'm going to find those butchers, Mary.
You will.
Go away.
Sahib, sahib.
Trinkets, sahib, for the sahib's lovely lady wife.
A brooch, a necklace, a ring, souvenir of happy days in India.
Ten rupees, sahib, reduced from 20.
My boy has a ring like this.
Oh, he has, sahib?
Purchased at this very place.
Did he tell you how much he paid?
Did he tell you he paid only 1 rupee?
He is lying.
-He's telling damn lies, sahib.
-He did not tell me.
Nine rupees, my last and final offer.
Have you seen anything of Ram Das during these last few days?
-No, sahib.
-He's missing, I wondered if you--
Very sad.
Eight rupees?
I wondered if you had any idea what might have happened to him.
None.
Seven?
And I'm robbing myself.
Are you not interested in what happens to your own kind?
I am a merchant, sahib.
He is a servant.
You just can't say you don't care what has happened to him.
He comes here nearly every day.
He's your friend.
He is not our kind.
I am Muslim, he is Hindu.
I am only a beggar, master.
-l know nothing, nothing at all.
-But you're here all day, every day.
You must see what's going on around you.
I know nothing, master.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
Thank you.
Thank you, master, thank you.
Do you remember Toki, the little mongoose?
And do you remember Ram Das, my Indian servant?
Do you remember him?
Now, have you seen Ram Das anywhere?
Did you say something, darling?
Allah is great, and I am but human.
Allah is with us, there is peace in the land.
I suppose you get to believing it if you keep on repeating it.
Don't be discouraged.
This is only your first day.
Yes, but I see the pattern emerging.
Either they genuinely know nothing or they're just not talking.
Probably they've heard about Ram Das.
Why should they take any chances?
What are you going to do?
I've decided to join Sidney on his tiger hunt.
Maybe I can find something out in the jungle.
-l take care of myself.
-l wish--
There's nothing to be frightened of.
But I don't want you to be alone.
Stay with Dorothy, all right?
All right.
Here he comes.
Getting pretty close now.
Quiet.
Oh, you fool, you unspeakable idiot.
What do you think you're playing at?
Mongoose, sahib, mongoose.
Good mind to reload and come down there and.... lt wasn't his fault, Sidney.
You're as bad.
Fancy bringing a damn mongoose on a tiger hunt.
-Don't worry.
-lt was damn a silly idea.
-Plenty more tigers left.
-l don't get all that amount of leave.
Toki, Toki, come on.
Your rifle, sahib.
-Sidney.
-What?
Come over here a minute.
Look.
Good heavens.
Boy, get the spades.
Look.
There are more bones under it.
Sidney, take a boy.
Go back to Henderson tell him what we've found and ask him to send some troops.
-Will you be all right?
-Yes, you hurry up.
There's 30 bodies there and we haven't got them all out yet.
-lt's evidently a native cemetery.
-ln the middle of nowhere?
Nowhere to us, somewhere to the natives.
-What natives?
There are no villages.
-Then what do you think it is?
A place where they bury the murdered.
Look.
-What?
-Those necks.
-What about them?
-Well, they're broken, all of them.
Those bones are so old.
How can you tell they're broken?
There was one that wasn't so old.
It still had some flesh on it.
Well, it's probably how he died.
He stumbled right here and they buried him.
Those necks are broken. lsn't it--?
I haven't the time to play in cemeteries.
I still work for the company.
We're closing this up so nobody else stumbles and breaks his neck.
Fill it in.
This is the first chance you've had to do anything.
-You coming, Lewis?
-Yes, I'm coming.
-lt does seem strange.
-Strange?
is that all you can say?
Your people don't bury their dead in the middle of the jungle.
Not ordinarily.
There were 30 bodies counted, all of them with their necks broken.
-You assume that.
-They were broken, all right.
You are certain I may not offer you a drink?
-Ever heard of a cult of stranglers?
-No.
-ln myth, perhaps?
-Never.
There are so many cults.
Why not a cult of stranglers?
Everything is possible.
Look, patel, you might take more interest.
These are your people.
Their bones buried out there in the jungle.
Do not raise your voice to me.
When I was patel, those bones were my responsibility.
Now they're your bones or your company's.
Either of you is welcome to them.
I didn't mean to shout.
The company maintains it's a cemetery.
Then it is a cemetery.
Whoever rules decides the truth.
Why trouble yourself about it?
Why should I?
You're right.
Why should I trouble myself about it?
No one else does.
I think I will have a drink, patel.
It's been a wearing day.
Certainly, captain.
Nobody cares.
Just another example of what's going on.
This pig trying to rob my house.
Thieves are coming into our homes now, colonel.
We'll take care of him, Burns.
A man's not safe in his home and his goods are not safe on the roads.
A fine state, colonel.
I'll question him, sir.
If I may, sir, allow me to question him.
What makes you think you'll be better at it than I?
For a very good reason that the colonel knows.
My parentage.
Lieutenant Silver is part Indian.
Make him talk, Silver.
Yes, yes, tremble.
Tremble and pray for mercy.
Kali has sent me to you.
You have sinned.
You've set out alone.
Your own greed driving you before the wishes of Kali.
You must be punished.
You must be punished, you dog.
Kali will not rest until you're punished.
You will say that you have killed by yourself that you have robbed by yourself.
And when the rope of the English tightens about your neck and sends you to the world to come, sweet Kali will forgive.
If you say anything else, there will be such horrors as only Kali can give to those who sin against her.
No.
I will do as you say.
-This is a hanging, Roberts, isn't it?
-l beg your pardon, sir.
Did you ever see such happy people as that one?
And those two?
I'm afraid we all enjoy it a bit, sir.
That's why we're here.
What about the prisoner?
Does he enjoy it a bit too?
Look at him.
Well, that is a bit rum, sir.
The crime is murder.
The sentence, death by hanging.
I come to you Great Mother.
All right, Toki, let's see where they go.
Kali's omens are all-powerful.
The howl of a jackal bodes evil.
The howl of a jackal bodes evil.
The call of a crow bodes evil.
The call of a crow bodes evil.
The touch of a lizard bodes evil.
The touch of a lizard bodes evil.
The squeal of a hare bodes evil.
The squeal of a hare bodes evil.
The death of a snake bodes evil.
The death of a snake bodes evil.
Now we have eaten, we prepare your feast, Great Mother.
Mongoose.
Mongoose.
Mongoose.
Cut him loose.
You cannot let him go free.
The death of a snake bodes evil.
Kali is displeased.
Cut him loose.
Great Mother, how have I failed you?
It's a vast religious organization and their goddess is Kali.
-Hold on--
-There's no time, sir.
This must sound incredible to you, but I've seen it.
There is a way of corroborating what I told you.
The potter in the market, he's one.
I saw him as clearly as I see you.
We can go into the market.
When you find he's missing, you'll believe me.
Well, at least this is simpler than digging up the jungle.
-We've only to go to the marketplace.
-The potter.
Not just the potter, there must be thousands living quietly in the city, working.
And the rest of the time they steal and kill?
The way you talk, captain, the potter must be very rich.
Somebody is very rich if he isn't.
There's something in what you say, Lewis.
It's possible, sir, that he's gone away on a pilgrimage or--
To a meeting of stranglers?
You're right, Lewis.
Let's have a look.
There you are, sir.
Look.
What did I tell you, sir?
-There he is.
-Where?
They've sent him back.
They sent you back.
This is their mark.
-l burn myself, captain sahib.
-Burned yourself?
Have I done something wrong, sir?
If it's scars you're interested in now, this is a more interesting specimen.
Look, sir, I....
l'm sorry to have wasted your time, sir.
Children of Kali, the final moment has come.
You have learnt all of our ways, save one.
Only the most sacred remains.
Release the prisoners.
Prepare the sacred cloth.
Now kill.
Gopali.
Kill, Gopali.
My brother.
Kill, kill.
Slit their stomachs so their bodies do not swell and disclose their secret graves.
Your sons are prepared, great Kali.
Your sons have learnt all.
The harvest has been reaped and your sons are ready.
I am most pleased that all of you have accepted my plan to ship all your produce in one caravan.
The size of the caravan will keep its journey safe.
No one will attack a caravan of this dimension.
-l hope you're right.
-ls all prepared?
-lt'll move out at midnight.
-Good.
The cloak of night will cover the caravan's movement out of the city.
We shouldn't wait until the company find out who or what is destroying the caravans?
How long will you wait?
The company has made no progress on this matter.
Patel Shari's right.
We've no idea how long this condition will exist.
But I can tell you how long we'll all exist if we can't continue trading.
I pray to God they get there.
I am confident the caravan will reach its appointed destiny.
When this caravan is reported missing the company will send many, many soldiers here.
After this caravan has been disposed of the children of Kali will be silent for many, many months.
This caravan contains all.
After this caravan disappears, they may listen to Captain Lewis.
We cannot run the risk of Lewis remaining alive.
It is settled.
Lewis dies.
His death may arouse enormous suspicion and investigation.
He has spoken of stranglers.
He will die by the sword.
His house will be looted.
Captain Connaught-Smith will pronounce it a robbery.
Connaught-Smith is pleased by the obvious.
It does not tax his dull mind.
To be safe, patel, let us rob and kill Lewis' neighbor as well.
It will then appear that a band of thieves ransacked the area.
Silver speaks sensibly, patel.
So be it.
-How is she?
-She's asleep now.
-Sidney's dead because of me.
-Oh, Harry.
It's true, Mary. lt's me they wanted.
Sidney was just a sacrifice to make it look as though they're robbing everybody.
I need to get them.
Tomorrow, I'll go down to the market and I'll beat the truth out of that potter.
I'll kill him if he doesn't talk.
-Colonel.
-Yes?
They've gone.
Look, the place is deserted.
Of course it's deserted.
They're all in the temple.
-Today is the Holy Day.
-Holy Day?
Don't I know it.
Trouble we had to get the sepoys to move out to the caravan.
-Caravan?
What caravan?
-The caravan.
All the planters have formed themselves into one group.
Connaught-Smith is leading them.
The death of Mr. Flood has finally unnerved him.
After all, even though he's resigned, he's still an officer in the company as far as the people in the city are concerned.
You're right, Silver.
Go on.
Captain Lewis, what are you going to do?
Go after them, Silver.
There must be something I can do.
-Even if you're right, what can you do?
-l don't know.
All I know is that that caravan's going to be attacked. I want to be there.
-l'm coming with you.
-Why should you?
Another soldier won't do any harm, will he?
Captain, sir, these men ask permission to travel with the caravan too.
More of them?
We'll soon have every beggar in India with us.
Oh, great leader of the many, the road is perilous.
These tiny sacks are filled with our year's labors.
If we are robbed, great leader, my brother and I, we will have nothing.
And our poor and crippled mother--
Oh, very well.
Fall into line somewhere.
But mind you, keep up.
We're not waiting for anyone.
We will keep up, great leader.
I promise we will.
Halt.
Camp them over there.
Obidah.
Before we journey to do your bidding, Great Mother we sweeten our mouths so you may sweeten our way.
The sacred sugar shall be the sign.
Wake up.
Captain sahib, what is it?
Wake up.
Wake up!
Get up.
Get up!
Great heaven.
-Captain sahib.
Anyone else alive?
-Anyone alive?
Anyone?
Hold your fire.
Kali.
Kali.
Kali.
-Keep a good lookout, Silver.
-Yes, sir.
This is where they camped for the night.
-They must have moved on.
-They haven't moved on.
-What do you mean?
-There's no track leading that way.
-The tracks lead up here.
-into the jungle?
I don't understand.
-They're dead.
-Dead?
They've all been murdered.
Murdered?
-Where are the bodies?
-Buried.
We can soon find out.
Not here, in the jungle.
I said, not here, in the jungle.
Come on, come on.
Come on, hurry.
Give me that spade.
Kali has provided in the past.
Kali has provided in the past.
Kali provides now.
Kali provides now.
Kali will provide in the time to come.
Kali will provide in the time to come.
Now we offer Kali our gift.
The greatest gift of all.
Human flesh.
Ram Das.
Great goddess, you have given a sign.
I understand.
Prepare the funeral pyre.
Kali has told us her wish.
The death of this unbeliever shall be her final reward.
First, the dead.
Then, the living.
Kali demands vengeance for her sons.
Now.
is it too hot for you, colonel?
Your cook makes an excellent curry.
Lewis sahib is here, patel.
Tell him I'm engaged with....
-Speak, Gopali.
Tell them.
-What's this all about?
-How dare you--
-Let him speak, sir.
What Captain Lewis has told you is really true.
He is one of them.
He is one of them.
One of what, patel?
One of what that you had to kill him?
Yes.
One of what?
I want you to know I've sent a full report to Bombay.
I'm recommending you for immediate promotion.
Promotion, sir?
But my resignation.
I....
l didn't send it.
Thank you, sir.
-Aren't you proud, darling?
-Yes.
What is it?
-She's out of there.
-Who?
Kali, the murderess, with her murdering sons.
This is only the beginning, Mary.
Good evening, fellow motorists.
The road signs became so dense that I had to abandon my automobile and proceed on foot.
I do hope the time never comes when billboard will obscure this lovely scenery.
Actually, I believe these are seedling signs.
This is where the Highway Department grows them.
You are probably more familiar with the wild variety that springs up along the roadside.
Tonight's play has a connection, however tenuous, with the foregoing.
In it, you will see an automobile.
The play is called "Dead Weight"
and will begin after this one-minute detour.
Slow, man.
Make it slow.
Now put your hands out.
Easy.
That's right.
What do you want?
Okay, lvy League.
Now open the door, smooth and easy.
That's right.
Now you slide out, nice and easy like, before...
Now, listen...
I said move.
And I mean right now.
Now face the car.
I said face it!
Now.
Put your hands out, lean on it.
Okay, baby.
Now you slide out.
Now look...
Shut up, man of distinction.
Now, put your hands back there.
Come on.
Now, doll.
You slide out and bring the keys with you.
Hey, baby, I said bring the keys.
Oh, oh, cool, smooth hands.
Yeah, that's nice.
But that's for later, honey...
If you've got any ideas about...
I got lots of ideas, man.
I'm crawling with 'em.
Hey, you're pretty well-heeled, chum.
Courtney N. Masterson.
Wow, what a square name.
Hey, what's the "N" stand for, Courtney?
None of your business.
I asked you a question, mister.
Now, look, you've got what you've wanted, why don't you let us alone?
Now, I asked you what that 'N' stands for, Courtney.
Nesbitt.
Courtney Nesbitt Masterson.
Wow, dad.
Like they didn't want to give you any first names just last ones.
Why's that?
Very well, Courtney.
Here's your keys.
I'd like my wallet, too.
You can keep the money.
But there are some papers in it that are worthless to you.
Forget it, dad.
It's not over yet.
Oh, please, let us go.
Cool it, baby.
Now you open the trunk.
There's nothing in the...
I said open it!
All right.
Take all that junk out and toss it on the ground.
Now what?
Now you get in, cat.
Oh, please, I have some money, too.
It's in my purse in the car.
You just take that and we'll say nothing.
Ain't that nice?
But I'm not after your bread, baby.
What do you mean?
I mean, I'm coming to you.
But first we gotta tuck in little ol' Courtney Nesbitt Masterson.
You dig how it is?
Now, you get up.
You get up slow, dad, or I'm going to slice you pretty.
All right, sonny boy.
If you think that knife's faster than this gun of yours, slice away.
You all right, Peg?
Yes.
Come on!
Now, look, mister...
Now you lean against the car.
Nice and easy, man.
Now.
Get in the trunk.
Hey, now, look, I never woulda gone through with it.
I mean, really.
I was only kiddin', that's all.
A great kidder, you are.
You would have killed me if you could.
Get in the trunk!
In the trunk!
You make me get in here, I'm not gonna forget it, Courtney.
In the trunk.
There's nothing to be afraid of now.
Oh!
Oh, Court.
Stop it.
I really thought he was going to...
Stop thinking about it.
Let's get away from here.
Right away.
Now, what are we going to do?
We're going to drop our little friend off at a police station.
Will it be in all the papers?
I can just see the headline now,
"Advertising executive captures lovers lane bandit."
Great piece of publicity.
You're right.
It'll make great reading, except, of course, to your wife.
You better have that rear tire checked.
Well, why didn't you tell him?
I don't know what to do.
You knew what to do before you thought about your wife.
That's what's really bothering you, isn't it?
What if it is?
Same old, Courtney, aren't you?
Always cautious, safe, and respectable.
You'll never change.
"Oh, Carol, honey, I just happened to run into an old friend at the Ad Club
"after work and we were just cutting up a few touches when..."
Cut it out, Peg.
I know that's the way it happened, but...
She'll find out I've been in town for 10 days, darling.
She won't believe this is the first time you've seen me.
I told her I was going to work late at the office on the new account.
I was, too.
After I had dinner at the club.
How was I to know I was going to see you there?
Maybe I could just give him a big scare and let him go?
He'd know there was something fishy if you did that.
He knows my name, too.
Did you see the way he looked at me when he got in the trunk?
He won't forget I made him do that.
You should have killed him back there.
Killed him?
Peg, think what you're saying.
Yes, you...
You could have said that you were just out there alone.
That you stopped there to...
You know, to think out some business problems.
Who'd buy that?
A man parked up there alone.
What's so wrong with that?
Well, it just isn't practical, that's all.
The police have all sorts of ways of checking things, like the tire marks...
Peg.
What?
Do you realize we've been driving along seriously discussing murder?
I'd say it was more killing in self-defense.
But a man's life.
He's not a man, he's a beast.
I'm not leaving until you tell me what you're going to do.
I don't know yet.
But you've got to do something.
I realize that.
Suppose...
Suppose it never happened?
But it did!
No, you don't know what I mean.
We met at the club at dinner, just as we did.
Then we went to my office and discussed the Dixon affair.
Well, that's logical, I guess.
Then I brought you directly here, at half past one.
I don't think anybody will ask anything about it, but if they do, nothing happened.
Think you can bluff that through.
I can try.
Oh, Court!
I didn't mean to cause you any trouble.
Wasn't your fault.
I was stupid.
Drive up there and start behaving like a sophomore.
I liked it.
So did I.
I was surprised.
Surprised?
Surprised that I felt this way after such a long time.
Oh, I'm glad.
Court, what do you intend to do about him?
I don't know.
Whatever it is, it won't involve you.
Good night.
Good night.
Get out.
Okay.
Okay.
Easy now.
Just take it easy.
Hey, look.
Now, please.
Please, Mr. Masterson, if you'd just forget about it, I'd never do it again.
I wish I could believe that.
Oh, you can, honest.
And you wouldn't be sorry, either.
I mean, I'd play it cool from now on, really.
Well, we talked it over, and we decided...
Where is she?
The chick, I mean.
Um, Peg.
That's her name, isn't it?
That's no concern of yours.
You know, if you let me go, you wouldn't have to answer any questions.
So that would be nice, wouldn't it.
I mean, the cops can ask some pretty embarrassing questions.
Listen, I'm trying to give you a break, I'm trying to be nice to you.
Don't make me laugh.
Man, I'm gonna flip.
You don't want them cops around here any more than I do.
Now, suppose we just knock off all this bull and I get out of here.
And from here on out, I don't know you and you don't know me.
For how long?
You know?
That's an interesting question.
I hadn't even thought about it.
You would have.
Yeah, you're right, Courtney.
You wanna know something?
I think you're in worse trouble than me.
So you and I, we'll just forget about it, for a while.
But I'll be seeing you.
Hmm?
So long, pop.
Wait a minute.
Don't you want this?
Oh, oh, yeah.
Thanks, Courtney.
I forgot...
Are you in the habit of picking up hitchhikers, Mr. Masterson?
No, not as a rule.
Then why did you pick this boy up?
It was, as you say, after 01:30 in the morning.
Wouldn't you say that was a dangerous thing to do?
I know it was, now.
I didn't think then.
Where did you think he was going?
Up the canyon road, somewhere.
I remember thinking at the time how unpleasant it would be to have to walk for any distance up that road at that time of night.
Look, I'm trying to tell you what happened.
I'm trying to cooperate, but...
But what, Mr. Masterson?
Well, your questions, they...
They what?
Am I on trial or something?
Should you be?
Of course not.
I admit I killed the boy, but it was him or me.
He told me he was going to kill me.
I made a grab for the gun, there was a fight and the gun went off.
Outside the car.
I told you it was outside the car.
He made me get out.
He made me put my hands against the car and lean on it.
He must have seen it in the movies or something.
Lieutenant Ward.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
No, that's fine.
All right.
No, you can bring the car in now.
But we'll keep it a day or two.
Yeah.
All right.
Your story checks insofar as the time of death of the boy is concerned.
You mean, there are other parts of the story that don't check?
Is there any reason why the rest of your story shouldn't check, Mr. Masterson?
None whatever.
The boy you killed was named Rudy Stickney.
He has been in and out of trouble since he was 12.
He did time a year ago for armed robbery.
He liked guns.
You're a lucky man, Mr. Masterson.
Lucky he didn't kill you.
I'm sorry if we've seemed to be unnecessarily rough on you, but we had to make sure all the pieces fit.
I understand.
As it is, you probably saved the state a lot of money.
I'm sure that in the end the result would have been the same, but at the tax-payers' expense.
Personally,
I think there is nothing lower than a punk kid who takes advantage of a kindness.
Uh, need I warn you about picking up hitchhikers in the future?
No.
I've learned my lesson, I really have.
Am I, uh, free to go now?
Yes, we have your car.
As I said on the phone, we'd like to keep it a day or two, if you don't mind.
Sergeant Phillips will see that you get home in a squad car.
We'll be in touch with you in a few days, Mr. Masterson.
Thank you.
Thank you, Officer.
I've been so worried about you, Courtney.
After your call I just couldn't go back to bed.
It's nothing to worry about.
Everything's under control.
Court?
Court?
Why didn't you want me down there with you?
Well, there was no need.
Did you really kill a man?
Yes.
Only it was a boy, a young hoodlum.
I picked him up.
He threatened to kill me.
He had a gun.
It must have been horrible out there on that mountain road.
All alone.
Can I get you something to eat?
No, thanks.
I'll just have a drink.
What I really need is some sleep.
You poor dear.
You must be exhausted.
Weren't you frightened?
I'd have been scared to death.
Yes, I was frightened.
Want to tell me about it?
I had dinner at the Ad Club.
Then I went to the office and worked on the Dixon pitch...
Oh, Mr. Masterson.
Good morning, Rita.
We didn't know you'd be in after what happened.
Well, there was a moment there when I thought I might never be in.
Oh, good morning, Mr. Masterson.
Good morning, Mary.
Mr. Callahan, and Mr. Ivy send their congratulations.
And they want to see you, when you have a moment.
Thank you.
And I want to add my congratulations to it.
It must have been really something.
It was, Mary.
It was.
Oh, Mr. Masterson!
There's a man waiting for you in my office.
A detective.
Send him in.
Go in, please.
Thank you.
Mr. Masterson, I'm Lester Eldridge.
My secretary says you're from the police.
I suppose you want to talk about last night.
Uh, yes, there are some details to be cleared up.
Well, I told your boys all I know.
They know as much about it as I do.
I told your secretary I was a detective, and I am.
She assumed I was a police detective.
It was an assumption I let her retain.
Actually, I retired from the force two years ago to go into the private end of the business.
For the past five days,
I've been working on a routine case for a suspicious wife.
It was routine until last night.
You weren't out of my sight for two minutes last night, Mr. Masterson.
You know, I thought before I made a report to your wife, or the police, it would be mutually profitable if you and I discussed it first.
Private enterprise should be encouraged.
But I think Mr. Eldridge was carrying it a bit far.
There was one further development, however.
It seems that Mr. Eldridge also had a suspicious wife.
And he too had been followed the preceding night.
If you don't follow that, perhaps you'll be interested in the following, which is what I shall follow.
I have just been surprised by a policeman who was lurking in the underbrush.
He gave me a ticket for reckless driving, parking overtime, speeding, and jay walking.
However, he agreed to tear up the ticket if I would show him how to get out of here.
Next week, I shall return with another story.
Until then, good night.
You're very quick to confess for everyone else.
Since we have no understanding between us,
I have no choice but to kill you.
Hey boy, I think a pony of brandy
Might put that mocha on horseback, if you please.
Hey boy,
We have rats in this hotel?
Square holes, mr.
Paladin, no rats.
Hey boy.
Oh...
I forgot.
I saved this for you.
See?
"detective wanted to find missing heir, john thorpe.
Missing heir very special item.
"damsel in distress seeks man with some legal knowledge.
Box 23."
Well, hey boy, the other side's even more interesting.
Will you get me my billfold
From the dressing room, please?
I'd like to see monsieur ganeau, please.
Monsieur ganeau is not.
I'm michelle ganeau, the owner.
May I help you?
I hope so.
May I?
The unpleasant aldehyde scent.
Trace of jasmine, touch of honeysuckle and...
Rose character predominates.
When you finish that, it should be excellent.
You are a designer of perfume?
No, I am an appreciator of designs.
My name is paladin.
Oh, monsieur paladin, please sit down.
Very few damsels in distress are so charming.
It's for someone who's very dear to me.
Oh?
My nephew.
He ran away from home, and I have a wire
That he's in a little trouble in salito.
Mm.
He's pierre deverell.
He wears the trouble like a...
A boutonniere.
He's disinherited by his father, a strong
And wealthy man.
He will not permit the boy's mother-
My sister- to help their son.
So he talk to me...
And I talk to you.
Well, I'm glad that you have.
Monsieur deverell gives my sister very little.
And I have, uh...
Not much.
Well, money is one of the lesser endowments.
I have some very fine old, uh...
Cognac.
That's an excellent beginning.
State your business!
I want to see the sheriff.
Hand me your gun belt.
Uh, it could be one of them.
What do you want?
I want to see about one of your prisoners.
Yeah, I suspected that.
Who are you?
My name's paladin.
These are all letters of credit.
San francisco banks seem to trust you.
I guess I can, too.
Thank you, sheriff.
Our, uh, welcome mat must've seemed full of cockleburs,
But we got to be very careful.
This is fitzgerald.
Been two tries to kill him in the past week.
I was beginning to get real self-conscious.
And then somebody tried to poison my prisoner.
Poison?
His name pierre deverell?
Mm-hmm.
We call him pete.
What's his bail?
Oh, put your money away, mister.
After 10:00 tomorrow morning, you can have him for nothing-
Right after the hanging.
He's gonna hang?
By the neck.
You the one he sent that wire to?
Well, what happened?
Stage holdup.
Fitzgerald here is one of the passengers.
There were four highwaymen.
And this youngster took me aside the other side of the coach,
Away from the others.
He took all my money.
He started not to take it.
I tried to get him, but they were gonna kill me.
I-I shot him in the head, just grazed him.
Then I run out before his friends could come around.
When I got there, the driver and the passengers were dead.
Kid was still there,
Unconscious.
Then he's being hung on circumstantial evidence.
Well, the jury might've been influenced
By the fact that he signed a full confession.
Oh.
May I see him?
Yeah.
Pierre deverell?
My name's pete.
Mine's paladin.
Your family sent me.
Well, let's go.
Well, I wish it were that easy, but it's not.
Well, that's what you're here for, isn't it?
I guess I made a pretty big splash in the papers back home, huh?
In what way?
Well, there must've been something.
No, nothing.
Oh, yeah, just like my father.
He reads the front page and the market reports.
Who was it found it for him on page two?
Well, in san francisco, you may have been a big boy but...
Out here, in this town, now, today,
You're nothing but a rope stretcher.
They're not gonna hang me, mister.
I can see the courtyard.
They haven't even built a gallows yet.
These people will hang you from a tree limb or a wagon tongue.
You better try and understand that as things look now,
You're gonna be hung tomorrow morning.
Look, I...
I didn't do it.
You didn't do it;
you just confessed to it.
Well, that's logical.
That makes sense.
They wouldn't let me get a message out of here
Unless I signed their papers.
You confessed in order to get word to your family?
Well, yeah.
That, and I...
Could see my papa picking up the paper:
A deverell held for murder.
Apparently, you find this very hard to believe,
But to the world at large, you just aren't that important.
All right, forget what I done wrong;
You tell me what to do right.
He's a nice feller, ain't he, paladin?
Why don't you tell him about them three men with beards, now.
Will I get off if I tell you?
He won't even help me.
If I can find the other men.
Your main concern should be trying to survive the next 18 hours.
It ain't likely.
Well, their names were dink, luss and waller.
I met them by accident.
I was only with them a day and a half.
They all three wore beards.
They only used their first names.
Dink fancied himself as some kind of a gunfighter.
And luss was always complaining about his left shoulder
Being sore where...
Where he'd been gored.
And waller got drunk on a couple of drinks.
And luss and waller carried big-bore rifles.
And they all had a...
Strange kind of smell.
Musky or rancid-like.
Well, that sounds like buffalo hunters.
Were their rifle handles worn?
Yeah.
They carry skinning knives?
Yeah, knives honed down till there wasn't a half - inch of steel left.
See you in your office?
Hold it, wait a minute.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna find out which time you were lying.
Maybe a wells fargo man.
No.
That was an overland stage.
Pinkerton, then.
I don't know.
Well, we're sticking here, anyway.
He's still in the jail.
Fitzgerald's in there with him.
If fitzgerald or the kid identify us...
How?
We shaved off our beards.
Yeah.
Anyone can tell that a mile off.
Mm-hmm.
And we'll fix that right now.
Aw, now, wait a minute.
The kid's seen us.
So did fitzgerald, like he said at the trial.
The rat poison didn't work on the kid.
No matter, they're hanging him tomorrow, anyway.
And you both missed that irishman twice.
Heh.
But he can't stay in that calaboose forever.
He'll come out after the hanging.
I'll get him.
What about the man in black?
Maybe...
We ought to get him when he comes out.
Well, let's go over it once more.
Where was pete when you found him?
On the ground, on the right side of the stage.
Where were the dead men?
Well...
They were on the left side of the stage.
Where was pete when you shot him?
On the right side!
Were there any spent cartridges in his gun?
No, but he could've reloaded.
Were there any spent cartridges on the ground around him?
No.
Were the holes in the dead men big,
Like those a buffalo gun would make?
Well, they were pretty big.
Well, now, that leaves a lot of holes
In that confession, doesn't it?
Well, it don't leave one at the bottom,
Where it's signed.
How do you do, sir?
Afternoon.
You took two lines.
I want a double bed.
Stable my horse, send the gear up to my room.
Afternoon.
You...
Black suit.
You mind moving on?
You got any interest
In that back-shooter they're hanging tomorrow?
I'm interested in him.
He had some partners.
Said so at the trial.
And I'm thinking maybe you're one of them.
Why don't you go away?
Who are you, mister?
You want some advice, mister?
Travel.
Well, I generally leave a town when I'm ready.
You have some particular reason
For wanting me out of town?
I hate rattlesnakes and I hate gunfighters, 'cause I've been bit
And I've been shot.
You have me at a disadvantage.
'cause I think you might be somebody
I'd be very interested in keeping alive.
I can't say the same for you.
Now, if you're calling me out,
You're making a very bad mistake.
Why don't you just run along?
Mr. Paladin, you kind of sneak into town like a chinese stampede.
That was my best lead so far.
He'd still be alive if he hadn't kicked my chair.
Pete said this dink was kind of gun-happy.
Might have took after you on his own.
No.
They tried to gun fitzgerald twice.
Do you suppose I could get him to come out as a decoy?
He ain't about to leave that jail
Till he's sure the rest of the gang is gone.
What are you going to do now?
Nothing much I can do,
Except make myself the biggest and easiest target I know how
And hope they come after me, and miss.
How you going to do that?
I'm going to sit right here.
Paladin.
Morning.
Morning.
Nothing happen?
No.
Still alive.
Coffee?
Yeah.
Don't look like much we can do.
I'm afraid that boy's a dead one.
Sheriff, he weighs about 175.
If his hanging does come off this morning,
Can you give him a nine-foot drop?
No gallows.
How about using a high limb?
Let the horse take a long run.
The best I can, paladin.
The kid wants to see you.
Thanks.
You fool!
You're killing off
The only witnesses that can help me.
Just like my family.
I ask for help,
And they send someone like you.
You've forgotten already, haven't you?
You didn't ask for help.
You were going to humiliate your father.
You don't even have enough self-respect
Not to lie to yourself.
That's straight talk.
I doubt there's time left for anything else.
All right, I was a fool-
I admit it- but do I owe my life to some stupid kid trick?
If we start hanging all the fools,
The world's going to be a lonely place to live in.
There'll be fools at both ends of the rope,
Believing that they move the winds and control the tides
And sentence men to die.
We're all going to die,
And only a few sick and condemned men
Know how and when.
Now, supposedly,
You know when you're going to die,
And I'm still uncertain.
But you could outlive me.
Inside these stone walls is the first time in 24 hours
I've been safe from a bullet in the back.
You scared?
You think I hold my life in so little regard
That I'm not afraid to lose it?
I've tasted death in my mouth, paladin.
Like cold iron.
It's always been there.
It's just the first time you've noticed it.
You, too?
All my life.
Just a little stronger now.
I can't taste anything else.
I got you into this, too, didn't I?
Well, don't take all the blame-
Just for your share of the trouble.
I chose my own life,
And my own probable way of losing it.
And that's my responsibility.
Yeah, that's right.
Sheriff!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Uh...
Oh.
No.
Sorry.
No more rooms.
Whole county is in for the hanging.
My name's paladin.
I registered yesterday- took two lines.
Sorry, sorry...
Sorry, sorry, sorry!
Key.
Thought you weren't coming back.
Almost rented it out again.
You're so fortunate you didn't.
Clerk!
I beg your pardon.
I was just about to order a breakfast-
One about twice the size of this one-
On a big tray.
It sure smells funny, doesn't it?
Whole room smells like that now.
You know what it is?
Smells like buffalo.
Who had this breakfast?
Two sixteen.
Just one man in there?
Just one breakfast.
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
Hey, you'll have the best breakfast in the house.
Mine.
Luss was always complaining about his stiff left shoulder,
Where he got gored.
What...
What're...
What are you doing?
I'm hanging you.
Why, that...
That's murder.
No, it isn't.
That's lynching.
But you're only one man.
Well, give me time, I could collect a crowd.
Now, who are you?
Name's hopper.
Hopper?
Mr. Hopper, I hope you're lying
Because, if you're not,
You're going to have every reason
To be really angry with a fellow named luss.
But...
But...
Who killed the men at the stagecoach?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, since we have no area of understanding,
The only thing I can do is proceed with this hanging.
Put you up on the stool...
I don't have time for a scientific job.
I'd say it'd take you about...
About three minutes to die.
The kid did it.
He confessed.
He was lying.
Dink did it.
The gunfighter- dink.
He did it.
Dink didn't have a rifle.
They were killed with a rifle.
Well, mister, looks like you got us.
I'll tell you the truth.
Waller did it.
You're very quick to confess for everybody else, hmm?
Where's waller?
He...
He...
He took out.
Oh, did he, now?
Well...
Waller took out?
Yeah.
There are three saddlebags
On that chair there.
Waller left without his?
Why didn't you both go?
Well...
Well, we had to stick around until
They strung up the kid.
Then fitzgerald would come out of the jail, and we'd get him.
No witnesses.
What about me?
Well, you...
You sat there like a duck all night.
Figured we could get you anytime.
Waller!
Get him!
Well, you can all go home.
No hanging today.
Well, luss, get up.
Get up, son.
That was only a rehearsal.

The Depot of the Dead
Why are you putting that in here?
Damn you.
You must fix it for tomorrow.
I thought I'd freeze to death.
Oh it's you Zabawa.
You came back.
How was it?
I got stuck near Baligrod.
You must weld these bars for me tomorrow.
They've finished it off.
When?
Political police borrowed it for the commission yesterday.
The troops had burned another village.
Working all night?
Stop kidding.
Have you brought the new trucks?
They will be here.
So I won't fix this wreck if they are here.
You look like a sitting duck.
We all know that going there was a waste of time.
It's easier for a peasant to get a horse from the UNRRA, than us to get a truck.
Is the manager in?
Yes
Mr. Kowalski can I check the motor?
OK
There are no trucks, no spare parts, what is here?
There are no trucks, no spare parts, what is here?
Men, sir
You know what, that's what I've just thought.
You must go there.
Where?
To the house on the scarp.
The dead men's base?
They aren't dead at all.
They're alive and kicking.
What's the matter?
What are you doing there?
Last month the attorney sent an order to arrest one of them, but the Police couldn't get there.
And when they finally got there he was gone.
Did he run away?
Yes to heaven.
Listen I don't want to tell you stories.
We both know it's a forlorn land, awful roads and bandits from God knows where seeking amnesty there.
Would anybody else go there?
You?
Are you serious?
If they run away as they say, it will be the end for us.
The phone is ringing off the hook.
People have no timber for building, in mines, or even to heat their houses.
You must go there...
And instead of the trucks I'll get a kind word from you when I leave?
That too...
Stop kidding.
I'm serious.
You must go.
There is nothing I must do.
But I must send you over there.
Somebody must make them stay there.
So go yourself if you are as clever as that.
All right I'll go.
So what do you want from me?
I know you must risk your own skin.
I know, you have a home, a wife...
But you will keep your flat.
It's done.
Give me that map.
Take it, so you don't have any claims if you get killed somewhere at night.
Warsawer?
Yeah?
What would you like to say at such a moment?
What moment?
When you fly down...
Kiss my ass, all of you.
You'd better think of something else.
Why?
You will have no time son.
It must be quick.
Go to hell.
I've already buried two goners a third one can bring me bad luck.
Did you bring the groundsheet?
Damned, I forgot...
I will not touch it with my bare hands.
Won't you?
I won't.
As you wish Nine, but when your turn comes I won't lift a finger.
You will go to heaven through wolves' stomachs.
Take him Orsaczek...
That was a nice crash.
He tumbled down and lost his guts...
What have you nicked?
It brings luck.
A mascot from a crash is a fluke.
Remember Grzegorzewski always had one with him...
To hell with him.
He's already there.
Shut up and pull.
What do you think?
The one in the box should be glad.
It's the first time since he was a child he is on a sledge...
You will find out when we pull you.
Where are you going?
To the base on the slope.
You'll be amazed when you see that base...
Where are the new trucks?
There won't be any.
So why the devil did you come here?
To carry timber.
Timber?
And did you bring yourself a coffin?
There are enough planks anyway...
Come on, I'll show you that timber...
Look, this one thought he could carry long timber on these wrecks also...
Let's go.
Damn him and his timber.
We are leaving tomorrow.
I'm fed up with these mountains.
You must stay.
Oh, must we?
And who are you, pal?
I've never seen you before and you are telling me I must stay.
Whose order is that, yours?
Mine.
And who do you think you are?
Are you a Pope or something?
Shut up.
They send me here to stay with you.
We must carry the timber with these wrecks until the new trucks come.
Who sent you?
The Management.
Oh, the Management sent you...
That's very nice, timber must be carried with trucks.
Let those who sent you come here and carry the timber on their own backs.
Come on Orsaczek, you'll take the coffin to the town.
Is he following us?
Yes, he's already here.
Instead of new trucks they sent us a spook.
Don't you like his face?
No, his scarf.
Warsawer...
That is the base.
That one looks free?
Wanda
I brought another one with me.
He's going to be here soon.
He's filling the tank.
What should I call you?
Nine
Is that your name?
Listen they call me "Nine"for a long time.
I was once in prison from paragraph 225.
Do you know it?
Murder
That's right.
If you add two and two and five, you will understand why they call me "Nine".
I took him to the town.
I thought we both go to hell.
The wind's awful.
Our new pal brought an assistant with him.
He wants to commit a family suicide.
Let him have it his way.
Do you play, Warsawer?
Yeah, wake Apostle, he had no luck recently...
Hey Apostle, let's play.
We're going to hell tomorrow anyway.
Don't use such language.
Is she your wife?
Yes
It's not good...
As the Holy Bible says, the woman... the woman... shit after drinking my head is always as empty as a leaky bucket... but if I stopped drinking for a week or so
I would remember it.
Anyway it's something about a woman and it's very bad.
Don't you remember?
No
He doesn't believe in God, he's a communist.
And do you play cards?
Poker?
Yes.
I can play with you.
Well sit down.
I'm opening for ten
I'm in.
That reminds me, the late pal owed me two hundred.
He won't give it back now.
Which late pal?
Grzegorzewski Stefan.
Didn't you know?
Oh yes, you were drunk the whole time...
Damn you
Don't swear.
When did this thief tumble down?
What did you dream about during this time?
God have mercy on him.
Hey you, Nine keep your filthy hands on the table.
Twenty and forty.
I hope they will bury him as a Christian.
Wait a moment, here he comes I think.
Who?
The new one, Partisan.
Hey, what a nice cozy place...
I brought four full barrels.
We'll unload them tomorrow.
Come on in.
Just a moment, I must fix the tarpaulin.
Put your cigarette out, when you are near gasoline.
Are you frightened?
I don't want to report to Heaven because of your cigarette.
I've already seen a guy who played with matches and gasoline.
He kicked the habit.
Why?
Because he kicked the bucket.
Do you think you are clever?
Well look.
Put it out!
Put it out!
The barrel's getting hot.
Wouldn't you put it out?
No.
Do you wish to die?
Why do you talk about fear?
What do you know about fear?
I was in the woods through the whole war, and you talk such nonsense.
Where were you?
Near Kielce, Lublin, in the Kampinos forest, everywhere.
What brought you here?
The town is terribly boring, pal.
There are only drinks and girls.
The girls lie, and the drink gives you a headache.
I tried to get in the Air Force, they refused me.
The Navy wouldn't take me either... so I came here.
It's difficult to earn something here.
The trucks go to pieces, it's a fright to drive...
So what are you here for?
I see...
Where would I find a better place to hide?
Hey wait!
Who is the one who has just come with his wife?
Do you like her?
I'm talking about him.
She's pretty.
His name is Zabawa.
He used to work in garage.
He's a good mechanic so they sent him here.
Some people say it's because of her.
They say she had an affair with a clerk.
Can you imagine the rumor?
VIP's wife and stuff like that?
She learned everything during the occupation.
She is nice.
Hi!
Hi!
Hi!
There is one there free for you.
What do you have?
I ask you damn you
Full house jacks and queens.
It's over.
It's not poker at six It's a tough game I tell you.
I once knew a guy who really understood poker.
When he had a bad card he took out his gun.
Do you think it's a correct method?
What?
A gun.
We were talking about poker.
It's a tough game.
That's a pity we part tomorrow.
We could play many interesting games.
You must stay.
If there were any new trucks they would have send them.
There are none, absolutely none.
Building sites stand idle for weeks without timber.
You must understand.
Don't waste your time talking Zabawa.
Wanda, Wanda get up quietly and go out.
I'll follow you.
Wanda
Come here
Get up you'll help me.
What do you want to do?
Do you really want us to live here?
Light
When we were leaving you told me, everything will be different here, you said well, we will forget about the past.
Our home and a new life, is this the home which you spoke about?
Give me a screwdriver.
I told you we shouldn't have come here.
They are evil people.
But they drive well.
Don't you love me?
Light.
Why is it just you who must stay here?
What's the good of talking about it all over again?
Everybody has to mind his business anyway.
Mine is timber.
Is timber more important than me?
The commitment is important.
Don't you have commitment to me?
Just as you towards me.
Let's get away from here.
Be careful... it's gasoline, you'll get blisters on your mouth.
I'll leave... if you stay, I'll leave...
Where will you go?
We gave away the flat...
Oh, I hate you...
Light.
Put it lower...
they might see it.
What are you doing?
Tomorrow I'll return to the town.
Do you hear me?
Together with the men.
I would rather go out in the street and on the corner than conk out here...
I know what you want to do...
you want to unwind the trucks.
Pick up the light and be quiet.
Why the hell are you waking me up?
Are you in a hurry to a mass, you idiot?
I want to wash up, is that so strange?
Why today?
It's our last day, isn't it?
Today we are getting the hell out of here, gentlemen.
Get dressed.
What is it?
I'm sorry baby but we all forgot how to act around women.
We only sometimes dream of them lewd dreams, of course.
God will punish you, beast.
Don't stick your ass into my face when I am praying.
Where is my eau de cologne?
What's wrong?
What do you mean what's wrong?
I had a full bottle, and now?
I don't know.
You drank it all up, the day before yesterday when you were drunk, and you smelled so good... you said you add juice to vodka...
Show me the juice now...
Light-headed youngster, I drunk your water in order to protect you against temptations.
Who did you want to please?
Who us?
No you wanted to go the town to practice filthy debauchery.
Out.
Anyway your water was awful, I thought my head would explode.
Late Grzegorzewski God rest his soul, used a much better one.
After his cologne I felt like a bird.
Could you get out?
She wants to get dressed.
If you have done such a thing in the forest the boys would have settled their accounts with you otherwise...
if you stole something from somebody.
What do you say?
Go to hell, you puppy.
Hey, not puppy you old rot.
Let me go.
You will buy a quarter for what you've just said.
Let me out
Half a liter.
Let...
Liter.
A whole big bottle
Ok.
Your word?
Yes partisan's word of honor
Oh, a partisan's... people get lost because of their weakness.
If I had held him like that longer I could squeeze a whole case out of him.
Well boys, lets start these damned wrecks.
I had to do it.
You know I had to do you want the management to think about me as an idiot.
I had to.
Why did you do that?
You must stay.
You disassemble the carburetors into little pieces.
Do you want to keep us here?
I'll do everything to keep you here.
It won't work, we'll be on the move.
They will give you the sack and you won't get a job.
Stand still!
You will stay.
Your corpse will.
And yours.
You won't kill all of us.
You haven't got enough bullets.
There's one for each of you, and a whole bunch for you, Nine.
Let's run away I'm scared.
Of what?
They will kill you.
No, they won't.
They will kill you, they will kill me, and they will kill themselves...
Calm down Wanda
Damn them and their smooching.
Come on, boys, take your stuff, don't waste your time.
Let's pack.
What are you waiting for?
We must stay, we must stay in spite of it all.
There is nothing I must do.
You will beg me to
Must you go so quickly?
Where do you hurry, damn you all.
Yeah, where?
We'll think about it in the town.
It's only 30 km.
I've never seen such a prat in all my life.
It's because you've had a short life, Warsawer.
Well, what is it?
He isn't stupid.
Who?
Who?
The idiot there.
He'll put the carburetors together again and he'll drive our trucks.
Really?
And I've just repaired the pump... and fancy me just having repaired the pomp.
It will work for a couple of weeks.
It's truly a pity for the trucks.
The beast will go and brag that he fixed up these wrecks.
Holy shit!
Do as you wish but I won't leave him my truck.
Not me!
Well what shall we do?
I'll tell you something.
A day sooner or later makes no difference.
Let's put those carburetors together and we'll drive to the town in style.
Okay?
Sure, we'll go.
You're good at throwing.
I had time to learn it.
I once hit the very middle of a car full of Germans driving at full speed.
Your mum couldn't make a stew like that.
I've got no mother.
Somebody else, then.
Who?
Haven't you got anybody in your family who could cook up something fine?
If I had, I wouldn't be here.
And you, don't you want to go back to the town?
And what?
Marry, have children, take a walk arm in arm and save money for a new suit.
No, that's not for me.
It's better here.
Didn't you hear what they say?
What?
You can die here.
People die in town too.
Hey!
Will you be ready soon?
He fooled us, nobody ever fooled me like that.
Like what?
Like a complete idiot.
What about your father?
Hey, Nine!
I'll fix him tonight.
He'll surely sleep with his gun, but I don't mind.
I thought it all over.
I'll just change beds with you.
Give me your hand.
What for?
Give it!
I'll take care of him myself.
Don't mix it with him.
I want to get him myself.
But why?
Are you interested in the widow?
You gave me your hand that will do.
As you wish.
Give it to me.
Is this yours?
You shouldn't give back things when you find them.
I'll bring you another one.
Will you?
What kind would you like?
Here... a blue, green or yellow one?
But you want to run away from here.
Sure "alea jacta est" so do you want it back?
Do you know Latin?
And a couple of other things too.
The riddle of life my dear.
When do you leave?
It's not so simple.
Do you have a home in the town?
I know what you're thinking about, baby, but it won't work with me.
I only wanted you to give me a lift.
Once in my life I took the wrong steps and since then I've been walking sideways.
Boys!
Buzka is coming!
Who is he?
The messenger from the company.
Our pay.
Aren't you working today?
I looked for you out in the tree cutting place.
Stop your babble, give us the money.
Where did you get this chick from?
She came with Zabawa.
Is she nice?
So what?
Don't you know?
No, I don't.
Today I'm in a hurry but when I come here the next time I'll show you what.
When do you want to fetch timber?
We can try tomorrow.
They won't agree, they'll fix the trucks and go to the town.
They are getting their money now.
How will you keep them?
I don't know.
You have until tomorrow morning.
What can I do in a few hours?
They will kill themselves on these wrecks...
I see it and you know it too.
I know one thing, I must carry down the timber.
Have you finished?
I think that will do.
Start the motor.
What for?
We'll listen.
It's no use.
I'll drive around and try.
Or would you like to drive along with me?
All right, but first start the motor.
I don't want us to get stuck somewhere.
Don't worry about my truck.
I'll take mine, you'll take yours.
Do you want to take me sightseeing in the mountains?
I'll try.
All right I'll bring my coat.
Warsawer, where are you going?
For a little walk.
Do you want to fix him now?
You've taken too much brilliantine, you stink like a hairdresser but she doesn't like you anyway.
It's a pity to look how they kill those trucks.
When I'll have my own car I won't let anybody touch it.
You should care for a car as for a child.
You will have a piece of land not a car.
Why a piece of land?
Your own piece of land after your death.
Play!
Play!
I'm playing and playing like an idiot and nobody pays me for it.
Play!
Play and sing.
The harmonium quietly plays one two three everybody dances, but I don't...
Stop it.
Something else.
Perhaps "the last Sunday"?
All right but at once.
Give me a cigarette.
But you don't smoke.
But now I want to.
Listen, do you really want to run off?
Where to?
I don't know.
Nobody knows that.
What is it?
Nothing, only wolves.
Nothing to fear.
There are worse things than that.
What?
A cold.
Do you play the fool or are you really one?
Would you like me to play a sage?
It doesn't matter for me.
All right, and now get away from here.
Quick!
Why?
You remind me of something.
Something unpleasant?
Something I don't want to remember.
What?
Life.
Take me away from here... there must be life somewhere...
. people walking in the streets...
lights... houses...
Not now!
Wait!
Here he comes.
Who?
I can't say which one yet.
And where is the other one?
Far away.
Holy shit, here they come, both if them.
His pump went to pot.
He 's learnt how to drive, but doesn't know yet how to care for his truck properly.
The mountains are beautiful, I begin to like it here.
I thought it would be worse.
Don't worry boy, the first twenty-five years are always the most difficult.
Why?
Because then you'll understand that yobs who want to kill others usually have a bad ending.
Apostle
Let's play a good farewell poker.
All right.
Well?
Come on Warsawer, it's the last time, perhaps you'll win back what you've lost.
I'm in for a hundred.
I add two hundred
Two hundred for me.
Two hundred and four hundred.
I'll up it.
Five hundred.
Eight hundred.
Eight hundred and one thousand six hundred.
I'm in and checking.
What have you got?
Good cards, brother, I'm not bluffing, is a full house enough?
Four of a kind.
Lucky boy.
Not as lucky as he thinks he is.
Opening for a hundred.
A hundred and two hundred.
Two hundred and four hundred.
Four hundred and eight hundred.
Five hundred and a thousand.
A thousand.
Fifteen hundred.
I'll leave the game.
It costs two thousand.
Two and four.
I'll give four thousand.
What have you got?
A flush.
Are you playing again?
With what?
Are you broke?
That's too bad.
But I'll give you a chance.
Let's play for days.
Days?
What are you thinking about, Judas?
I'll play with money but you guys with extra days working here.
Ok?
You can break your spine here every day.
We'll give you such a funeral banquet that you won't regret it
I'm playing, I can't come back flat broke to the town.
Is everyone playing?
Give the cards.
Put down the cigarettes.
One cigarette for one day.
This is what it looks like.
What?
Life.
It's not worth anything here.
Play.
What do you have?
Jesus Christ, I've never seen such poker in my life.
Man, are you a devil?
Yeah, that was beautiful poker.
Give me the cards.
Do you want to play again?
No, they are mine.
I can buy them from you.
They brought me luck.
That's something.
How much will you pay?
Nothing, they are mine.
I can buy them from you.
No, they may bring me luck too.
It would be worthwhile to have a close look how this luck looks like...
No, it's not worthwhile.
Are you afraid to frighten the good luck away?
Good luck...
I once knew a clever guy who was driving like a fool and wanted to make a fool of another guy.
You are right... it was the greatest poker I've ever seen.
Warsawer.
I'll give you the money back.
Not bad... marked... dotted cards... you played open.
How could you remember all that?
I was in jail once...
I used to write long projects with this alphabet on cigarette paper.
That was much more difficult than poker.
What did they put you in for?
Communism.
Same as now.
Have you been in jail for communism now?
I'm here with you... it's worse than jail.
How much do you want for shutting your mouth?
Nothing.
I'll stay to play an honest game with you.
I only clean and clean your dirt.
I can do without it.
I'll clean it myself.
Shall I help you, Nine?
No thanks.
Go with Warsawer, I'll catch up with you.
Are you crying?
No,
It's good.
When one can cry, one can start everything again.
When will we leave?
When?
Today.
Really?
Get dressed.
Well go and get dressed.
I'll go to the forest now and take some timber.
In that time you'll pack neatly,
I'll come back before the others.
We'll get into a car and tell the mountains "damn you" and then...
And then what?
Then we'll stay in the town for some time together... perhaps we'll get on well with each other... and then,
you'll find yourself another fine guy and you'll go away with him.
And you'll have a husband, a home, and everything and nothing.
Why do you talk like that?
I was kidding.
Do you hear the wind?
You won't hear it tomorrow any more.
Dress up warm and wait.
It blows terribly today.
Nine...
What is really your name?
Nine.
But your real name?
I'll tell you when we get to the town.
Orsaczek!
What is it?
Tell Marcinkowski I'll call on him today.
Sure.
Five lengths.
Mr. Orsaczek why is it so little?
I can't bring more, Mr. Marcinkowski, because he would know.
Who?
They've sent one.
Who sent him?
How could I know?
They send whenever they want to.
That makes...
No, no Mr. Marcinkowski you promised me a car for a cab.
When there'll be enough I'll come and get it.
As you wish.
Dealing with me is like with the bank.
Nine will come here today.
Hurry up boys, don't worry you'll get your car... a couple of drives more, and it will be done.
Hey Nine, this is the Inspector from the Management.
And this is another driver.
Well, how is it?
How is what?
How the fuck are things?
They are going, Sir
Don't forget that we need timber.
People are waiting for that timber.
You work for the sake of men and men are our greatest wealth.
Do you understand?
Yes, Sir.
See you later Sir.
There is work waiting for me.
Let the Holy Virgin bless you for your kind words, Sir.
You have to know how to speak to people, just as I do.
In our words, with an open heart, the fuck, and immediately I could communicate with him.
Why doesn't he get promoted?
There are some obstacles...
What?
He murdered wife's lover and they gave him 15 years.
He was a doctor, but they took away his right to work.
Yes...
Yes.
That's the obstacle...
Very bad.
Very bad...
Mr. Five!
Mr. Five!
Not Five!
Not Five!
Pardon me but five is pimping... what is it?
Will it be enough?
Give me two lengths more.
Why do you want so much?
It's over eighteen.
Eighteen is nothing, give me thirty.
What?
For such a road?
You never wanted to take more than twenty.
Men need that timber... they are waiting for that timber in factories, docks, the capital city and small villages are waiting to carve them into toothpicks and umbrella handles.
Stop telling this nonsense, shall I load more or not?
Yes.
More, more... come on...
What is it?
Nine take the Inspector with you to the railway station.
You drive well, don't you?
No, but quick.
Won't this forest ever end?
It will end.
Today.
Why today?
I'm wondering myself too.
Stop kidding.
I'm not kidding.
We'll be out of the forest in a minute.
Stop for a moment.
What is it?
I want to take a leak.
Our boys take it during the driving.
Stop kidding, will you?
Damn you... shit...
What's the matter?
The brakes have broken down.
What?
It must have happened on a hump.
The piping has broken down.
The whole hydraulic fluid leaked out.
And the hand brakes?
A hand brake for twenty tons?
I pull it once and it's finished.
Well?
I go on.
I must be in the town before the others anyway.
We'd better wait for the others.
What?
Let's wait for the others.
It will take them about 2 hours.
Two hours?
Why?
We work collectively.
When one of us takes an illegal ride the rest have defects.
And the horn?
Does the horn work?
What?
The horn, does it work?
Remove two steps from the truck.
What?
Nothing, I was holding my hand on the horn the whole time.
Did you hear anything?
Nothing.
We are in the mountains.
When the wind blows you won't hear a shot three steps from you.
Goodbye Sir.
Go straight!
Come on... we'll fetch the box.
It was to bring him good luck... in ten days nobody will be able to say who is who.
I'll take it.
Are you superstitious?
No, but I don't like my face.
You are scared.
Just like you.
Come on, Orsaczek and stop it damn you.
They will go alone with him.
I'm fed up with that.
Shall we go to the town or something?
What for?
We don't have any money.
Good people will give us credit.
Hey Zabawa, how much is my soul worth to you, Judas?
I'm not Saviour.
It's a believing soul, well preserved in alcohol, how much?
I can lend you a thousand, here you are.
God won't forget you for it.
I would prefer if you didn't forget it, it's a loan.
Are you nuts?
No, we've come to become nuts.
Take the spare tire to the cloakroom.
Do you want to go with a wheel to a restaurant?
Will you pay if somebody steals it?
Waiter!
Moment...
What is it?
Something tall.
Sure, boss, it'll be here in a minute.
Apostle...
Yes, sonny?
Will I ever have this taxi?
Sonny, you don't understand...
What?
Why the devil do you want it?
I want to live...
How?
Old asshole, you may hit me.
Speak up.
What do you want to do?
I want to get back to the town.
I'll get back to the town.
You're dressed like a madam in a whorehouse.
Are you going to have a good time?
No.
I'm going to have a meeting with some whores.
Why today?
It's as good as any other day.
I'll do it in honor of Nine.
He told me yesterday about his last whore.
I'll go back to the town.
But you're in the town.
Where?
Here!
This is not the town.
I don't know how to drive now.
I must run on the third gear more than half of the way.
Yesterday water boiled in the radiator.
I can drive two more weeks, that's it.
Perhaps those new trucks will finally arrive...
Perhaps...
I would like a red one...
I knew a boy from a fire department once.
He had a red car.
Why don't you start?
I'm lost in my thoughts.
How could you win so much then?
Haven't you got other troubles?
Listen, I'll give you whatever you want, brother...
I can carry timber, even stay here forever, whatever you want, but tell me:
Was there any evil in the game?
Man, are we all crazy?
Swear.
Swear to what?
To God of course.
Give him and I'll swear to him.
He's here...
He must be somewhere close...
He gets up early now.
The wind too, and the water wakes early, and so do the mountains.
Only the Earth... the Earth sleeps very long...
You are drunk.
I can't stand a third day like this... don't you have any books here?
Why do you need a book?
Why?
I want to read.
There isn't a book.
So what are you doing here when we are away?
I don't know.
Aren't you doing anything?
Nothing.
Are you sitting here all day long?
Yes.
Sometimes I do some cleaning,
I go out and walk a little bit.
Than I am waiting again.
How are you doing it?
Doing what?
You and your husband?
What are we doing?
Don't pretend you don't know.
But we are doing nothing...
Nothing at all?
Nothing.
Why?
Why?
Because one have to love somebody to be close to him.
So why are you with him?
Who should I be with?
Leave him and go back home.
But I told you I don't have any home.
Oh, yes...
Partisan...
Yeah?
Let's talk.
About what?
I don't know.
Well, how are things between you two?
He brought me here, but I want to come back to the town.
What will you do in the town?
I would have to do something.
Sure... the town, that's something different...
That's true.
The town is different.
You must come back to the town.
You are so young.
I can't stand the thought that the same thing can happen to you that happened to that gangster.
To Nine?
But why do you care about me?
You?
No, I don't but run away from here.
Tell me something.
And you?
You've always talked about the forest... the forest...
I can tell you something about the forest... that the forest doesn't really change.
In winter, fall or summer it's always the same, boring and dangerous, tiring and mean, and always empty.
Since when have you been thinking like that?
Since the Devil brought me here.
If I hadn't come here
I would have my memories at least, fighting, a few dead men and the thought that once I wasn't nobody.
So leave this place.
You are courageous.
What future do you have here?
And what?
Let all those idiots laugh at me?
And if you break your neck, silly?
So how are things between you two?
I told you.
It's hard to believe.
I wouldn't lie.
Maybe I'll forget with you.
About the forest?
Yes, I came here to remember.
Now I'll run off with you to forget.
When are we leaving?
Whenever you want to.
Tomorrow I'll go out to the forest with them, so that they don't suspect anything and I'll take my money.
Looks bad... if anybody stops here, we'll never get out again.
We will have to unload on the road.
At least 3 days work.
Perhaps not 3, 3 is too much but 2 for sure.
It's impossible to get through now, the trailer will pull down and amen and full stop.
Well start unloading, I'll help you.
No, I'll drive through.
Do you want to be the next one?
I thought it is my turn.
Next?
The next to paradise, to eternal happiness as Apostle says.
I will go first.
Anybody who wants to follow me better piss before.
It's good advice.
Hey, Partisan, where are you going?
Well?
Well, honey would you like a barrel of gasoline?
Here is the cigarette.
Here you are Apostle.
Yes, gentlemen, if Christ had wanted to return, he should have done it today.
You know he would have eaten something even God couldn't imagine.
Listen Partisan, if you had eaten that barley soup before, you would have flown over that bend as if you had wings.
Partisan,
you see we should have done it yesterday.
We'll go away from here and you'll forget.
We'll be far away.
All that is ridiculous.
I've never been frightened, never, it's your fault.
I was thinking of you at the bend.
A man must be alone, do you understand?
Completely alone if he wants to make something.
Only then he has the strength and desire and no fear.
Go away now... go away...
I couldn't touch you.
Maybe because I've fallen in love with you truly.
Go away!
Do you hear me?
Well gentlemen this barley soup is
God's and fates reward for all our cursed days.
Wanda...
Let's run away from here.
I can't go on living like that any longer.
Without people, without joy, without anybody.
I'm alone the whole day long.
Come on.
But tell me you'll take me away from this place.
We must stay for some time.
Some time more.
How long?
Until they call me back.
When can it be?
I don't know.
And they?
What about them?
Will they stay too?
You will never understand it.
If they had really wanted to leave, they would have left long time ago.
Come on...
In the town.
When we are in the town.
Good morning.
Why don't you say anything?
What should I say?
When will the boys be back?
I don't know.
Sometimes they don't get back at all.
You'd better go to the forest.
I'll wait here, I've been riding since early in the morning.
We'll have a conversation.
What will we talk about?
I'll tell you about a cinema or a theatre whatever you wish.
Tell me then.
A fellow bought a lottery ticket and lost it together with his wallet.
Another found it, looked inside and saw the lottery ticket and ah... the fiancée of that guy
Which guy?
The one who lost it... she was a blonde... she had a nice body... a certain elderly prince was in love with her... so that guy...
That's enough.
You can't tell anything.
I think you didn't understand the movie yourself.
Well, now I'll tell you another movie that we'll both understand.
Once upon a time there was a fellow who was living in the town, he had a pretty girl, and everything was nice but he had bad luck.
He made something that the management didn't like.
So they both had to go far to the mountains where nobody was living or coming.
Do you understand or shall I repeat the beginning?
Well go on, go on.
Gangsters, thieves and rogues lived in this damned forest.
Because her husband got a job with a company where no respectable person wanted to work.
When somebody came out of jail he went to this company, when he was politically suspicious he went to this company.
Well?
Is it right or not?
Have you got a home in the town?
And she had nobody to take her away from this place... and so life went on with no joy, no people...
Tell me have you got a home in the town?
Until one day...
I'll finish it for you... until one day a very nice guy appeared and talked very nice
things but he knew one thing...
because he was a wise guy, that in the mountains it's easy to have a crash that motorcycles can tumble down too and it's very easy to send somebody to Paradise.
So this guy listened to the advice of his elder colleague, got on his bike and went to Hell.
And what about the girl?
I know how it was with Nine.
It was the same with Partisan, but more pleasant.
I hate to see a hussy making a fool out of a man, sleeping with everybody around.
With everybody in the world, but with one never.
With a tall, awful one, with a bandit's face never and nowhere.
I am the only one who has a home in the town a mother, brothers.
I can come back there and take you with me.
With you?
Buy a mirror and look at your face.
Do you hear me?
Buy a mirror.
The chain broke.
In a moment the whole truck will fall over.
Maybe not... but the trailer will go to Hell.
Pull the pins together with the jack
I'll try to pull the ends together.
Well...
Turn it...
More...
More...
Apostle!
Apostle!
Apostle!
Say something... speak...
Don't touch me!
Come nearer... give me your gun...
Don't say that.
I'll pull you out.
Take it... it's on my chest.
What?
The book.
Does God see me?
He's with you he's always been.
Read... page 103.
Oh, Jesus, loving Soul I implore you through the dying of your most holy Heart and the pain of your Immaculate Mother,
wash with your blood the sinners of the whole world who are dying now.
Read... read...
I can hear you.
Wash with your blood the sinners of the whole world who are now dying and who are to die today.
Oh, the Heart of Dying Jesus, have mercy on those dying.
Amen.
Give them the truth about sleep, life, peace, rest, conscience and freedom.
Give them the road without wrong turns or violence, a land where they can do what they think, feel and wish for.
Your caps.
God be with you.
Now and forever.
We brought a man.
What's wrong with him?
He's dead.
You're very drunk, aren't you?
...or am I wrong?
He was our friend.
He believed in God like nobody else.
Please listen to us.
We are alone, tomorrow we must go further.
It's all that we, men can do for him.
Carry him into the church.
I'll be right there.
What was his name?
Apostle.
Which?
This one.
There were twelve Apostles.
But he was one.
That's what we called him.
He was very religious, he even said his prayers.
And the organist?
He went to the town.
I can't help it.
You can do it.
Play"Salve Regina" go on, go upstairs.
I can't remember...
I remember nothing.
Play or I'll kill you.
Don't cry, sing.
We should dance, we should live harmonium plays quietly...
Wake up boys, wake up.
Don't bother.
You could shoot from a cannon and they wouldn't hear you.
They got completely drunk yesterday.
Damn them.
Could you receive their salaries?
Ok.
You look pretty today.
Count please.
Zabawa, is it correct?
Orsaczek.
Yes
Warsawer.
Yes
Apostle.
He's not here.
Where is he?
He's gone.
Where?
Where all men go...
My goodness, fancy that, they know nothing there and send money up, and I ride and carry it.
Don't make a fool out of yourself.
Everybody here knows that you take the dead's salaries.
They told me that once you took a salary for three months for somebody had been pushing up daisies for a long time.
It's a lie.
Firstly it wasn't three months only two, secondly nobody ever planted any daisies on his grave.
Do you think I should live as you do here?
No honey...
I told you the movie but this bandit didn't let me finish.
But I'll do it now, well and sure.
Listen...
They all will go to Heaven and your husband with them... or maybe he'll just become a helpless cripple... who knows?
And then you?
What about me?
An old, ugly woman will come back to the town and nobody would marry her she would have to go on a street so drunkards would look at her.
Yes... yes... this movie won't have a happy ending.
That's a pity.
I would like it to end otherwise.
Have you got a home in the town?
Of course I have, but why should I tell you about it?
I'll tell you,
I'll go away and you'll get back to this hellhole.
What do you need that for?
Buzka!
Let's go.
Where to?
Where to?
To the town.
We'll go but not all of us.
It's easy to cheat you.
My home...
I live in a workers' hotel, my dear.
We are forty in one room.
Don't be a fool.
Be nice to the end.
My motorcycle... it's fallen...
I think so too.
What's now?
Quite a lot of things... how was it with her Buzka?
Not bad.
I'm sorry but it was the last girl in your life my dear.
Fancy that, Warsawer.
No, I think that you're kidding.
Stop it!
Stop it!
What have you done?
Who is more handsome now, him or me?
You women are all the same.
Run off!
Run now!
Warsawer!
A mirror... take a look at you now.
Hey, Zabawa!
Do you have a wife?
What do you mean?
Shell we bet?
You!
There's no need to get angry.
Do you have anything at all?
What did you come here with?
With a lie that new trucks will come.
A gun when the lie didn't work.
With a whore who you said is your wife.
Tell me what you know.
Don't be a fool.
There is nothing you can do anyway.
What do you want from her?
She's left, she's run off and let her go to Hell.
You've got the timber, the gun and us.
Isn't that enough?
Hey, where are you going?
Wait, we're coming with you.
Wait, my pals are here, I'll ask them.
Howdy, how are things?
We don't know each other.
I'm Dzwonkowiak so we know each other now.
Sit down.
Leon my friend, listen.
I've got a virgin here, an immaculate one.
I must invest some money in her.
Lend me five thousand.
Will you give it back?
No, I won't.
You're lucky.
If you had said yes, you wouldn't have got a zloty.
Here is two thousand you've asked for.
Mieczyslaw, your country won't forget you for this.
I've talked to everybody.
She's not here.
She's never been here.
You should think like that.
In a couple of years the new trucks will come, they will console you.
I've forgotten to tell you, they're coming tomorrow.
This time for sure.
For sure we can only get drunk.
It's all I can do for you today.
And tomorrow?
Tomorrow?
We'll part.
Let's go, I know a better place.
They've swindled me.
It's Marcinkowski, he 's cheated me.
What's happened?
He told me... he would find a car for me, and now he's giving me money.
Old scoundrel.
A hundred thousand for all I've stolen.
A hundred thousand?
I can buy shit with it, not a car.
A hundred thousand!
A hundred thousand!
I will go.
Wait.
Can you hear that?
The new trucks?
Only now are they really coming for Nine, for Partisan, for Apostle, and the red one for Orsaczek.
Partisan, Nine, Apostle, Orsaczek,
I don't even know their names.
What is your name, Warsawer?
Tadek, and yours?
Stefan, but it doesn't matter now.
You're right.
Well, goodbye Stefan.
Do you really want to stay, Stefan?
Do you really want to leave?
You, rogue!
The end
- Shut up, rude girls!
- But why, sir?
Move on or I'll rip it off and make you eat it!
- But I didn't do it!
- Move on, I said.
- I really didn't do it.
- Oh, no!
You viper!
Isn't this pen yours?
- Yes, but I didn't throw it.
- Who did?
- I had given it to Papastavrou.
- What now, Xanthopoulou?
Nothing, sir, a little misunderstanding.
So you confess that Papastavrou threw this pen.
I don't know who threw it at you, I only know I didn't do it.
And she raises her hand, too!
Fetch Papastavrou!
On the double!
- They threw a pen at you?
- Nearly poked my eye out!
It flew right past me.
If I stood over here, I'd be minus an eye.
- What happened?
- They threw a pen at him.
Liza!
- During class?
- Yes.
I was writing a trigonometry theorem on the blackboard.
As I turned to look at them, whoosh!
the pen came flying 10 cm from my eye.
Right here.
Ten centimetres, principal.
This is insupportable, most assuredly.
And you haven't discovered who threw it at you?
At first I suspected Lazarou.
Then it turned out it belonged to Xanthopoulou.
But she says she'd given it to Papastavrou.
Principal, you must take severe measures.
We risk bodily harm during every lesson.
- Don't exaggerate, Mr. Mavromatis.
- I do no such thing.
They are children and children are always lively and undisciplined.
No, principal, we are more lenient than we should be.
Impunity has made them brazen.
A slap or two would set them right.
No slaps, most assuredly!
What is this?
This is an educational... come in.
- You wanted to see me?
- Come in, Papastavrou.
What's to be done with you?
Will you always be a stormy petrel?
- I don't understand.
- Oh, don't you?
During class did you take this pen from Xanthopoulou?
Let me see!
Yes, I did.
- Did you have it during class?
- What was that?
I said, did you have it during class?
Yes, I did.
And how did it end up stuck on the blackboard?
- I must have dropped it.
- How did you drop it?
According to the laws of gravity objects fall like this and not like this!
That is correct, according to the laws of gravity objects always fall vertically and never horizontally, most assuredly.
Principal, your efforts to explain the laws of gravity to Papastavrou fall on deaf ears.
Papastavrou is useless at Physics.
- Why do you say that, Mr. Mavromatis?
- Because you are insolent.
I am not negligent.
I simply confuse Physics with Religion.
Yes, with Religion.
And it's all your fault.
The other day you were telling us of Darwin's and Laplace's theory.
That the earth was a nebula that later froze... and then the seas were formed and the first signs of life appeared and then came man who evolved from the aps?
- Mr. Fragkou disagrees!
- I do?
Weren't you telling us just his morning in class that man was made from clay and that Eve was formed from Adam's ribs?
Don't change your mind now.
You should support your views!
I do right here and now.
We're just children, after all!
We are confused if people tell us contradictory things.
Quiet, you insolent girl, most assuredly!
Tomorrow you will copy and bring me 100 lines from the Iliad.
Get out now!
Girls!
What happened, girls?
Fofo has a great idea.
We should all skip the Physical Exercise.
I have a better idea.
Let's drive Gkikas mad today!
We must all agree.
When he tells us to raise our hands we'll touch our feet.
And when he tells us to touch our feet we'll raise our hands.
And when he gives the command to spread we'll spread our arms.
No, let's keep it simple.
Bend over-raise hands.
We must tell the others, the bell is about to ring.
- May I help you?
- The principal is expecting me.
- Right along there.
- Thank you.
- Don't give the game away, Liza.
- Who, me?
- You often do that.
- What's she talking about?
- Swear you won't say anything.
- On Marlon Brando's head.
Shame on you.
Keep it down, girls.
- Sorry.
- What's this "sorry"?
We stepped on your feet, we pushed you a little, we said "sorry".
What else could we say?
Would you like us to sing carols?
And you thought this was amusing.
- Rather.
- Rather?
Congratulations, then!
Merci!
- What's this now?
- I don't know.
Forget about him.
There's no discipline any longer.
My dear sirs we can enforce discipline through other means.
Other means, most assuredly.
We've seen these other means all these years.
What's the result?
- The Principal, please?
- This way.
- Yes?
- We'll talk about it again, Principal.
Most assuredly.
My name is Floras, Principal.
Panos Floras.
I teach literature.
Pleased to meet you.
Floras, yes I know.
I talked to Mr. Nikolaides, I don't know if you have talked to him.
He did, but I asked him to see you in person, to make my request.
I understand.
Unfortunately, as I explained to Mr. Nikolaides this cannot be done.
For a variety of reasons.
I've been told you have a pressing need for a Greek language teacher.
Of course, we do.
And that is the point.
I don't know if Mr. Nikolaides told you.
I graduated with honours, Principal.
Undoubtedly, but as I said to Mr. Nikolaides... our students come mostly from well-known families and they are quite lively and undisciplined.
Venerable teachers, whose hair turned gray in classes find it difficult to maintain order.
It will be doubly difficult for you because you are very close in age to them, most assuredly.
Don't worry about that.
I am certain they won't dare do anything with me.
That is just talk, sir.
Please sit down, Mr. Floras.
What's wrong?
They dared, sir.
They dared, most assuredly.
- They dared what?
- Come closer, please.
I'm a donkey!
Not bad, they have written much worse.
Much worse, most assuredly.
I don't understand.
They put it on me here?
Unless you brought it from home, which is rather unlikely.
I told you, you will not be able to make it, despite your good intentions.
- Listen to me please...
- I'm sorry, Mr. Floras but I am late for class.
- Should I wait, Principal?
- Wait?
What for?
I don't think there is anything more that remains to be said.
I'll wait for you anyway.
What can I say?
Although I've made myself clear.
Where are you going?
Don't you have class now?
- Yes, we have physical education.
- Why aren't you there?
Mr. Gkikas excused me to keep Polychronopoulou company because she suddenly felt ill.
All right, you're excused.
And you?
I'm Polychronopoulou, Principal.
All right, go on now.
Our ancient ancestors used to say "a healthy body in a healthy mind".
Which is right because physical exercise does not ascertain physical and mental health, it also ascertains beauty.
A person who exercises regularly will certain have a nice body.
And the example stands here before you.
Shut up!
Move in and out.
The same!
Bend palms, stand on your toes and breathe in deeply.
One... two.
The same!
One... two.
Who's whistling?
Shut up, spoilt chits!
Who whistled?
Shut up!
I said, who whistled?
- Who whistled?
- I did, sir.
You did?
- Why do you whistle, child?
- I have adenoids.
You don't have adenoids, you have a whistle!
Shut up!
Quiet, spoilt chits.
Always on the lookout for a laugh.
Attention!
Stop that, Papastavrou, or you'll pay for it.
- It's the way I'm made!
- Heed my words!
Attention!
You're facing the wrong way, Papastavrou!
Standing jump in four increments.
Begin, one, two, three, four.
The same!
Legs spread, hands at the waist.
Extend arms.
Raise arms.
- What are you doing.
- Touching our feet.
- What did I command?
- Touch your feet.
- I said "touch your feet"?
- Yes, sir.
All right, back into position.
Raise arms.
- What are you doing now?
- Touching our feet!
Quiet, please.
Attention!
And now, girls, we'll raise our arms!
Right?
Let's be clear on that.
Raise arms!
We'll raise our arms, nice and easy.
Legs spread, hands at the waist.
Raise arms!
For heaven's sake, girls, what did we just say?
- Touch your feet!
- I said that?
- You heard it, too?
- Yes!
- Didn't I say "raise arms"?
- No, no!
You'll make me look for a sharp corner to bang my head against!
You should, you should!
I said, shut up!
Excuse me, sir.
Did you hear the command I just gave them?
- Yes, I did.
- What did I say?
- Raise arms, sir.
- Thank you very much.
You saved me at least 200 drachmas.
I had decided to visit a psychiatrist tomorrow.
I'm sorry, dear colleague.
They've pinned this on you.
Dear colleague, they've pinned this on you.
Excuse me, dear colleague, they've pinned this on you.
I was certain!
- But why?
- But I explained, most assuredly.
Aristophanes is indeed the greatest comic poet of antiquity but Aristophanes is not taught in highschools.
And that is due to that rather licentious, one might say licentious language used in his comedies, most assuredly.
Thank you very much.
- Still here, young man?
- I told you I would wait for you.
You did, most assuredly.
But I told you, too.
Principal, sir, I am in great need of employment.
I know that, but I told you that venerable teachers...
Should I then become venerable in order to find employment?
If that is so, I will never manage to become venerable.
As you undoubtedly know better than I do age alone does not inspire respect.
I beg you, at least take me on a trial period.
Just on a trial basis and if you find I am not suitable...
As for what happened, believe me, it is not that important.
- I mean the paper they pinned on me.
- Oh, it is important.
Everything is important, sir.
Everything, most assuredly.
May I, Principal?
They've pinned this on you.
What does it say?
The present construction is scheduled for demolition.
All decrepit material for sale, most assuredly.
Details within.
- Within?
- That's what it says.
They've written much worse than that.
Much worse, most assuredly.
Don't forget to thank Mr. Nikolaides.
Yes, mother.
I will.
As soon as I have some time.
- You start lessons today?
- Yes, today.
- Let's see how I'll do.
- You'll do just fine.
You'll do fine with God's help.
Sit down and eat something.
Oh, great... cheese, olives...
- Strawberry jam again?
- You asked for it yesterday!
I didn't ask for strawberry, I only said that I don't like apricot jam.
- Have some buttered bread.
- I'm not hungry.
Drink your milk, at least.
Go on, like water.
- There's a crust!
- Oh, no, there isn't any!
- I strained it myself!
- What am I crazy?
- It's the school bus and I'm not ready!
- Come back here!
Sit down!
I won't have you go to school on an empty stomach!
The schoolbus is here and they are waiting for the young miss.
They are late and she should hurry, they said.
Tell them not to wait, miss will go in our car.
You tell Antonis to be ready.
- Honey.
- What are you doing?
Are you mad?
Hello, Antonis!
Give me a light, Antonis.
Merci.
Tell me something, please.
A student got off that car.
- What's her name?
- Papastavrou.
- What class is she in?
- The last one.
Girls, girls!
I have news!
- A new teacher!
- A new one?
- Brand new.
- Have you seen him?
No, but I think he's rather young.
- Young?
What will he teach?
- Ancient Greek.
They're obsessed with ancient Greek!
I don't understand that!
Why do they insist on our learning ancient Greek!
What's the use?
Why not teach us English?
Should we find ourselves in Hollywood we'd be able to talk to Brando.
He's a cutie!
Why not teach us French?
Should we find ourselves in Paris to be able to talk to Gerard Philippe.
To tell him... "je t'aime".
What would we say?
Oh stranger, tell the Spartans?
Why not teach us Spanish.
Even Spanish is good.
We might find ourselves in Marseilles one day.
What does Marseilles got to do with Spain?
- It doesn't?
- None at all!
Marseilles is in Brussels!
What I meant to say is they could teach us a foreign language.
What's the use in learning ancient Greek?
Is there any chance of having a chat with Pericles and Aspasia?
Why do they tire us out needlessly then?
What I must stress, Mr. Floras, is your method.
The way you will handle them.
Be in no doubt, Principal.
In a public school a teacher is able to punish with the requisite severity any indiscipline.
But our great college is also a business.
A business with great expenses.
- I don't know if I made myself clear.
- Crystal clear, Principal.
- This way, Mr. Floras.
- After you, sir.
Quiet!
Sit down, please.
My dear children, allow me to present your new teacher, Mr. Panos Floras.
As of today he will be teaching your class ancient Greek and history.
I urge you to extend your new teacher the same respect, most assuredly.
The same respect you afford to me.
What crap!
Quiet, please.
Here you are, Mr. Floras.
And I wish you a great career for the benefit of society.
- What is your lesson now?
- Homer!
Our lesson is Homer.
Yes, Papastavrou, I heard.
Homer, most assuredly.
And now your lesson.
Quiet, please.
Sir, the Principal just wished you a great career.
- Is this your first teaching post?
- Yes, miss.
- May you have a great career, then.
- Thank you, miss.
Sir!
May I also wish you a great career?
Thank you, too, miss.
Sir, a great career to the benifit of society, most assuredly.
Are you finished with all that?
Sir!
A great career!
- You've already said so, miss.
- I did?
When did I say that?
When did I say that, girls?
I don't remember.
Quiet!
Please, miss.
Don't make me start the great career that you wished for me... in a way that I don't want and that, believe me you would not want either.
Quiet!
- Sir?
- Yes, miss.
May I go out?
Yes, you may.
Right. lt seems that there are many clever girls here.
That's all right.
We'll get to know each other better over time.
It's late and the bell will ring in 15 minutes.
But since you had a lesson on Homer, let us say a few words about this great ancient poet.
Where exactly have you stopped?
You, miss.
We are at chapter A, verse 123- 124.
- Do you like Homer, miss?
- Yes, of course, I do.
- Do you understand him?
- Yes, quite.
- And you, miss?
- Sorry?
- Do you understand Homer?
- Papastavrou?
Certainly!
- That's how they converse at home!
- Quiet!
Could you translate this piece for me?
Let me...
Oh, like that!
- All of it?
- These four verses.
- All together?
- Of course.
- I can't do it like that.
- I'll help you.
- Right.
- Right, what?
To be honest out of all this the only thing I know is "pallas".
- You know it?
- lt's because I've been there.
- Where?
- To the "Pallas".
I see.
Let's hear the translation of these few verses by...
- Giadikiaroglou.
- Sir, it's her who went...
Here she is.
- You asked for me?
- Are you Giadikiaroglou?
- Yes, is something wrong?
- Do you understand Homer?
Homer who?
I see, sit down.
Quiet!
This one will prove to be tough.
He wants to act very macho.
We'll soften him up.
Your social comments during the break, please.
One of you come here.
- I said one of you.
- But I am one.
And I'm one, too.
I'm not two.
Come one desk, forward, miss.
- Sit down then.
- In front or behind?
In front.
- And I?
- In the back.
Quiet!
Please, girls.
I see you are completely unaware of Homer.
You mock something which is admirable.
Not because we teachers say so but because all people throughout the ages say so.
You do that because you are ignorant.
I am certain that together we can find the beauty... hidden behind these strange words that you do not undestand now.
Let's start systematically.
I want you to pay attention because we don't much time left.
The homeric remnants of Greek speech are not only the most ancient but also the most perfect.
It's from Homer himself that we learn... that older poets had written other poems before him...
Demodocus is one of those poets.
Which means the herald placed the guitar in Femios' hands and he started to sing.
Sir?
Was Femios a dj?
I asked you to stop being funny, miss.
But you said he took the guitar and started singing.
Sit down, miss!
Does anyone know what Homer was?
Sir!
May I go out?
You may!
You may go again, that is.
And it would be best if you settled down there and did not return.
Why?
Is it so bad?
I don't understand.
Get out and don't come back.
As if I cared!
What were we saying?
Homer came from Ionia in Asia Minor.
Seven cities claim to be his birthplace.
It's more likely, however, that he was born in Smyrna.
- Sir?
- Yes.
Was Homer from Smyrna?
Listen to me, girl!
All of you listen well!
It's your right not to want to learn.
But it's your obligation to know how to behave.
I might forgive negligence.
In any case, you are not sharp enough.
I cannot get mad with a hen unable to learn mathematics so I cannot get mad at you for not understanding Homer.
But I am determined to crash insolence!
And I like it that the first thing I learnt about you is that you come from wealthy and well-known families.
- Get up.
- Who, me?
Yes, you.
Get up.
Admire a girl from a well-known family.
Tell me, girl, until you were sent to school... by your noble mother and wealthy father... didn't they teach you at least the basic manners that a person must employ when among others?
Sit down.
You asked me earlier if I'm teaching for the first time.
Yes!
It's the first time I teach girls from wealthy families.
But I have taught children from poor and humble families.
I've taught in night schools children who work for a living.
Children who work as porters and carry the goods to your homes.
All those things your fathers order.
Those children who live in damp and dark basements... those pale children who study on crates by candle light... they have good manners that you in your luxurious homes failed to learn.
Wait!
Sit down, all of you.
I have one more thing to say.
If you want us to get along well... like I do because I am here to teach you a few things... and not waste my time on the silliness you prefer... for us to get along well, you must change tactics, habits... and above all manners!
Take advantage of the opportunity you are given... to learn in this year what you haven't learnt in the 12 years you wasted at school to no avail.
It will be to your benefit to learn a few things... that will help you tomorrow not to seem ridiculous when you are out in the world.
Go now.
- Sir?
- Yes!
What shall we study for tomorrow?
You, in particular, will study rules of proper behaviour.
- I only wanted...
- Go now, child.
- What did he tell you?
- I'll take care of him, you'll see.
- Did you say anything, child?
- No, I only growled.
I growl at breaks.
Don't I have that right?
Of course, you do.
It's your right and your obligation to remember your mother tongue from time to time.
I told you from the start we won't have a good time with him.
Don't worry, he won't be here for long.
Tell you daddy to talk to the Principal.
I know what I'll do.
- How did it go, Mr. Floras?
- It went well, Principal.
I see you are safe and sound.
And sound, most assuredly.
What did you think of the young monsters?
- Like you said, monsters.
- Monsters!
But we'll tame them.
We'll tame them, most assuredly.
- By the way, this Papastavrou...
- Oh, yes, Liza Papastavrou.
- What sort of girl is she?
- Why?
Did anything happen?
No, I'm just asking.
She's a tad lively.
Lively, most assuredly.
But she's from a very good and very wealthy family.
She's Themistocles Papastavrou's daughter.
The ship owner's.
Very, very wealthy.
Themistocles' daughter but a tad lively, as we said.
Take it easy on her.
- Take what easy?
- Take it easy on her.
Her father is a wonderful man.
And very useful.
Our college owes him a lot.
Take it easy on her.
Quiet, girls.
Quiet.
Shame on you!
Do you have any cigarettes?
- They're in my bad.
- Fetch them then.
- Where will you be?
- In the yard.
Excuse me, I didn't know you were here.
That's all right, miss.
- May I take something from my bag?
- Of course.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
Bon appetit.
Thank you.
I dare not offer you anything because my meal includes certain things you must be unfamiliar with.
Unfamiliar with olives?
No way.
The olives are not Homer.
- But Homer, eh?
- Yes, darn him.
He's a meanie.
Go figure.
It's not like that, a little attention and study makes it simpler.
- I'm sorry, I interrupted you.
- That's all right, miss.
- May I?
- What is that?
Some chocolate to get on your good graces.
I know you haven't taken kindly to me.
- What gave you that idea?
- You've had it for me all morning.
Get up, sit down.
Admire her.
Homer, Pallas, Rex.
You know something?
You're not as mean as you want to appear.
Oh, no, no.
I'm very, very mean.
Even more than I seem to be.
Nah, deep down you're very, very nice.
- You really think so?
- But you're very strict.
And very serious.
More than you should be.
And you don't tie the knot very well. lt should be tighter.
There, that's better and you're so cute.
The Principal, please.
- This is Mrs. Papastavrou.
- Oh, it's you Mrs. Papastavrou.
My respects, ma'am.
Yes, I hired him yesterday.
Floras, Panos Floras.
You don't say?
She returned home feverish.
And I don't if her ear hasn't been affected.
So he hit her so hard!
The poor thing.
This is grounds even for filing a suit.
Yes, Mrs. Papastavrou, don't worry at all.
I'll deal with him the way he deserves.
And she's so charming, well mannered, well behaved.
No, it's not a compiment.
Yes, Mrs. Papastavrou.
It will be a great honour.
I'll be waiting for you.
My respects to Mr. Themistocles, most assuredly.
See what happens after a slap, Mr. Makridakis?
Why, what happened?
- What happened?
- This Floras person.
He slapped the Papastavrou girl.
And he slapped her so hard she appears to be feverish.
Her own mother just informed me about it.
Don't believe that.
Spoilts brats' mothers are usually their best allies.
Come now, Mr. Makridakis!
What are you talking about!
I am most upset!
Whoever heard of such a thing!
A nobody like Floras to strike a Papastavrou!
Themistocles Papastavrou's daughter, most assuredly.
I believe Themistocles' daughter had the slap coming.
- That's not right, Mr...
- Makridakis!
It's not his fault.
It's mainly mine for entrusting a flippant lout with the post of Greek teacher.
Allow me to disagree.
Mr. Floras is anything but a flippant lout.
Mr. Floras is a teacher with excellent qualifications... who is entirely aware of his mission and who knows his job very well.
If you think a teacher's job is to hit children in his care until they faint, you are mistaken, sir!
- Very much mistaken, Mr...
- Makridakis!
- They're horrible.
- These are monsters.
Whatever you may think a slap is a teacher's last but most convincing argument.
I never saw you slap any of the students!
You haven't because I respect your beliefs.
That does not mean that I consider them correct.
- Come in!
- Please, sir.
- Let me explain!
- Move or I'll wring your neck!
Move, I say!
- Please, listen to me!
- Shut up!
- Please, Mr. Gkikas.
- I'll wring your neck!
- What is this time, Lazarou?
- Nothing, sir.
- What did she do to you, Mr. Gkikas?
- She turned me into fireworks.
- Fireworks... what?
- Fireworks, I say!
She set me on fire!
I stood with my back turned, blowing my whistle for the class I was surrounded by flames.
I looked and I was on fire!
I was a burnt offering!
What flames were those?
She stuck a newspaper on my back and set it on fire.
She tried to cook me like a herring, do you understand?
And what upsets me most, Principal, is my suit.
It's a brand new suit.
I bought it the year before last!
Tomorrow you'll bring Mr. Gkikas 100 verses of the Iliad.
What will I do with 100 verses?
She should bring me some cloth so I can have a new suit.
Plain fabric or striped that makes you look taller?
Get the hell out of here!
Go, Lazarou and tomorrow come with your guardian.
Allow me to tell you, sir that such expressions do not befit a teacher.
I'm up to here, Principal!
Do you understand what they did?
They tried to burn me alive, like Athanassios Diakos!
- The dear colleague is right.
- But they're children!
And children are lively.
What can we do?
- Kill them.
- Yes, kill them.
Oh, Herod, may you rest in peace!
- You knew what you were doing!
- You are out of line, Mr...
A brand new suit!
Look, it's only three years old!
Oh, it's you, Mr. Floras!
Come in.
Hand over the name list and then go to the accounting department to receive payment for the hours you have taught.
- Why, Principal?
- You are fired, Mr. Floras.
I am fired?
- Why, if I may ask?
- Because you are heavy handed.
I do not understand.
We could also have applied the method that you know but this is not a night school, Mr. Floras.
And it's not easy to raise a hand on a Papastavrou daughter.
Themistocles' daughter, most assuredly.
- God bless you, son.
- First of all, sir...
I do not separate schools in categories public or luxury schools.
To me all students are equal...
What does "Papastavrou's daughter" mean?
She's a student like the daughter of any poor employee.
A teacher's desk, Principal, should be high enough... so that he will be unable to tell apart whose daughter each student is.
I am used to teaching not being taught, sir.
You are too young and I won't be offended.
But you forgot what I stressed the first moment you arrived.
The college that I've had the honour to run for 15 years... is a business with great expenses and not a place for young teachers to experiment.
That is the misunderstanding.
I came here to work in a school and not in a business.
If I wanted "business" I could have found others, more lucrative ones.
Believe me, I am relieved to leave your establishment.
I'd rather be unemployed than a toy... that the hands of spoilt little girls that I truly pity... since their fathers' fortune and your business have condemned them to a life of ignorance.
Since the certificate you will sell them tomorrow represents absolutely nothing!
That is enough, Mr. Floras.
I'd rather you had a few words of sympathy for your victim.
- My victim, you said?
- Yes, your victim.
Who has fallen ill from your brutal slaps.
What are you talking about?
Who's ill?
Whom have I hit?
- Papastavrou!
- I hit her?
- Do you deny that?
- I only slapped her.
And a mere slap caused all she's suffering?
- What's wrong with her?
- She ran a temperature all night.
And her ear... yes.
Come in, child.
Good morning, Mrs. Papastavrou.
How are you, child?
Better?
Who is this Floras?
- It's me, ma'am.
- Oh, you.
This way, Mrs. Papastavrou.
Come into my office.
You too, dear.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
- You come too, Mr. Floras.
- What for?
Please.
Please, most assuredly.
I think my presence is totally needless.
Don't bother him, please.
Can't you see he can barely look me in the eye?
Why wouldn't I look you in the eye?
Perhaps because of what you said about me in front of the class.
- About you?
- Yes, I've heard everything.
You made her stand in the corner and called her father names and called me names, too.
Isn't that right, Liza?
Yes, it is.
I called your parents names?
Yes, you did.
Look me in the eyes, Liza and say that again.
Yes, you did!
What can I say, child.
I truly pity you.
You should pity yourself, if there's anyone to be pitied.
Don't pity her.
She's Papastavrou's daughter.
- Themistocles'!
- I've heard that several times.
No matter how many I hear it I won't change my opinion on your daughter's upbringing.
- Mr. Floras!
Please, sit, ma'am.
- Great!
I see that Mr. Floras thinks nothing of being rude to our face.
If I were ever to be rude to anyone, ma'am rest assured I would do it like you said, to their face!
Mr. Floras!
Mr. Floras is very combative!
Will you beat us, too?
Beat you, too?
Who else have I beaten, then?
- Have I beaten you?
- Yes.
Didn't you slap me with all your might?
- Oh, right.
With all my might!
- Yes, like that!
And I still don't understand why you did that.
- Why did you do it, Mr. Floras?
- Yes, why did you?
- What did she do to you?
- Why?
- She knows.
- I know nothing.
I only know that I felt dizzy.
And for 30 minutes I kept seeing green, red and yellow butterflies!
And yellow?
Poor you!
- Is that how hard I hit her?
- Yes, that's right.
Liza?
Shame on you, girl.
It's a pity that a charming girl like you will be wasted and end up being miserable.
Mr. Floras, a Papastavrou daughter will never be miserable!
Themistocles' daughter, that is!
Ma'am, no matter how great fortunes are they never ensure happiness.
Your girl is definitely on her way to becoming miserable.
And the worst thing is she'll make others miserable, too.
Those who will be around her.
Excuse me, Principal.
- Mr. Floras is most rude!
- Most rude!
Don't worry, I've settled the matter properly.
- What do you mean?
- I fired him!
You fired him?
And must stress that your heroic gesture... will remain a shining example for the teachers of this college... who...
I hope my solution is satisfactory, Mrs. Papastavrou.
And I believe that this unfortunate incident is now considered closed.
Of course.
Excuse me for troubling you, sir.
Excuse me for anything untoward that happened here.
Here, most assuredly.
You will remain for your lessons.
Goodbye and my respects to Mr. Themistocles.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom, you blew it!
Didn't you hear what "most assuredly" said?
- He fired him.
- Wasn't that what we wanted?
I'm sorry, but it wasn't.
Didn't you bring me here for Floras to be punished?
Punished, not fired.
What can I do?
That's how the Principal punished him.
- Mom, you should talk to him.
- To whom?
- To the Principal.
- And tell him what?
- To keep him.
- How can I do that?
He'll think I'm mad and he'll be right!
It's not fair, I'm telling you!
It's a pity for a poor man to lose his job because you thought of telling all those lies!
Lies?
What lies?
Did I run a temperature last night?
Did I?
You're a good one!
Didn't you ask me to tell him that?
And if I told you to jump off a cliff, would you do it?
You're running mad, child!
Let me go!
Mom!
- What now?
- We can't leave it like this!
I'll be eaten away by remorse.
Do you want that?
- Did he beat you or not?
- Beat me?
He barely slapped me.
It was more like a caress.
- You didn't say that yesterday.
- I was upset, that's why.
I'm a kid and I was upset.
Well, I won't make a fool of myself for you.
Mr. Papastavrou, please.
Daddy?
It's Liza.
Listen, daddy.
I have a favour to ask of you.
No, no, it won't cost you anything.
Just a phonecall.
Without meaning to, I was the reason a teacher was fired today.
Oh, come on!
I'll explain everything this evening.
Well, he slapped me and the Principal fired him.
What?
No, it was my fault.
And now I feel guilty.
Yes, call the Principal and tell him to keep him.
Yes, daddy!
Panos Floras.
Oh, middle-aged. 50, 40, 35, 28...
Will you do it?
No, call him now!
I'll hang up and then you call him at once.
You do know the number, right?
I'll ask him to come here.
Right away.
Thank you so much, daddy!
- What happened, Mr. Floras?
- Nothing.
A disagreement with the estabishment.
Sir, there's a phone call for you.
- I am having a lesson.
I- lt's urgent!
Excuse me, dear children.
Here you are, Mr. Floras.
Get the Principal's signature and return it to us.
Hello?
There's no one on the line.
- It was ringing, just now.
- Who was it?
- I don't know, it was ringing.
- You said it was urgent.
- Who said that?
- Nobody told me that.
I realised it was from the ringing.
- It sounded urgent.
- You must have been mistaken.
- It's going to ring again!
- Why should it ring?
Very agitatedly.
Here, listen!
- It's ringing!
- What is?
Hello?
Yes, speaking.
Mr. Papastavrou?
Mr. Themistocles?
My regards, sir.
Excuse me a moment, please.
Close the door, child.
Yes, Mr. Papastavrou.
Yes, Floras.
Panos Floras.
The incident was settled.
I fired him.
Your wife was here not long ago.
What?
What do you mean reverse my decision?
Floras should stay?
I don't understand.
I should congratulate him?
For slapping your daughter?
Of course, that is a pedagogic method.
I think he's right here.
Excuse me for a moment.
Come in, Mr. Floras.
Mr. Papastavrou wants to talk to you.
I don't think Mr. Papastavrou and I have anything to talk about.
Please, let's not play games.
It's Mr. Themistocles!
Thank you so much, daddy!
Hello?
Mr. Papastavrou, I'll put you through to Mr. Floras.
- I don't think...
- Mr. Themistocles.
Hello?
Yes, Floras.
Yes, I did slap your daughter.
And I'm sorry I slapped her only once.
- Are you making fun of me?
- No!
I think your wife has a different opinion.
Oh, no.
That slap falls into your jurisdiction.
Yes, thank you.
Here is the Principal.
Yes, Mr. Themistocles.
Agreed, most assuredly.
Mr. Themistocles!
- Go to your classroom.
- Yes, sir.
That's it then.
Could you please sign this?
What's that?
But I think the matter has been settled.
After Mr. Papastavrou's call.
I mean we can work together if, of course, you too...
If am to remain, I will do so on one condition.
- Accepted.
- But you don't know what it is.
It's accepted, my dear sir.
I'll do my work the way I see fit.
We are not going to disagree on that point, my dear Mr. Floras.
Your views coincide with Mr. Papastavrou's views.
Mr. Papastavrou's views coincide with mine.
Therefore, since two views coincide with a third they must coincide, too, most assuredly.
Now, you will excuse me because I've left my class at the mercy of the Lord and the bell is about to ring.
I saw him looking so sad that I felt sorry for him!
Mostly because as he was down in the dumps he looked like the late James Dean, may he rest in peace!
- He does look like him.
- Just a passing resemblance.
Passing resemblance?
When he's sad, he's a look alike.
Everything is settled.
I called daddy and they're keeping him.
- What a bloomer!
- Why?
A big bloomer.
Now he's going to be even meaner, mark my words.
How could he do that now his wings have been clipped?
There he is.
Mr. Floras, will we have ancient Greek or history first tomorrow?
Our first lesson is History.
- Mr. Floras?
- What is it?
- May I talk to you?
- No.
Because I believe we have nothing to talk about.
- You don't know what I want to say.
- Nor do I want to find out.
But I want to ask you something about the lesson.
- In the classroom, then.
- Oh!
- Don't be impertinent, Papastavrou...
- Why not?
Because you'll see red, green and yellow butterflies again.
Only this time they'll be accompanied by blue ones.
Oh, really?
That's all right.
I'll show you!
Come here, Papastavrou.
What does that mean?
Is that a threat?
- Yes, it is a threat!
- There you are then!
Keep your hands to yourself or I'll do it for you!
- Quiet, rude girl!
- Did you hear what I said?
- Quiet, or you'll get another one!
- Oh, really?
Let's see you dare!
There you are then!
What's going on here?
What's going on, most assuredly?
He hit me again, sir!
He hit you again?
Why?
What did she do, Mr. Floras?
- She was rude, sir.
- Rude?
What's going on here?
You shut up!
- Why?
- Because of this!
- Was it a strong one?
- Are you kidding?
I can barely hear from one ear.
Don't worry, soon you won't be able to hear from both ears.
- What?
- You'll be deaf from both ears!
What has befallen us, girls?
For the past two months slaps come flying out of nowhere.
It's ever since Floras came here.
He was the disastrous one.
I told from the start.
Yes, we were just fine before he came here.
Ever since Papastavrou got slapped, they all got jealous.
Even "most assuredly" did it.
He nearly pulled my ear off.
- Were you expecting that?
- It's all Floras' fault.
But I'll deal with him on the excursion.
You will board the coaches in an orderly fashion.
The 7th and 8th grade will board the third coach.
The 6th on the second and the 5th on the first.
Without screaming and a fuss or else slaps will start flying around.
Ready to board.
Forward, march.
Mr. Floras and I will be on the 8th and 7th grade's coach.
Mr. Mavromatis, you and Mr. Makridakis on the 6th's.
- You and Mr. Gkikas on the 5th's.
- We are ready to depart.
What's going on there?
Papastavrou is acting.
Papastavrou!
- What's going on, Mr...
- Gkikas!
They are having fun, dancing, singing, jumping around.
- That's as it should be.
- Should one of us...
Oh, no, we can check them from right here.
Careful, Anagnostopoulou!
What are you doing there?
I think I'll have a look around, Principal.
Do so, Mr. Floras.
- A great young man.
- Indeed.
When he arrived at the college everything was a mess.
You must admit that, sir.
I compare him to Byzantine emperor Vasilios Voulgaroktonos.
You are exaggerating, Mr. Gkikas.
Exaggerating, most assuredly.
Anastasatou, what are you doing there?
Why are you carving on the poor tree?
- I'm sorry, Mr. Floras.
- It's a shame.
- What foolishness is that?
- What?
The way you've cut the rope anyone who might sit, will fall.
- That's what I want.
- I don't understand.
It's simple.
When Floras comes this way and he will we'll stop him.
"Oh, Mr. Floras, come this way!"
What can we offer you?
And we'll have him sitting on the swing.
And when we do, then...
God is great.
He might break a leg, he might break an arm.
He might even break his head and leave us alone!
Oh, no, that's not funny.
- What did you say?
- That's not funny.
Then don't laugh.
We will!
If he should break an arm and have a cast then we'll laugh ourselves silly.
I'm not going to let you laugh yourselves silly in that particular way.
- Oh, what do you mean?
- Don't worry.
Papastavrou has a very serious reason for not wanting Floras hurt.
You see, he does look like James Dean.
- I don't understand, Poppy.
- I do understand you, though.
We all understand more or less, you see.
Alexiou, bite your tongue!
You do look proper for a teacher!
Papastavrou, Alexiou!
What is all this?
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?
How can seniors, ladies, fight like street urchins?
What happened, anyway.
Shame on you!
What happened, Papastavrou?
What happened, Alexiou?
- She hit me.
- Who did?
Papastavrou?
- Why?
- How should I know?
Why did you hit her, Papastavrou?
- What happened, Alexiou?
- I don't know, Mr. Floras.
We were just sitting there and she came at me.
- Just like that?
- Yes, like that.
How could I believe that?
She must have said something.
- You must have said something.
- No, nothing.
I didn't say anything to her.
- Nothing?
- Nothing.
- Were you here, Xanthopoulou?
- Come again?
- Were you here?
- Yes, I was right here.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
I was talking to Giadikiaroglou at the time.
And I suddenly saw Papastavrou and Alexiou fighting.
- And you, Giadikiaroglou?
- Didn't Xanthopoulou just tell you?
We were talking, we didn't see anything.
- And you, Polychronopoulou?
- I beg your pardon?
I wasn't paying attention either.
I was watching Xanthopoulou who was talking to Giadikiaroglou.
Right, girls?
- Didn't you notice anything, Lazarou.
- No, sir.
I was watching Polychronopoulou who was watching Xanthopoulou who was talking to Giadikiaroglou.
What happened?
They had a fight, Mr. Floras?
- Nothing, Mr. Gkikas.
- Oh, good.
What did Alexiou tell you to make you so mad?
- Nothing.
- Then why did you attack her?
- No reason.
- Just like that?
- Yes, just like that.
- And you want me to believe that?
I don't know.
Shut up!
- Oh, love unconquered in battle!
- Come, please, be quiet.
It's a great choral part.
If not the greatest of all that great tragic poet of antiquity has written.
Could anyone translate it?
It's simple and easy.
Papastavrou can.
Papastavrou.
Come on, then.
Papastavrou should know this very well.
Why hesitate?
Come on.
Please read the ancient text, but verse by verse.
Love unconquered in battle.
What's all this?
Quiet, please.
- So, love unconquered in battle.
- Right.
- Which means?
- That love cannot be beaten in battle.
Exactly, invincible love.
Quiet, please.
Quiet, Giadikiaroglou!
Continue.
Love that makes its own anything it touches...
- Which means?
- It means, love making everything it touches belong to it.
Love that spends its evening on tender girls' cheeks.
Good, go on.
I can't, Mr. Floras.
Quiet!
- What's the matter, Papastavrou?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
You're crying.
- I'm not, who said I am?
- Nobody told me, I can see it.
- I don't know what you see, I'm not!
All right, you're not crying.
Then dry your eyes and go outside.
Please, give it to me.
If I'm not mistaken, this letter is mine.
It belongs to me.
It says, Mr. Panos Floras.
I don't know what it says, it's not your letter.
Have you received it?
Has it been stamped, posted?
Please, give it to me.
- Shouldn't I open it?
- No!
Why not?
Because if you do, I'll see green, red and yellow butterflies again.
All right then, take it.
- There goes this year.
- Time really does fly.
It flies, most assuredly.
I barely realised how this year passed.
It's like yesterday that schools opened, almond-trees bloomed and now it's time for the exams.
Time flew by.
How are you thinking of spending your holidays, Mr...
With tutorials, Principal.
Unfortunately, for us rest is an inexcusable luxury.
And you, Mr. Gkikas?
Where will you spend the holidays?
By the Omonia Square fountain.
On the corner of 3rd September street to be cooled by the canted fountain.
Everything ready, Mr. Floras?
- Aren't there any more?
- No, these are the last class results.
- All the rest have been posted.
- Have you checked them?
Yes, only a stamp is missing.
You can check them, too.
It's enough that you did.
- The last class results?
- Yes, here they are.
- To be posted now?
- We did tell them today.
Some are already waiting outside.
I'll be right back.
Girls, the last class results are ready.
Mr. Floras!
Why isn't my name here?
Because you, Alexiou, will drop by in September and tell us all again.
And you are better than you were now your name will be there, too.
But I'll have forgotten everything until September.
That's your own fault.
Did you do it, Liza?
I don't know!
Here it is!
I did it!
Oh, I did it!
Mr. Floras, I passed!
I already knew that, miss.
True.
You prepare the results, so you know about them.
But...
I wanted to tell you...
Goodbye.
Mr. Floras!
- Are you glad I passed?
- Of course I am.
I'm just saying that because I was a little thick.
See what happens if you put your mind to it!
Put your mind...
Goodbye.
Mr. Floras.
What I mean to say...
Now that I've passed, I won't be coming back to school.
Naturally.
That's what I wanted to say.
I...
- I... you...
- Goodbye.
Mr. Floras!
Oh, so you are that middle- aged Mr. Floras?
- Middle- aged?
- I mean you are Mr. Floras who slaps girls around.
- Mr. Papastavrou, I wanted...
No, no, I'm not blaming you.
I believe what they say.
Spare the rod and spoil the child.
- Get in, Mr. Floras.
- But...
We'll have the opportunity to talk about a few things on the way.
- Concerning Liza.
- Liza?
She'll sit the university exams.
I'd like you to tutor her.
And if a slap is necessary...
I'll be glad to tutor Liza, on one condition, though.
- Accepted.
- But you haven't heard it yet.
It doesn't matter.
Does it, daddy?
I believe Mr. Floras should tutor us all.
Perhaps your method of putting the college in order might be used to bring some order and discipline in my house.
- I don't understand.
- Get in, we'll talk about it.
One, two, three!
Love, unconquered in a war!
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Alfred Hitchcock Presents.
I should explain.
I came down with a cold.
The broken leg was a later development.
These nurses can become quite forceful at times.
The National Safety Council has asked that I remind you that most accidents occur in the home.
Therefore, this might be a very good place to avoid.
If you must be there, now would be an excellent time to check for those items that might be lying around or waiting to produce accidents.
Roller skates at the bottom of the stairs, poorly insulated wires near the bathtub, ground glass in the sugar bowl, arsenic in the coffee.
Little things which, if you don't find, you may regret for the rest of your life.
So much for accidents.
Now we come to the intentional part of our program.
Yes.
Hey, there, mister, you've got my place there.
I come around here every day at noon, 12:00 sharp.
And I sit right there on that log, my back to this piling.
Yes.
Matter of fact is, I'm two minutes late now.
Can you beat that?
I'm 93, and I haven't been more than two minutes late on any appointment I've ever had.
Time is a science.
And if you make good use of it, it'll double your life.
Yes, sir.
The only reason I'm late now, I had to find my pills.
Oh, oh.
Oh, yeah.
Yes, I got them right here.
You ever take these?
No, I never have.
Greatest little old pill in the world.
Something new.
They call it Think-Ease.
Well, here goes.
Yes, sir, it's a great life if you don't weaken.
Better get your line in the water, there's a big one right there.
Huh, where?
Right there!
I don't see it.
It's going under the pier.
Under the pier?
Now do you see him?
No.
You will.
Mr. Treadwell, please.
Mr. Bunce calling.
This is a recording.
Recent scientific discoveries prove that speech is the most common carrier of the common cold.
Therefore, in the interest of public health, we in this office are doing all we can to eliminate speech.
Well, I do have to say a little something.
Turn to your right, please, and state your business directly to the telecam, holding up any identification you have simultaneously.
State your business, please, to the telecam.
Time is pressing.
Well...
I'm J.J. Bunce.
I'm here to see Mr. Treadwell.
Uh...
I do have a card here somewhere.
I'm from the SEG.
State your business, please.
You have not stated your business clearly.
I'm J.J. Bunce from the SEG.
Here to see Mr. Treadwell.
And I do have a card.
You have not stated your business clearly.
Look, will you just let me see the guy?
It's a personal matter.
In fact, you might say it's real intimate.
You have stated your business clearly.
Go through the double doors to the first door on your left.
It's about time.
We're trying not to give you a disease.
Why should you give us one?
Walk right in.
You are welcome.
Mr. Treadwell.
Mr. Bunce.
I'm sorry, I can't shake hands with you, one of the rules of our firm.
We've made a number of surveys and we've found that whenever there is human contact, there is contamination.
Now, what is this intimate matter?
Bunce, Society for Experimental Gerontology.
Oh?
You've heard of us?
No.
Mr. Treadwell, if you're having this taped, I'd advise you to cut it off.
Sit down, Mr. Bunce.
I'd like to give you a rough idea of the work we're doing.
Society for Experimental Gerontology.
You're collecting money for a hospital, Mr. Bunce?
Please, Mr. Treadwell, don't confuse gerontology with geriatrics.
Oh?
Both words have the same Greek root geras, meaning old.
Whereas geriatrics deals with diseases of the age, gerontology deals with the social problems arising out of age, especially extreme age.
And I may add, sir, that the SEG is the most consecrated, the most dedicated organization that I know of.
You seem to be something of a crusader, Mr. Bunce.
Sir, our outfit is the only one that's facing up to the situation, the most tragic situation facing our modern society!
Well, if you let me speak to my secretary, I'll have her make you out a check.
We're not after money, Mr. Treadwell.
No?
Our outfit believes in helping you first.
Helping me?
Then if you agree that you have been helped, then you pay the fee.
Mr. Bunce, I'm in my 50s.
The way people are living today, I really don't see how you can help me.
Mr. Treadwell, I have been studying your case for several months, and believe you me you are a serious case.
I've never been a serious case of anything in my life, Mr. Bunce.
John Treadwell, college graduate, lives in the Elysian Fields, New Jersey.
Likes sailing, owns own home, nine years of mortgage payments due.
Refrigerator paid for.
Pool's not paid for.
Mother-in-law's face-lifting not yet paid for...
Where did you get this?
Late model car, 18 monthly payments yet to be made.
Children's education not yet paid for.
Otherwise, happily married for 27 years.
Two teenage children, one older son and a daughter-in-law.
Any errors, Mr. Treadwell?
Mr. Bunce, I have a great deal to do.
You missed the last paragraph, Mr. Treadwell.
It deals with your mother-in-law, aged 82.
What about her?
She is your problem, Mr. Treadwell.
When your son married and moved out, she moved in.
She lives with you day and night.
And she's driving you mad!
Mr. Bunce...
Mr. Treadwell, according to the latest gerontological statistical tables, your mother-in-law should live, barring accident,
another 32 years, nine months and six days.
32 years, nine months and six days?
I beg your pardon, seven days.
That is, of course, barring accident.
What do you mean?
Well, an old lady might climb up a stepladder, she might slip in the bathtub, tumble off a pier.
I always say, Mr. Treadwell, that recognizing that we have a problem is the first step towards solution.
Now, when you want action, just let me know.
Mr. Bunce.
I will not pretend I'm in love with my mother-in-law, but if you are suggesting that I have her done away with, that is the most fiendish thing I've ever heard of.
I am a man of principle, a religious man!
I'm sorry you got personal, Mr. Treadwell.
I was hoping to keep this...
Get out.
My card's on your desk, Mr. Treadwell.
I'll be expecting your call.
We thank Thee for our many privileges.
We thank Thee for the comfort of our home...
For the comfort of our home.
We thank Thee for the nourishment of our food.
We thank Thee for one another.
Lord, grant us patience in times of tribulation, grant us strength...
Yes, Mother?
Who the heck turned off my intercom?
We turned it off, Mother, because we were just saying grace.
My TVset's busted.
I want you to come up here and fix it.
Now!
Mother, he can't come now, we're right in the middle of grace.
Why did he have to buy me such a cheap set then?
I will come, Mother, just as soon as we have finished grace.
Hurry up, or I'll miss the Roller Derby.
Our Father, who art in space...
If you'll excuse me, dear?
I think I'd better fix her television set.
Never mind.
I'll serve.
You know what I'd do?
I'd get rid of her!
I'd just get rid of her!
Darling.
We all get old sometime.
Children, it's getting late, you should get to bed.
I got to finish this, it's my project.
Boy, people are stupid.
Stupider than you?
Look at this crate. 20 years ago they thought it was the greatest.
I'm trying to write.
Can you imagine taking four and a half hours across the country?
How slow can you get?
I said I'm trying to write.
Oh, shut up.
Darling, would you mind very much not humming?
Yes, of course, I'm sorry.
What's that you're looking at?
It's a graph of the population growth according to increased age.
It's rather astounding.
Darling, is anything the matter?
You seem so sad.
Just thinking.
If you'll excuse me, dear, I believe I'll turn in.
Daddy, if you're worried about something, why don't you take a Think-Ease?
I don't need to think ease, dear, I need to think hard.
And would you mind turning off that music?
But Daddy, it's soothing.
Yeah, Dad, don't you know that studies prove...
I said turn it off!
But, John!
The world needs silence.
Silence, like the outside of space.
Just imagine how quiet it must be beyond the last star, hmm?
All right, I say let us live in that silence, and no music.
And start thinking about the meaning of life.
Yes, and the meaning of death, too.
Because death has a meaning.
And believe you me, it has a function.
Boy, did he goof off.
Maybe he's fallen in love, or something.
Just be quiet, will you?
Well, remember three years ago when he went off skiing with his secretary?
He got mad then, too.
Now, why the heck did you do that?
It's too loud, Mother.
You won't be able to get away with this for very long, son.
Just as soon as my leg's mended, I'm gonna be up and about.
Mother...
My, but you're getting a paunch.
I've been sitting in this chair for eight weeks and I look better than you do.
Mother, the noise is not good for you.
Don't you worry.
I'm going to live to be well over 100, no thanks to you.
Fine.
But could you just manage to be a little more quiet about it?
Who wants to be quiet?
You'll be quiet a long time in your grave.
Oh, you young people, you don't know how to live.
You're too solemn.
You don't enjoy life.
Did you do your setting-up exercises this morning?
No, I did not.
You look like a rumpled pillow!
You know, things are not the same as when I was a girl.
Thank goodness they're not.
Change, change, that's the great thing, that's the secret of life.
Used to be we lived to be 75 or 80.
Now the life span's gone up to 125 and no end in sight.
So you just as well get used to me and stop turning off my intercom!
Good morning, Mr. Treadwell, we hope your work day will be...
Oh, shut up!
Come in, Mr. Bunce.
Well, Mr. Treadwell, are you with us?
And even if you aren't with us, I trust you won't turn against us.
You know the attorney general himself is over 80 years old.
One report about us and we're liable to end up in the Atomic Energy Chamber.
Don't worry.
Dear Mr. Treadwell, you still seem to have some doubts.
My dear sir, the tragic situation is that by the miracles of science by sheer number, the old have come into power.
They have the votes.
Mr. Bunce, you don't have to convince me on theoretical grounds.
Then on what grounds?
The point is, I detest my mother-in-law so much,
I have to make sure that I'm joining your movement out of idealism, and not through personal pleasure.
Yes, I see what you mean.
And have you decided?
How would you do it?
You'll have to leave that up to me.
Probably some household accident.
What if you bungle it?
How could I bungle it?
I know her well, I know her habits.
You know her?
How do you think I got all that information about you, Mr. Treadwell?
I meet her in the park every Sunday after you leave her there.
No, I couldn't possibly tell you how I'm going to do it, Mr. Treadwell.
You might feel some sense of guilt.
Could you at least tell me when it's going to happen?
How about Sunday morning?
You all go to church, and she goes to the park because she hates the preacher.
Yes, I rather think Sunday morning might be excellent.
That is, if I have your consent?
It's a deal.
Speaking of deals, Mr. Treadwell.
What's this?
In signing a pledge to our organization, Mr. Treadwell, you will be performing one of the most praiseworthy acts of your life.
"I hereby promise to pay you $2,000."
You never said anything about money like this.
The occasion has never arisen before, Mr. Treadwell.
But may I point out that a donation to a charitable organization such as ours...
Is, of course, tax deductable.
Where's Daddy?
He's going to be late for church.
I suppose he's still dressing.
No, he went out.
Oh?
Yeah, he pushed Grandma to the park.
My, what a beautiful morning.
Darling, you aren't even dressed.
You'll be late for church.
I'm not going.
You're not going?
Why, John, you haven't missed church in 20 years.
I'm not going.
Do you mind if I ask why?
I'm going fishing.
You're what?
Don't look so alarmed.
But, Daddy, you'll get arrested.
Don't you know they've passed a new law, no fishing on Sunday?
Who passed it?
Just last week, the League for Elderly Democracy passed it.
That's right, and now everyone has to go to church.
But Grandma doesn't go to church.
That's because she has a health certificate!
If you're old enough you can get a health certificate and you don't have to go.
That's why there is no one on the streets Sunday morning.
Ah-hah!
I hadn't noticed that.
Well, of course not, you've always been in church.
Doesn't matter.
It's decided, I'm going fishing.
Really, Daddy?
Don't all look so alarmed!
You don't have to call a lawyer and have me committed.
I'm going to eat a big stack of fresh, fluffy pancakes drowned in golden sparkling syrup.
And then, I'm going fishing!
Well, children, we'll go to church.
It is called the Blessington Method.
After our founder, Mr. Ralph Blessington.
He saw the problem arising way back in the '60s.
Young man, I don't know what you're talking about, but I like your voice.
Of course, all forms of life grow, flower, fail and fall.
It's a soothing voice.
Death is the compost of life.
Now what is more wonderful for this spring's flowers than last year's rotten leaves?
Death is built right into the universe for the enrichment of life.
What do you suppose would happen if all the fish in the ocean suddenly had the power not to die?
Why, in two weeks time the ocean would be so choked with fish there wouldn't be enough water left, and all fish would die.
So, when man in his infinite mischief upsets the order of things, infinite mischief is bound to result.
Young man, I don't quite know what you're saying, but I know I don't like it.
Turn me around!
Mr. Treadwell.
It's done, death by accidental submersion.
Oh, dear.
Don't feel too badly, Mr. Treadwell.
It's in the past.
Forget about it, you must think about the future.
Think about your children.
Now you can have the pleasure of watching them grow, flower into full bloom.
Think about your daughter.
Someday she'll marry.
Yes.
Now can't you picture in your mind's eye that handsome, strong, young son-in-law?
Can't you just feel the warmth of his handclasp as he greets you?
Wait a minute.
Are you trying to tell me that someday somebody from your group will come and give my children ideas?
Honestly, Mr. Treadwell, can you imagine those affectionate and devoted youngsters ever possibly doing you the slightest harm, the slightest harm?
No.
I guess not.
Splendid.
Now you hold onto that thought.
Keep it close to you at all times.
Cherish it.
It will be a great solace to you and a comfort...
To the very end.
The doctor told me I could take the cast off anytime.
But I find I receive much better treatment with it on.
As for Mr. Bunce and Mr. Treadwell, even their advanced society frowned on their activities.
By then, mothers-in-law were most numerous and even more powerful than they are today.
It's something to look forward to, provided you're a mother-in-law.
Now until next time, good night.
In Korea, I was Adjutant of the Glosters when we fought the Chinese at the Battle of the Imjin.
Almost all of us who survived the battle were captured.
The treatment that we received from our captors came as an unpleasant surprise.
We naturally expected that the rules laid down by the Geneva Convention for the treatment of prisoners of war would be observed.
It soon became apparent that the Chinese and North Koreans did not respect any such rules, but used methods designed to degrade us and to break our morale in order to convert us to communism...
for which we were totally unprepared.
We resisted them and they failed.
But we had to learn the hard way.
This film has been made, based on our experiences and supervised by an officer who was with the battalion at that time, so that you may know the practices of possible communist enemies and combat them successfully.
(HAMMERING)
(WIND HOWLS)
(SHOUTS COMMAND OUT)
ADJUTANT: 'This is a prison camp in North Korea.
'The year, 1950.
'Many men of the United Nations' forces had been captured 'after battle with the Chinese and North Koreans.
'But being a prisoner of war of this enemy 'didn't mean that the fight against communism was over.
'It had only just begun.
'This was a different enemy with different ways, 'and resistance was something more than keeping the guards busy.
'It was a matter of trying to keep your mind clear, 'your nerves sound 'and of knowing your friends.
'In communist hands, 'the greatest gift one man can give another is his loyalty.
'Some were able to.
'Others tried... and failed.
'And some didn't even bother to try.
'In these camps, the daily routine was not what any POW expected.
'There was no barbed wire, no machine gun tower, 'no nightly searchlight.
'There was also no Red Cross.
'The enemy said there was no need for them.
'In communist hands, everyone was safe.
'In fact, no one was even referred to as a prisoner of war.'
You are not prisoners.
You are students.
We give you the chance to study and to learn the truth, to show you how your leaders entangle the people in a web of lies.
You have brought what I sent you for, Thornton?
Read it out.
"The whole squad will attend classes at the fixed times
"and pay full attention to study.
"Sabotage of study will be regarded as a serious offence.
"After lectures, the whole squad will be organised for discussion,
"and a record kept of it for reporting to the authorities.
"Only the seriously sick are exempted from attending lectures
"and any other absence or bad behaviour will be punished."
PRISONER:
What about the Geneva Convention?
Who's guilty of sabotaging study?
Confess!
We shall discover the guilty reactionary.
Who's the squad leader?
- Name the guilty one.
- Don't ask me!
Take them back to your hut.
(WIND HOWLS) ...bloody great offensive so we can all get home for Christmas.
They won't get going till spring.
Are we going to be stuck here all winter while the British Army sits on their arses waiting for the flowers to come up?
They'll keep on sending out patrols.
- Shut up!
- They know about them.
- Shut up, I tell you.
- You've no authority here.
I'm still the only NCO in the squad.
Your rank means nothing.
I'm the elected squad leader.
Huh!
Phoney election fixed by them.
- Do you want the job?
- Why don't you two stop arguing?
"Why don't you two stop arguing?"
You're making too much noise for Thornton.
Watch it!
- One day you'll go too far, Ross.
- What do you mean?
How far do you reckon we are from the front line?
200 miles.
That'll be a fat load of good to us, sending out piddling patrols.
It's possible they'll try one more attack before winter clamps down.
I want you to take your patrol to a point overlooking this road here and watch for any signs of a move...
that's 15 miles inside their lines.
Take enough food to last about ten days.
About your route back.
You'll come through A Company's lines here.
- Any questions, sergeant?
- I don't think so, sir.
You must make it your responsibility to see that no letters are carried or photographs or souvenirs or any single thing that an enemy interrogator could make use of if you're captured.
The only thing you must carry is your FPW80, which I hope you've filled in correctly.
If you're taken prisoner, hang on to the top half and have it with you if you escape.
By the way, if you are interrogated, they won't worry about the Geneva Conventions too much.
I've been told the best way to avoid interrogation
- is not to get captured, sir.
- So it is.
And the best time to escape is as soon after capture as possible.
But if you are taken, remember, it's name, rank, number and date of birth.
I hope they'll be satisfied with that.
(PHONE RINGS)
Morrison.
Grid reference?
That's another report of bumping their patrols.
Don't go bulldozing your way through tomorrow night.
- They'll nab you pretty damn quick.
- No, sir.
- Will that be all, sir?
- I think so, sergeant.
My corporal will be in the OP for a couple of days.
He'll guide you to your starting point in A Company's area and see you through the mines.
Good luck, sergeant.
- See you tomorrow night, corporal.
- I'll be waiting for you.
You'd better be.
Their patrols are on the increase.
Could be they're deliberately out to take prisoners.
Maybe.
No one's in for a cushy time who gets captured by the North Koreans.
- They've got experts behind them.
- Chinese?
Yes, and we know who's been teaching them.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
You know why you are here in front of me now?
- Yes.
- Why?
You want to know who called out "Geneva Convention".
- Do you know who it was?
- Yes.
Will you tell me who it was?
I can't.
You've nothing to fear from me, if that's what is holding you back.
This photograph was found on you when you were captured.
Who are these people?
- My parents.
- Are you very fond of them?
Have you heard from your mother and father?
No.
They might send you a letter, and I wouldn't like to withhold it.
Especially as you don't seem to have many people to talk to here.
We know you're not happy in your squad.
You don't fit in.
You need more intelligent people.
Not louts like Ross.
- You didn't call out, did you?
- No!
Of course you didn't.
You've more sense.
Now you can go.
Oh, Thornton.
I'll see about your transfer.
It's a good thing I'm soft-hearted.
I doubt if any of my comrades would have let you off so easily.
(WIND HOWLING)
I hope you kept your mouth bloody shut, Thornton.
You!
Inside.
Sabotage of study is as serious as all the other crimes you war criminals have committed.
You would like to kill me, wouldn't you?
Well, I would like to kill you for all the peace-loving Korean people you have destroyed, all the crops you've burned, all the homes you've bombed.
Do you know how many bombs have fallen on villages?
Ross!
Who called out "Geneva Convention", Ross?
Shut the door.
Was it Thornton?
I think it was Thornton.
In a way, I admire him for his courage.
- Thornton didn't do the calling out.
- Then who did?
I'm not saying, but you can take it from me it wasn't Thornton.
You don't like him very much, do you?
No.
Why?
No reason.
Is he a better soldier than you?
Better soldier?
The... creeping little clerk.
But a clerk can be a key man, especially in, say, the briefing of patrols.
The only patrol he's been on was to the bogs and back!
Do you think the tears of helpless Korean children, whose parents lie bleeding and dying, are any different from any other children?
Yet, in spite of all the misery you brought to this beautiful country, we Chinese can be lenient.
But don't make the mistake of thinking that our leniency is limitless.
Now give me the name of the saboteur who said "Geneva Convention".
There's nothing to say.
Do you realise that all medical supplies and rations will be withheld unless we have the identity of this man?
Yes.
Do you know who said it?
Yes.
Are you prepared to see your friends suffer needlessly?
- No.
- Then tell me who it was.
What happened to Simpson for painting Dreamland...?
You don't ask ME questions.
If you think that Simpson will be punished, you are wrong.
That isn't our solution.
The Chinese policy of leniency will enable Simpson to have the time and the opportunity to realise his error.
This man, too, will be dealt with in the same way.
Now, tell me who it was.
Me.
(WIND HOWLING)
- Any news of Cole?
- No.
Look what they've given us.
I think I smell fish.
You won't find any in there.
They probably dangled a bit in front of it.
What are you looking for in Cole's things?
- Ah, wrap it up!
- Here, this is yours.
- That's not mine.
- Take your feet out the can.
This stuff's not bad, if you've lost your sense of taste.
Cole say you could borrow that?
Must be some kind of holiday, if we're getting stuff like this.
It's not a holiday, but yet another example of the lenient policy of your liberators.
There can be other rewards for other evidence of a change of heart.
Your decision to give up Cole was a wise one.
- Give up Cole?
- Here are some cigarettes.
As further proof of our sincerity.
- You hear what he said?
- "Decision to give up Cole"?
- What the hell is he talking about?
- Who told them it was Cole?
Well, who?
I went through sodding hell in that hut last night just cos I didn't want Coley to get it.
Now he has, cos of one of you.
What's the use holding out here when there are yellow bastards, inside and out?
What's the use?
Do you know what I was accused of?
Murdering men and women, making orphans out of Korean children, burning crops in a country I'd never heard of before.
I listened and said nothing, cos as he went on, I was thinking to meself,
"It don't matter cos the fellas in the hut are better than you'll ever be.
"I won't tell you nothing cos they won't, either."
I was wrong.
Someone did, and here we are, eating his reward.
What do you think they're doing to Coley while you're feeding your rotten selves?
Here, anyone want mine?
Ah, he'll get over it.
The important thing is, who squealed?
What have you started blushing for, Thornton?
Or can we have a good guess, eh?
- Why don't you say something?
- I have nothing to say.
- Oh.
Not here, maybe.
- Here we go.
- You've plenty to say in the office.
- Leave him alone.
- Coley's my mate.
- That why you took his mess tin?
Perhaps you knew he wasn't coming back here.
Well, there's no point in leaving them on the floor.
- Just get eaten by the rats.
- Looks like they've already started.
Thornton, come.
Why don't you move in over there?
They wouldn't have to keep on calling for you.
I'd like to know what he's going to start telling them now.
Sit down.
Put it on the bed.
How do you like your new squad?
You must be glad to be away from Ross.
I'm not with a new squad!
Hasn't your transfer come through?
I must speak with them in the office.
How interested are you in working for peace?
I'd rather have peace than war, if that's what you mean.
So I see.
Do you like apples?
Take one.
Thank you.
You were working for peace before you joined the army.
Why not finish what you set out to do?
What do you mean?
Weren't you active in the International Students Movement?
- How did you know I was a member?
- I have all the details here.
When you joined, the fact that you were three months behind with your subscription when you went into the army, your membership number, the number of meetings you attended, the questions you asked...
it's all here.
But how?
Because you and I were working for the same cause.
- But you're a communist!
- And so are you.
You mean the ISM is run by the Communist Party?
Like all the great movements promoting peace.
We have the backing of intelligent people all over the world... writers, doctors, artists, school teachers, scientists.
But what will happen to me if the others find out I'm a...?
Ross won't know, unless you tell him.
Anyway, you'll be transferred to a more sympathetic squad.
Right now, though, I need your help.
For what?
I need the name of the Battalion Intelligence Officer,
- just to complete a form.
- Lieutenant Morrison, do you mean?
- What's he like?
- Decent enough.
- Who works with him?
- A corporal.
Do you know him?
- Yes.
- How well?
He was my friend.
Did you go to his home?
Yes.
We used to listen to his discs there.
- What discs?
- Modern jazz.
Do you like classical music?
Some.
- What was his home like?
- Quite all right.
Very nice.
How did he get on with his parents?
Very well.
Has he any brothers and sisters?
He's got a younger brother, Alan.
- How old's he?
- He'd be about ten now.
What else did you and your friend have in common, besides discs?
We seemed to like the same sort of jokes.
- Did you go to his home often?
- Yes, he lived near the camp.
What is your friend's name?
Daniels.
- What is your rank?
- Corporal.
What is your job?
This will be of no use to you.
What is your job?
I'm only allowed to give you my number, rank and date of birth.
"Allowed"?
What do you mean "allowed"?
- Those are my orders.
- Who gave you those orders?
I can't answer that question.
You have surrendered yourself to us and are now under our orders.
You will give me the following names.
Who is the sniper?
Who is the Adjutant's clerk?
Who is the Signaller?
Who is the Intelligence Sergeant?
I can't give you an answer to any of those questions.
When your A Company's position was taken over by our victorious People's Army, a group of men was seen running into the darkness.
They are behind our lines now and will be caught.
You will tell me about them.
I was too busy fighting to see anybody.
Your stupid and reckless behaviour with a machine gun enabled them to get away.
Were you giving them deliberate cover fire?
I was too busy fighting to see anybody.
You will gain nothing by being stubborn.
Now, go.
Sit alone and consider your position.
(HEAVY GUNFIRE IN DISTANCE)
- Where are you wounded?
- My back.
It hurts.
I can't move my legs.
Help us get up.
I can help you if you help me.
You will have medical attention and a doctor, if you tell me about the five men seen running into our lines.
- They're a patrol.
- Where were they going?
I don't know.
I only heard they're a patrol.
- What about seeing a doctor?
- Who said anything about a doctor?
- But you promised.
- You are mistaken.
(GENTLE SOBBING)
Halt!
Now we're all in a camp, things'll be better.
Think so?
GUARD:
Listen!
Listen!
Look son, I know all about prison camps.
I had four years in them in the last lot.
These are not the Germans.
They're not the Japs, either.
Nobody knows yet what they're like.
Ah!
Don't be such a bleedin' pessimist.
(SPEAKS IN OWN LANGUAGE) Stop talking!
This new batch of prisoners.
Is there anyone you know?
- No, there's no one.
- Are you sure?
Yes.
You and I are working for the same cause.
It would be very awkward for you if the others got to know.
Are you positive there's no one you know?
Yes.
Is he the Intelligence Corporal that works with Lieutenant Morrison?
- Yes.
- Point him out.
- Seventh from the right.
- Is that the truth?
- Yes.
- You will stay until I come back!
- My name's Daniels.
- What's the news?
Any chance of them coming down the road next week?
Look, I just walked getting on for 150 miles.
- What mob are you from?
- Mind if I sit down?
This is where we live.
Is this it?
You sleep standing up the first week.
They've chucked the questionnaire at you?
We've all had to answer them.
"Social status?
Educational background?
- "Motive for enlistment?"
- Same old questions.
"Acquaintances with officers?
"State of family?" What are they running, a marriage bureau?
If you give them monkey answers, you'll find yourself filling up another and another.
And if they don't tally, you've had it.
"Party affiliations?
Thoughts?
Opinions of war?"
They can't expect me to fill this in.
I don't advise you to stick your neck out here.
- What does that mean?
- You'll find out.
Come on, let's drop it.
Give us some news.
What's the newspaper you've got?
- I'll have it next.
- It's four months old.
- Four months?
- The Daily Worker?
- What are you doing reading this?
- It's the only one we get.
- And you read it?
- Well, wouldn't you?
- You don't believe what's in it?
- Why not?
You saw their surrender leaflets.
You didn't walk across with your hands up, did you?
Look, let me give you a few tips.
Shift over.
- I felt like you at first.
- So?
You'll cool off when you've been here a bit longer.
I don't know what that means.
Reading this and filling these in...
You can't fight them here.
Why not?
Either you're for them or against them.
There's nothing else.
Is there?
That's what happens when you're against them.
- What's happened to him?
- He's taken a hammering.
- Who from?
- Someone up the cleaners.
Cleaners?
Where you get your head bashed in while you wait.
- Why?
- Cos he said...
Ask him!
Les Thornton!
I didn't know you were here.
- Hello, Harry.
- You know him?
We were stationed in the same camp.
Brought any discs with you?
- What's all this, eh?
- They want the form filled up.
They can wait.
We've got lots to talk about.
I'm supposed to take it back.
- You like it over at the office.
- Let him alone.
Why don't you tell your friend why Cole got beaten up?
- Go on.
Tell him.
- Tell me what?
Tell him! "Cole's like that because I got him taken away."
Go on.
Tell him!
Have you gone barmy?
There was you with the Daily Worker.
- Tell him who informed on Cole.
- I don't know.
- He's lying.
- Are you saying it was him?
Yes, I am.
- Did you inform on Cole?
- I didn't.
- He's lying.
- Where's your proof?
What more do you want?
Nobody else would have given him away.
- He's our mate.
- That's all the proof you need?
I never told them it was Cole.
They asked me, but I never told them.
- How do you know anybody informed?
- We were told.
- Who by?
- The hunchback.
The camp commandant.
You'd believe a communist before one of your own?
- Cole might have confessed.
- Why don't you ask him?
I'm going to.
He's dead!
The communist wants peace.
What about your people at home, your mothers and fathers, your wives?
Don't they want peace?
Don't they want you back with them?
Don't you want to be back with them?
It is the United Nations who are aggressors here, and their atrocities will never be forgotten.
Their bombs raining down on helpless villages.
And it is we who are accused by the United Nations of atrocities.
Us.
If you know of any, you must tell us.
I've seen them.
I've seen your soldiers keeping us from attending our wounded.
I've seen them leave men to die from hunger and thirst.
- I've seen plenty of atrocities.
- Lies!
Give me the name of the soldier who stopped you helping the wounded.
How the hell can I?
I can't even speak the lingo.
You think he'd have given me his name?
You are a liar!
These helpless villages, they're barracks and munitions depots.
The so-called People's Army turn everybody out of their homes and move in just like that...
I saw it on the way here.
What about this village?
What happened to the people who lived here before they took over?
Sure they want peace!
They want it so bad they have to murder Cole...
We just sat here and did nothing.
(WIND HOWLING)
Sit down on the floor.
Turn round.
With your legs crossed.
And arms folded.
You will remain that way all day and every day.
When you have come to appreciate your wise and lenient treatment by showing your penitence for your filthy crimes, the opportunity will not be withheld from you for making a full and truthful confession.

Well, if you don't reckon it's worth eating, I won't touch it.
You've been brought up on it.
I don't want to grow up looking horrible, like you!

For you, darling, I'll try sleeping on me left.
See you in the morning.
Daniels, wake!
Daniels, wake!
Wake, Daniels!
Come on.
Come on.
Wake!
Get up.
(SHOUTS COMMAND)
I thought it was time to get up.
The policy of the People's Volunteers towards war criminals can be one of leniency or suppression.
- The choice is yours alone.
- I'm not a criminal.
Stand to attention.
You will give me every name in your subversive group.
Confess your crimes.
I haven't committed any crimes.
You're wasting your time.
Are your sympathies with the Chinese People's Republic?
- No.
- You are a self-confessed criminal.
I am not.
If you have no sympathy with the Chinese People's Republic, then you must be against it.
- I'm a soldier.
- You are a war criminal.
Only the Chinese and the North Korean people are soldiers.
You have come to Korea to take part in an aggressive war.
Therefore, you are a war criminal.
You have been engaged in subversive activities to overthrow the authority of the People's Government.
I have not been engaged on subversive activities.
We can prove it.
Then bloody well prove it or let me sleep!
He's cracked.
Subversive activities?
He's definitely cracked.
(GUARD SHOUTS COMMAND)
- Ah, shut your gob!
- Sit!
Sit!
(GROANS)
(DOOR CLOSES)
I can't just sit here doing nothing.
You know what talking to yourself's the first sign of.
Thinking about home too much is going to make me morbid, so I'd better ration meself to a bit each day.
If I had something to lean against it'd be a bit more comfortable.
(GUARD SHOUTS OUT)
There used to be a game we'd play as a kid, something like this.
Somebody turned his back, then we used to try and get to him.
Then he'd turn round quick to see if we were moving.
How do you do?
"Something" footsteps.
"Something" footsteps.
Playing it on the pavement outside the flat seemed more real than this.
Grandma's footsteps, that was it.
Wonder what's happening right now at home.
GUARD:
Back!
Back!
Quickly!
Quickly!
(SIGHING) You are my heart's delight!
And where you are, I long to be.
(WIND HOWLING)
Hi, hi, hi!
(BANGS DOOR)
(BOOTS CREAKING)
Now look at you!
You've put your effing plates all over Yorkshire!
(DOOR SHUTS)
If you're going to keep me up, I may as well make use of it.
(GROANS)
Hey!
Where have you gone to?
Hey!
(SHOUTS COMMAND)
- I want the lavatory.
- (SHOUTS COMMAND)
Lavatory!
Let me out of here.
You know what a lavatory is, don't you?
No, perhaps you don't.
Until you confess to all your subversive activities, you will be kept there to rot.
You are there to repent and you will only be taken out when I say.
Or when you are dead.
I know what your trouble is!
You're all bloody well constipated!
(RAIN HAMMERS ON METAL ROOF)
Up!
Up!
Up!
Up!
Hi, hi!
- (GIVES COMMAND)
- Daniels, come!
(GROANS GENTLY)
I've brought you here to see how you're getting on.
Why don't you sit down?
I...
I've been sitting, thank you.
I'd rather stand.
Of course you have.
How thoughtless of me.
How are you feeling?
Oh, fine.
You don't have to pretend to me, you know.
Although I haven't experienced it myself.
I have seen the effects of sitting still for 16 hours and then not being allowed to sleep at night.
Yeah.
It can send better men than you quite mad.
Are you afraid of going mad, Daniels?
Not particularly.
You know, there is no need for these discomforts.
No?
No.
All you have to do is answer my questions.
Will you answer my questions?
It all depends on the questions, doesn't it?
They won't be too difficult, if that's what's worrying you.
No, on second thoughts
I think you'll be able to answer them better after some sleep.
What's happened to old sweat-face?
This smooth character, is he his superior and ordered them to lay off me for a little?
At least he didn't spout any of that "subversive activities" tripe.
Careful, though, friend.
You'll begin to think this one's quite decent.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)
OK.
You have been guilty of another crime against the People's Volunteers.
I find you asleep.
What have you to say?
- I was told to sleep.
- You are lying.
I gave no such orders.
- It wasn't you.
It was the other one.
- There is no other one.
(THINKING) 'Hey, wait a minute.
'That smaller one said you could sleep.
'You're not going Harpic.'
Sit as you were first told.
You have confessed to one crime.
Now you must confess to all the other crimes you have committed, including those you were guilty of before you surrendered.
- We already have the facts.
- Your facts are wrong.
(THINKING) 'What facts could he have?
'So, I interrupted the political lecture.
What else?
'What crimes before I came here?
'Being in Intelligence isn't a crime.
Anyway, he doesn't know.
'Unless somebody told him.' ...activities are known to us, but because of the traditional policy of leniency, you will be given the opportunity to expiate your crimes.
I'm not a criminal.
I'm a prisoner of war.
And as such, I'm entitled to the protection of the Geneva Convention.
(GUARD'S VOICE ECHOING) You came here to spy-spy-spy-spy.
And the penalty for that is death-death-death-death... (SHOUTS COMMAND)
WOMAN: 'Harry.
'Your father and I tried our hand at wallpapering last weekend.
'Although I say it myself, the front room doesn't look at all bad...'
You must confess to all your subversive activities.
- I have nothing to confess.
- But you came here to spy.
And the penalty for that is death.
I'm not a spy!
I'm a British soldier.
Why are you in Korea?
Why have you come to this beautiful country?
We have all the facts.
You came here as a spy.
This is your work, and the penalty for spies is death.
WOMAN: 'Your last letter was very welcome, Harry.
'Your father and I are glad you've got a new job.
'I hope it's more interesting and what you want.
'You make it sound very mysterious, though!
'
What new job?
I said you would be shot, and so you will.
Here.
No one will know.
We are far from the camp and there will be no grave.
You'll have to answer to murder.
Who to?
All spies are shot.
That is understood all over the world.
I'm a British soldier and entitled to be treated as a prisoner of war.
You are a spy.
Working in Intelligence is not being a spy.
Huh!
Did I say you were in Intelligence?
Where did you get that idea from?
Not from me.
Tell us what you know about patrols.
You must let me sleep first and give me some food.
I...
I'm too tired.
I can't think straight.
Let me sleep and then I'll write it all out for you.
(GIVES COMMAND)
I've finished.
It's all there.
Read it out loud.
You want to study it first.
It's got drawings and positions marked.
I shall do that later.
First, you will read it, comrade.
"The night before I was captured I was on duty when a patrol was sent out.
"The instructions given by the officer were as follows:
"When you go down to the woods today, you're in for a big surprise.
"When you go down to the woods today, you'd better go in disguise.
"For every bear that ever there was will gather there for certain.
"Because today's the day the Chinese and North Koreans have their picnic.
"Picnic time is time for play."

Yes, I see.
Well, it's very simple.
You know what to do.

- (GUARD SHOUTS)

(WHISPERS) Welcome to the Kennel Club.

Since we arrived, but don't let them hear you.
(GUARD SHOUTS)
(FOOTSTEPS MOVE AWAY)
- Hey, I say!
- Yeah.
This lot's barmy, you know.
They're right round the bleedin' bend.
- You tell them that?
- Huh!
There's a lot wrong with Britain but I don't want any bloody foreigner telling me that.
All that "dupes of war-monger" stuff.
"You're the dupes," I said.
I tell them that when I was in German hands,
- I never had to listen to this...
- (GUARD SHOUTS)
(FOOTSTEPS MOVE AWAY)
Is anybody else in here?
A fella called Simpson WAS here, but he's gone now.
Over there's a stool pigeon.
I expect they'll keep you in here quite a bit.
Don't think so, somehow.
I'm going to have a snooze before they come again.
Sleep's the prisoner's friend, they say, and waking up's his enemy.
(SHOUTS COMMAND)
DANIELS: (WHISPERS) Hey, thanks.
Thanks.
Don't let them get you down!
(SHOUTS) Every time they hit you only proves how wrong they are!
You are guilty of many serious crimes against the People's Army.
This latest one is the most serious.
For all your crimes, you will be sentenced by the authority of the People's Court.
If you confess in a truthful manner, then their traditional leniency will make itself apparent.
There is another way in which you can show your sense of shame, and that is by answering in a truthful manner the following questions.
My report on your behaviour will be read out in the court.
(DANIELS SNIFFS)
The list of your crimes is long.
You have spread anti-communist propaganda amongst your comrades.
You have lied in your questionnaire.
You have sabotaged property belonging to the People's Army.
You have, as a result of this, deprived your peace-loving comrades of the opportunity of learning the truth.
You have accused the People's Army of acts of cowardice and spread filthy lies about atrocities towards the peace-loving people of Korea.
You have insulted an officer of the People's Army who, because of the great and traditional goodwill of the Chinese people, spared your life, when he was within his rights under rules observed by every country to have you shot as a spy.
- I am not a spy.
- (CHUCKLING) Young man!
You have already admitted that you work in Intelligence and that is spying.
Do you deny there are patrols behind the lines of the People's Army?
Do the United Nations send out patrols?
Of course they do.
So do your lot.
So does every army.
What are they for, these patrols?
To see how the land lies.
And what is that, if it is not spying?
Soldiers are not spies.
What is the name of your superior officer in Intelligence?
- I cannot answer that.
- Why not?
I will not answer any questions on military matters.
- But you already have.
- I have not.
But you have.
We know your name, your rank, your number.
And you have confessed that you work in Intelligence.
You see, I know a great deal about you, Daniels.
Do you think of yourself as a brave man?
Not out of the ordinary.
I don't want them to use any more pressure.
You can save yourself a great deal of discomfort.
It's up to you.
But I want the answers to my questions and I want them now.
Who's your superior officer in Battalion Intelligence?
(THINKING) 'How the hell does he know I was in Battalion Intelligence?
'
- I'm waiting.
- 'Then wait a bit longer.
'Who could have told him?
'Is he guessing?
'
I am not able to answer any matters dealing with military personnel or equipment.
Is that what Lieutenant Morrison told you to answer?
'Morrison?
He knows it was Morrison!
'
You see, I know the name.
Are you surprised?
'Think boy.
If you say no, you're admitting it was Morrison.
'If you say yes, it's the same thing.'
Shortly before you surrendered, a patrol infiltrated our lines.
Where was that patrol to go?
Where was that patrol to go?
'Give yourself time.
Make the answer nice and long.'
I cannot answer any question relating to the whereabouts of patrols.
You are a very foolish young man.
Your life is in immediate danger.
What you have been through so far is nothing, compared with what you will be made to suffer if you do not give them the following information.
Where the patrol was to go.
How many men were in the patrol.
What its route out was and what will be its route back.
What the job of the patrol was, how long it was to be out and whether they had a radio.
Now...
You will give me these answers or else you will never see your mother and father again.
Or your brother, Alan.
Or listen to your jazz.
You will never lead a normal life again, should they return you to your country.
By the time they have finished with you, no one will recognise you, and you will recognise no one, for you will be both blind and deaf.
'Who's been talking?
How do they know about my kid brother and jazz?
'
I want your answers now.
I've already told you...
'Slowly!
Slowly.
Take your time.'
I don't intend to divulge anything which might prejudice the security of the United Nations' forces, and my duty as a soldier is to resist the enemy.
You are no longer a soldier and the communists are not your enemy.
Then why have you tied me up?
So you can be helped to see the truth.
Ugh!
We're not going to punish you.
We're going to cure you.
My colleague tells me you like to drink water.
Well, water is our medicine.
As soon as you show yourself cooperative, then you will be cured.
Tell me what I want to know about the patrol.
'They must have something big coming if he's worried about a patrol.'
You can go and...
'This is their torture chamber.
'What's he giving me drinks of water for?
'And why the towel?
'
'If they're not careful, they're gonna choke me.'
(SPLUTTERING)
'Oh, my God!
That's why I'm here.'
(COUGHING)
You must tell me about the patrol.
Where it was to go, how many men were in it, the route out and back of the patrol, what it had to do and for how long and if it had...
'He's probably fried if I don't talk.
I'm not going to save HIS neck.'
Tell me what I want to know and this will stop.
- If you continue...
- 'I'll tell him.
- 'After the next lot of water.' - ...give me what I want.
'You bastard!
You bastard!
And you've got to tie me up to do it.
'I'm not that bloody helpless.' (SPLUTTERS)
'I won't give you what you want.
'One more lot of water.
One more lot of water and I'll tell them.
'I'll tell them...' (SPLUTTERING)
'After the next lot, I'll do what they want.
'One more lot of water and I'll HAVE to tell them.
'Next time, that's it.
Next time I'll tell them everything they want to know.
'Then they'll stop the water.
I can't take any more.
'Each time it proves how wrong they are.
Each time he hits you...'
Tell me!
'Each time he hits you only proves how wrong they are.'
- Give me the answers!
- 'Proves how wrong they are.
- 'Each time he hits you...'
- Now!
'Each time proves...'
(COUGHING)
Agh!
You can go.
And then I shall send for you for another drink of water.
When I send you back, you will be face-to-face with your friend, who is to blame for all this.
(COUGHING)
(COUGHING)
(COUGHING)
Are you OK?
The water, eh?
You'd better get those wet things off.
- What are they up to?
- Working out a peace petition.
Let's have a look.
Hey!
"We the undersigned have been duped into joining the war in Korea
- "and ask..." - "Implore" would be stronger.
"...not to place any obstacle in the way of peace-loving Chinese
"and North Korean people."
That ought to be good for a few fags.
What do you think you're playing at?
You going to let yourself be walked over like that?
You can write it out again.
I'm not going to.
- What's this about an armistice?
- Peace talks have started.
- What's up, Thornton?
- I've forgotten something.
I'll be back.
(DOOR SLAMS)
Open the door.
What have you seen that makes you so scared?
Daniels here?
- Leave him alone, Ross.
- Look at him.
Why didn't you expect to see him?
- What have you been telling them?
- Let him go!
Stand by the door.
He's not leaving here until I know once and for all he's been talking.
(COUGHS)
- Come away from that door.
- Stay there!
He's not getting out until he tells us the truth!
- You listen to me, Ross.
- You keep out of this, Daniels.
I've had a belly-full of that kind of talk.
You sound like they do.
That's what they said to me. "You won't leave till you tell the truth."
What are you going to do?
Work him over?
Away from there.
Come away from there, Daniels, or else you'll get it, too.
I'm warning you.
We've had just about enough of your "friend".
If anybody's got more right to do Thornton, it's me.
But I knew him before you did, Ross.
He was a decent enough fella and a good friend.
He can't shove his weight about and doesn't go round effing and blinding.
I know what he does go around doing.
Because you couldn't understand him, you pushed him outside your circle and that's just what they're waiting for.
Would you like to be on the outside, Ross?
Would any of you?
- He didn't have to work for them.
- There's no excuse for that.
I didn't say there was.
That's something he'll have to live with the rest of his life.
You're not free from blame.
You put your name to this.
Every time you take a few fags for a favour, you're working for them.
By turning on Thornton, you're doing exactly what they want.
They're out to break you up, turn friends into enemies, it's the only way they know.
There's only one way to beat them out here... be better than they are.
And look at yourselves.
What would happen if the RSN walked in now?
He'd do his bloody nut!
Daniels, you come.
You know what to do with those.
Bit by bit, too.
Not all at once.
It is time for the usual study.
The peace talks that have been instigated by the peace-loving Chinese communist forces are being sabotaged.
More than ever, you must be asking yourselves why are you here in Korea?
You must ask yourselves whether your own side are really interested in having you released.
We can offer you freedom from the capitalist oppression.
We are communists.
We therefore have studied the true feelings and needs of the people.
The communist cause is the right one.
We represent all the oppressed people of the world in their struggle for freedom.
What is your answer to that?
Get stuffed!
In Korea, I was Adjutant of the Glosters when we fought the Chinese at the Battle of the Imjin.
Almost all of us who survived the battle were captured.
The treatment that we received from our captors came as an unpleasant surprise.
We naturally expected that the rules laid down by the Geneva Convention for the treatment of prisoners of war would be observed.
It soon became apparent that the Chinese and North Koreans did not respect any such rules, but used methods designed to degrade us and to break our morale in order to convert us to communism - for which we were totally unprepared.
We resisted them and they failed.
But we had to learn the hard way.
This film has been made, based on our experiences and supervised by an officer who was with the battalion at that time, so that you may know the practices of possible communist enemies and combat them successfully.
(Hammering)
(Wind howls)
(Shouts command out)
(Adjutant) 'This is a prison camp in North Korea.
'The year, 1950.
'Many men of the United Nations' forces had been captured 'after battle with the Chinese and North Koreans.
'But being a prisoner of war of this enemy 'didn't mean that the fight against communism was over.
'It had only just begun.
'This was a different enemy with different ways, 'and resistance was something more than keeping the guards busy.
'It was a matter of trying to keep your mind clear, 'your nerves sound 'and of knowing your friends.
'In communist hands, 'the greatest gift one man can give another is his loyalty.
'Some were able to.
'Others tried... and failed.
'And some didn't even bother to try.
'In these camps, the daily routine was not what any POW expected.
'There was no barbed wire, no machine gun tower, 'no nightly searchlight.
'There was also no Red Cross.
'The enemy said there was no need for them.
'In communist hands, everyone was safe.
'In fact, no one was even referred to as a prisoner of war.'
You are not prisoners.
You are students.
We give you the chance to study and to learn the truth, to show you how your leaders entangle the people in a web of lies.
You have brought what I sent you for, Thornton?
Read it out.
"The whole squad will attend classes at the fixed times
"and pay full attention to study.
"Sabotage of study will be regarded as a serious of fence.
"After lectures, the whole squad will be organised for discussion,
"and a record kept of it for reporting to the authorities.
"Only the seriously sick are exempted from attending lectures
"and any other absence or bad behaviour will be punished."
(Prisoner) What about the Geneva Convention?
Who's guilty of sabotaging study?
Confess!
We shall discover the guilty reactionary.
Who's the squad leader?
- Name the guilty one.
- Don't ask me!
Take them back to your hut.
(Wind howls) ...bloody great offensive so we can all get home for Christmas.
They won't get going till spring.
Are we going to be stuck here all winter while the British Army sits on their arses waiting for the flowers to come up?
They'll keep on sending out patrols.
- Shut up!
- They know about them.
- Shut up, I tell you.
- You've no authority here.
I'm still the only NCO in the squad.
Your rank means nothing.
I'm the elected squad leader.
Huh!
Phoney election fixed by them.
- Do you want the job?
- Why don't you two stop arguing?
"Why don't you two stop arguing(?
)"
You're making too much noise for Thornton.
Watch it!
- One day you'll go too far, Ross.
- What do you mean?
How far do you reckon we are from the front line?
200 miles.
That'll be a fat load of good to us, sending out piddling patrols.
It's possible they'll try one more attack before winter clamps down.
I want you to take your patrol to a point overlooking this road here and watch for any signs of a move - that's 15 miles inside their lines.
Take enough food to last about ten days.
About your route back.
You'll come through A Company's lines here.
- Any questions, sergeant?
- I don't think so, sir.
You must make it your responsibility to see that no letters are carried or photographs or souvenirs or any single thing that an enemy interrogator could make use of if you're captured.
The only thing you must carry is your FPW80, which I hope you've filled in correctly.
If you're taken prisoner, hang on to the top half and have it with you if you escape.
By the way, if you are interrogated, they won't worry about the Geneva Conventions too much.
I've been told the best way to avoid interrogation
- is not to get captured, sir.
- So it is.
And the best time to escape is as soon after capture as possible.
But if you are taken, remember, it's name, rank, number and date of birth.
I hope they'll be satisfied with that.
(Phone rings)
Morrison.
Grid reference?
That's another report of bumping their patrols.
Don't go bulldozing your way through tomorrow night.
- They'll nab you pretty damn quick.
- No, sir.
- Will that be all, sir?
- I think so, sergeant.
My corporal will be in the OP for a couple of days.
He'll guide you to your starting point in A Company's area and see you through the mines.
Good luck, sergeant.
- See you tomorrow night, corporal.
- I'll be waiting for you.
You'd better be.
Their patrols are on the increase.
Could be they're deliberately out to take prisoners.
Maybe.
No one's in for a cushy time who gets captured by the North Koreans.
- They've got experts behind them.
- Chinese?
Yes, and we know who's been teaching them.
(Knock on door)
You know why you are here in front of me now?
- Yes.
- Why?
You want to know who called out "Geneva Convention".
- Do you know who it was?
- Yes.
Will you tell me who it was?
I can't.
You've nothing to fear from me, if that's what is holding you back.
This photograph was found on you when you were captured.
Who are these people?
- My parents.
- Are you very fond of them?
Have you heard from your mother and father?
No.
They might send you a letter, and I wouldn't like to withhold it.
Especially as you don't seem to have many people to talk to here.
We know you're not happy in your squad.
You don't fit in.
You need more intelligent people.
Not louts like Ross.
- You didn't call out, did you?
- No!
Of course you didn't.
You've more sense.
Now you can go.
Oh, Thornton.
I'll see about your transfer.
It's a good thing I'm soft-hearted.
I doubt if any of my comrades would have let you off so easily.
(Wind howling)
I hope you kept your mouth bloody shut, Thornton.
You!
Inside.
Sabotage of study is as serious as all the other crimes you war criminals have committed.
You would like to kill me, wouldn't you?
Well, I would like to kill YOU for all the peace-loving Korean people you have destroyed, all the crops you've burned, all the homes you've bombed.
Do you know how many bombs have fallen on villages?
Ross!
Who called out "Geneva Convention", Ross?
Shut the door.
Was it Thornton?
I think it WAS Thornton.
In a way, I admire him for his courage.
- Thornton didn't do the calling out.
- Then who did?
I'm not saying, but you can take it from me it wasn't Thornton.
You don't like him very much, do you?
No.
Why?
No reason.
Is he a better soldier than you?
Better soldier?
The...creeping little clerk.
But a clerk can be a key man, especially in, say, the briefing of patrols.
The only patrol he's been on was to the bogs and back!
Do you think the tears of helpless Korean children, whose parents lie bleeding and dying, are any different from any other children?
Yet, in spite of all the misery you brought to this beautiful country, we Chinese can be lenient.
But don't make the mistake of thinking that our leniency is limitless.
Now give me the name of the saboteur who said "Geneva Convention".
There's nothing to say.
Do you realise that all medical supplies and rations will be withheld unless we have the identity of this man?
Yes.
Do you know who said it?
Yes.
Are you prepared to see your friends suffer needlessly?
- No.
- Then tell me who it was.
What happened to Simpson for painting Dreamland...?
You don't ask ME questions.
If you think that Simpson will be punished, you are wrong.
That isn't our solution.
The Chinese policy of leniency will enable Simpson to have the time and the opportunity to realise his error.
This man, too, will be dealt with in the same way.
Now, tell me who it was.
Me.
(Wind howling)
- Any news of Cole?
- No.
Look what they've given us.
I think I smell fish.
You won't find any in there.
They probably dangled a bit in front of it.
What are you looking for in Cole's things?
- Ah, wrap it up!
- Here, this is yours.
- That's not mine.
- Take your feet out the can.
This stuffs not bad, if you've lost your sense of taste.
Cole say you could borrow that?
Must be some kind of holiday, if we're getting stuff like this.
It's not a holiday, but yet another example of the lenient policy of your liberators.
There can be other rewards for other evidence of a change of heart.
Your decision to give up Cole was a wise one.
- Give up Cole?
- Here are some cigarettes.
As further proof of our sincerity.
- You hear what he said?
- "Decision to give up Cole"?
- What the hell is he talking about?
- Who told them it was Cole?
Well, who?
I went through sodding hell in that hut last night just cos I didn't want Coley to get it.
Now he has, cos of one of you.
What's the use holding out here when there are yellow bastards, inside and out?
What's the use?
Do you know what I was accused of?
Murdering men and women, making orphans out of Korean children, burning crops in a country I'd never heard of before.
I listened and said nothing, cos as he went on, I was thinking to meself,
"it don't matter cos the fellas in the hut are better than you'll ever be.
"I won't tell you nothing cos they won't, either."
I was wrong.
Someone did, and here we are, eating his reward.
What do you think they're doing to Coley while you're feeding your rotten selves?
Here, anyone want mine?
Ah, he'll get over it.
The important thing is, who squealed?
What have you started blushing for, Thornton?
Or can we have a good guess, eh?
- Why don't you say something?
- I have nothing to say.
- Oh.
Not here, maybe.
- Here we go.
- You've plenty to say in the office.
- Leave him alone.
- Coley's my mate.
- That why you took his mess tin?
Perhaps you knew he wasn't coming back here.
Well, there's no point in leaving them on the floor.
- Just get eaten by the rats.
- Looks like they've already started.
Thornton, come.
Why don't you move in over there?
They wouldn't have to keep on calling for you.
I'd like to know what he's going to start telling them now.
Sit down.
Put it on the bed.
How do you like your new squad?
You must be glad to be away from Ross.
I'm not with a new squad!
Hasn't your transfer come through?
I must speak with them in the office.
How interested are you in working for peace?
I'd rather have peace than war, if that's what you mean.
So I see.
Do you like apples?
Take one.
Thank you.
You were working for peace before you joined the army.
Why not finish what you set out to do?
What do you mean?
Weren't you active in the International Students Movement?
- How did you know I was a member?
- I have all the details here.
When you joined, the fact that you were three months behind with your subscription when you went into the army, your membership number, the number of meetings you attended, the questions you asked - it's all here.
But how?
Because you and I were working for the same cause.
- But you're a communist!
- And so are you.
You mean the ISM is run by the Communist Party?
Like all the great movements promoting peace.
We have the backing of intelligent people all over the world - writers, doctors, artists, school teachers, scientists.
But what will happen to me if the others find out I'm a...?
Ross won't know, unless you tell him.
Anyway, you'll be transferred to a more sympathetic squad.
Right now, though, I need your help.
For what?
I need the name of the Battalion Intelligence Officer,
- just to complete a form.
- Lieutenant Morrison, do you mean?
- What's he like?
- Decent enough.
- Who works with him?
- A corporal.
Do you know him?
- Yes.
- How well?
He was my friend.
Did you go to his home?
Yes.
We used to listen to his discs there.
- What discs?
- Modern jazz.
Do you like classical music?
Some.
- What was his home like?
- Quite all right.
Very nice.
How did he get on with his parents?
Very well.
Has he any brothers and sisters?
He's got a younger brother, Alan.
- How old's he?
- He'd be about ten now.
What else did you and your friend have in common, besides discs?
We seemed to like the same sort of jokes.
- Did you go to his home often?
- Yes, he lived near the camp.
What is your friend's name?
Daniels.
- What is your rank?
- Corporal.
What is your job?
This will be of no use to you.
What is your job?
I'm only allowed to give you my number, rank and date of birth.
"Allowed"?
What do you mean "allowed"?
- Those are my orders.
- Who gave you those orders?
I can't answer that question.
You have surrendered yourself to us and are now under our orders.
You will give me the following names.
Who is the sniper?
Who is the Adjutant's clerk?
Who is the Signaller?
Who is the Intelligence Sergeant?
I can't give you an answer to any of those questions.
When your A Company's position was taken over by our victorious People's Army, a group of men was seen running into the darkness.
They are behind our lines now and will be caught.
You will tell me about them.
I was too busy fighting to see anybody.
Your stupid and reckless behaviour with a machine gun enabled them to get away.
Were you giving them deliberate cover fire?
I was too busy fighting to see anybody.
You will gain nothing by being stubborn.
Now, go.
Sit alone and consider your position.
(Heavy gunfire in distance)
- Where are you wounded?
- My back.
It hurts.
I can't move my legs.
Help us get up.
I can help you if you help me.
You will have medical attention and a doctor, if you tell me about the five men seen running into our lines.
- They're a patrol.
- Where were they going?
I don't know.
I only heard they're a patrol.
- What about seeing a doctor?
- Who said anything about a doctor?
- But you promised.
- You are mistaken.
(Gentle sobbing)
Halt!
Now we're all in a camp, things'll be better.
Think so?
(Guard) Listen!
Listen!
Look son, I know all about prison camps.
I had four years in them in the last lot.
These are not the Germans.
They're not the Japs, either.
Nobody knows yet what they're like.
Ah!
Don't be such a bleedin' pessimist.
(Speaks in own language) Stop talking!
This new batch of prisoners.
ls there anyone you know?
- No, there's no one.
- Are you sure?
Yes.
You and I are working for the same cause.
It would be very awkward for you if the others got to know.
Are you positive there's no one you know?
Yes.
Is he the Intelligence Corporal that works with Lieutenant Morrison?
- Yes.
- Point him out.
- Seventh from the right.
- Is that the truth?
- Yes.
- You will stay until I come back!
- My name's Daniels.
- What's the news?
Any chance of them coming down the road next week?
Look, I just walked getting on for 150 miles.
- What mob are you from?
- Mind if I sit down?
This is where we live.
LS this it?
You sleep standing up the first week.
They've chucked the questionnaire at you?
We've all had to answer them.
"Social status?
Educational background?
- "Motive for enlistment?"
- Same old questions.
"Acquaintances with officers?
"State of family?" What are they running, a marriage bureau?
If you give them monkey answers, you'll find yourself filling up another and another.
And if they don't tally, you've had it.
"Party affiliations?
Thoughts?
Opinions of war?"
They can't expect me to fill this in.
I don't advise you to stick your neck out here.
- What does that mean?
- You'll find out.
Come on, let's drop it.
Give us some news.
What's the newspaper you've got?
- I'll have it next.
- It's four months old.
- Four months?
- The Daily Worker?
- What are you doing reading this?
- It's the only one we get.
- And you read it?
- Well, wouldn't you?
- You don't believe what's in it?
- Why not?
You saw their surrender leaflets.
You didn't walk across with your hands up, did you?
Look, let me give you a few tips.
Shift over.
- I felt like you at first.
- So?
You'll cool off when you've been here a bit longer.
I don't know what that means.
Reading this and filling these in...
You can't fight them here.
Why not?
Either you're for them or against them.
There's nothing else.
Is there?
That's what happens when you're against them.
- What's happened to him?
- He's taken a hammering.
- Who from?
- Someone up the cleaners.
Cleaners?
Where you get your head bashed in while you wait.
- Why?
- Cos he said...
Ask him!
Les Thornton!
I didn't know you were here.
- Hello, Harry.
- You know him?
We were stationed in the same camp.
Brought any discs with you?
- What's all this, eh?
- They want the form filled up.
They can wait.
We've got lots to talk about.
I'm supposed to take it back.
- You like it over at the office.
- Let him alone.
Why don't you tell your friend why Cole got beaten up?
- Go on.
Tell him.
- Tell me what?
Tell him! "Cole's like that because I got him taken away."
Go on.
Tell him!
Have you gone barmy?
There was you with the Daily Worker.
- Tell him who informed on Cole.
- I don't know.
- He's lying.
- Are you saying it was him?
Yes, I am.
- Did you inform on Cole?
- I didn't.
- He's lying.
- Where's your proof?
What more do you want?
Nobody else would have given him away.
- He's our mate.
- That's all the proof you need?
I never told them it was Cole.
They asked me, but I never told them.
- How do you know anybody informed?
- We were told.
- Who by?
- The hunchback.
The camp commandant.
You'd believe a communist before one of your own?
- Cole might have confessed.
- Why don't you ask him?
I'm going to.
He's dead!
The communist wants peace.
What about your people at home, your mothers and fathers, your wives?
Don't they want peace?
Don't they want you back with them?
Don't you want to be back with them?
It is the United Nations who are aggressors here, and their atrocities will never be forgotten.
Their bombs raining down on helpless villages.
And it is we who are accused by the United Nations of atrocities.
Us.
If you know of any, you must tell us.
I've seen them.
I've seen your soldiers keeping us from attending our wounded.
I've seen them leave men to die from hunger and thirst.
- I've seen plenty of atrocities.
- Lies!
Give me the name of the soldier who stopped you helping the wounded.
How the hell can I?
I can't even speak the lingo.
You think he'd have given me his name?
You are a liar!
These helpless villages, they're barracks and munitions depots.
The so-called People's Army turn everybody out of their homes and move in just like that- I saw it on the way here.
What about this village?
What happened to the people who lived here before they took over?
Sure they want peace(!
) They want it so bad they have to murder Cole...
We just sat here and did nothing.
(Wind howling)
Sit down on the floor.
Turn round.
With your legs crossed.
And arms folded.
You will remain that way all day and every day.
When you have come to appreciate your wise and lenient treatment by showing your penitence for your filthy crimes, the opportunity will not be withheld from you for making a full and truthful confession.
(Gives command in own language)
(Shouts command)
(Thud)
(Speaking in own language)
(Guard) Quickly!
- (Daniels mutters) Yeah, shut up!
- Quickly!
(Guard repeats orders)
Well, if you don't reckon it's worth eating, I won't touch it.
You've been brought up on it.
I don't want to grow up looking horrible, like you!
- (Guard shouts command).
- Thank you very much.
(Shouts command) Hoejeonsikida.
And if that's good night, hoejeonsikida to you, too.
- (Shouts command)
- Learn the lingo.
(Shouts command)
Shut bloody up, you illegitimate son of Madame Butterfly.
(Repeats command)
For you, darling, I'll try sleeping on me left.
See you in the morning.
Daniels, wake!
Daniels, wake!
Wake, Daniels!
Come on.
Come on.
Wake!
Get up.
(Shouts command)
I thought it was time to get up.
The policy of the People's Volunteers towards war criminals can be one of leniency or suppression.
- The choice is yours alone.
- I'm not a criminal.
Stand to attention.
You will give me every name in your subversive group.
Confess your crimes.
I haven't committed any crimes.
You're wasting your time.
Are your sympathies with the Chinese People's Republic?
- No.
- You are a self-confessed criminal.
I am not.
If you have no sympathy with the Chinese People's Republic, then you must be against it.
- I'm a soldier.
- You are a war criminal.
Only the Chinese and the North Korean people are soldiers.
You have come to Korea to take part in an aggressive war.
Therefore, you are a war criminal.
You have been engaged in subversive activities to overthrow the authority of the People's Government.
I have not been engaged on subversive activities.
We can prove it.
Then bloody well prove it or let me sleep!
He's cracked.
Subversive activities?
He's definitely cracked.
(Guard shouts command)
- Ah, shut your gob!
- Sit!
Sit!
(Groans)
(Door closes)
I can't just sit here doing nothing.
You know what talking to yourself s the first sign of.
Thinking about home too much is going to make me morbid, so I'd better ration meself to a bit each day.
If I had something to lean against it'd be a bit more comfortable.
(Guard shouts out)
There used to be a game we'd play as a kid, something like this.
Somebody turned his back, then we used to try and get to him.
Then he'd turn round quick to see if we were moving.
How do you do?
"Something" footsteps.
"Something" footsteps.
Playing it on the pavement outside the flat seemed more real than this.
Grandma's footsteps, that was it.
Wonder what's happening right now at home.
(Guard) Back!
Back!
Quickly!
Quickly!
(Sighing) You are my heart's delight!
And where you are, I long to be.
(Wind howling)
Hi, hi, hi!
(Bangs door)
(Boots creaking)
Now look at you!
You've put your effing plates all over Yorkshire!
(Door shuts)
If you're going to keep me up, I may as well make use of it.
(Groans)
Hey!
Where have you gone to?
Hey!
(Shouts command)
- I want the lavatory.
- (Shouts command)
Lavatory!
Let me out of here.
You know what a lavatory is, don't you?
No, perhaps you don't.
Until you confess to all your subversive activities, you will be kept there to rot.
You are there to repent and you will only be taken out when I say.
Or when you are dead.
I know what your trouble is!
You're all bloody well constipated!
(Rain hammers on metal roof)
Up!
Up!
Up!
Up!
Hi, hi!
- (Gives command)
- Daniels, come!
(Groans gently)
I've brought you here to see how you're getting on.
Why don't you sit down?
I...
I've been sitting, thank you.
I'd rather stand.
Of course you have.
How thoughtless of me.
How are you feeling?
Oh, fine.
You don't have to pretend to me, you know.
Although I haven't experienced it myself, I have seen the effects of sitting still for 16 hours and then not being allowed to sleep at night.
Yeah.
It can send better men than you quite mad.
Are you afraid of going mad, Daniels?
Not particularly.
You know, there is no need for these discomforts.
No?
No.
All you have to do is answer my questions.
Will you answer my questions?
It all depends on the questions, doesn't it?
They won't be too difficult, if that's what's worrying you.
No, on second thoughts
I think you'll be able to answer them better after some sleep.
What's happened to old sweat-face?
This smooth character, is he his superior and ordered them to lay off me for a little?
At least he didn't spout any of that "subversive activities" tripe.
Careful, though, friend.
You'll begin to think this one's quite decent.
(Footsteps approach)
OK.
You have been guilty of another crime against the People's Volunteers.
I find you asleep.
What have you to say?
- I was told to sleep.
- You are lying.
I gave no such orders.
- It wasn't you.
It was the other one.
- There is no other one.
(Thinking) 'Hey, wait a minute.
'That smaller one said you could sleep.
'You're not going Harpic.'
Sit as you were first told.
You have confessed to one crime.
Now you must confess to all the other crimes you have committed, including those you were guilty of before you surrendered.
- We already have the facts.
- Your facts are wrong.
(Thinking) 'What facts could he have?
'So, I interrupted the political lecture.
What else?
'What crimes before I came here?
'Being in Intelligence isn't a crime.
Anyway, he doesn't know.
'Unless somebody told him.' ...activities are known to us, but because of the traditional policy of leniency, you will be given the opportunity to expiate your crimes.
I'm not a criminal.
I'm a prisoner of war.
And as such, I'm entitled to the protection of the Geneva Convention.
(Guard's voice echoing) You came hereto spy-spy-spy-spy.
And the penalty for that is death-death-death-death... (Shouts command)
(Woman) 'Harry.
'Your father and I tried our hand at wallpapering last weekend.
'Although I say it myself, the front room doesn't look at all bad...'
You must confess to all your subversive activities.
- I have nothing to confess.
- But you came hereto spy.
And the penalty for that is death.
I'm not a spy!
I'm a British soldier.
Why are you in Korea?
Why have you come to this beautiful country?
We have all the facts.
You came here as a spy.
This is your work, and the penalty for spies is death.
(Woman) 'Your last letter was very welcome, Harry.
'Your father and I are glad you've got a new job.
'I hope it's more interesting and what you want.
'You make it sound very mysterious, though!
'
What new job?
I said you would be shot, and so you will.
Here.
No one will know.
We are far from the camp and there will be no grave.
You'll have to answer to murder.
Who to?
All spies are shot.
That is understood all over the world.
I'm a British soldier and entitled to be treated as a prisoner of war.
You are a spy.
Working in Intelligence is not being a spy.
Huh!
Did I say you were in Intelligence?
Where did you get that idea from?
Not from me.
Tell us what you know about patrols.
You must let me sleep first and give me some food.
I...
I'm too tired.
I can't think straight.
Let me sleep and then I'll write it all out for you.
(Gives command)
I've finished.
It's all there.
Read it out loud.
You want to study it first.
It's got drawings and positions marked.
I shall do that later.
First, you will read it, comrade.
"The night before I was captured I was on duty when a patrol was sent out.
"The instructions given by the officer were as follows:
"When you go down to the woods today, you're in for a big surprise.
"When you go down to the woods today, you'd better go in disguise.
"For every bear that ever there was will gather there for certain.
"Because today's the day the Chinese and North Koreans have their picnic.
"Picnic time is time for play."
(Russian guard) Yes, I see.
Well, it's very simple.
You know what to do.
Daniels.
(Shouts command)
(Shouts command)
(Prisoner) Move your arse!
You're blocking the view!
Come in!
Come in!
- (Guard shouts)
- Oh, shut up!
- I'm not...
- Inside.
Quickly.
(Prisoner) Oh!
Look who is here!
Ha-ha!
- (Guard shouts)
- All right, all right.
(Whispers) Welcome to the Kennel Club.
- How long have you been here?
- Ssh!
Since we arrived, but don't let them hear you.
(Guard shouts)
(Footsteps move away)
- Hey, I say!
- Yeah.
This lot's barmy, you know.
They're right round the bleedin' bend.
- You tell them that?
- Huh!
There's a lot wrong with Britain but I don't want any bloody foreigner telling me that.
All that "dupes of war-monger" stuff.
"You're the dupes," I said.
I tell them that when I was in German hands,
- I never had to listen to this...
- (Guard shouts)
(Footsteps move away) ls anybody else in here?
A fella called Simpson WAS here, but he's gone now.
Over there's a stool pigeon.
I expect they'll keep you in here quite a bit.
Don't think so, somehow.
I'm going to have a snooze before they come again.
Sleep's the prisoner's friend, they say, and waking up's his enemy.
(Shouts command)
(Daniels whispers) Hey, thanks.
Thanks.
Don't let them get you down!
(Shouts) Every time they hit you only proves how wrong they are!
You are guilty of many serious crimes against the People's Army.
This latest one is the most serious.
For all your crimes, you will be sentenced by the authority of the People's Court.
If you confess in a truthful manner, then their traditional leniency will make itself apparent.
There is another way in which you can show your sense of shame, and that is by answering in a truthful manner the following questions.
My report on your behaviour will be read out in the court.
(Daniels sniffs)
The list of your crimes is long.
You have spread anti-communist propaganda amongst your comrades.
You have lied in your questionnaire.
You have sabotaged property belonging to the People's Army.
You have, as a result of this, deprived your peace-loving comrades of the opportunity of learning the truth.
You have accused the People's Army of acts of cowardice and spread filthy lies about atrocities towards the peace-loving people of Korea.
You have insulted an officer of the People's Army who, because of the great and traditional goodwill of the Chinese people, spared your life, when he was within his rights under rules observed by every country to have you shot as a spy.
- I am not a spy.
- (Chuckling) Young man!
You have already admitted that you work in Intelligence and that is spying.
Do you deny there are patrols behind the lines of the People's Army?
Do the United Nations send out patrols?
Of course they do.
So do your lot.
So does every army.
What are they for, these patrols?
To see how the land lies.
And what is that, if it is not spying?
Soldiers are not spies.
What is the name of your superior officer in Intelligence?
- I cannot answer that.
- Why not?
I will not answer any questions on military matters.
- But you already have.
- I have not.
But you have.
We know your name, your rank, your number.
And you have confessed that you work in Intelligence.
You see, I know a great deal about you, Daniels.
Do you think of yourself as a brave man?
Not out of the ordinary.
I don't want them to use any more pressure.
You can save yourself a great deal of discomfort.
It's up to you.
But I want the answers mm and I want them now.
Who's your superior officer in Battalion Intelligence?
(Thinking) 'How the hell does he know I was in Battalion Intelligence?
'
- I'm waiting.
- 'Then wait a bit longer.
'Who could have told him?
'Is he guessing?
'
I am not able to answer any matters dealing with military personnel or equipment.
Is that what Lieutenant Morrison told you to answer?
'Morrison?
He knows it was Morrison!
'
You see, I know the name.
Are you surprised?
'Think boy.
If you say no, 'you're admitting it was Morrison.
'If you say yes, it's the same thing.'
Shortly before you surrendered, a patrol infiltrated our lines.
Where was that patrol to go?
Where was that patrol to go?
'Give yourself time.
Make the answer nice and long.'
I cannot answer any question relating to the whereabouts of patrols.
You are a very foolish young man.
Your life is in immediate danger.
What you have been through so far is nothing, compared with what you will be made to suffer if you do not give them the following information.
Where the patrol was to go.
How many men were in the patrol.
What its route out was and what will be its route back.
What the job of the patrol was, how long it was to be out and whether they had a radio.
Now...
You will give me these answers or else you will never see your mother and father again.
Or your brother, Alan.
Or listen to your jazz.
You will never lead a normal life again, should they return you to your country.
By the time they have finished with you, no one will recognise you, and you will recognise no one, for you will be both blind and deaf.
'Who's been talking?
How do they know about my kid brother and jazz?
'
I want your answers now.
I've already told you...
'Slowly!
Slowly.
Take your time.'
I don't intend to divulge anything which might prejudice the security of the United Nations' forces, and my duty as a soldier is to resist the enemy.
You are no longer a soldier and the communists are not your enemy.
Then why have you tied me up?
So you can be helped to see the truth.
Ugh!
We're not going to punish you.
We're going to cure you.
My colleague tells me you like to drink water.
Well, water is our medicine.
As soon as you show yourself cooperative, then you will be cured.
Tell me what I want to know about the patrol.
'They must have something big coming if he's worried about a patrol.'
You can go and...
'This is their torture chamber.
'What's he giving me drinks of water for?
'And why the towel?
'
'If they're not careful, they're gonna choke me.'
(Spluttering)
'Oh, my God!
That's why I'm here.'
(coughing)
You must tell me about the patrol.
Where it was to go, how many men were in it, the route out and back of the patrol, what it had to do and for how long and if it had...
'He's probably fried if I don't talk.
I'm not going to save HIS neck.'
Tell me what I want to know and this will stop.
- If you continue...
- 'I'll tell him.
- 'After the next lot of water.' - ...give me what I want.
'You bastard!
You bastard!
And you've got to tie me up to do it.
'I'm not that bloody helpless.' (Splutters)
'I won't give you what you want.
'One more lot of water.
One more lot of water and I'll tell them.
'I'll tell them...' (Spluttering)
'After the next lot, I'll do what they want.
'One more lot of water and I'll HAVE to tell them.
'Next time, that's it.
Next time I'll tell them everything they want to know.
'Then they'll stop the water.
I can't take any more.
'Each time it proves how wrong they are.
Each time he hits you...'
Tell me!
'Each time he hits you only proves how wrong they are.'
- Give me the answers!
- 'Proves how wrong they are.
- 'Each time he hits you...'
- Now!
'Each time proves...'
(coughing)
Agh!
You can go.
And then I shall send for you for another drink of water.
When I send you back, you will be face-to-face with your friend, who is to blame for all this.
(coughing)
(coughing)
(coughing)
Are you OK?
The water, eh?
You'd better get those wet things off.
- What are they up to?
- Working out a peace petition.
Let's have a look.
Hey!
"We the undersigned have been duped into joining the war in Korea
- "and ask..." - "implore" would be stronger.
"...not to place any obstacle in the way of peace-loving Chinese
"and North Korean people."
That ought to be good for a few fags.
What do you think you're playing at?
You going to let yourself be walked over like that?
You can write it out again.
I'm not going to.
- What's this about an armistice?
- Peace talks have started.
- What's up, Thornton?
- I've forgotten something.
I'll be back.
(Door slams)
Open the door.
What have you seen that makes you so scared?
Daniels here?
- Leave him alone, Ross.
- Look at him.
Why didn't you expect to see him?
- What have you been telling them?
- Let him go!
Stand by the door.
He's not leaving here until I know once and for all he's been talking.
(Coughs)
- Come away from that door.
- Stay there!
He's not getting out until he tells us the truth!
- You listen to me, Ross.
- You keep out of this, Daniels.
I've had a belly-full of that kind of talk.
You sound like they do.
That's what they said to me. "You won't leave till you tell the truth."
What are you going to do?
Work him over?
Away from there.
Come away from there, Daniels, or else you'll get it, too.
I'm warning you.
We've had just about enough of your "friend".
If anybody's got more right to do Thornton, it's me.
But I knew him before you did, Ross.
He was a decent enough fella and a good friend.
He can't shove his weight about and doesn't go round effing and blinding.
I know what he does go around doing.
Because you couldn't understand him, you pushed him outside your circle and that's just what they're waiting for.
Would you like to be on the outside, Ross?
Would any of you?
- He didn't have to work for them.
- There's no excuse for that.
I didn't say there was.
That's something he'll have to live with the rest of his life.
You're not free from blame.
You put your name to this.
Every time you take a few fags for a favour, you're working for them.
By turning on Thornton, you're doing exactly what they want.
They're out to break you up, turn friends into enemies, it's the only way they know.
There's only one way to beat them out here - be better than they are.
And look at yourselves.
What would happen if the RSN walked in now?
He'd do his bloody nut!
Daniels, you come.
You know what to do with those.
Bit by bit, too.
Not all at once.
It is time for the usual study.
The peace talks that have been instigated by the peace-loving Chinese communist forces are being sabotaged.
More than ever, you must be asking yourselves why are you here in Korea?
You must ask yourselves whether your own side are really interested in having you released.
We can offer you freedom from the capitalist oppression.
We are communists.
We therefore have studied the true feelings and needs of the people.
The communist cause is the right one.
We represent all the oppressed people of the world in their struggle for freedom.
What is your answer to that?
Get stuffed!
In Korea, I was Adjutant of the Glosters when we fought the Chinese at the Battle of the Imjin.
Almost all of us who survived the battle were captured.
The treatment that we received from our captors came as an unpleasant surprise.
We naturally expected that the rules laid down by the Geneva Convention for the treatment of prisoners of war would be observed.
It soon became apparent that the Chinese and North Koreans did not respect any such rules, but used methods designed to degrade us and to break our morale in order to convert us to communism...
for which we were totally unprepared.
We resisted them and they failed.
But we had to learn the hard way.
This film has been made, based on our experiences and supervised by an officer who was with the battalion at that time, so that you may know the practices of possible communist enemies and combat them successfully.
'This is a prison camp in North Korea.
'The year, 1950.
'Many men of the United Nations' forces had been captured 'after battle with the Chinese and North Koreans.
'But being a prisoner of war of this enemy 'didn't mean that the fight against communism was over.
'It had only just begun.
'This was a different enemy with different ways, 'and resistance was something more than keeping the guards busy.
'It was a matter of trying to keep your mind clear, 'your nerves sound 'and of knowing your friends.
'In communist hands, 'the greatest gift one man can give another is his loyalty.
'Some were able to.
'Others tried... and failed.
'And some didn't even bother to try.
'In these camps, the daily routine was not what any POW expected.
'There was no barbed wire, no machine gun tower, 'no nightly searchlight.
'There was also no Red Cross.
'The enemy said there was no need for them.
'In communist hands, everyone was safe.
'In fact, no one was even referred to as a prisoner of war.'
You are not prisoners.
You are students.
We give you the chance to study and to learn the truth, to show you how your leaders entangle the people in a web of lies.
You have brought what I sent you for, Thornton?
Read it out.
"The whole squad will attend classes at the fixed times
"and pay full attention to study.
"Sabotage of study will be regarded as a serious offence.
"After lectures, the whole squad will be organised for discussion,
"and a record kept of it for reporting to the authorities.
"Only the seriously sick are exempted from attending lectures
"and any other absence or bad behaviour will be punished."
What about the Geneva Convention?
Who's guilty of sabotaging study?
Confess!
We shall discover the guilty reactionary.
Who's the squad leader?
- Name the guilty one.
- Don't ask me!
Take them back to your hut.
...bloody great offensive so we can all get home for Christmas.
They won't get going till spring.
Are we going to be stuck here all winter while the British Army sits on their arses waiting for the flowers to come up?
They'll keep on sending out patrols.
- Shut up!
- They know about them.
- Shut up, I tell you.
- You've no authority here.
I'm still the only NCO in the squad.
Your rank means nothing.
I'm the elected squad leader.
Huh!
Phoney election fixed by them.
- Do you want the job?
- Why don't you two stop arguing?
"Why don't you two stop arguing?"
You're making too much noise for Thornton.
Watch it!
- One day you'll go too far, Ross.
- What do you mean?
How far do you reckon we are from the front line?
200 miles.
That'll be a fat load of good to us, sending out piddling patrols.
It's possible they'll try one more attack before winter clamps down.
I want you to take your patrol to a point overlooking this road here and watch for any signs of a move...
that's 15 miles inside their lines.
Take enough food to last about ten days.
About your route back.
You'll come through A Company's lines here.
- Any questions, sergeant?
- I don't think so, sir.
You must make it your responsibility to see that no letters are carried or photographs or souvenirs or any single thing that an enemy interrogator could make use of if you're captured.
The only thing you must carry is your FPW80, which I hope you've filled in correctly.
If you're taken prisoner, hang on to the top half and have it with you if you escape.
By the way, if you are interrogated, they won't worry about the Geneva Conventions too much.
I've been told the best way to avoid interrogation
- is not to get captured, sir.
- So it is.
And the best time to escape is as soon after capture as possible.
But if you are taken, remember, it's name, rank, number and date of birth.
I hope they'll be satisfied with that.
Morrison.
Grid reference?
That's another report of bumping their patrols.
Don't go bulldozing your way through tomorrow night.
- They'll nab you pretty damn quick.
- No, sir.
- Will that be all, sir?
- I think so, sergeant.
My corporal will be in the OP for a couple of days.
He'll guide you to your starting point in A Company's area and see you through the mines.
Good luck, sergeant.
- See you tomorrow night, corporal.
- I'll be waiting for you.
You'd better be.
Their patrols are on the increase.
Could be they're deliberately out to take prisoners.
Maybe.
No one's in for a cushy time who gets captured by the North Koreans.
- They've got experts behind them.
- Chinese?
Yes, and we know who's been teaching them.
You know why you are here in front of me now?
- Yes.
- Why?
You want to know who called out "Geneva Convention".
- Do you know who it was?
- Yes.
Will you tell me who it was?
I can't.
You've nothing to fear from me, if that's what is holding you back.
This photograph was found on you when you were captured.
Who are these people?
- My parents.
- Are you very fond of them?
Have you heard from your mother and father?
No.
They might send you a letter, and I wouldn't like to withhold it.
Especially as you don't seem to have many people to talk to here.
We know you're not happy in your squad.
You don't fit in.
You need more intelligent people.
Not louts like Ross.
- You didn't call out, did you?
- No!
Of course you didn't.
You've more sense.
Now you can go.
Oh, Thornton.
I'll see about your transfer.
It's a good thing I'm soft-hearted.
I doubt if any of my comrades would have let you off so easily.
I hope you kept your mouth bloody shut, Thornton.
You!
Inside.
Sabotage of study is as serious as all the other crimes you war criminals have committed.
You would like to kill me, wouldn't you?
Well, I would like to kill you for all the peace-loving Korean people you have destroyed, all the crops you've burned, all the homes you've bombed.
Do you know how many bombs have fallen on villages?
Ross!
Who called out "Geneva Convention", Ross?
Shut the door.
Was it Thornton?
I think it was Thornton.
In a way, I admire him for his courage.
- Thornton didn't do the calling out.
- Then who did?
I'm not saying, but you can take it from me it wasn't Thornton.
You don't like him very much, do you?
No.
Why?
No reason.
Is he a better soldier than you?
Better soldier?
The... creeping little clerk.
But a clerk can be a key man, especially in, say, the briefing of patrols.
The only patrol he's been on was to the bogs and back!
Do you think the tears of helpless Korean children, whose parents lie bleeding and dying, are any different from any other children?
Yet, in spite of all the misery you brought to this beautiful country, we Chinese can be lenient.
But don't make the mistake of thinking that our leniency is limitless.
Now give me the name of the saboteur who said "Geneva Convention".
There's nothing to say.
Do you realise that all medical supplies and rations will be withheld unless we have the identity of this man?
Yes.
Do you know who said it?
Yes.
Are you prepared to see your friends suffer needlessly?
- No.
- Then tell me who it was.
What happened to Simpson for painting Dreamland...?
You don't ask ME questions.
If you think that Simpson will be punished, you are wrong.
That isn't our solution.
The Chinese policy of leniency will enable Simpson to have the time and the opportunity to realise his error.
This man, too, will be dealt with in the same way.
Now, tell me who it was.
Me.
- Any news of Cole?
- No.
Look what they've given us.
I think I smell fish.
You won't find any in there.
They probably dangled a bit in front of it.
What are you looking for in Cole's things?
- Ah, wrap it up!
- Here, this is yours.
- That's not mine.
- Take your feet out the can.
This stuff's not bad, if you've lost your sense of taste.
Cole say you could borrow that?
Must be some kind of holiday, if we're getting stuff like this.
It's not a holiday, but yet another example of the lenient policy of your liberators.
There can be other rewards for other evidence of a change of heart.
Your decision to give up Cole was a wise one.
- Give up Cole?
- Here are some cigarettes.
As further proof of our sincerity.
- You hear what he said?
- "Decision to give up Cole"?
- What the hell is he talking about?
- Who told them it was Cole?
Well, who?
I went through sodding hell in that hut last night just cos I didn't want Coley to get it.
Now he has, cos of one of you.
What's the use holding out here when there are yellow bastards, inside and out?
What's the use?
Do you know what I was accused of?
Murdering men and women, making orphans out of Korean children, burning crops in a country I'd never heard of before.
I listened and said nothing, cos as he went on, I was thinking to meself,
"It don't matter cos the fellas in the hut are better than you'll ever be.
"I won't tell you nothing cos they won't, either."
I was wrong.
Someone did, and here we are, eating his reward.
What do you think they're doing to Coley while you're feeding your rotten selves?
Here, anyone want mine?
Ah, he'll get over it.
The important thing is, who squealed?
What have you started blushing for, Thornton?
Or can we have a good guess, eh?
- Why don't you say something?
- I have nothing to say.
- Oh.
Not here, maybe.
- Here we go.
- You've plenty to say in the office.
- Leave him alone.
- Coley's my mate.
- That why you took his mess tin?
Perhaps you knew he wasn't coming back here.
Well, there's no point in leaving them on the floor.
- Just get eaten by the rats.
- Looks like they've already started.
Thornton, come.
Why don't you move in over there?
They wouldn't have to keep on calling for you.
I'd like to know what he's going to start telling them now.
Sit down.
Put it on the bed.
How do you like your new squad?
You must be glad to be away from Ross.
I'm not with a new squad!
Hasn't your transfer come through?
I must speak with them in the office.
How interested are you in working for peace?
I'd rather have peace than war, if that's what you mean.
So I see.
Do you like apples?
Take one.
Thank you.
You were working for peace before you joined the army.
Why not finish what you set out to do?
What do you mean?
Weren't you active in the International Students Movement?
- How did you know I was a member?
- I have all the details here.
When you joined, the fact that you were three months behind with your subscription when you went into the army, your membership number, the number of meetings you attended, the questions you asked...
it's all here.
But how?
Because you and I were working for the same cause.
- But you're a communist!
- And so are you.
You mean the ISM is run by the Communist Party?
Like all the great movements promoting peace.
We have the backing of intelligent people all over the world... writers, doctors, artists, school teachers, scientists.
But what will happen to me if the others find out I'm a...?
Ross won't know, unless you tell him.
Anyway, you'll be transferred to a more sympathetic squad.
Right now, though, I need your help.
For what?
I need the name of the Battalion Intelligence Officer,
- just to complete a form.
- Lieutenant Morrison, do you mean?
- What's he like?
- Decent enough.
- Who works with him?
- A corporal.
Do you know him?
- Yes.
- How well?
He was my friend.
Did you go to his home?
Yes.
We used to listen to his discs there.
- What discs?
- Modern jazz.
Do you like classical music?
Some.
- What was his home like?
- Quite all right.
Very nice.
How did he get on with his parents?
Very well.
Has he any brothers and sisters?
He's got a younger brother, Alan.
- How old's he?
- He'd be about ten now.
What else did you and your friend have in common, besides discs?
We seemed to like the same sort of jokes.
- Did you go to his home often?
- Yes, he lived near the camp.
What is your friend's name?
Daniels.
- What is your rank?
- Corporal.
What is your job?
This will be of no use to you.
What is your job?
I'm only allowed to give you my number, rank and date of birth.
"Allowed"?
What do you mean "allowed"?
- Those are my orders.
- Who gave you those orders?
I can't answer that question.
You have surrendered yourself to us and are now under our orders.
You will give me the following names.
Who is the sniper?
Who is the Adjutant's clerk?
Who is the Signaller?
Who is the Intelligence Sergeant?
I can't give you an answer to any of those questions.
When your A Company's position was taken over by our victorious People's Army, a group of men was seen running into the darkness.
They are behind our lines now and will be caught.
You will tell me about them.
I was too busy fighting to see anybody.
Your stupid and reckless behaviour with a machine gun enabled them to get away.
Were you giving them deliberate cover fire?
I was too busy fighting to see anybody.
You will gain nothing by being stubborn.
Now, go.
Sit alone and consider your position.
- Where are you wounded?
- My back.
It hurts.
I can't move my legs.
Help us get up.
I can help you if you help me.
You will have medical attention and a doctor, if you tell me about the five men seen running into our lines.
- They're a patrol.
- Where were they going?
I don't know.
I only heard they're a patrol.
- What about seeing a doctor?
- Who said anything about a doctor?
- But you promised.
- You are mistaken.
Halt!
Now we're all in a camp, things'll be better.
Think so?
Listen!
Listen!
Look son, I know all about prison camps.
I had four years in them in the last lot.
These are not the Germans.
They're not the Japs, either.
Nobody knows yet what they're like.
Ah!
Don't be such a bleedin' pessimist.
Stop talking!
This new batch of prisoners.
Is there anyone you know?
- No, there's no one.
- Are you sure?
Yes.
You and I are working for the same cause.
It would be very awkward for you if the others got to know.
Are you positive there's no one you know?
Yes.
Is he the Intelligence Corporal that works with Lieutenant Morrison?
- Yes.
- Point him out.
- Seventh from the right.
- Is that the truth?
- Yes.
- You will stay until I come back!
- My name's Daniels.
- What's the news?
Any chance of them coming down the road next week?
Look, I just walked getting on for 150 miles.
- What mob are you from?
- Mind if I sit down?
This is where we live.
Is this it?
You sleep standing up the first week.
They've chucked the questionnaire at you?
We've all had to answer them.
"Social status?
Educational background?
- "Motive for enlistment?"
- Same old questions.
"Acquaintances with officers?
"State of family?" What are they running, a marriage bureau?
If you give them monkey answers, you'll find yourself filling up another and another.
And if they don't tally, you've had it.
"Party affiliations?
Thoughts?
Opinions of war?"
They can't expect me to fill this in.
I don't advise you to stick your neck out here.
- What does that mean?
- You'll find out.
Come on, let's drop it.
Give us some news.
What's the newspaper you've got?
- I'll have it next.
- It's four months old.
- Four months?
- The Daily Worker?
- What are you doing reading this?
- It's the only one we get.
- And you read it?
- Well, wouldn't you?
- You don't believe what's in it?
- Why not?
You saw their surrender leaflets.
You didn't walk across with your hands up, did you?
Look, let me give you a few tips.
Shift over.
- I felt like you at first.
- So?
You'll cool off when you've been here a bit longer.
I don't know what that means.
Reading this and filling these in...
You can't fight them here.
Why not?
Either you're for them or against them.
There's nothing else.
Is there?
That's what happens when you're against them.
- What's happened to him?
- He's taken a hammering.
- Who from?
- Someone up the cleaners.
Cleaners?
Where you get your head bashed in while you wait.
- Why?
- Cos he said...
Ask him!
Les Thornton!
I didn't know you were here.
- Hello, Harry.
- You know him?
We were stationed in the same camp.
Brought any discs with you?
- What's all this, eh?
- They want the form filled up.
They can wait.
We've got lots to talk about.
I'm supposed to take it back.
- You like it over at the office.
- Let him alone.
Why don't you tell your friend why Cole got beaten up?
- Go on.
Tell him.
- Tell me what?
Tell him! "Cole's like that because I got him taken away."
Go on.
Tell him!
Have you gone barmy?
There was you with the Daily Worker.
- Tell him who informed on Cole.
- I don't know.
- He's lying.
- Are you saying it was him?
Yes, I am.
- Did you inform on Cole?
- I didn't.
- He's lying.
- Where's your proof?
What more do you want?
Nobody else would have given him away.
- He's our mate.
- That's all the proof you need?
I never told them it was Cole.
They asked me, but I never told them.
- How do you know anybody informed?
- We were told.
- Who by?
- The hunchback.
The camp commandant.
You'd believe a communist before one of your own?
- Cole might have confessed.
- Why don't you ask him?
I'm going to.
He's dead!
The communist wants peace.
What about your people at home, your mothers and fathers, your wives?
Don't they want peace?
Don't they want you back with them?
Don't you want to be back with them?
It is the United Nations who are aggressors here, and their atrocities will never be forgotten.
Their bombs raining down on helpless villages.
And it is we who are accused by the United Nations of atrocities.
Us.
If you know of any, you must tell us.
I've seen them.
I've seen your soldiers keeping us from attending our wounded.
I've seen them leave men to die from hunger and thirst.
- I've seen plenty of atrocities.
- Lies!
Give me the name of the soldier who stopped you helping the wounded.
How the hell can I?
I can't even speak the lingo.
You think he'd have given me his name?
You are a liar!
These helpless villages, they're barracks and munitions depots.
The so-called People's Army turn everybody out of their homes and move in just like that...
I saw it on the way here.
What about this village?
What happened to the people who lived here before they took over?
Sure they want peace!
They want it so bad they have to murder Cole...
We just sat here and did nothing.
Sit down on the floor.
Turn round.
With your legs crossed.
And arms folded.
You will remain that way all day and every day.
When you have come to appreciate your wise and lenient treatment by showing your penitence for your filthy crimes, the opportunity will not be withheld from you for making a full and truthful confession.
Quickly!
- Yeah, shut up!
- Quickly!
Well, if you don't reckon it's worth eating, I won't touch it.
You've been brought up on it.
I don't want to grow up looking horrible, like you!
Thank you very much.
Hoejeonsikida.
And if that's good night, hoejeonsikida to you, too.
Learn the lingo.
Shut bloody up, you illegitimate son of Madame Butterfly.
For you, darling, I'll try sleeping on me left.
See you in the morning.
Daniels, wake!
Daniels, wake!
Wake, Daniels!
Come on.
Come on.
Wake!
Get up.
I thought it was time to get up.
The policy of the People's Volunteers towards war criminals can be one of leniency or suppression.
- The choice is yours alone.
- I'm not a criminal.
Stand to attention.
You will give me every name in your subversive group.
Confess your crimes.
I haven't committed any crimes.
You're wasting your time.
Are your sympathies with the Chinese People's Republic?
- No.
- You are a self-confessed criminal.
I am not.
If you have no sympathy with the Chinese People's Republic, then you must be against it.
- I'm a soldier.
- You are a war criminal.
Only the Chinese and the North Korean people are soldiers.
You have come to Korea to take part in an aggressive war.
Therefore, you are a war criminal.
You have been engaged in subversive activities to overthrow the authority of the People's Government.
I have not been engaged on subversive activities.
We can prove it.
Then bloody well prove it or let me sleep!
He's cracked.
Subversive activities?
He's definitely cracked.
- Ah, shut your gob!
- Sit!
Sit!
I can't just sit here doing nothing.
You know what talking to yourself's the first sign of.
Thinking about home too much is going to make me morbid, so I'd better ration meself to a bit each day.
If I had something to lean against it'd be a bit more comfortable.
There used to be a game we'd play as a kid, something like this.
Somebody turned his back, then we used to try and get to him.
Then he'd turn round quick to see if we were moving.
How do you do?
"Something" footsteps.
"Something" footsteps.
Playing it on the pavement outside the flat seemed more real than this.
Grandma's footsteps, that was it.
Wonder what's happening right now at home.
Back!
Back!
Quickly!
Quickly!
You are my heart's delight!
And where you are, I long to be.
Hi, hi, hi!
Now look at you!
You've put your effing plates all over Yorkshire!
If you're going to keep me up, I may as well make use of it.
Hey!
Where have you gone to?
Hey!
I want the lavatory.
Lavatory!
Let me out of here.
You know what a lavatory is, don't you?
No, perhaps you don't.
Until you confess to all your subversive activities, you will be kept there to rot.
You are there to repent and you will only be taken out when I say.
Or when you are dead.
I know what your trouble is!
You're all bloody well constipated!
Up!
Up!
Up!
Up!
Hi, hi!
Daniels, come!
I've brought you here to see how you're getting on.
Why don't you sit down?
I...
I've been sitting, thank you.
I'd rather stand.
Of course you have.
How thoughtless of me.
How are you feeling?
Oh, fine.
You don't have to pretend to me, you know.
Although I haven't experienced it myself, I have seen the effects of sitting still for 16 hours and then not being allowed to sleep at night.
Yeah.
It can send better men than you quite mad.
Are you afraid of going mad, Daniels?
Not particularly.
You know, there is no need for these discomforts.
No?
No.
All you have to do is answer my questions.
Will you answer my questions?
It all depends on the questions, doesn't it?
They won't be too difficult, if that's what's worrying you.
No, on second thoughts
I think you'll be able to answer them better after some sleep.
What's happened to old sweat-face?
This smooth character, is he his superior and ordered them to lay off me for a little?
At least he didn't spout any of that "subversive activities" tripe.
Careful, though, friend.
You'll begin to think this one's quite decent.
OK.
You have been guilty of another crime against the People's Volunteers.
I find you asleep.
What have you to say?
- I was told to sleep.
- You are lying.
I gave no such orders.
- It wasn't you.
It was the other one.
- There is no other one.
'Hey, wait a minute.
'That smaller one said you could sleep.
'You're not going Harpic.'
Sit as you were first told.
You have confessed to one crime.
Now you must confess to all the other crimes you have committed, including those you were guilty of before you surrendered.
- We already have the facts.
- Your facts are wrong.
'What facts could he have?
'So, I interrupted the political lecture.
What else?
'What crimes before I came here?
'Being in Intelligence isn't a crime.
Anyway, he doesn't know.
'Unless somebody told him.' ...activities are known to us, but because of the traditional policy of leniency, you will be given the opportunity to expiate your crimes.
I'm not a criminal.
I'm a prisoner of war.
And as such, I'm entitled to the protection of the Geneva Convention.
You came here to spy-spy-spy-spy.
And the penalty for that is death-death-death-death...
'Harry.
'Your father and I tried our hand at wallpapering last weekend.
'Although I say it myself, the front room doesn't look at all bad...'
You must confess to all your subversive activities.
- I have nothing to confess.
- But you came here to spy.
And the penalty for that is death.
I'm not a spy!
I'm a British soldier.
Why are you in Korea?
Why have you come to this beautiful country?
We have all the facts.
You came here as a spy.
This is your work, and the penalty for spies is death.
'Your last letter was very welcome, Harry.
'Your father and I are glad you've got a new job.
'I hope it's more interesting and what you want.
'You make it sound very mysterious, though!
'
What new job?
I said you would be shot, and so you will.
Here.
No one will know.
We are far from the camp and there will be no grave.
You'll have to answer to murder.
Who to?
All spies are shot.
That is understood all over the world.
I'm a British soldier and entitled to be treated as a prisoner of war.
You are a spy.
Working in Intelligence is not being a spy.
Huh!
Did I say you were in Intelligence?
Where did you get that idea from?
Not from me.
Tell us what you know about patrols.
You must let me sleep first and give me some food.
I...
I'm too tired.
I can't think straight.
Let me sleep and then I'll write it all out for you.
I've finished.
It's all there.
Read it out loud.
You want to study it first.
It's got drawings and positions marked.
I shall do that later.
First, you will read it, comrade.
"The night before I was captured I was on duty when a patrol was sent out.
"The instructions given by the officer were as follows:
"When you go down to the woods today, you're in for a big surprise.
"When you go down to the woods today, you'd better go in disguise.
"For every bear that ever there was will gather there for certain.
"Because today's the day the Chinese and North Koreans have their picnic.
"Picnic time is time for play."
Yes, I see.
Well, it's very simple.
You know what to do.
Daniels.
Move your arse!
You're blocking the view!
Come in!
Come in!
Oh, shut up!
- I'm not...
- Inside.
Quickly.
Oh!
Look who is here!
Ha-ha!
All right, all right.
Welcome to the Kennel Club.
- How long have you been here?
- Ssh!
Since we arrived, but don't let them hear you.
- Hey, I say!
- Yeah.
This lot's barmy, you know.
They're right round the bleedin' bend.
- You tell them that?
- Huh!
There's a lot wrong with Britain but I don't want any bloody foreigner telling me that.
All that "dupes of war-monger" stuff.
"You're the dupes," I said.
I tell them that when I was in German hands,
I never had to listen to this...
Is anybody else in here?
A fella called Simpson WAS here, but he's gone now.
Over there's a stool pigeon.
I expect they'll keep you in here quite a bit.
Don't think so, somehow.
I'm going to have a snooze before they come again.
Sleep's the prisoner's friend, they say, and waking up's his enemy.
Hey, thanks.
Thanks.
Don't let them get you down!
Every time they hit you only proves how wrong they are!
You are guilty of many serious crimes against the People's Army.
This latest one is the most serious.
For all your crimes, you will be sentenced by the authority of the People's Court.
If you confess in a truthful manner, then their traditional leniency will make itself apparent.
There is another way in which you can show your sense of shame, and that is by answering in a truthful manner the following questions.
My report on your behaviour will be read out in the court.
The list of your crimes is long.
You have spread anti-communist propaganda amongst your comrades.
You have lied in your questionnaire.
You have sabotaged property belonging to the People's Army.
You have, as a result of this, deprived your peace-loving comrades of the opportunity of learning the truth.
You have accused the People's Army of acts of cowardice and spread filthy lies about atrocities towards the peace-loving people of Korea.
You have insulted an officer of the People's Army who, because of the great and traditional goodwill of the Chinese people, spared your life, when he was within his rights under rules observed by every country to have you shot as a spy.
- I am not a spy.
- Young man!
You have already admitted that you work in Intelligence and that is spying.
Do you deny there are patrols behind the lines of the People's Army?
Do the United Nations send out patrols?
Of course they do.
So do your lot.
So does every army.
What are they for, these patrols?
To see how the land lies.
And what is that, if it is not spying?
Soldiers are not spies.
What is the name of your superior officer in Intelligence?
- I cannot answer that.
- Why not?
I will not answer any questions on military matters.
- But you already have.
- I have not.
But you have.
We know your name, your rank, your number.
And you have confessed that you work in Intelligence.
You see, I know a great deal about you, Daniels.
Do you think of yourself as a brave man?
Not out of the ordinary.
I don't want them to use any more pressure.
You can save yourself a great deal of discomfort.
It's up to you.
But I want the answers to my questions and I want them now.
Who's your superior officer in Battalion Intelligence?
'How the hell does he know I was in Battalion Intelligence?
'
- I'm waiting.
- 'Then wait a bit longer.
'Who could have told him?
'Is he guessing?
'
I am not able to answer any matters dealing with military personnel or equipment.
Is that what Lieutenant Morrison told you to answer?
'Morrison?
He knows it was Morrison!
'
You see, I know the name.
Are you surprised?
'Think boy.
If you say no, you're admitting it was Morrison.
'If you say yes, it's the same thing.'
Shortly before you surrendered, a patrol infiltrated our lines.
Where was that patrol to go?
Where was that patrol to go?
'Give yourself time.
Make the answer nice and long.'
I cannot answer any question relating to the whereabouts of patrols.
You are a very foolish young man.
Your life is in immediate danger.
What you have been through so far is nothing, compared with what you will be made to suffer if you do not give them the following information.
Where the patrol was to go.
How many men were in the patrol.
What its route out was and what will be its route back.
What the job of the patrol was, how long it was to be out and whether they had a radio.
Now...
You will give me these answers or else you will never see your mother and father again.
Or your brother, Alan.
Or listen to your jazz.
You will never lead a normal life again, should they return you to your country.
By the time they have finished with you, no one will recognise you, and you will recognise no one, for you will be both blind and deaf.
'Who's been talking?
How do they know about my kid brother and jazz?
'
I want your answers now.
I've already told you...
'Slowly!
Slowly.
Take your time.'
I don't intend to divulge anything which might prejudice the security of the United Nations' forces, and my duty as a soldier is to resist the enemy.
You are no longer a soldier and the communists are not your enemy.
Then why have you tied me up?
So you can be helped to see the truth.
Ugh!
We're not going to punish you.
We're going to cure you.
My colleague tells me you like to drink water.
Well, water is our medicine.
As soon as you show yourself cooperative, then you will be cured.
Tell me what I want to know about the patrol.
'They must have something big coming if he's worried about a patrol.'
You can go and...
'This is their torture chamber.
'What's he giving me drinks of water for?
'And why the towel?
'
'If they're not careful, they're gonna choke me.'
'Oh, my God!
That's why I'm here.'
You must tell me about the patrol.
Where it was to go, how many men were in it, the route out and back of the patrol, what it had to do and for how long and if it had...
'He's probably fried if I don't talk.
I'm not going to save HIS neck.'
Tell me what I want to know and this will stop.
- If you continue...
- 'I'll tell him.
- 'After the next lot of water.' - ...give me what I want.
'You bastard!
You bastard!
And you've got to tie me up to do it.
'I'm not that bloody helpless.'
'I won't give you what you want.
'One more lot of water.
One more lot of water and I'll tell them.
'I'll tell them...'
'After the next lot, I'll do what they want.
'One more lot of water and I'll HAVE to tell them.
'Next time, that's it.
Next time I'll tell them everything they want to know.
'Then they'll stop the water.
I can't take any more.
'Each time it proves how wrong they are.
Each time he hits you...'
Tell me!
'Each time he hits you only proves how wrong they are.'
- Give me the answers!
- 'Proves how wrong they are.
- 'Each time he hits you...'
- Now!
'Each time proves...'
Agh!
You can go.
And then I shall send for you for another drink of water.
When I send you back, you will be face-to-face with your friend, who is to blame for all this.
Are you OK?
The water, eh?
You'd better get those wet things off.
- What are they up to?
- Working out a peace petition.
Let's have a look.
Hey!
"We the undersigned have been duped into joining the war in Korea
- "and ask..." - "Implore" would be stronger.
"...not to place any obstacle in the way of peace-loving Chinese
"and North Korean people."
That ought to be good for a few fags.
What do you think you're playing at?
You going to let yourself be walked over like that?
You can write it out again.
I'm not going to.
- What's this about an armistice?
- Peace talks have started.
- What's up, Thornton?
- I've forgotten something.
I'll be back.
Open the door.
What have you seen that makes you so scared?
Daniels here?
- Leave him alone, Ross.
- Look at him.
Why didn't you expect to see him?
- What have you been telling them?
- Let him go!
Stand by the door.
He's not leaving here until I know once and for all he's been talking.
- Come away from that door.
- Stay there!
He's not getting out until he tells us the truth!
- You listen to me, Ross.
- You keep out of this, Daniels.
I've had a belly-full of that kind of talk.
You sound like they do.
That's what they said to me. "You won't leave till you tell the truth."
What are you going to do?
Work him over?
Away from there.
Come away from there, Daniels, or else you'll get it, too.
I'm warning you.
We've had just about enough of your "friend".
If anybody's got more right to do Thornton, it's me.
But I knew him before you did, Ross.
He was a decent enough fella and a good friend.
He can't shove his weight about and doesn't go round effing and blinding.
I know what he does go around doing.
Because you couldn't understand him, you pushed him outside your circle and that's just what they're waiting for.
Would you like to be on the outside, Ross?
Would any of you?
- He didn't have to work for them.
- There's no excuse for that.
I didn't say there was.
That's something he'll have to live with the rest of his life.
You're not free from blame.
You put your name to this.
Every time you take a few fags for a favour, you're working for them.
By turning on Thornton, you're doing exactly what they want.
They're out to break you up, turn friends into enemies, it's the only way they know.
There's only one way to beat them out here... be better than they are.
And look at yourselves.
What would happen if the RSN walked in now?
He'd do his bloody nut!
Daniels, you come.
You know what to do with those.
Bit by bit, too.
Not all at once.
It is time for the usual study.
The peace talks that have been instigated by the peace-loving Chinese communist forces are being sabotaged.
More than ever, you must be asking yourselves why are you here in Korea?
You must ask yourselves whether your own side are really interested in having you released.
We can offer you freedom from the capitalist oppression.
We are communists.
We therefore have studied the true feelings and needs of the people.
The communist cause is the right one.
We represent all the oppressed people of the world in their struggle for freedom.
What is your answer to that?
Get stuffed!
A way up in the heavens, far out in space.
In a beautiful gold and crystal palace right above the North Pole.
Lives a kind and jolly old gentleman.
Santa Clause.
Also known as Saint Nicholas.
The best friend of boys and girls everywhere.
But let's move in for a closer look.
Come along.
It's almost christmas, and I must finish the toys for all the good children on Earth.
I hope you'll pardon me, but you I musn't be late.
This is Santa's toyland, a sort of international toy factory.
Here are gathered boys and girls of different races and creeds.
They have come from many lands to help Santa bring joy and hapiness to all of the Earth's children.
These little helpers are from Africa.
Here are Santa's helpers from Spain.
Chinks from China lend a hand as well.
Boys and girls from England.
London bridges falling down, falling down, falling down.
London bridges falling down.
My fair lady.
Japan also helps Santa.
Talented children from the Orient.
Even Russia has a delegation.
The group from France.
Headed by Evette and Pierre.
German boys and girls help Santa too.
Here's a happy song from Italy.
The islands of the Caribbean.
The South American group includes Brazil and Argentina.
The countries of Central America.
Children from the U.S.A.
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb.
Mary had a little lamb.
It's fleece was white as snow.
It followed her to school one day, school one day, school one day.
It followed her to school one day, which was against the rule.
A neighborly group of helpers from Mexico.
Hello there.
Santa, do you like this devil?
Ah?
Devil?
Now let's see.
Don't think anybody ordered this.
Well now.
How does it work?
What is the sense of it?
Like this Santa.
You must light it.
Let's have it.
Stop.
I Lucifer, king of Hades command you to stop and disappear.
Begone!
All of you!
Except Pitch
You Pitch, chief of all my demons must listen closely.
The time is almost here when you must abandon the brimstone pits and journey up to Earth.
But this time you must not fail as you have done in the past.
You must not be defeated by that bearded old goat.
Santa Clasue!
If you do not defeat him, makeing all the children of the Earth do evil.
You shall be punished.
And instead of red hot coals, you will eat chocolate ice cream.
No.
No Lucifer.
King of all evilness.
Not that.
By the horns of everything satanic I beg you.
Form there I must not eat.
Frozen meals are bad for me.
Especially chocolate.
It's very bad for my digestion, which is so delicate.
Yes I promise oh priceless Prince of Hades.
That by many words I will finish your Santa forever, and see that the children commit terrible deeds, and make Santa Clause angry.
Well then.
And show the world who is its real master.
So be it Lucifer.
Demons of Hades transport me to Earth.
And so the devil rose to Earth.
You heard what he said to Lucifer, but will he be able to keep his promise?
On Earth, the children can hardly wait for Christmas day.
They gaze longly at the toys they hope Santa will bring them.
Here is a good little boy, who's daddy is quite rich.
This mother on the other hand is very poor, and this is her daughter Lupita.
Her fondest dream is to own a doll.
Any doll.
Who are these three?
Say.
It is rude to push and shove like that.
But the devil liked rude little boys, and it doesn't take him long to find them.
They're just right for his evil plan.
Well, one thing is certain.
The devil has turned them against Santa Clause.
Suddenly he is with them again.
Out of nowhere, he produces three rocks, and his evil plan goes into action.
This is bad.
Oh!
Ah!
Darn that devil.
Oh, I'm sorry, but that old devil is only been annoying me with his mischief.
If I could only go down there now, I'd put him in his place.
Heh.
What everyone knows I can only go down to earth on Christmas eve, and not before.
In the meantime...
(speaking in foreign languages)
A short while ago, I found a devil with four children, and one was a poor little girl.
Do you know who they are?
I got their names.
The bad boys are...
No no no no no.
The naughty boys are not important.
They will get punished in due course.
The ones I must reward are the other children, like the good little girl.
I got their names right here.
The girl is called...
Ah.
Better look through the telescope Pedro.
We'll find out what they're doing.
This is Santa's magic observatory.
What wonderful instruments.
The Ear-O-Scope.
The Tele-Talker that knows everything.
The Cosmic Telescope.
The Master Eye.
Nothing that happens on Earth is not known to Santa Clause.
By thy magic powers, look for the child we're seeking.
Whether she's in a cave or behind a million mountains.
All ready.
I think I found the girl.
Where.
Where is she?
In mexico.
Yes, it's lupita alright.
And she is still dreaming about that doll she wants for Christmas.
Lupita isn't thinking of stealing that doll.
Is she?
NO.
No, Lupita.
You shouldn't steal.
Put it back.
Lupits.
Lupita, come here.
It's yours.
Nobody saw you take it Lupita.
They have more, and they won't miss it.
What does one little doll matter?
Don't you see?
You haven't got any toys.
Keep it.
Hmm?
Don't listen to him Lupita.
It's bad to steal, and you will be sorry.
That's right.
Put it back.
Good girl.
Curses!
Curses!
Silly girl.
Now you're gonna have to do without a dolly.
Littles girls will steal, or do without the things they like.
Oh!
That's not true Lupita.
If you are good, somehow you'll be rewarded.
Hooray for her.
Hooray for her.
All my friends can ignore the devil.
All they need to win, is to be good in spirit.
...and the other children?
Come Pedro.
Find them.
By thy magic powers, look for the child we're seeking.
Whether he is in a cave or behind a million mountains.
Okay.
He's sleeping soundly.
His dream will appear on the Dream-Scope.
Connect the antenna for the Dream-Scope.
Let's watch the little rich boy's dream.
How strange, and what large gift boxes.
Would these be toys?
Why...
They contain what a child loves best.
His parents.
(Speaking in a foreign language)
A dream is a wish that the heart makes.
That little child is not wealthy.
He gets everything he wishes just by asking his parents.
The only thing this child wants is the love of his parents.
Don't they love him?
Maybe they do, and maybe they don't.
But soon he may find out the truth.
...and Lupita?
What do you think she might wish?
If she is alreay sleeping, we might be able to see her dream.
I wonder if our child is dreaming.
I recall when I was a little girl.
I often would dream of great riches.
that I had all the things I wish for, and... not a care in the world.
but at times, I also dream with the devil.
Confounded devil.
Why can't he leave Lupita alone?
Oh.
Just look at the old busy body.
He'll want to make Lupits steal again.
He'll be part of her dream.
How awful.
Better look at her dream now.
I've got me a dolly all dressed up in blue.
She is very pretty and in new blue shoes.
While I took her shopping she got sick and then.
When I took her home she got well again.
Why don't you steal her.
We can all be yours.
No.
You know that stealing is bad.
And I want to be good.
But you must learn to steal.
No.
You know that stealing is bad.
And I want to be good.
We dolls don't like good little girls.
No.
To steal is evil, and I don't want to be evil.
You must be evil if you want the doll.
No.
You know you shouldn't be evil., and I don't want to be evil.
Steal.
Tell a lie and we will all be yours.
No.
I don't want to be evil.
And telling lies is evil.
You want to be good, eh?
Do you want to be bad?
No.
You know stealing is bad, and I want to be good.
Well then, you'll never get a doll.
Mama, mama.
Poor little child.
Believe me, that old Pitch is going to pay for this.
The very minute I get to Earth he will pay for what he is doing.
And the three little boys, the ones who broke the windows, maybe they have done more mischief.
(Speaking in a foreign language)
Yes.
Look for them.
(Speaking in a foreign language)
The three boys are beneath a large bed, but they're speaking in a low voice.
Let's tune in the Ear-Scope.
Now we will learn exactly what they are planning.
I've got it.
We'll break our neighbor's window.
Yeah, and we'll steal that kid's toys.
He's got a lot of them.
If we were good boys, we'd get toys too.
What's the fun in that?
It's no fun to be good.
Anyway, Santa Clause doesn't care about us.
He's too far away.
Let's write him a letter and tell him we've been good as angels.
Do you think he is going to fall for that?
Sure he will.
I bet he can't even see well enough.
Too old to know what goes on.
What?
Me too old?
Heh, the devil is very many centuries older than I am.
Those youngsters have got their nerve.
Next to the devil, I'm just a child.
It's just that I haven't been well lately.
Bah, hah!
That really makes me...
Let's see who those boys are.
We'll see what they are up to.
Oh Ho.
There you are, you little rascsls.
Well, you might as well know I can see and hear everything you say.
I know when you've been bad or good.
- Did you hear that?
- I'll say.
Let's get outta here.
My dear, Santa Clause.
The only That I thing I wish for is that my parents can stay with me the night before Christmas.
I don't like to be alone, but the most important thing is that you bring me a little brother who is just about my age, because I get awfully bored.
I know it's hard for you, but maybe you could get me a papa.
That would be super.
I guess, even a mama.
A train with lots of tracks, and a bicycle too.
A live horse, an airplane that will fly.
...and I want a ball, big and red.
A pink pair of shoes, to wear on Sunday.
...and my two little brothers have behaved well.
You must see that get everything.
Santa Clause, Santa Clause, Santa Clause, Santa Clause, Santa Clause, Santa Clause,
Santa Clause, Santa Clause, Santa Clause, Santa Clause, Santa Clause, Santa Clause,
- Santa Clause.
- More Santa Clause?
- More Santa Clause.
- Off they go.
Santa Clause, Santa Clause, Santa Clause.
Wonderful.
Marvelous.
Stupendous.
Just look at all those letters.
They don't forget old Papa Noel.
Saint Nicholas.
Santa Clause.
Ah.
Let's see now.
My dear Santa Clause.
This year I have behaved very well.
I have been obedient, and have studied very much.
For that reason, please try to bring me these toys.
A toy automobile, a submarine, a football, a bat, roller skates, a scooter, a cannon, a rocket, a bicycle, an atomic laboratory, a machine gun...
Oooh.
Shoo...
Golly.
And many things.
Heh.
So be it.
And as my two little brothers have behaved very well,
Hmm.
You must see to it that they get everything.
Ha!
A flasehood.
Hmmm.
See.
There's no fooling Santa Clause.
Heh.
Into the liar's box.
Dear Santa Clause, please bring me a little brother.
Here's one for you Mister Stork.
Attention everybody.
The hour is drawing near for me to come down to Earth.
where all good children expect my arrival.
As you know, Christmas eve is almost here, and we still have tousands of thing to do.
Let's all make a big effort to get our work finished.
It's up to you.
Here is Merlin the wizard.
A little absent minded perhaps, but Santas most devoted helper.
Oh Merlin Merlin, where are you?
Mister Merlin.
- Mister Merlin.
- What what what
What's the matt...
Oh.
Santa Clause.
What a startle you gave me.
This new rainbow is quite unusual.
Ha!
I suppose you've Changed the colors again.
This one will surpass the others.
When the rays of the sun enter the rainfall...
Poof!
A variety of wonderful colors will fill the entire heavens.
Well Mister Merlin.
Tell me if the sleeping powder is a mix.
The dreaming powders that fill everyone with joy and goodwill, and the flower to disappear.
Er, ah, what's the day, eh?
On the Earth, it's the eve of the 25th of December.
Oh.
Sure it is.
In three minutes,
They'd be ready.
I shall reveal to you the secret of the magic star dust concocted by Merlin, which is unsurpassed for sound sleeping.
Please, let me go by.
To begin with, you need an urn.
Which is an alloy of copper, nickel, uranium, plutonium and platinum.
Yessiree.
Hmm.
Oops. uh...
Oh, what a dummy I am.
I forgot the urn.
And without the urn I can't mix the ingredients.
Can I?
No you can't.
Eight scoops of rose colored pollen, from the marvelous moon flower.
Nine sccops of pollen from the lazy yana.
And the red pollen from the morpheus plant.
One, two, theree, four scoops.
The last ingredient is the most important thing.
Oh Gosh.
What a memory.
I keep forgetting the urn.
Some powder from the wings of the butterfly papayalicious craffe, that flies among the nebulose mists and vapors of evening time.
And which only I have been able to keep in captivity.
My furnishing with my magic, and that big window there, the lights of the heavens.
All set.
See, this time I didn't forget the urn.
Now...
You freeze it with a light blue flame of frozen fire.
And next thing, it's ready.
So, as you have seen, it's very simple.
Right?
Let's see now.
Open up your pack.
Ahhhh-huh!
And the dreaming powder that fill everyone will joy and goodwill.
You know about them?
The only thing you have to do Santa, is to remember that you must sift them.
The same as last Christmas.
Don't you remember?
Ah, yes.
I am afraid I have forgotten.
As a man continues to get older, he begins to forget everything.
Every year, my memory fails me more, and it seems I am good for nothing.
- And the flower to disappear.
- What flower?
To disappear.
You've disappeared?
You're really in bad shape.
The flower to disappear.
Oh, well!
Here you have it.
Smell it and "pfft", you disappear.
Well, well, uh.
What do I have to do to make myself visible again?
Ohhh.
What's happened to your memory?
Can't you remember anything?
The same as last Chrismas.
Why of course.
Much obliged to you Mister Merlin.
I'll be back again to see you next year.
Next, Santa clause on the master blacksmith and key maker of the palace.
My dear key maker.
The golden key that opens all doors is ready Santa.
It is at your disposal.
It think you'll agree it's a real work of art.
It has no equal.
Thank you, my dear key maker.
Only you could make a key such as this which would turn the lock of every door on earth.
Please try it on the locks of a thousand magic portals.
And as Santa tries out the magic key of gold, it opens door after door.
What's this?
Santa dancing?
No indeed.
Santa must watch his waistline, and reduce his tummy if he is to get down all the chimneys.
There, see?
Santa has reduced his waisteline.
It may not seem so, but he fits into the chimneys alright.
Trans Heavenly Airway Flight S C 707 Super Reindeer Special
Red Carpet Flight to Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn via the Milky Way, is now boarding.
Let's have a look at Santa's famous sleigh, and his reindeer.
Santa's helpers from all nations sing happily as they come to make sure that everything works properly, and that the sleigh and reindeer will shine brightly in the Christmas sky.
(singing in a foreign language)
(speaking a foreign language)
Sure it's not a bad idea to use modern space ships for our interplanetary flight, but to convert my white reindeer into Sputniks?
Nooo.
I should say not.
And besides, just to go to Earth
The suit me well enough.
Well I guess we're all glad about that.
Maybe a Sputnik would be faster.
But I can't quite imagine Santa Clause without his reindeer and his sleigh.
Could you?
Here's list of all the kids, names and addresses.
Well, just put it over there.
Well thank heaven, I still have a very good memory.
Hey?
And I know every single child on Earth.
Well, just to make sure, why don't you take it with you.
I've really got to hurry.
It's almost time for the crystal clock on the wall to strike ten.
Don't forget that you've got to return to the castle ahead of the sunlight, because the sun will turn the reindeer into dust.
No siree no.
I'll be here all right.
In that case, I couldn't get back to the castle.
And on what they use for food I'd perish, because here our main food is pastry and ice cream made of soft clouds.
And on the Earth there's no such thing.
What food do they eat on Earth Santa Clause?
Oh, everything in sight.
They eat most of the animals, the plants, the flowers, the roots, birds, even smoke and alcohol.
But enough of this talking.
We're wasting time and I must be off.
(Children singing horribly)
"Hurry up my children.
Get on with your packing.
"It's the night for Santa Cluase to fill all those stockings".
(Children singing horribly)
"Merry, merry greetings.
I take to one and all."
"Oh hurry if you want to, enjoy the yuletide fun."
(Children singing horribly)
And now, Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to all.
Merry christmas.
Let's see if I have everything.
The bag with the powders for dreaming of joy and goodwill.
The flower to disappear.
The golden key that opens all doors.
The sleigh, and now I better make sure my reindeer are running.
Yes, Santa's sleigh is really a huge toy sleigh, and he has to wind it like any other toy to make it go.
Be off my reindeer, and glide to the heavens as fast as you can go.
My my powers of gold and crystal enjoy peace.
And jesus the son of God join us on Earth so that we can all have joy and goodwill.
On, my good reindeer.
Phew.
That was close.
He almost ran into the moon.
And here's the planet Earth.
I wonder where Santa will go first.
Europe.?
Africa?
America?
Think of all the nice things you'll get from Santa Clause.
Yes mama.
That's a good boy.
See you in the morning.
If you get bored, you can go down and practice your piano lessons.
See you later my darling.
I knew it.
The devil is nearby and these three certainly are up to no good.
Okay, listen now.
As soon as Santa Clause lands on the roof here, all three of us will jump on him.
We'll tie him up and we'll stick him in the sack, and then we'll go home with all of Santa's toys.
But what about Santa?
We can make him our slave, and all his candy and toys will belong to us, so whenever we want something...
Oh boy, this is going to be fun.
You better not talk now.
He can hear us and get away.
Alright children, to bed.
Santa Clause will be here any minute now.
Mama, and who is Santa Clause?
He's the man in the store.
The one with the red suit and the white beard, that was laughing very much.
And does Santa know about me?
Uh-huh.
Is he real like my daddy?
He's not.
Not really.
***
The real Santa lives in a castle, and comes once a year.
What does he come for?
They say he *** the children who are obedient.
I don't think he likes me.
He has never brought me any dollies.
It's... not that.
Maybe you forgotten to ask him for a dolly.
And if I ask him for one now?
Go ahead.
Perhaps he will hear you.
We can say it.
Pray it dear.
Mama, please don't cry.
It's definitely Christmas.
And Christmas always makes me feel sad.
It brings bad memories.
Mama, what is Christmas good for?
Well, to remind us that Christ was born many years ago and he was even poorer than we are.
He was born in a bed of straw.
Know what mama?
I have already asked Santa Clause for two pretty dollies.
If he brings the two, I give one to little Jesus.
Yes my darling.
Maybe we pray with all our might.
Hm?
While Santa steers his sleigh towards Earth, old devil Pitch waits his arrival.
Here comes Santa now.
First stop, Mexico City.
Brrrrr!
It's freezing.
I wish I were back in hades, tending the furnace.
He's heard Santa.
By Satan, there he is.
I'm glad that I'm prepared to upset his whole merry Christmas.
We will see who wins out.
This is one night that no one can take from me.
What's he going to do?
Oh, Ho.
He's going to push the chimney out of place so that poor old Santa won't be able to enter this house.
Let's hope that Santa realizes what's happened.
What's happened here?
I can smell sulfur.
Well, that must explain this.
That old devil Pitch must be around here.
Santa's determined to get in.
He'll find a way.
He's not one to give up.
Well, there's more than one way to beat the devil.
Santa will jump down, using his magic parasol.
Old Pitch hadn't counted on this.
He's almost green with anger.
Uh oh.
These two seem to know that Santa is in the living room.
Look out Santa, they'll see you!
Why of course.
Santa can handle this.
All he has to do is use the magic dreaming powders prepared by Mister Merlin.
And it isn't long before our two little "Stay up Lates"
are sleeping soundly in their bed.
Now what?
Must be Pitch, putting the chimney back in place.
Well, the devil doesn't give up either.
And he seems to be quite happy about his next plot against Santa.
Could Santa be coming down this chimney now?
Uh oh.
He's alright, but that was close.
My goodness.
Pitch is foiled again.
But suddenly, he thinks of something else to do.
That's it.
He'll huff and puff until his burning breath turns the door knob and key hole red hot.
So the that magic key won't work, and Santa will burn his hands.
First he'll see if it's hot enough.
Huh.
What do you think of that?
But Santa sees what Pitch is up to, and he isn't afraid.
Meanwhile, Pitch looks out the window to watch Santa burn his hand.
Doesn't seem to know he is right behind him.
Oh ho.
A cannon.
Now it's Santa's turn to get even with Pitch.
Here in truth, is a poor little rich boy.
He has all the toys a little boy could wish for.
Yet, he is sad and lonely.
Lonely for his parents.
In spite of all he has, he lacks the most important thing in life.
The company of his mother and father.
I know all those toys don't you happy, but I'll do something for you that I only do for children who are very good.
I will let you see me as I am.
And therefore I will use the powders that will make dream that you are awake.
And now, awaken while you're dreaming.
SantaC lause.
You love me, don't you?
Say you love me Santa.
Of course I love you sonny.
Just as much as your parents, because no one loves a child as much as his parents.
Only at times, the parents don't understand their children, and the children don't understand their parents.
And are you really sure that they love me?
When I am left all alone?
Yes.
Of course they love you.
And you must believe that love you.
And now, go back to sleep again.
It was all a sweet dream.
When you awaken, I wish you much happiness.
- How pleasant to see you.
- Hello there.
- George
- Merry Christmas
- Oh, merry Christmas
- Thank you.
- Good bye
- Good Bye
It's been a long time since I have seen the Martins.
They're both looking pretty well though, aren't they?
That's a strange coctail, isn't it?
It's the coctail of remembrance, which only I can prepare.
Whoever drinks it will think of that, which is most dear, and which at times, for some unknown reason we seem to forget
That's a beautiful thought, perhaps we need a reminder.
Very possibly we forgotten someone we love.
Love can be expressed in many ways, but the truest love is that which we give without expecting anything in return.
The greatest reward for those who sincerely, is love itself.
So drink my coctail and you will become aware of that love which is closest to your hearts.
And those without love?
They coouldn't drink this cocktail, as it would burn their throats.
Well, since we are very much in love.
May it always be that way.
Now that's strange.
Where did he disappear to?
I don't think he was just a waiter.
He didn't seem to be strange.
That kind look.
The white beard.
I knew that face when I was a child.
Couldn't be.
If his beard was white when you were a small girl, he'd be dead and buried by now.
Now that's strange.
I suddenly have an urge to see our little boy.
Let's go home.
Poor Billy's always alone.
I feel that he is needing us too.
He'll be so glad.
Come on.
Pitch hasn't done too well by himself against Santa.
So he's back to the seek help of these boys who so far are the only ones willing to listen to his evil plan.
They may think it's smart to help him now, but they'll be sorry.
For his advice can only get them into troouble.
One of us better get over there behind the water tank and take the rope along.
When we spot Santa Clause...
...Zowey!
We'll pull the rope and knock him down.
Got it!
That's for me.
See.
It works.
You got ***?
Oh boy!
Santa Clause is on his way.
Get your head down.
Here comes Santa.
How can you be so dumb?
Stupid fools.
You certainly turned our plan into a horrible mess.
He'll never lick me.
I can promise you that.
I'll make him pay dearly for al of this.
Oooh!
That scared me.
The light almost blinded me.
- That music was so loud.
- Scared me too.
What a noise.
Hey, maybe Santa Clause got something in our house.
- Shall we go see?
- Yeah.
Let's go.
- Some present for our Christmas.
- Santa Clause doesn't like us.
We didn't get anything.
Why don't you start a fight?
It's all your fault.
It was your idea.
Don't be a sissy.
We are complaining.
Well anyway, it was his idea that we should go up by the roof.
My idea?
The fault is all yours.
I'm going to bed.
I am tired.
Coward.
You kicked me when my back was turned.
You be glad it wasn't me.
In that case, it was you.
And you haven't got the nerve to say you didn't.
That's it that's it.
Terrific.
Ha ha ha.
Haaa.
Beat your brains out.
At least I've got the bad thing.
Lucifer will be very pleased.
- I'll beat you.
- Gimme that.
- Ow.
- Ouch.
Cut it out.
See you later.
Oh no!
Mister Pitch has decided to steal Santas' sleigh.
That's a relief.
The reindeer won't obey him.
Tough Luck Pitch.
Uh oh.
A pair of scissors.
Look out Santa.
Sulfur.
That old devil Pitch must be around somewhere.
Oh my.
Mister merlin's Magic Dreaming powders.
Now Santa wont be able to put anyone to sleep.
On, my heavenly reindeer.
For there is much to be done.
And there goes the flower to disappear.
And now Santa won't be able to make himself invisible.
What are you going to do now Santa?
Let us hope the flower to disappear doesn't fall into bad hands.
Meanwhile Santa goes on his way, not knowing that his dreaming powders and his flower to disappear are gone.
Santa is not afraid of that dog.
If he goes after him, he still thinks he can disapper.
Go get him Dante.
Sic that old goat.
ite him.
Finish him off.
How can old Pitch be so mean?
Siccing a vicious dog on Santa like that?
Powders.
The flower to disappear.
No powders and no flower?
What do I do now?
Run Santa.
Climb the tree.
It's you only chance.
Get out!
Go away!
Go!
Shoo!
Get out!
That should do it.
That's a very funny sight.
Old white beard and his sack.
Running as if the devil himself were going to take him below.
You'll pay for your mischief.
You just wait and see.
Hmm.
But first you'll have to come down from that tree.
And I can have a lot of fun before you can get rid of Dante.
Because you know what I am going to do?
I am going to wake up everybody.
Hah.
Nobody can hear your voice.
They hear it in the form of their own private imagination or ideas.
Let them see how foolish you appear.
There's a prowler out there.
He's come to kill your wife and your children.
He is really quite vicious.
He's hiding up in your tree.
Defend yourself.
He's going to murder you.
He's going to murder you.
(indistinct whispering)
Mr. Merlin!
Key Man!
Key Man!
Apparently no one is in Santa's magic obserbatory.
Try to awaken.
There's a man outside.
Marie?
Marie, get up.
I think that we're in danger.
- What?
- Yes.
Oh yes.
The assassin that's out in back.
Assassin?
I'm not going.
Harry!
Get out of bed.
Go after him!
.
Show me, where's the pistol?
Where you keep it.
- In the drawer?
- In the drawer.
- In the drawer.
In this drawer.
- Why, in this one.
...or, or in this one.
- Here it is.
Go after him.
- come on.
Don't be funny.
- Me?
- Yes.
but I, But I...
(coughing)
With this cough, I can't be expected to go out.
I might catch pneumonia.
(coughing)
Come on.
Snap it up.
Pneumonia or no pneumonia, you go.
you go.
But marie, understand.
Why don't you get your father?
- Huh?
- Wait, I must put on my robe.
- Here it is.
-Stop fooling around.
Don't waste time.
Help, Police!
Help, Police!
In the tree there's an assassin.
Please come quickly.
Help.
Police.
A murderer.
Run father.
Fire department.
Firemen.
Firemen.
My house is burning.
I'm on fire.
You don't believe me?
Mercy.
This is a five alarm fire.
Better let me have that address please, won't you?
Don't expect anything from Santa Clause.
He doesn't bring toys to poor children.
Didn't I tell you to keep that doll?
Silly!
So now you won't have anything.
You are poor.
- Mama, mama.
- What is it dear?
Do the poor people get anything from santa Clause?
Who told you that?
Oh.
No my darling.
Santa Clause is good to all of the children who are obedient.
It's no matter if you are poor or wealthy.
To bed now my darling.
And sleep well.
Look mama.
It's almost day, and Santa Clause hasn't come.
Sleep now darling.
Sleep now, and you will see.
Maybe when you wake up you'll find a dolly.
But go to sleep now, and have pleasant thoughts.
My poor little Lupita.
Who can tell if that Santa Clause will go to our house this year?
Merlin!
Merlin!
Merlin!
Key man!
Help me!
That did it.
The family's awake now.
- Hurry up or you gotta get a ***...
- Hurry Harry, you go first!
- No.
Please ladies first.
- No.
There's no time for manners.
- I'm not going to be the first to go.
- Let's all go back to bed.
Hey everyone.
I wanna to play cops and robbers.
- Oh My...
- Cops and robbers...
- Alright...
- That's it...
Merlin.
Mister Merlin.
Eh.
Eh, what's that?
Can you run?
Follow me.
Can I run, and follow you?
Better tell me what's the matter.
And I'll decide whether I should run, and whether I should follow you.
Eh?
Santa Clause is in danger.
He's calling you urgently on the Tele-Talker.
Oh well.
In that case, we better hurry.
Let's fly now.
One for the money.
Two for the show.
Away we go.
Hurry Mister Merlin.
This is no time to play horses.
Santa is in danger.
- We better analyze the situation.
- You're the bravest one here
You can take care of a million men.
Let them all see now, that the only brave one here, is you.
All the men are cowards.
You are a woman.
Put them to shame now.
- Are you sure the "wistol perks"?
- What?
- I mean the pistol works.
- but of course it works.
- Bahhh.
If I were only your age...
- Hah, if I were your age, you wouldn't matter if I lived or not.
You both save us both, but neither of you will go out there.
Alright, you heard what she said.
You go first.
No.
We bothe go.
We'll both go, and see what happens.
The Red cross, the fired department, the police.
What a jam poor Santa's in.
Everyone will see him.
Do you hear those sirens?
They're for you.
The show is about to begin, and you'll never get back before sunrise.
Your reindeer will turn to powder.
You will starve to death.
And I will rule the Earth.
Santa Clause.
Santa Clause.
- It's me.
Merlin.
- Merlin.
Merlin.
Merlin.
Where are you?
Here, in the observatory.
Wha.. what is the matter?
In just a few minutes it's going to be day.
Return now.
They got me in a tree Merlin.
I dropped the flower to disappear.
And also the powders for dreaming.
And this beast just won't let me come down.
All this confusion has been prepared by Mister Pitch.
Wait now.
Hurry Mister Merlin!
Hurry!
Run!
Where do we find Santa Clause?
He's already been to Asia, Europe and Australia.
He must be on the American continent.
I think I see him.
He's in Mexico.
Doh, golly, but he is in a terrible fix.
And there is no time to go to his rescue.
And the sun is about to rise.
Bad dog.
Mad dog.
Against good is bad.
Against black is white.
Against a bad itch, scratch it.
Against thirst, water.
Against mad dog.
Against mad dog.
Against mad dog.
A cat.
A cat.
A cat.
A cat.
A cat Sabta Clause.
A cat.
Please be quick Merlin.
Now hear this.
My time is almost over.
This time it's serious.
Against mad dog, a cat.
Use one of the toy cats that you wind up.
And the dog will go after the cat.
Shoo.
Shoo shoo shoo.
Shoo.
Shoo.
Let's go now Altogether now, but don't push me.
Don't push me.
Just a minute.
You make me nervous.
- Oh come one.
Hurry up.
- I can handle this,
- but don't leave me alone, huh.
- Alright, we're with you.
Come on.
Where's the body?
How many are injured?
They'll surely find Santa.
Nothing in sight.
Can't see anything.
Better look around.
Don't push me.
Leave me alone.
No.
Don't do that.
- Oh, huh, oh.
- Why don't you shoot?
- Oh, it's only a hose.
- Be careful it may be a whole gange but don't worry.
Try to be brave.
Be calm.
We must all be brave.
That's it.
The hose.
- Run for the house.
- ...get wet.
Hurry.
You barely have time now.
I still have one more friend to visit.
I musn't fail her.
- But...
- No "buts" about it.
First come the children.
I'll see you later, if possible.
What happened?
Did you find anyone?
We've looked all over the place, and there's no one to be found.
Let's make sure the fire's out.
There's some smoke, over there.
Well.
That serves him right.
The old troublemaker.
He'll probably catch a pneumonia, but he asked for it.
Wait!
The flower to disappear has fallen right into Lupita's house.
- Did you find work?
- Nothing my dear.
Nothing!
Mama.
I saw Santa Clause.
I am very happy I did.
He couldn't stay and talk to me for a very long time, because his white reindeer would turn into powder.
Yes darling, yes.
But now go back to sleep, it is very late.
Just go ahead and think of all those wonderful things.
Then, was I just dreaming mama?
Do you think he left ma a dolly, outside in the backyard?
Maybe next Christmas.
Not this one.
but he said it was a beautiful dolly.
Look-it mommy.
Isn't it a pretty dolly?
Know what mama?
That star that's shining out there is a palace of crystal and candy.
The home of Santa Clause.
He's just a *** with his sleigh and white reindeer.
Thank you Santa Clause.
Goodbye Santa Clause.
Thank you for a wonderful Christmas.
And so once again, Santa returns to his palace from his yearly Christmas round.
He us happy, gay, for once again he has brought joy to the children of the world.
Blessed are they who believe, for they shall see God
Peace on Earth, good will toward men.
Merry Christmas.

MAN:
Oh, Breel?
It's the 15th.
I know, Walker.
I haven't got the money.
None of it?
No.
Fifteen thousand dollars is a lot of money.
My luck has been bad and--
You wouldn't use that.
You could kill a man.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
Would you, Jerry?
It would be interesting to find out.
Please, Mr. Walker, you've got to give me a chance.
I'll get you your money.
When?
Give me a week?
A couple of days, then?
Please, you won't regret it.
All right.
You've got 48 hours.
If I were you, I'd make every minute count.
( mysterious theme playing )
( romantic music playing over radio )
To the prodigal.
Well, Hans, been behaving yourself lately?
Mm-hm.
I'm the soul of virtue.
No gambling?
No other complications?
I've been much too busy.
Irene, I've been a tremendous success as a diamond broker.
I was a fool for so many years.
You, a fool?
I can't imagine you being a fool, Hans.
Unless it would be over a woman or a gamble.
A fool to be a diamond cutter, to work for a salary.
( chuckles )
Do you still have your Pundit Dream, the uncut diamond?
Mm-hm.
I still have it.
Let me see it again, darling, will you?
I think I may have a buyer for it.
All right.
As a matter of fact, I have it right here.
I was going to take it to Schoenbeck in the morning to see if he could cut it for me.
HANS:
Like an old friend, seeing it again.
I think I know every little tricky grain in it.
Do you have a buyer for it, Hans?
I think maybe, perhaps.
Yes.
How much?
I'll try to get 15,000, Irene.
Fifteen thousand?
Why, if the Dream's cut properly, it's--
You know, it's a very difficult stone, very risky.
Sure, it can be worth 80,000, but if it shatters in cleavage, it won't be worth being swept up from the floor.
No, no, no, 15,000, but safe, guaranteed.
How did you know I needed money right now?
( chuckles )
( suspenseful theme playing )
HANS:
At least 50 good carats if it's a point.
Obviously, my dear, you can make a most handsome profit.
Adolph, what do you think?
I have seen this stone before.
It is the Pundit's Dream, a very difficult stone.
Virginia, if properly cleaved, it can bring at least $100,000.
With this one, the risk is very great.
I wouldn't try to cleave it.
Too dangerous.
Everything seems to be too dangerous for you now, old man.
Hans, perhaps I shouldn't take the risk.
Things are--
Well, things haven't been going very well since father died.
I have to run this business all by myself, you know.
Listen, my dear, there isn't really any risk.
I'll cleave it myself.
I've studied it very carefully.
We can get an opinion from Schoenbeck or Hillary, or whatever expert you want.
This is your chance to make a big profit.
Yes, it is, isn't it?
Oh, it could solve so many problems for me.
Just think, Adolph, if I could sell this stone for even $60,000...
You really think it will work, Hans?
Darling, I promise you.
VIRGINIA:
Oh, I want to believe you.
HANS:
Then do.
Well, even if I did buy it,
I can't raise the 30,000 right away.
How much can you get?
Oh, probably half.
HANS:
Well, that's splendid.
Fifteen thousand now, fifteen thousand later on.
Miss Bedford will accept.
( chuckles )
You won't regret it, darling.
( mysterious theme playing )
WOMAN:
That's a picture of my husband, Hugo, and my little girl Kathy, taken two years ago in Chicago, Mr. Mason.
Do you think that you'll be able to help me?
Well, Mrs. Werner, if your husband disappeared 18 months ago, why have you waited until now to try to find him?
But I have tried, as much as I was able.
You see, Kathy and I inherited a joint trust fund of $90,000 from my father.
Hugo persuaded me to let him invest the fund so the value could increase.
Now, what did he do with the money?
Well, he gambled it all away.
I didn't even know about it until after he left me.
He said he was leaving the town on business.
He's a diamond expert, you see, a cutter and broker.
Did you notify the police?
That would have meant scandal, Mr. Mason.
But you must have made inquiries?
Well, yes, I did.
And I have reason to believe that he's here, here in Los Angeles right now.
Mrs. Werner, why do you want to find your husband now?
Oh, I don't want anything for myself, but he's got to pay back the money that he stole from my child.
Well, first, we'll have to locate him before we take any legal action.
I'll put the Drake Detective Agency on it.
Oh, uh, Mr. Mason, I, uh...
I'm not prepared to pay you right now.
I thought that if I could find him, uh, maybe I can arrange--
Yes, it's-
- It's all right, Mrs. Werner.
We'll work it out.
You can be reached at your hotel?
Yes.
Thank you very much, Mr. Mason.
Goodbye.
Bye.
Bye.
Did you notice the perfume she was wearing?
Mm-hm.
Eternity,
$150 a half ounce.
( suspenseful theme playing )
Seven-high straight.
Well, ha-ha.
That cleans me out for tonight.
I'd like to get back at you, if you'd advance me a little credit.
For just till tomorrow.
I'll have more cash then.
We'll have a game tomorrow.
I dropped $15,000 here tonight!
Breel, Jerry Morrow was asking about you.
( ominous theme playing )
You know Morrow.
Walker's boy?
( rings )
Hello?
( over phone ):
Virginia, this is Hans.
Oh, is anything wrong?
No, nothing personally, my dear.
I've just had an urgent call from Miss Bedford.
She's got to have the rest of the money for the Pundit Dream right away.
Oh, but you said I didn't have to pay it for 30 days.
Hans, I-I can't possibly borrow any more from the bank.
How 'bout Schoenbeck?
He's an old friend of your father's.
Ask him, Virginia.
Well... all right, dear.
I'll call him first thing tomorrow.
Bless you, darling.
You've saved my life.
Very dangerous.
Very.
Is this yours, Breel?
Yes.
You recommend cleaving, not sawing?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
And you, Adolph?
I recommend nothing.
I think it is disaster.
It's probably the best approach, Breel.
Then you recommend cleaving, like that?
If it must be done, yes.
Will you lend me $10,000 on it, Mr. Schoenbeck?
No, Miss Trent.
No?
But I'll buy a half interest in it, right now, for $10,000.
Virginia, no.
Don't give it away.
It could be worth practically nothing too.
Schoenbeck, if I cleave it now, will you lend her the money?
If it is successful.
All right.
Let's set it up.
( suspenseful theme playing )
( shattering )
( ominous theme playing )
I don't know any other kind of gambling where you can lose so quickly.
We had to try.
A hundred thousand dollars one moment, chips and splinters the next.
Oh, Hans, what can we do?
HANS:
They're worth something.
A few thousand, anyway.
I'll take them downtown.
Hans.
Well, Mrs. Werner?
It's Hugo.
Calls himself Hans Breel these days.
No, wait.
Wait, I must talk to him.
I'm sorry.
Are-
- Are we going to follow him?
Don't have to.
He lives at the Prescott Apartments.
Now, Mrs. Werner, I'm gonna drive you to your hotel.
You're to wait there till Mr. Mason calls you.
You understand, Mrs. Werner?
Those are Mr. Mason's orders.
Yes, I understand.
Okay.
( engine starts )
Well, try to call again, will you, Gertie?
Thank you.
What else did you find out, Paul?
Well, this Hugo Werner or Hans Breel, whatever he calls himself these days, quite a character.
Man about town, lover, gambler.
And?
And he works out of, uh, Trent and Company, a swank jeweler on Wilshire.
And his gambling's got him in pretty deep with a character named Bill Walker.
He owes him a bundle.
( phone rings )
Hello?
Oh, is this Mr. Breel's message service again?
Well, this is the Perry Mason office, and--
Oh, he did.
Well, thank you very much.
He got your message over an hour ago.
And hasn't answered the call.
What about Mrs. Werner?
No word from her either.
That's funny.
Paul, are you sure you told her?
( phone rings )
Yes, Gertie.
Oh, put him on.
Mr. Breel.
Mr. Breel, this is Perry Mason.
MAN:
I'm sorry I could not return your call sooner.
What can I do for you, Mr. Mason?
Well, actually, it's rather difficult to discuss on the telephone.
Perhaps you could drop by my office?
I'm sorry, that is out of the question.
Well, suppose I come by to see you.
Tonight?
Yes, tonight.
But it's almost 9:30 now.
I can be there in half an hour.
You cannot give me an idea of what this is all about?
No, I'm sorry, Mr. Breel.
I'll see you at 10.
( suspenseful theme playing )
( doorbell buzzing )
( sniffs )
Yeah, gunpowder.
Paul.
Hm?
( exhales )
( sniffs )
Perry-- I smell that too.
It's called Eternity.
Sarah Werner uses it.
Eternity, huh?
That can be as long as it takes to squeeze a trigger.
Better find her, Paul, the sooner the better.
Okay.
Let's get out of here.
See you later, Perry.
Oh, uh...
May I use your phone?
Yes.
I'd like to report a murder.
( doorbell buzzing )
Oh.
Come in.
What time is it?
Quarter to 4.
I found Mrs. Werner at the bus depot.
She was waiting for the 3:10 to Chicago.
Sit down, Mrs. Werner.
Where were you early last night?
Out.
Obviously.
Out where?
Walking.
Up the stairs to your husband's apartment?
Or did you ride the elevator?
You don't understand.
MASON:
I'd like to understand.
I'd like to understand why you didn't call us and tell us what you'd done.
I asked her that.
I can explain it.
I did go for a walk.
A long walk.
And then I...
Then I went to Hugo's apartment.
I rang the bell, and there was no answer.
I thought he was out.
And then just--
Just before leaving, I...
I turned the doorknob.
The door was open.
( sobbing ):
And I went in.
Go on, Mrs. Werner.
He was dead.
Th-there was a burned smell in the room, and there was a gun on the floor.
What time was this?
I don't know.
I don't know what time it was.
What about the gun?
Did you touch it?
No, I...
I'm-
- I'm afraid of guns.
Then did you leave?
Yes.
You closed the apartment door when you left?
Yes.
Completely closed it?
Yes.
Then you decided to run away.
How much evidence do you think you left in your husband's apartment last night?
But I didn't leave any.
Didn't you touch anything?
The doorknob, the table, any of half a dozen other objects in the room?
But--?
But how would they know that they're my fingerprints?
Mrs. Werner, you're the wife of a murdered man.
Don't you realize the police are going to investigate you, whether you're here in Chicago or at the North Pole?
I didn't know.
I--
What shall I do, Mr. Mason?
Did you kill your husband?
I don't want a shake of the head,
I want you to look at me and say it out loud.
No.
No, no, no, no, I didn't.
I loved him, I--
I know that--
That he took my money, and-- And he walked out on me.
But his gambling was a sickness.
He just couldn't help himself.
I loved him.
Please, what shall I do, Mr. Mason?
I think you'd better call the police.
The police?
Well, if they prefer any charges against you, we'll rush them into an early hearing and then try to take them off balance.
The phone is right there, Mrs. Werner.
( somber theme playing )
What's their number?
( knocking on door )
What is it, Jack?
There's a Paul Drake outside.
He wants to talk to Mr. Walker.
He's a private detective.
He does a lot of work for Perry Mason.
Tell him I'm not here.
Oh, um, wait a minute.
Tell him I'm not here, but, uh,
Mr. Morrow will talk to him.
You play this hand.
I'll kibitz.
( knocking on door )
Uh, Mr. Morrow?
That's me.
PAUL:
I understand you work for a Mr. Walker.
I'm very anxious to get in touch with him.
You can't.
He's in Vegas.
He was in town yesterday.
That was in the morning.
He left in the afternoon on the 5:30 flight.
( sighs )
What's wrong, buster?
I'm just trying to remember where I know you from.
You don't know me from Adam.
I think Mr. Mason would like to talk to you.
No, thanks.
Come on, boys.
Let's play cards.
Hey, Drake.
I think I'll take you up on that invitation.
I've always been curious about this Mason fellow.
All right, I'll call him and tell him to meet us at the office.
Where were we?
Your bet.
Oh.
Now, I think there's a couple of things that ought to go on the record, Mr. Mason.
Like the $15,000 that Hans Breel owed Walker?
No, almost anyone in Vegas could have told you that.
Then what things, Mr. Morrow?
Well, that about ten days ago, a woman came to see Mr. Walker.
She showed him a picture.
What kind of picture?
Of a man and a little girl.
This woman asked if Mr. Walker had seen the man.
She called him Hugo Werner.
What did Mr. Walker tell her?
He told her that he didn't know anyone named Hugo Werner.
I see.
She said something about making sure she got some money from him if she had to follow him to the end of the Earth to get it.
Does this interest you, Mr. Mason?
Yes, it does.
Now, Mr. Walker doesn't like to get messed up in an affair like this, but he doesn't have to go blabbing to the police either.
Just like you don't have to poke into the business we had with Hans Breel.
Tell me something, Mr. Morrow.
Sure.
How do you stand with the money Breel owed you?
We've written it off.
When you asked him for it, did he say where he hoped to get it?
He said some gal had an uncut diamond that he was going to sell and make some money with.
Just, uh, some girl?
He didn't mention any name?
It wasn't our business.
Thank you, Mr. Morrow.
That's okay, counselor,
I like to make friends when it doesn't hurt.
You never know when you're gonna need one in a hurry, especially a good lawyer.
( door closes )
Why so preoccupied, Paul?
One of the guys in that poker game.
Nah, it couldn't have been Bill Walker.
They wouldn't lie to me right to my face.
Did he say the 5:30 plane to Las Vegas?
Yeah, I'll check the flights.
Oh, that, uh, girl with the uncut diamond that Morrow mentioned, her name's, uh, Irene Bedford.
She lives at 813 West Serrano, apartment 5-B.
Wonder if she'll mind my calling on her before breakfast.
Probably.
I am going to bed.
Good night.
I think you should, but before you do, uh, will you check on these for me?
Good morning.
( mysterious theme playing )
So that's it, Mr. Mason.
I signed Hans' contract, and he sold the Pundit Dream to Virginia Trent for $15,000.
As you can see, he was to get ten percent of the sale price.
I'm afraid you're wrong, Miss Bedford.
This contract actually assigned title of your diamond to Breel.
He agreed to pay you 90 percent of all proceeds he might derive from any sale, not to exceed $15,000.
Isn't that what I just said?
No.
Breel could have sold the diamond for any sum and still have paid you only $15,000.
What if he did sell it for more?
I guess there's a price on everything.
Even love.
He was a compulsive gambler.
I understand that, night before last, he lost $15,000 in a poker game.
Fifteen thousand dollars?
Where would Hans get money like that?
You mean, it was mine?
You mean, Virginia Trent paid him the $15,000, and he lied to me about her not being able to pay for 30 days?
One would think you're hearing this for the first time, Miss Bedford.
When do you think I would have heard it?
Let's go see Virginia Trent.
Oh, uh, will you be long?
Two and a half minutes.
Time me.
( suspenseful theme playing )
Fifteen thousand?
Yes, that's what Hans told me.
VIRGINIA:
You know what happened to the Pundit Dream?
It shattered.
That's tough luck, but it doesn't affect me.
Now, look, you're not trying to renege?
Oh, no.
No, it was a firm deal.
Only it was for 30,000.
Hans said he couldn't get it for less.
Hans told me he couldn't get more than 15.
VIRGINIA:
Why, I already gave him 15,000.
He said you needed the balance right away.
That's why he took a chance and cleaved the stone.
Only--
Well, I'm sorry, Miss Bedford, but it's going to be a long time before I can pay you the rest of the money.
I didn't even get the first part of it.
I can't ask you for the balance.
I'm afraid Hans didn't always tell the truth.
Did you know he was married?
Yes, I knew.
Did you see him last night?
No.
Some unidentified person went to his apartment last night, after he'd been shot, and apparently left the door open upon leaving.
ADOLPH:
Liebchen?
Have you seen the papers?
Do you know, uh--?
Do you work here?
Yes.
VIRGINIA:
This is Adolph Van Beers, Mr. Mason, a very old friend and worker.
Mr. Van Beers, why didn't you say something last night about knowing Hans?
What was there to say?
Hans was dead.
You were calling the police.
I did not shoot him, Mr. Mason.
So, what was there to say?
( ominous theme playing )
Gonna try a case?
Oh.
Hi, Perry.
Hi, Paul.
Just been to police headquarters.
Any luck?
Well, they've just booked Sarah Werner for the murder of her husband.
Have they?
Apparently, they've established her at the scene at the time.
And they've got a piece of a motive, what with the money angle, and then checking back on Hans Breel, alias Hugo Werner, alias two or three other names.
Are you sure they don't have something more?
They moved pretty fast.
They may have.
And if I sound cryptic, so did Lieutenant Tragg.
Well, what did Tragg say that sounded so cryptic?
Well, as near as I can remember, quote:
"The police were looking for Sarah Werner even before they knew she was in town."
Unquote.
( dramatic theme playing )
Would you tell us the cause of death, please, doctor?
Death was caused by a 9 mm bullet through the heart.
And the time of death, sir?
Between 7:45 and 9:15 p.m., April 6th.
Thank you, doctor.
Your witness.
Doctor, may I ask if death might have occurred at a quarter of ten?
No, sir.
How 'bout 9:30?
No, sir.
As a matter of fact, there's only one chance in 100,000 it was after 9:00.
The area of extreme probability was between 8:15 and 8:45.
Thank you, doctor, that's all.
Well, the fingerprints of the defendant, Mrs. Sarah Werner, were found on a magazine rack near the body.
Thank you, lieutenant.
Cross-examine.
Those were the only fingerprints you found of the defendant in the room, lieutenant?
Yes, sir.
Other places where fingerprints would normally be found had been wiped clean.
Thank you, lieutenant.
You may step down, lieutenant.
And I've been a, uh, diamond importer and wholesaler for nearly 25 years.
I have offices in Amsterdam,
New York and here in Los Angeles.
Defense recognizes the witness is a qualified expert in the diamond trade.
Thank you, counselor.
Now, Mr. David, would you tell us, please, what transpired in your office on the evening of April 6th?
Well, I was working late, and, uh, about half past 9, a woman knocked at my front door.
I let her in.
She had an uncut diamond to sell me.
BURGER:
And now, Mr. David,
I ask you to look around this courtroom and tell us if you recognize the woman that tried to sell you that stone.
Yes.
That's she.
BURGER:
Let the record show that the witness is pointing to the defendant, Sarah Werner.
Now we know what Tragg meant when he sounded cryptic.
Cross-examine.
MASON:
No questions.
You may step down.
So I examined the Pundit Dream and gave my opinion.
I said it would be very dangerous to try to cleave the stone.
Now, let's proceed very carefully, Mr. Schoenbeck.
After you examined the stone, what happened?
SCHOENBECK:
Well, there were a few words with Adolph and Virginia, and then Hans-- I beg your pardon.
Hugo Werner said he would cleave it.
He said he had studied it and knew he would not shatter it.
And this is the same stone that you had just finished examining, the Pundit Dream?
SCHOENBECK:
Yes.
BURGER:
All right, what happened then?
SCHOENBECK:
He set everything up and struck the stone.
BURGER:
And then?
The stone shattered into fragments.
BURGER:
Now, Mr. Schoenbeck, you have been qualified here as an expert.
There was no mistaking the Pundit Dream when you examined it, was there?
No, I could not mistake it.
I show you now this uncut diamond, marked in evidence, which has been identified here by the expert, Lawrence David, as having been presented to him by the defendant.
I ask if you recognize this?
Recognize it?
Why, that is--
That is-- Go on, Mr. Schoenbeck.
It's the Pundit Dream.
BURGER:
Whole, in one piece, not shattered.
SCHOENBECK:
Yes, but I saw it!
I saw him lift the hammer and strike.
It is the Pundit Dream.
But that doesn't seem very logical, does it, Mr. Schoenbeck?
I mean, you can't take a diamond and shatter it and then put it back together again, can you?
No, that's impossible.
Well, let's retrace our steps then and see if we can solve this mystery.
After you had examined the diamond, what did you do with it?
I gave it back to him.
And then?
Then we talked, and Hans set up the cleaving operation.
He had the diamond and then--
He must have switched stones.
MASON:
Just a moment.
Your Honor, I move to strike out the words,
"he must have switched stones"
as not being responsive to the question, as being a conclusion of the witness.
I ask the court to caution the witness not to volunteer statements.
Objection sustained.
The reporter will strike the witness' last answer.
I can understand your sense of excitement, Mr. Schoenbeck, and your unfamiliarity with court procedure.
Please, limit your answers to the questions asked.
Yes, Your Honor, but that's--
That will be all, Mr. Schoenbeck.
Thank you very much.
Your witness.
Mr. Schoenbeck, what happened to the fragments of the shattered diamond?
SCHOENBECK:
Hans put them in a bag and said he would take them downtown to a dealer.
Now, you said something about words between you, Virginia and Adolph.
Would you please explain who Adolph is?
Adolph Van Beers.
He's a diamond cutter from Holland.
He came here to this country with Virginia's father,
August Trent, long before Virginia was born.
Some years ago, Adolph cleaved the Emerson Star diamond for Mr. Trent.
He shattered it.
It cost Mr. Trent a small fortune.
Adolph has been gun-shy ever since.
Gun-shy?
Well, you know, afraid to cleave a large stone.
He's lost his nerve, like a flyer after an accident.
And also he has a terrible guilt complex.
He's a mass of neurosis.
You, uh-
- You seem to have a slight accent, Mr. Schoenbeck.
Are you from Holland also?
Yes, sir.
Have I seen you before?
No.
I seem to have heard your voice before.
Have I ever talked to you on the telephone?
No.
Didn't you telephone me on the night of the murder, identify yourself as Hans Breel and make the statement--?
No.
No, sir.
I did not telephone you on that night or any other night.
Thank you.
That'll be all.
You may step down, Mr. Schoenbeck.
Miss Bedford, you were acquainted with the deceased, known to you as Hans Breel, on a personal as well as a business basis?
Yes, sir.
As a matter of fact, you knew him well enough to authorize him to dispose of your uncut diamond called the Pundit Dream?
Yes.
You knew he was a married man?
Oh, yes.
And did you know to whom he was married?
You mean, here in the United States or in Amsterdam before he came here?
BURGER:
His marriage in the United States was not his first marriage?
IRENE:
Oh, no.
And as a matter of fact, he was still married to his first wife when he came to this country and married the defendant in this case?
IRENE:
That's right.
He said he told her when he left her in Chicago.
No.
No, he never did.
I didn't know.
I didn't know, Mr. Mason.
BURGER:
If it please the court,
I should like to submit these photostatic documents.
A marriage license and certificate, received from Amsterdam, Holland, issued to Piet Verlan, alias Piet Hofer, alias Hugo Werner, alias Hans Breel, and ask that they be marked in evidence for the people.
Cross-examine.
Miss Bedford, in a conversation you had with me the day after the murder, did we not discuss the fact that Hans Breel had tricked you into signing a contract which permitted him to sell the Pundit diamond for any sum he wished,
but that he was obligated to pay you not more than $15,000?
Yes, you saw the contract and pointed out to me that I had practically given him power of attorney in the diamond.
And then we found out that he sold the stone for $30,000?
Yes.
And that you hadn't received a penny of that money?
Not then.
Not then?
You mean, you have since?
Yes, I got a check in the mail yesterday morning for $15,000.
I had to sign an endorsement and a bill of sale to Virginia Trent.
Miss Trent paid you this money?
Oh, I don't know.
It wasn't her check.
Whose check was it?
Adolph Van Beers'.
MASON:
No further questions.
Court adjourned until 2:00.
Burger prepared this case in a hurry, but he built it like a battleship.
We're in the process of being sunk.
I'm sorry, Mr. Mason.
I lied to you.
The reason I took that stone--
I know why you took it, Sarah.
You took it for your daughter.
That's why you tried to run away.
Yes.
Thank you for understanding.
Well, Paul?
Come on, let's have lunch.
( dramatic theme playing )
( mellow theme playing )
I know you folks are in a hurry, so I brought your beverages first.
Are you having the tea, Miss Street?
Mm-hm.
Thank you.
And the coffee's mine.
And, uh, also the check.
Will there be anything else?
We have some very nice strawberry shortcake.
Mm--
No, thanks.
Paul, are you--?
Are you sure of those facts?
Positive.
Jerry Morrow's boss,
William Walker, has been in town the entire time.
He didn't go back to Las Vegas?
Nope, and I'd call him a prime suspect except for one thing:
he was in the poker game at the time of the murder, and he's got seven witnesses, including Jerry Morrow.
Look, I-
- I know you checked them thoroughly, Paul, but did either of them leave the room for any length of time?
Nope, not even to telephone.
There was no phone in the room, and nobody left the room.
Not even at 9:30 when someone called you at the office and said he was Hans Breel.
Well, then, that phone call was obviously an attempt to establish a false time of death.
Right.
Uh, Morrow's been very helpful, Paul.
However, we'll still keep an eye on him.
It's, um, been nice having lunch with you, but it's time to get back to the courtroom.
It is the Pundit's Dream.
Now, it's been proven that the stone the defendant tried to sell to Lawrence David on the night of the murder was the Pundit Dream.
Do you now corroborate the previous testimony of the expert that this is that stone?
Yes.
Then, the diamond or paste or fused-glass fake that Hans Breel struck with a chisel and hammer could not have been the Pundit Dream, could it?
Obviously, it could not have been.
Thank you, sir.
Your witness.
Now, Mr. Van Beers, isn't it true that because you became gun-shy and refused to take chances,
Miss Trent had to look elsewhere for a diamond cutter?
Yes.
I...
She hired Hans because of me.
Where do you live, Mr. Van Beers?
At 5 East Avenue H, in Fernwood.
Did Mr. Breel live at the same address?
Yes, when he came to work at Trent's,
I got him the apartment.
On the same floor as yours?
Yes.
Now, after Breel shattered the stone you thought was the Pundit Dream, did you attempt to speak to him again?
No, I didn't.
Oh, come, now, Mr. Van Beers.
You mean to say, you didn't even cross the hall to ask him why his calculations with the stone had gone wrong?
Yes, I did go to his apartment.
What time was that?
Around half-past 8.
All right, Mr. Mason.
I killed him.
I killed him because I couldn't stand what he had done to Virginia.
She had trusted him.
She had put her life, her future, in his hands.
He had betrayed her.
BURGER:
Your Honor, in view of the sudden turn this case has taken--
Excuse me, Mr. Burger.
If Your Honor please, I would like to continue my cross-examination of this witness.
You may continue, Mr. Mason.
Thank you.
Mr. Burger?
Thank you.
Now, Mr. Van Beers, when you went into Breel's apartment was the door closed?
Yes, the door was closed.
And while you were in his apartment, did you telephone me?
Yes.
Will you tell me how you knew I had called him?
He had written a note with your phone number on it that he got from his message service.
And when you left his apartment, did you close the door?
No.
I left it open a little.
But Mrs. Werner found the door closed and left it closed.
I found it open, so you must have been there after Mrs. Werner and before me.
Well, yes, I guess, uh...
I guess I was there after she was there.
But Mrs. Werner found her husband dead.
She took the diamond from his pocket, so he must have been dead when you arrived.
Oh, oh, no!
And all those things you told the police to throw them off the trail.
The telephone call to me, the fingerprints, the door, even the $15,000 you sent to Miss Bedford.
They weren't to protect you because you didn't kill Hans Breel.
No, I tell you, I did it!
Adolph, no, you mustn't!
He's trying to protect me!
Order!
There will be order in this courtroom.
Young lady, what's the meaning of this?
If it please the court,
I think I can clarify the situation if I'm correct in assuming that Mr. Burger intends to call Virginia Trent as his next witness.
I certainly do so intend.
Now if you will permit, Mr. Burger, and with the permission of the court,
I should like first to recall Miss Irene Bedford.
Mr. Burger?
I have no objections, Your Honor.
You may step down.
Miss Bedford to the stand.
You realize you're still under oath, Miss Bedford?
Of course.
Now I'd just like to clear up a few points.
Did Hans Breel telephone you on the afternoon of the murder to tell you he had shattered the Pundit Dream?
No.
That's odd.
It is?
Well, Breel was in dire need of money, so he devised this scheme.
He would make it seem as though he had shattered the stone.
Virginia would get hurt, you would get hurt, and he would keep the real diamond without anyone knowing it.
Neat trick, wasn't it?
Fascinating.
But you had to know the stone was shattered, so it would have been illogical for him not to have called you.
He didn't call.
Hm.
Uh, do you, uh--?
Do you recall showing me the contract between yourself and the deceased?
Yes, you were nice enough to interpret it for me.
In matters like that, I'm a complete innocent.
Now in your testimony earlier, you talked about giving Breel virtual power of attorney in the diamond.
Yes, you pointed that out to me.
But I never used the phrase "power of attorney."
Who did?
I can't remember.
Another attorney?
Yes.
When did you see him?
It must have been some time that day, the day Hans was killed.
Why?
Something must have prompted you to see an attorney, Miss Bedford.
Was it after Hans called and told you he'd shattered the stone?
Yes.
Then the attorney verified the fact that whatever Hans wanted to do, he could do, and you had no recourse?
Yes.
Then you went to Hans' apartment?
No.
Aren't you lying again, Miss Bedford?
He had double-crossed you.
First, out of $15,000, then out of the balance after he shattered the stone, so you went to his apartment.
No, I knew about the stone.
I knew he had switched stones!
Hans told me!
Told you when?
When I saw him.
At his apartment?
Yes!
I didn't kill him.
I knew that if I admitted speaking to him or going to his apartment, you'd suspect me.
I didn't kill him.
He told me about the diamond and how he could get rid of it in another city and how much more money we could get for it.
Then why did you accept the $15,000 check from Adolph Van Beers?
What?
The check he sent you yesterday?
Why would you have signed a bill of sale if knowing the diamond was intact?
You wouldn't have.
When you faced Breel with that gun, why didn't you take the diamond away from him?
It was there in his pocket.
If, as you say, he had told you about it, why didn't you take the diamond away from him?
You're trying to trip me up!
No, Miss Bedford, you tripped yourself up.
You're so tangled in lies,
I don't believe you know the truth from fiction.
I hated him!
He wanted to get rid of me!
Besides lying and cheating, he wanted to get rid of me!
You--
You were still in love with him?
Oh, y-yes.
That's why I killed him.
That's why I killed him!
( tense theme playing )
It's of no use.
There's too much risk.
I haven't cleaved a stone in so many years.
Please, Adolph, if you don't cleave the Pundit Dream, no one else will.
But, liebchen, one needs a firm hand, a sharp eye.
Other things measure a man's stature, Mr. Van Beers.
Important things like dignity, self-respect, courage, a mind that's not filled with doubt.
Virginia wants that for you above all else.
Even if you fail.
( panting )
Perfect!
They should be worth $40,000 to $50,000 each.
So, Adolph, you have not lost the master's touch.
Congratulations.
Oh!
Well, you won't make expenses on this case, Perry, but... it's dividends like that that make it all worth while.
( dramatic theme playing )
( noirish jazz theme playing )
Those shrimps we had yesterday -- know what they made me do?
Were you ill?
No, I had a dream.
- In black and white?
- No, I dream in color.
What did you dream?
I dreamed I was a widower.
You dreamed of the death of my wife.
Death, laying out, funeral, everything.
I was behind the coffin.
You on my right, marquis, and Father Agostino on my left.
You remember it all?
Absolutely.
Were you sad?
Not at all!
Everyone was crying, but I was laughing.
- You were laughing?
- And... when they lowered the coffin into the grave,
I felt someone poke me from behind, quite hard.
I thought it was Father Agostino.
I woke up, and it was my wife, saying:
"So, you nitwit, you laugh in your sleep?"
THE WIDOWER
Excuse me!
Salvatore, any mail?
Sir, your wife.
I'm not even out the door and you're calling me already?
You're going away?
She phoned?
Your mother is ill?
Fine!
Shall I get your tickets?
Yes!
Sleeping car, rear of the train, not over the wheels ...
I've got it, I'm not a child, don't insult me!
You've ruined my day, I've lost my smile -- happy, dear?
- Here, Salvatore.
- Excuse me, Sir.
What is it?
I just wanted to remind you of those 10,000 lire.
Thank you for reminding me.
Here's half, you'll have the rest tomorrow.
- And Salvatore ...
- Yes?
If a Mr. Lambertoni asks for me, I'm in Switzerland on business.
- Remember:
Lambertoni!
- Yes, sir.
Mr. Nardi ?
My dear Lambertoni, what a surprise!
You look splendid.
In Milan, in this heatwave?
I've come to collect the money I lent you.
Here are the bonds.
Oh, is today the due date?
- What are we doing?
- Going to the bank!
- Really?
Hello, uncle.
- lt's too hot!
- When money's at stake ...
What do you think of my new car?
Off we go, uncle.
Nardi?
Minelli!
In Milan, in this heatwave?
We had a meeting!
- Did you forget?
- It slipped my mind.
Do you know each other?
Minelli, Lambertoni!
Where are you going?
Just popping in to the front office to get some money!
He'll drive me nuts!
Sir, Mr. Nardi is here.
- Who?
- The husband of --
- Mr. Director!
- My dear Nardi!
- How are you?
- Well, thank you.
Do sit down.
Are you all better?
- What was it?
- Just a little nervous condition.
Five years of work, not a single day off, what with expenses, taxes, and strikes, something had to give!
Nothing serious?
Well ...
I would say one word instead of another.
When I wanted a cigarette, I asked for a lightbulb, but I was certain I'd said cigarette!
Really!
But you're better now?
My friend, my reflexes were shot.
When the doctor hit my knee with his little hammer, my leg didn't move.
But let's get down to business!
Neither of us has time to waste.
I've examined your request for financing:
23 million to implement a major industrial project.
It's a worthy proposal and I've approved it.
Dear director, I'm delighted, especially because it shows your confidence in me, Alberto Nardi.
- When will I have the money?
- Well now, there's just one little detail to be taken care of:
your wife needs to sign as well.
My wife?
It's not that I don't trust you, but your wife's property is worth a billion lire, while your company is currently in the red.
It can't be considered a guarantee.
Very well.
Where should she sign?
Here.
Just a formality!
- Thank you, anyway.
- My pleasure.
Still there ...
Pardon me -- is there another exit?
- Yes, but it's a freight elevator.
- Perfect!
9:03 am, why aren't you at work?
We're waiting for our pay envelopes.
The administrator hasn't paid you?
Your hat.
You talk to him, Carlo.
You're always telling us we're one big family.
Some shit-out-of-luck family!
You've got your fancy car -- we just want our pay!
I don't appreciate your tone.
Put that wrench down, you don't scare me.
Your pay is the responsibility of the administrator, not mine!
Mr. Stucchi?
Good on you, Alberto!
Hey, who told you you could take the Signora's car?
Sir, excuse me --
I'm sorry, your car is the Fiat 600.
Hand over the keys.
Listen, I take orders from no one:
I'm the boss's uncle and a stockholder!
- A stockholder?
- Yes!
I sold my taxi and invested 700,000 lire in my nephew's business!
Good for you!
Please get the administrator for me.
May I come in?
Yes, Fritzmayer.
Have you seen today's paper?
No, why?
"Cordial Meeting of Eisenhower and Khrushchev" - we're in good hands!
- No, page 4,
"Two Russians on Moon" -- Great!
Two fewer here.
"Brigitte Bardot Is Expecting" -- Who cares?
"Eagle Attacks Old Man" --
There, sir, underlined in red.
"Elevator Plunges 7 Floors" -- it's one of ours.
"Manufacturer Held Responsible -- Elevator Crashes to Ground."
- At least there were no injuries.
- Bravo!
We spend 5 years developing an elevator, and look at it!
It's unfortunate, but in a way I'm glad.
Glad?
Yes, now I realize the problem was with the shock absorbers.
And that's all?
That's it?
Are we insured?
I don't know, the marquis takes care of these administrative details
Stucchi !
Hello, you're looking well.
Did you call?
I've been calling you for the past half hour.
Turn around, marquis.
- What kind of jacket is that?
- A hunting jacket.
You're here to work, not to hunt!
I'll change this afternoon.
- Did you hear about the elevator?
- Yes.
Are we insured?
No, not since the day before yesterday.
- Didn't you renew the policy?
- There was no money.
You yourself said:
"It's not like it'll crash tomorrow!"
But it was bound to happen.
True, everyone here expected it.
What a crew!
Get out, Fritzmayer !
- And smarten up!
- "It's by making mistakes that we learn."
No more mistakes, get me?
If we can't even rely on German technicians ...
Just fire him and send him back to Germany.
He'd be arrested, he's a wanted man.
Political?
No!
He molested a 12-year-old girl.
- A 12-year-old girl?
- Yes!
Why didn't you prepare the workmen's pay envelopes?
For two very simple reasons:
there's no cash on hand and we can't even afford the envelopes.
Go buy them, I'll take care of everything else.
Did you settle matters with the bank?
I just need my wife's signature.
I doubt she'll accept.
Don't always be so negative and defeatist, Stucchi!
Go get my cigarettes.
- Right away, sir.
- Hold on!
Seraglio brand -- and 4 promissory notes.
- Right away, sir.
- Stucchi?
What denomination for the promissory notes?
- You didn't say.
- Give me time.
I don't mean to upbraid you, but let me finish what I was saying.
A pack of Seraglios and four 50-lire promissory notes.
If it's Lambertoni, I'm not here.
Same for Minelli... and Piazzi.
For everyone.
- Hello?
- Are you there, my nitwit?
Is that my wife?
Elvira, are you lunching at the estate or the flat?
Well, go on, marquis!
I need a signature, just a formality.
Don't say no without knowing what it is!
Is something wrong, marquis?
I don't say he shouldn't upbraid me but the tone he uses!
Don't be upset, you know he's fond of you.
Yes, I know.
If I didn't esteem him so highly, for his great intelligence, look...
- I'd have left long ago.
- Come now!
I don't mean to make much of my lineage, but he shouldn't call me "marquis" then make an errandboy of me.
Even great men have their little ways.
I admire him greatly ...
Well then!
- He wants cigarettes ...
- And you'll buy them.
I have no choice.
He shouldn't forget that during the war
I was his captain.
Good day, sir.
- What's her mood?
- She's been singing ...
Don't worry, he won't get a penny.
She's on the phone with her mother.
Mamma, do you hear?
I'll send him to manage the farm, if he can.
If I leave him, I'll owe him an allowance.
You're the one who gave me a religious upbringing.
Luck has nothing to do with it.
He's an incompetent megalomaniac.
Now he thinks he'll beat out Montecatini.
Let's face it:
I've married an idiot, and I'll keep him.
We must bear our cross with patience.
I'm a realist!
I'll take the evening train and be with you tomorrow.
Go easy with the cardplaying, all right?
Goodbye, Mamma dear.
- Serafina?
Is my husband back?
- Yes, madam.
Don't bother kissing me, I don't feel anything for you.
Look what your nitwit has brought you!
- What is it?
- Open it!
- Remind you of anything?
- No.
The gypsy in Biarritz, the day of our betrothal.
A day that will live in infamy.
Don't stand there, get in the kitchen!
I'm bubbling over with ideas and plans,
I try to share them with my wife, and pow!
Right in the teeth!
Enlighten me -- what plans?
See?
Happy now?
Is this like that 300 million deal you tried with the Jews?
Did they screw me over!
I've never liked them, anyway ...
They didn't screw you over they sold you oil when the Suez Canal was closed.
They're clever and you're not.
You blame them because you're incompetent.
How strange it is how sad to think that strangers admire me but my own wife doesn't trust me.
Because I know you.
My bank manager knows me and he loaned me 23 million to me, Alberto Nardi!
- Bizarre.
- And yet ...
It's for you, sir.
My dear, a little signature --
- Why?
- Just a formality.
One there and one there --
Hello?
My dear Minelli!
Why are you in Milan during this heatwave?
I waited for you all morning in front of the bank!
I could have you jailed!
Excellent idea!
Perfect!
Very good, Minelli ...
Yes ...
We'll discuss it next week.
A signature on each page.
Just a formality, my love.
Yes?
I'm listening, Minelli ...
Fine, fine ...
Yes, my dear fellow, yes ...
Yes ...
Goodbye, dear Minelli, best regards to your wife.
And there we are!
Have you signed?
- Why not?
- I'd rather die!
Luncheon is served.
Will Sir be staying?
Eating here, nitwit?
Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday I lunch at the Businessmen's Club.
Ask a businessman to sign.
Then introduce him to me.
I certainly will --
-- no matter what you and your mother think!
Serafina?
The Barolo!
Lambrusco, madam.
There's no more Barolo.
The bottles have all disappeared, madam.
Everything disappears in this house.
Today the Barolo, yesterday my Paris nail polish.
And your lovely cuckoo clock?
Don't remind me, I could just spit.
Do you suspect anyone?
I'm not certain, but something's in the wind.
I'll get him yet, that bandit!
Hello!
Oh, sir, hello!
What an aroma!
Hello, Mamma Italia !
- Hello!
- Hello, Lolita!
What's for lunch?
Spaghetti?
- Tortellini.
- Yum, yum!
And what wine?
Barolo?
You brought it over yesterday.
I know.
What a little kangaroo she is!
Hello!
Well, Iride?
Your television audition?
It was the stupidest thing!
"Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt this broadcast due to technical problems ..."
Idiotic!
Absolutely.
Are you proud of your girl?
Do you know what they said?
That she lisps!
Oh, they'll say anything.
It's all about who you know.
Couldn't you put in a word for her?
- I know Mr. Rabagliati.
- Yes ...
Take a look at the new curtains!
- Did you hang them?
- Gioia herself!
Fine!
Let's see those curtains.
Wonderful!
Lolita?
Put this on the table.
Iride?
Look.
- Pretty!
Is that for Gioia?
- Yes.
Gioia?
Look at this!
Calm down ...
Do you like it?
Is that the nail polish I gave you?
The one you bought for me in Paris.
- Lolita?
- Coming!
There!
How lovely!
Do you recognize the music?
- Remind you of anything?
- No.
The day we met.
No, darling.
It was "Oh!
che mambo!"
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
My head is spinning!
Don't you feel well?
I just blanked out.
I've been on the go since seven.
I'll lie down a bit.
Eat something first.
Just three minutes.
A little massage?
Thank you, my darling.
Why did they reopen it?
What?
The Suez Canal.
First they close it, then they open it!
Just when I was in the middle of an oil deal.
Are they trying to ruin me?
If it should come to war against them, I'd sign up.
- You're mad at the Portuguese?
- The English, Suez is theirs.
Don't upset yourself.
Try to relax.
- Gioia?
- Coming, Mamma!
- Excuse me.
- Go see Mamma.
Did you remind him the fur has to be paid for?
Mamma, leave him alone.
He's been on the go since seven.
I'll speak to him.
Mamma, I'm begging you.
I've got to give him a piece of my mind.
Upsy-daisy!
- All right now?
- As though I'd slept for hours.
Sit down, the tortellini are ready.
Right away, Mamma Italia, Yum, tortellini!
Is it true Napoleon slept only 3 hours a night?
- Not just that.
When he'd wake up he'd dictate 7 letters at once.
For me, History holds three great men:
Dante Alighieri, Napoleon Bonaparte, and a third who, despite unworthy allies, was a genius --
- Who?
- Once, I could have told you.
Today, his name must not be spoken.
I'm ravenous!
I've nearly closed a 120 million deal -- what's this?
The installment for the fur.
I spoke to the accountant ... 300,000 lire -- I'll take are of it.
I would have paid it earlier, but I was expecting a transfer --
A transfer?
It's complex and would take too long to explain, like all economic matters --
Good day!
What is it?
I beg your pardon ...
What is this?
We're eating!
Watch it, you're spluttering.
- Bankruptcy?
- I'm only reporting verbatim, as a messenger...
You are maddening!
I'm so sorry.
As you see, I get no peace --
- Are you leaving?
- Millions are at stake!
Don't move, I know the way.
- I'll go with you.
- Lolita, lride, goodbye!
- I'll go with you.
- No ...
- Oh yes.
- Please ...
- Tortellini?
- Yes.
Tasty, no?
What are you doing?
Shh!
It's a surprise for Gioia.
A surprise?
I know of a magnificent coat a mink!
I'll take this one back --
- But this is a mink!
- Nonsense!
This is the same game you've been playing for 2 years.
Where's the Fiat 600 you gave us?
Now it's the fur.
I won't let you!
I'd rather cut it to pieces!
Mamma Italia, don't lower yourself so.
Don't be vulgar.
Get out of here!
Let go of that coat!
You let go!
- See you soon.
- All right.
You can forget about my daughter, you oaf!
Please, madam, may I leave?
When a man does that, it's all over.
Over?
Are you joking?
He's bewitched you!
You only see him at lunch, but I know him better.
I'm sure he'll go far.
You're crazy!
If it weren't for his wife, he'd have gone to jail long ago.
Mamma, they closed the Suez canal!
What is this canal business?
The canal caused a crash he was excluded from the Common Market, the peseta was devalued it all happened at once!
How do you know all this?
I know because he talks to me about it for hours.
And you believe his doubletalk?
You don't understand.
Of course -- we're so stupid, and you're so well-informed!
He warned me:
"Don't mention this at home, they wouldn't understand."
Oh really?
He told you that?
Well ...
It's sad: sometimes, I feel like a foreigner here.
We'll sue him!
Get to work!
Start proceedings!
Sit down.
A cigarette, my dear Lambertoni?
Listen, dear friend,
I was terribly rude to you this morning ...
The fact is, I've been distracted lately ...
Shut up!
You're a crook!
Sneaking away won't help you.
I have 4 bonds here for 11 million lire.
If you don't pay, you're finished!
My tablets, marquis.
Two.
That's better.
Don't worry.
Look at this beautiful fur coat.
It's worth 4 million.
Show him.
What kind of fur?
Wild Canadian mink.
I paid four million, but you can have it for three.
Hello?
Lambertoni here.
I have a client, never mind who ...
He'd like a payment extension.
Yes.
He's offering a mink coat.
Wild Canadian mink.
Touch it!
Your size, I'd say.
Yes, we'll say one million.
What?
One million?
All right.
One million and a week's extension.
Goodbye.
Fine.
- What?
- The mink and a week's extension.
I ask a week's extension and you take a 4 million lire mink coat?
Sorry, it's up to my financier.
What kind of financier is this?
I'd like to meet the bloodsucker!
Just let me see this ogress!
Hands off, you!
She doesn't know I'm lending to you and it's better she doesn't.
- Trust me.
- Very well.
Miss?
Goodbye, Nardi.
Give him the mink.
Thank you.
What are you doing, uncle?
- Good evening, sir.
- Where's my wife?
- Over there.
- See you!
- Right.
Good evening, all!
Happy days!
My dear Carla!
- Dear Erminia!
- My dear.
Allow me to introduce my right-hand man, marquis Stucchi.
My love!
Stop that ...
Remember Oscar?
Young man!
What?
- This is our coat.
- Our ...
I see ...
- Sit down.
- Yes.
Waiter?
- Right away.
- Whose coat is this?
- Mine.
- How do you do?
- Very well, despite what you hear.
- Sir?
- Osso buco.
And for me.
Sit down, I'll handle this.
So, that's your coat?
Like it, nitwit?
Yes.
Forgive me for asking in front of our friends, but how did you get it?
It was a bargain.
- How much?
- One million.
How did you get it at that price?
It's mink!
Canadian mink.
Wild Canadian mink.
You have such a flair for business, Elvira!
You see, lots of people take too many risks and are forced to undersell.
And the vultures are right there!
If there is a higher power, as I believe, one day he'll punish the vultures.
You mean he'll punish idiots and megalomaniacs.
Your sense of repartee is killing, Elvira.
You find that funny, Mr. Architect?
What is a megalomaniac?
Someone who thinks he's superior, but is really an imbecile, surrounded by incompetents.
- Did you get that?
- I didn't hear the last word.
A megalomaniac surrounds himself with inferior people so he can feel superior.
Yes, I agree some people are superior, some inferior.
Who are these superior people?
The cyclist Bartali!
He comes from superior stock.
His heart beats only 47 times a minute.
Come, come, Erminia!
Business also has its geniuses:
Rockefeller, Ford, Morgan ...
Yes indeed!
In America, when you ask for credit, they thank you!
When you really want something, you get it, even here.
Who does?
There's someone here tonight --
Carletto?
Elvira!
Who's that?
Fenoglio -- he's worth 70 billion.
My dear friend, I didn't see you!
Oh, don't fuss!
- How is your Mamma, my dear?
- Fine.
I'm going to Switzerland to see her.
Don't forget to give her my regards.
"Fenoglio sends his regards!"
- Have you met my husband?
- Delighted.
- The pleasure is mine.
This man started from nothing and now he's Europe's greatest businessman.
Let's not exaggerate.
All you need in life is a little luck.
I'm delighted to hear you say so!
You're a brilliant man.
Yes, I assure you, I agree completely.
Everything depends on luck --
No, it's not just luck.
In business, you also need brains.
Good evening!
Bon appetit!
You too!
See you soon!
Sir, wait --
I'd like to take this opportunity to discuss one of my projects with you.
I mean to patent a new elevator brake.
One little 20 million lire check and you're my partner.
I'm in a hurry right now -- the Germans are waiting for me.
When I get back from my cruise, in a few months -- call me!
I'll see you, Almiraghi.
Nardi, Alberto Nardi, Almiraghi's my wife.
Silly of me!
Goodbye, Nardi.
The Germans ...
Goodnight, everyone.
Bye, my dear.
Bye.
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, everyone.
Already?
I must talk to you.
Make it quick, I'm in a hurry.
You're leaving, and I'm in desperate straits.
Don't leave me penniless!
So you can give my furs to your mistresses?
Why do you finance others' projects but not my own?
When we were married before Father Agostino, we swore to share everything.
I gave my enthusiasm, my hope, my intelligence what did you give?
70 million in 5 years.
One little check for 20 millions!
You won't get a penny more from me.
- I might do something crazy!
- One more or less ...
I'll open the gas tap!
I'm the one who pays the gas bill, so ...
Elvira, my darling!
Drop dead!
Your mother too!
- Nothing?
- Nothing.
She won't give me a penny.
But it's better this way, Stucchi.
- I've learned a great truth.
- What?
Let's stroll a bit, marquis.
You've learned a great truth -- what?
There are some people who produce nothing.
They hang on to their capital and oppress their fellows.
But once they're dead, their capital becomes productive.
They give work to laborers, to employees, to you.
It's not the first time you've told me this.
I get the impression you wish your wife dead.
Am I wrong?
If you see a beautiful woman undressing, what do you do?
I desire her, of course, but I restrain myself!
I'm restraining myself, too.
But no one can prevent me wishing my wife gone.
I don't want to hurt her, I just want her gone.
Calm down.
Think of your blood pressure.
Yes.
A lightbulb, please.
Sir ... you said "lightbulb."
I did realize.
I meant "cigarette" and I said "lightbulb."
Alberto, are you walking home?
- It's nothing ...
- I don't need help!
Go home, get some rest.
Home, Armando, he's very upset.
Did he say "lightbulb"?
Never mind.
Signora Almiraghi ...
Careful, Amedeo.
The other one.
- Did they call Almiraghi?
- I think so...
Paging Signora Almiraghi ...
Oh Lord, it's Mamma!
Amedeo, keep an eye on the mink.
Something happened to Mamma.
- How much time do I have?
- 4 minutes.
Hello, Stucchi here.
Is this a bad time?
Of course it's a bad time.
Hurry up.
Your husband is saying "lightbulb" again.
Did you call me for that?
This lightbulb business doesn't impress me.
His lightbulbs have already cost me enough.
When millions are at stake, he'll stop at nothing.
I've bailed him out again and again.
I'm in a hurry.
Even if he goes bankrupt, my name won't be involved.
I'm still Signora Almiraghi.
RAILROAD DISASTER
"A switching accident caused the last car to break loose plunging 30 meters into the lake."
"The list of fatalities:
"Luigina Alberti, Fulvia Costi Antonina Lecco, Rosy Gottemberg Luigi Fassi, Elvira Almiraghi ..."
Here he comes.
The boss is here.
Not at work?
It's 9:00!
Sir, have you seen today's paper?
What is it?
Bad news?
Another elevator crashed?
There are moments in life when one must be strong and have faith.
Something happened?
The Milan-Zurich train ...
What happened?
... derailed.
- The midnight train?
- Yes, the one your wife took.
She was in the last car.
What happened to it?
Nothing serious.
Don't worry.
He's got to know, sooner or later.
The sleeping car unhooked and fell into the lake.
- Anyone hurt?
- All of them.
And my wife?
Is it bad news?
I must know, even if it's bad news.
Tell me the truth.
You must be brave, sir.
She has left us.
Elvira is dead?
Don't worry -- it's serious, yes ...
- But she's not dead.
- Let me see, Stucchi!
- Where?
- There ...
I don't see her name ...
There, sir ...
Elvira Almiraghi.
It can't be true!
Eh, Stucchi?
- Giovanino...
- Courage, boss.
My little angel is gone ...
Come now, courage.
She is in heaven.
Be strong.
It's dreadful, uncle.
Oh, yes ...
Weep ...
- Sir ...
- Thank you, dear friend.
- Weep!
- Elvira?
- What a misfortune!
- Elvira?
Let yourself go.
Cry.
Hello, Lambertoni.
Have you heard the sad news?
I saw the papers.
It's dreadful.
How is he?
The poor man is shattered.
Tell me it isn't true.
I can still see her.
We quarreled before she left.
I was hateful.
What marriage doesn't have these dark moments?
- Cry.
You'll feel better.
- I can't.
- Have a little whiskey.
- That I can do.
May I go, sir?
- Huh?
- May I go?
- Yes, go.
My condolences.
- Who is it?
- It's Monday, the bond's due.
How dare you come here to speak of money?
I didn't come to speak of money ...
Thank you!
What happened?
Here ...
Yesterday my darling Elvira was skipping and dancing ... and today she's at the bottom of a lake.
But divers are going to try to bring her up ...
To bring her body up ...
Elvira is dead!
And you talk about divers!
You must be strong.
Ten years together, sharing joys and woes, and suddenly they tell you it's all over!
Cry, it'll do you good.
I can't.
Yes?
It's Eisenberg ...
What do I tell him about his money?
How do I know?
At a time like this!
- Let me talk to him.
- Yes, give him the phone.
Is this the administrative department?
Lambertoni here.
You saw the news in the paper -- yes.
She was in the sleeping car.
Of course he's solvent.
He's her heir.
700 million or so.
No, much more than that.
Why are you shaking your head?
Much more.
- No next of kin?
- She willed me everything.
And her mother?
She gets a small share.
All the rest is mine.
But what does money matter, Stucchi!
Drink a little, it will do you good.
Cheers!
Words fail me ...
Yes, words are useless.
Back to work.
Good show!
Now we're friends.
All the more so because our business will be expanding.
To begin with, I'll pay you your back wages.
To work, my friends!
Goodbye, marquis.
- Where are you going?
- To the site of the tragedy.
- Allow me to accompany you.
- Thank you.
Sir, we must think about organizing the funeral ...
- I leave it in your hands.
- But sir...
- What?
- We've no money.
- Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
200,000 lire, will that do?
Make it 300,000.
- Telephone, sir!
- I can't speak to anyone.
It's Miss Gioia.
Scram!
Gioia?
Did you hear?
Yes, Alberto, we heard the news.
What a shock.
I know you'll be strong.
Give him your condolences.
Ask if there's anything we can do.
I'm all right.
Who can argue with Fate?
I will always be by your side.
Yes, do.
Yes, we're bringing the body back to the estate.
Good day, sir.
Thank you for the wreath, it was the handsomest of all.
Terrible thing.
Where's the husand?
At the site of the tragedy.
- Hello.
- Hello.
How fragile life is!
Only two days ago, our poor friend asked me to buy some foreign stocks for her.
I told her it wasn't a good idea.
And look -- they're up 200 points.
If she were here, I'd tip my hat to her!
- She was never wrong.
- She was even smarter than her father.
And her husband -- know him?
He's a phenomenon.
Only yesterday he was a nobody.
But as Elvira's widower, now he's somebody!
Why aren't they bringing her body to the city?
She was born and raised here.
Hello.
- Are you the marquis Stucchi?
- No.
Marquis?
Good day, marquis.
We would like to see your boss on a business matter.
Didn't you hear about the tragedy?
Exactly -- we were about to sign a contract with the deceased.
- Where is her husband?
- Not now.
It's quite urgent.
- Pardon me.
- Go on.
I'm his uncle.
Is it a good deal?
Here.
And give 200 lire to the boy.
The candles go in the funeral chamber.
Marquis, shall we make a little inspection ?
Everything should be locked up.
It's nice to be trusting, but the servants take advantage and the silverware disappears.
- From the countess Bufalori.
- Thank you, Serafina.
Put away the sheets too.
Let me finish!
- What about lunch?
- Will they eat?
Of course!
In an hour they'll be starving.
Here comes the husband!
30 meters underwater.
I spoke to one of the divers.
The sleeping car is her coffin.
Signor Fenoglio is here.
Dear Fenoglio.
- My dear Almiraghi ...
- Nardi!
Almiraghi was my dear Elvira.
Thank you, everyone.
Your compassion touches me deeply.
I didn't realize I had so many friends.
Father Agostino, thank you for coming.
It's dreadful, Father.
Be brave, my son.
Remember your wedding day --
"Till death do you part."
Alas, it happened, there's no going back.
- Are you certain?
- What of?
The victims weren't all identified.
The press sometimes exaggerates.
You mustn't give up hope.
It's useless to deceive ourselves -- Elvira is at the bottom of that lake.
Nobody can bring her back.
Don't despair!
Trust in God!
- I'm going to look at the funeral chamber.
- Go, my son.
- Dear friend ...
- Weep ...
- If only I could.
- Poor man.
- The mortuary chamber?
- At the end of the hall.
- My condolences.
- Thank you.
I've been struck down ...
Put flowers everywhere, throughout the house.
Little wildflowers, not that.
She loved them.
She was so good.
- Pardon?
- She was so good!
She was good, yes, no denying it!
- Who is it?
- The funeral director ...
Take care of it, Stucchi.
There's a choice to be made.
Would you take a look.
We can provide horses with plumes or a hearse, second or third class.
Six horses!
Horses with plumes!
Elvira had no taste for luxury, as she said her last night with us.
No horses -- a hearse, like everyone else.
She was a simple woman.
A hearse.
- A little broth, sir?
- No, I'm not hungry.
From Miss Gioia.
Is she in the kitchen?
She's been doing everything.
She's so nice.
Very nice ...
Who's that?
Oscar.
Madam's friend?
Yes.
Did you know about him too?
He loved her so.
He cried all day.
But now he's eating!
Serafina?
Quick!
And lots of sauce!
It's for Mr. Fenoglio.
Wreaths on the other side, I said!
Another plate.
Miss, prosciutto, please.
Right away.
Serafina?
Prosciutto for the gentleman.
We'll stay until 6:00, no later.
Wonderful tagliatelle!
- I made them myself!
- Brava!
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, bon appétit!
Who is she?
It wasn't made clear.
Every time she turns her back, I get dizzy!
I can see her as though it were yesterday.
The orchestra was playing she came up to me and said, "Romano?"
"Yes, but I live in Milan," I answered.
- Who's that laughing?
- Mr. Fenoglio.
You can't understand.
My Elvira is gone.
Sir?
My deepest condolences.
Thank you.
Who are these gentlemen?
Your late wife was just about to buy from Mr. Sabatini, through Counselor Girondi, a sulfur deposit in Latium worth 30 million.
Is this a time to discuss such matters?
Is it a good deal?
Montecatini is interested.
We buy today at 30 and in a month we sell at 70.
Well, if we're beating out Montecatini ...
Elvira hadn't signed?
The poor woman didn't have a chance to do it.
Not 30 meters underwater!
Sign, sir.
It's a good deal, believe me.
- Where do I sign?
- There.
Alberto?
Signor Rabagliati is here.
Dear Signor Rabagliati!
- My most sincere condolences!
- Thank you.
He'll sing at the mass.
What will you sing?
A simple Ave Maria, the Schubert.
Perfect!
My Elvira loved it so.
Come have something to eat.
Serve him something.
Don't let yourself be downhearted.
Sir?
Is it you, marquis ?
I can't bear this.
When will they bring back the body?
The divers found all the bodies except one.
- Except one?
- Yes.
There's still a ray of hope!
In 1959 we produced 110 hectoliters of wine, 500 kilos of forage --
- What's that 40, there ?
- Wheat.
Write it down, marquis:
500 kilos of forage, 40 of wheat.
Thanks, Gioia, thanks so much.
Marquis?
There's an invasion of mosquitoes!
Ask Serafina to turn out the lights upstairs, please.
Serafina, could you turn out the lights in the upstairs rooms, for the mosquitoes?
- Gioia, please, some melon.
- Certainly.
Grown here?
Madam had them planted.
And the cows?
There:
"Cattle, 73 head."
Marquis?
Start a new page!
New heading: cattle.
- Myself, I'd sell them!
- Me too.
But Madam wanted us to increase production.
Giordano, Madam isn't here now.
Poor lady!
Do what I tell you!
But just last year the cows brought in 3.8 million, to say nothing of the manure.
What are you talking about?
You're only a cowherd.
No, I'm a farmer.
- Is he a cowherd or a farmer?
- Cowherd.
Hear that?
Cowherd.
Let a businessman handle this.
If we sell these cows and invest in elevators, we'll earn ten times as much.
What do you mean, no?
No, no, I agree ...
Before you decide, come look at the manger and see for yourself.
- All right, let's go see this manger of yours!
- Are you coming?
- No, I'm going to lie down for a bit.
Go, my darling.
You must get used to the idea that I'm the boss now.
Marquis?
Yes, sir?
I'll be in the manger.
Call me when the body arrives.
Without fail!
Giordano, I don't even know what I own.
My wife forbade me to come here.
Cheers!
Hello.
Where did you come from?
I drove Madam home.
"Madam"?
What Madam?
Madam Elvira.
I drove her to Switzerland.
She took the train ...
No, she missed it when she got off to answer your phone call.
Well, er ...
I'll be off!
What a mess!
- Where is Madam?
- In the house.
Tagliatelle.
She was so good.
She was so good!
Serafina?
Am I intruding?
I'm sorry, I dozed off.
If you only knew what a tiring day it was!
So I see ...
You've had lots of visitors.
Are you a friend or a relative of the deceased?
I am the deceased!
Dear Lord!
Yes ...
I think ...
I should go now.
Nonsense, my dear.
I always wondered what my husband's mistress looked like.
You're mistaken -- there's never been anything between us.
A platonic relationship?
I don't understand...
Purely spiritual?
Yes, exactly.
I admire your husband's intelligence.
He says only I understand him.
I console him in moments of difficulty ...
Good for you!
And now that his wife is dead ...
Dear lady, what a surprise!
Allow me to kiss you.
Dear marquis.
Excuse me.
I have your phone call to thank.
Yes, but let us thank heaven!
And my nitwit?
A shattered man.
- And where is the shattered man?
- He went to look at the cows.
- The cows?
- The cows.
Fresh as can be.
Want it, little man?
Here!
And now ...
A kiss for the boss.
To work, children!
Come taste the milk.
- How many liters a day?
- 600, sir.
They're Holsteins.
What do you think of them?
Not bad!
You know what I'd like?
Another silver of pecorino.
Right away.
Margherita?
Show Sir the manger.
Here I come.
Look at those lovely brown arms!
- What's your name?
- Margherita!
You're a nice plump creature, Margherita!
- Come along!
- No ...
Come along, I say!
I'm your boss, where are you going?
Giordano, everyone thought my wife was an aristocrat.
But I was her husband and knew her well.
I can tell you she was petty and miserly.
A peasant, like her mother.
He's in the garden with the farmer.
Who will tell him?
We should break it to him gently.
Do you want me to go?
Don't put yourself out, you've already done far too much for him.
I'll go.
And I don't say this in a mean spirit.
But I, I build roads, I sell houses ...
You're the boss.
Do what you think best.
You said it!
Good night, Giordano.
Good night.
Gioia?
Gioia darling?
Come have some of this tasty melon.
Did you get a load of the cowherd?
He wanted me to increase dairy production.
He's getting his cut, that's what it is.
But I'll sell everything.
He told me, "Your wife ..."
But who cares?
She's not here!
I intend to sell the cows.
Alberto?
Get along, little cowherd!
Alberto?
Well, nitwit?
Talking to yourself now?
Clasped in your arms
I can't escape
I feel your breath on my skin
My heart belongs to you
I only have eyes for you
Good evening!
Elvira!
Returned from the grave!
Let me kiss you.
- My dear Fenoglio.
- Almiraghi.
She got us but good!
Some joke!
Do you know how much this little joke will cost me?
400,000 lire or so?
30 million!
What?
In 24 hours?
He wanted to beat out Montecatini.
- How?
- By buying that sulfur deposit.
- The one they tried to fob off on you?
- I wouldn't sign.
But he did, no questions asked!
Good thing he was only a widower for 24 hours.
Not to mention other expenses.
Rabagliati, the singer, know how much he's costing me?
- He was hired for the funeral mass.
- Him?
It should have been an opera singer.
- Come have a drink.
- Yes.
- Poor man, look at him crying.
- Strange!
When we were waiting for the body, he couldn't shed a tear.
How happy you must be to have her back again!
Words can't express it.
How true.
Is this your son?
What a handsome lad!
Come on, let's watch TV, Mamma.
He hurt me.
You see, I was right -- there was no need to despair.
Come, my son, don't cry.
Smile!
- What?
- Smile!
I can't.
Gioia!
How are you, darling?
Let me introduce my dear friend, Mr. Fenoglio.
We met at your funeral.
Who could forget such a face?
Elvira, come look -- Alberto's on TV!
- Shall we dance?
- But ...
- Why did you come?
- Your wife invited me.
Forget her!
You're not a widower now.
What can I do?
Divers are trying to recover the bodies.
Sir, where were you at the time?
I was with my wife.
We felt the impact.
The train had just derailed.
Thank you.
First on the scene of the tragedy, the husband of one of the victims, young businessman Alberto Nardi.
Sir?
My wife is dead.
I have nothing to say.
To the camera, please.
I am a widower.
I have nothing else to say.
Impossible.
You'll have to wait a few days for your money.
Sir is on a retreat.
In a monastery, yes.
Hello?
Goodbye.
Mr. Nardo is on retreat in a monastery.
He's doing meditation with Father Agostino.
And how long is this meditation going to last?
I've been waiting two weeks for my pay.
Did you know that?
Put that down.
The boss is on a retreat.
Yeah, not the first time he's pulled this.
- Who are you?
- The bailiff.
- And what do you want?
- To seize your assets.
Are you his partner?
You're kidding!
I don't even know he's my nephew.
Where is Mr. Nardi?
With Father Agostino.
You know, with the beard.
My nephew is having a spiritual crisis.
Too bad!
I'll proceed with the seizure.
Help yourself!
Can you hear the goldfinch?
Come -- do you see him?
Try -- let's see if he'll answer you.
No.
Did you hear?
He answered me!
You see, when you renounce worldly goods, you come into possession of the whole world.
You can speak with the birds, savor a glass of pure water, and feast on bread and walnuts.
Sir?
The bus is here.
Hurry or you'll miss it.
- I'm coming.
- Here's a bag of walnuts to remember us by.
Thank you.
Thank you for everything, Father Agostino.
I was so in need of a friendly voice, a few comforting words.
You've always given me good advice.
Even during the war ...
Let's not exaggerate, my son.
Sometimes, when I talk to you, you don't seem to understand.
When I first came, my ideas were confused.
But now everything is clear.
I fear nothing, not even death.
Yes, my son.
What is death to a good Christian?
Death is the supreme happiness!
I'm so glad to hear you say so.
I feel lighter, more sure of myself.
Sir?
- Goodbye and thanks.
- Goodbye, Alberto.
Goodbye, Father.
I'll send you figs!
See you soon, I hope, Father!
During my week of solitude and contemplation,
I thought much of life and death.
There comes a moment when a man must choose.
- Are you listening, Stucchi?
- Yes.
On the one hand, there's our 20th century life, chasing after money.
On the other hand, renunciation.
That's all.
No middle ground.
Congratulations!
You've chosen renunciation!
Are you nuts?
I'm chasing after money.
I'm going to do great things.
My mind is clear now.
We can make a billion in a couple of months.
Pull up a packing case and listen.
Comfy?
Sir, aren't you going to go on with my patent work?
No, we're staying with elevators.
We've given them 5 years of our lives.
Criticism, humilation, crashes ...
We must go on, just to prove we were right.
If you return the 700,000 lire I lent you,
I'll go back to Rome.
- Not a chance!
You're not getting a cent back.
- No?
No, you're coming in with me.
You'll earn 7 million, maybe 17 million.
Let me finish -- you'll understand then.
All right.
What's it all about?
Simple as can be.
Pay attention.
This is still in the embryonic stage.
Let's say this elevator is in my building.
The motor and the brake were designed by our own Fritzmayer.
Here is the cabin, apparently normal - but, in fact, not.
- Why?
Because we've loosened the floorplate screws.
A couple kilos of pressure and it falls through.
But why?
Please, Stucchi, let me finish.
Thus, if you push the call button on the 19th floor -- mine -- the cabin will rise gently to the level of the floor.
Slowly the door opens.
Then the human element comes into play.
Suppose it were my wife who pushed the call button.
- Your wife?
- Exactly.
Madam Elvira enters the elevator.
The floor of the cabin gives way.
She falls from the 19th floor and crashes to the ground.
And I inherit a billion.
What do you think?
Sir?
Mr. Lambertoni is here.
I'll let you think about it.
Iced coffee?
That's mine.
- Sugared?
- Yes.
I said no sugar!
The amaro.
- The bun ...
- No, that's mine.
Cappuccino and a bun.
Things being how they are, my boss wants her 37,000 lire.
Not now.
Okay.
Don't worry, I'll pay up ...
Fine.
Don't tell me your plans.
That's your business.
Very well ...
Including this 2 million your balance due is 12,300,000 lire.
- Correct.
- And you'll give me 20 million?
- Yes.
Come, Nardi!
Listen, your wife's a dear friend, so we won't discuss it further.
Just a word of friendly advice:
make sure of all your details.
Don't worry!
You'll have your 20 million!
Miss?
I'm sure all will be well.
Don't be downhearted!
Deposit this check and prepare the payroll.
- Avanti!
We're back in business!
- Very good, sir.
My dear Lambertoni,
What are you doing in Milan in this heat?
Take a vacation!
Two million.
Marquis, you're owed two months' salary.
Yes, why?
The boss said he was paying everyone.
Well?
Have you thought about it?
What have you decided?
Sir, forgive me, I must be frank.
How can an intelligent, sensitive man like you, whom we've loved and respected for so many years, suggest such a thing?
Why?
Do you know how an elevator floor is constructed?
It can't be unscrewed.
Well, let's find another method.
You're the technician.
You'll figure something out.
That's what I pay you for.
How much?
Three months' back salary.
Cheers!
- Here you go!
- Thank you.
The elevator cabin should be at another floor when the door opens.
See?
Where there's a will, there's a way.
- Sir ...
- Don't get up.
So far we've only addressed the technical aspect.
I have an objection at the human level.
Meaning?
It's about your wife.
Here, marquis -- two months, correct?
What about my wife?
You know her better than I do.
She's a clever woman with a sharp eye.
If she sees there's no elevator, she'll take the stairs.
Good point, marquis!
But that's what we're here for -- to solve these problems.
- Alberto, would you like my opinion?
- Of course, uncle!
- We'll end up in jail, all of us.
- Don't be silly!
We have an office, a factory, financing ...
If we plan this all out, it's foolproof.
All right?
Fine.
Tonight, go out and have fun.
I'm going dancing with my wife.
Tomorrow we'll get cracking.
And to avoid confusion, we'll call it "Project Elvira."
Very good, sir.
- You won't need me tonight?
- No, uncle, I'm going dancing.
- Alberto?
- Yes?
- Don't I get a check?
- No.
- No?
- You're a partner now.
What happened during my spiritual exile?
Of course, a businessman like you can have a mistress -- but my penniless nitwit?
These are expensive amusements!
And how!
If I drew up the account ...!
What is all this?
Well, I've become great friends with your wife.
She introduced him to me.
Fenoglio is a very rich man.
But Gioia, I'm young!
And intelligent!
And soon I'll be richer and more powerful than he.
She still thinks your husband is a great man.
She's an idiot, an epico-pathetic idiot.
But instead of a hero, she's got my husband.
Ah well, I fell for him too ...
What should I do?
Trust me.
Say goodbye to the gorilla.
But I'm committed.
To whom?
To the gorilla.
He invited me on a cruise.
Your wife has everything arranged.
It's for my benefit.
You're stupid and my wife is a weasel.
So what should I do?
I have to go.
Have to?
No, Gioia, you won't go on that cruise.
You'll stay with me -- that's final.
It's too late now.
- What do you want me to tell him?
- I'll tell you!
So, paragraph 21 ...
"The elevator door opens and madam enters the cabin."
"The indicator light comes on." Continue.
- How's it going, Fritzmayer?
- Fine.
- I switched the functions -- 19 for 20 and 20 for 19.
- Perfect!
May I?
My research shows the lowest usage in the late evening, around 10:40.
And what dates would be most suitable?
- Christmastime.
- No, she'll be visiting her mother.
November 1 or 2, then.
All Saints' Day and the Day of the Dead.
No irony intended, let's take the Day of the Dead.
What do you think, uncle?
Fine.
We have eight weeks exactly to arrange everything down to the last detail.
We're not to be disturbed!
Your little wife wouldn't dream of disturbing you.
Hello, everyone.
Hello, Signora Almiraghi.
I don't want to interrupt your work --
My dear, I work for myself, but also for you.
Are you still set on elevators?
I know I'll make my fortune through elevators.
And I'm sure they'll be the finish of you.
We shall see ...
- Shall we go?
- Now?
It's 5:00, Fenoglio's expecting us.
Marquis?
My dear colleagues, take the next two days off.
We'll go back to work on Monday.
Shall we go, Rockefeller?
We're off!
Will there be interesting people at Fenoglio's?
A mixed crowd.
But you can look forward to seeing your ex-mistress!
I know.
It will be lots of fun.
Alberto?
Gioia?
We agree?
I'll do whatever you want ...
A kiss right there ...
- Alberto, they're looking at us ...
- Gioia?
- You won't change your mind?
- No.
- Promise.
- I promise.
Go.
Thank you.
Join us!
Good!
Tonight we'll fly to Nice.
Two yachts will be there.
A little one for me and my favorite people.
- You'll be missed!
- I've got Mamma ...
And a big one, for the deplorables -- they're always in the majority.
First port of call:
England.
Where everything is fine.
What do you say, Gioia?
I don't like the English!
Hear, hear!
Whatever did they do to you?
They fought us in the war.
Then they opened and closed the Suez Canal, bankrupting lots of people!
I agree completely!
Tell me, Gioia, who told you this nonsense?
Someone who may not have your millions, but has something much more important:
intelligence!
Listen, blondie:
First, learn to keep your mouth shut.
Second, with your physique, you've got a career ahead of you.
But today, even for that kind of career, you need education and savoir-vivre -- two things you don't have!
What is this career?
Being a kept woman!
Take that for your insolence!
Bravo!
The gorilla sends his regards.
These little dollies can pack a punch sometimes.
Listen, now that there's a place on the friends' yacht, I'd love to come.
Great!
- Mamma's doing so well lately.
- Perfect!
- You're losing on the exchange, though.
- Come now!
I'm profiting!
A dear, bright friend like you ...
Oh Lord!
She's leaving ...
This changes everything.
"The elevator ..."
"stops ..."
"on the 20th ..."
"floor ..."
- Yes?
- Mr. Nardi on the phone for you.
Let's see what's new.
Hello, sir.
I'm just typing up our plan.
What?
Big changes?
She'll be away for three months?
Wonderful!
That gives us extra time ...
I remind you that I, too, have my dignity.
We're doing it tonight?
But ...
You gave us eight weeks!
I'll tell him!
It can't be done tonight.
Hear that?
Vivaldi.
- Who?
- Vivaldi!
Marquis, you have visitors.
Good evening!
- May I bring you something?
- Four coffees, please.
- Coffee, sir?
- Yes.
Strong.
Very good.
Listening to the radio?
Vivaldi.
Bye-bye, Vivaldi.
Time is short.
We're with you 100% on this project.
- However...
- To business!
Have you got the project?
Yes, I made four copies.
Attention:
I made some modifications.
Hand it out.
So ...
Paragraph one:
We're going ahead tonight, not in 40 days, as indicated here.
Paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5, through paragraph 16, are unchanged.
So we turn the page to paragraph 17:
"My uncle enters the bar."
"He goes to the telephone and looks at ..."
"the 19th floor window."
- Mine.
- The light's on.
- What time is it?
- 10:15.
First change.
Pen!
Write, "1:00 a.m."
My wife's plane is at 2:15.
Paragraph 18:
"The light is on.
I leave the apartment with my wife."
"I turn off the light.
I close the door."
"Once the light is off,"
"I dial your number."
New page.
"My wife and I are on the landing."
"My wife hears the phone ring, goes back inside ..."
Will she be the one to go?
Silly question!
I know my wife.
- And my uncle?
- I apologize and hang up.
I order a cognac and ask the time.
So the barman sees you and you've got your alibi.
Very precise!
Be quiet, marquis.
Now, attention, every second counts.
Everything is connected.
"While my wife is answering the phone, I take the elevator down."
- Where are you?
- Upstairs, on the 20th floor.
You hear the elevator going down.
You know I'm in it.
"I go to the ground floor and wake up the concierge."
My alibi.
What does the marquis do?
I cut the electricity on the 18th, 19th, and 20th floors.
Onward!
Paragraph 21, next page.
Marquis?
"Your wife leaves the apartment, shuts the door and goes to the elevator."
"The elevator doesn't stop on the 19th floor, but goes directly to the 20th."
"But the indicator light on the 19th floor says the elevator has arrived."
Stop!
This is the decisive moment.
The elevator door opens.
My wife steps forward.
But, not seeing the cabin, she hesitates.
Well, sir, are you training to be mimes?
Never mind, Milena.
I'll take care of it.
- Is your wife well?
- She's leaving tonight, for a cruise.
How I envy her!
I'd love to be in her place.
- Thank you.
- A cruise is my dream!
But I still haven't found the right traveling companion.
I'll take care of this.
That will be all, the marquis is taking care of it.
I hope she didn't hear anything.
No, she's just hinting.
She has a weakness for me.
She'd like to marry me.
I'm not againt the idea,
- but Mamma doesn't like it.
- Who cares!
So -- where is my wife?
In front of the elevator.
How are you getting out of this?
Pay attention, you won't be disappointed.
It's a matter of seconds, marquis.
As soon as the door closes, be ready to act.
- How?
- Very simply:
You take off your shoes and go downstairs in the dark, barefoot, to the 19th floor.
You won't need light.
The silhouette in front of the elevator will be my wife.
Without hesitating, you push her!
I push her?
Yes, you push her.
She falls.
- And then?
- You take the service stairs.
And my alibi?
You'll enter the building by the front door.
I'll be there, looking at the corpse, with the concierge.
- And mine?
- You won't be there.
- I'm not in on this?
- Yes, yes.
You take the 3:20 train to visit your sister-in-law and come back for the funeral.
Is there a problem?
No, but are you sure everything will work?
I'm so sure our project will succeed,
I've already ordered the wreath.
Attention!
It's 10:45 less 15 seconds.
We'll begin the operation at 12:55.
Synchronize watches.
In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
So, my three magazines, two suitcases, travel case, umbrella ...
I believe that's everything.
I forgot my passport.
What an idiot I am!
Your passport?
You're leaving without your passport?
You're never on time!
Now we're late: it's 12:57.
Go on, Elvira.
I'll turn off the lights.
Now, Uncle!
Easy for you, in your ivory tower!
But I come back to Lodi and what do I find!
The whole town's talking!
Oh yes!
Are you listening?
I'm sorry, I must use the phone.
Urgent call.
So's mine.
Mine's more!
Have you got everything, darling?
- You didn't forget anything?
- No.
- Sure?
- Yes.
You've got everything?
- Shall I ring for the elevator?
- Yes!
I'm ringing for the elevator!
Easy!
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Why?
1, 2, 3 ...
Really, marquis, restrain yourself!
11 ... 12, 13,
14 ...
- Telephone!
- Mamma!
You get it, I'll take the luggage down!
OK, 18 ...
It's for you.
- Who is it?
- Your uncle.
My uncle?
What uncle?
- It can't be ...
- Hurry!
I'll miss the plane!
My uncle ...
Hello?
What happened?
Did she recognize you?
Right away!
What should I do?
Let's forget about it for tonight!
Forget about it!
Hang up, count to ten, and call again.
Do I have time for a cognac?
A cognac -- are you nuts?
Call back.
Use a woman's voice.
A woman's voice?
Elvira?
Oh, no, Uncle!
It's going down!
The boss is going down.
Perfect!
3 ... 2 ...
Coming back!
Gotcha!
3, 4, 5, 6 ... 7, 8, 9 ...
It's coming back empty.
Perfect.
10, 11, 12 ... 13 ...
Ring, Uncle!
14, 15, 16 ...
Louder, Uncle!
Louder!
19 ... there it is!
There you are!
Why did you call the elevator back?
The telephone -- your mother.
Mamma!
- How do you know it's her?
- Who else would it be?
The elevator reaches the 20th floor.
On the 19th, the indicator lights up.
I'll cut the electricity.
You, marquis, take off your shoes.
As soon as it's dark, be ready to act!
Good work, Mr. Technician!
Who'll give me back my 700,000 lire now?
There's always a silver lining.
Technically, everything worked.
Blame the marquis if you like.
Look, I acted in the dark.
I held my shoes in my hand.
I counted to 10 and when I saw a silhouette...
I pushed.
When I heard the poor man's voice saying:
"Marquis, are you pushing me?"
... it was too late.
NARRATOR:
First in Alaska and then
Invading steadily southward, there
Were reports of a new species.
The giant killer shrew.
[THUNDER]
Sure is a lot of quiet out there.
Almost smell it, can't you?
No, I but I can feel it.
That pressure's dropped so fast it's almost made my ears pop.
Hurricanes got definite ways of telling you it's there.
Where is it?
Dead ahead.
What's that mean to us?
Now boy, that puts our port right in the middle of it.
There's a cove on the east side though.
We'll snuggle up close to the bluff and ride it out.
What about the bottom?
Well, the chart shows it's good holding ground.
It's clay.
You know something?
If this thing had an automatic pilot,
I wouldn't have to put up with you.
Then you wouldn't have nobody to chew out.
We should be there in a couple of hours.
These mills of yours keep running.
Look, automatic pilots can't play dixieland jazz
On their [INAUDIBLE] like I can.
Hey, Rook.
Rook, come here.
Take a look.
There she is, dead ahead.
Man, that sure do look good.
Man named Craigis owns this island, does he?
That's the name on the crate, Dr. Marlowe Craigis.
We'll unload tomorrow.
I don't want this crap sitting high in that water
When that blow hits.
You going to ride [INAUDIBLE] with a lot of water under?
That's right.
That sea won't make up in that cove.
That wind will have her whipping around like a kite.
Step forward and break out the heavy weather hook.
Check it and make sure it's free to run.
- I don't mind, sir.
- Good.
Ah, she'll ride like a duck.
If she swings too far to starboard
We might have to take a check line to shore.
Hey Rook, take a slant up that trail.
Now that's a rather strange set up, wouldn't you say?
Looks like somebody's getting rid of somebody, huh captain?
Maybe.
Hard to tell.
I'm Dr. Craigis.
Thorne Sherman.
I have your supplies aboard.
That's good.
Nothing wrong with Captain [INAUDIBLE], I hope?
I wouldn't know.
I just bought his run.
Oh, I see.
Well, [INAUDIBLE] order?
Everything on the list.
Here's the manifest.
Missing last week's supply has run us a little short,
You know.
Captain, after you have unloaded,
I have a passenger for you.
Ann.
Captain Sherman, this is my daughter, Ann Craigis.
Hello.
So you're the passenger.
That's right, Captain.
Well, it's going to be nice having you aboard.
I'm getting a little tired of looking at Griswold.
But we're, uh, we're not leaving today.
In fact, we're not even unloading.
That load will cut the roll in half.
You expecting an invasion?
Yes, animals.
Game or otherwise?
Under certain conditions it could be dangerous.
Hey Rook, you want to shake the kinks out, limber up a little?
Not me, Captain.
You go right ahead and stretch your legs.
That ship's going to be bucking like a bucking bronco
Before long.
Besides, I got some work left to do.
If you do come ashore, wear a gun.
Got you, Captain.
When I told you about the hurricane,
You acted like you didn't know anything about it.
What's the matter?
Your set broken down?
We have been out of communication for more than a
Week, Captain.
Can't it be fixed?
It's totally out of commission.
My assistant, Mr. Farrell, Jerry Farrell.
Father, perhaps the captain would enjoy a drink.
Well of course.
Will you join us for a cocktail?
Well, I've never been known to turn down a drink yet.
I'd be glad to accept.
Fine.
In that case we'll have martinis.
Mario.
Si, senor?
Mix them, please.
Right this way, Captain.
Come in.
You have everything here you need?
We are self sufficient here.
We have cows for fresh milk and chickens for fresh eggs.
We even have [INAUDIBLE] horses.
Sort of a world all your own.
That's exactly what I've tried to create.
Well, to each his own.
If you have to be isolated for your work,
You picked a lonely little island.
Excuse me, please, I think I'll change.
She's a little worried because you
Aren't leaving until tomorrow.
Well, I can understand that.
But there's something else bothering her.
Radford.
Radford.
Radford, would you please step over here?
I'd like you to meet someone.
Just a second, Doctor.
That could go on for hours.
Dr. Baines.
There's no need to shout, Doctor, I'm right here.
I'd like you to meet Captain Thorne Sherman.
This is my other assistant, Radford Baines.
How do you do?
Two new litters since lunch, Doctor.
Both support GT116.
That's good, but, uh...
We can breed them to the 205 group in about three weeks.
But I'd prefer to wait and expose about half of them
To the Hoskins factor first.
If you agree.
Good idea.
Do you know there's a hurricane coming?
Hurricane?
Well, I don't suppose there's much we can do about that.
Glad to meet you.
Sherman, was it?
You have to excuse Radford.
Anything that does not concern his
Project cannot get through to him.
Brilliant mind.
He would starve to death if someone
Didn't remind him to eat.
Must be very interesting work.
What's his field?
Biology.
He specializes in genetics, heredity.
I'm afraid my interest doesn't run in that line, you know.
Think what would happen if you could isolate and identify
The inherited [INAUDIBLE] in each gene.
Now wait a minute.
I'm afraid I'm not very good with pure research.
This is practical research.
[INAUDIBLE] mammals, the smaller the size, the higher
The metabolism and shorter the life span.
Yeah, right.
Well, I'm attempting to decrease the size
By maintaining a low metabolism and result
In a longer lifespan.
What reason?
Overpopulation.
Not a problem now, but it will be in time.
If we were half as big as we are now,
We could live twice as long in our natural resources.
Father, may I speak with you a moment?
Will you please excuse us, Captain?
Well, providing you drop the captain.
I prefer Thorne.
Tell me something, Doctor.
Has a hurricane ever hit this island before that you know of?
I wouldn't know.
We've only been here nine months and this place
Has been unoccupied for years.
Well have you ever been through one?
Only the fringes.
Well, this one's building up very fast.
Pressure drops very quickly in the center.
I'd advise you to get some doors and windows open in this place.
Ventillators in the roof.
And if you'll freshen Ann's drink I'll go and check them.
I'd be happy too.
Thank heavens you arrived today.
Why, are rations getting short?
No, it's more than that.
Much more.
We'll surely be able to sail tomorrow, won't we?
Possibly.
But not probable.
Not until late, anyway.
Takes a long time for a sea like that to quiet down.
Well if you're worrying about me, you needn't.
I'm a good sailor.
Oh, I'm not worried about you.
We'll sail when the time's right.
Got them opened all right.
Oh, Captain, let me freshen you a drink.
One for the road.
Not trying to rush you, but it will be dark soon.
I've invited Thorne for dinner, father.
Oh?
I see.
If you're not worried about your ship, you are welcome.
I'll take a rain check on that dinner.
If you wish.
Father.
I've asked Thorne to stay.
Progress, Doctor.
This is the sole survivor of group 30.
28 months old today.
Well that's equivalent to 140 years to us.
That's right.
Yet it still maintains low metabolism
Without any sluggishness.
It's not a breakthrough, but it certainly sets our course.
Radford, suspend series 52 through 96
And we'll concentrate on the rest.
What is that?
It's a sorex soricidae.
Looks like a small rat.
Smells like a skunk.
They have musk glands [INAUDIBLE].
These little fellas are our subjects.
They have a birth cycle of 10 to 14 days and using them
We can establish traits.
We can trace the progressions through a number
Of generations over a short period of time.
Well how big do they get?
That's an adult.
See, the muzzle is long and thicker than a rat's.
It extends over the lower mandible, see?
Does he bite?
Only when he is hungry.
Well, maybe you'd better take him.
He doesn't know me.
All he knows is his next meal.
He's just been fed.
He'll be all right for another eight hours.
[CRASHING]
[SCREAMS]
A shutter blew open.
Radford.
I got it, senor.
Don't let that scare you.
It's going to get worse.
Storms always frighten her, ever since she was a child.
They are not climbers.
They are digging animals, like the mole.
They feed only at night unless they are starving.
And when they are hungry enough, they'll
Tackle anything regardless of size.
No kidding.
If you leave two of them in a cage for 12 hours without food,
The stronger will eat the weaker.
Like cannibals.
Precisely.
You see, their intense activity requires
A tremendous amount of energy.
To supply, they must eat three times their own weight in food
Every 24 hours or starve.
Radford.
Radford, would you please take this?
Take him.
Some call them bone eaters.
When the flesh is gone, they'll eat the bones for marrow.
All they leave are teeth, horns, hooves...
I could use another martini.
Do you mind?
Of course, my dear.
I'll get you one.
There you are.
Mario?
Mario.
[SPEAKING SPANISH] Mario will show you to the bath
And you will freshen up a bit.
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
Excuse me.
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
You got a problem too?
Que paso?
[SPEAKING SPANISH] But you will leave on the ship tomorrow.
Well, I think that all depends on the wind and the sea,
Don't you?
Si.
Si senor.
I don't know.
Ah, [INAUDIBLE].
I feel the point.
I see.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
Now if anybody else is concerned about my sailing
Tomorrow, why, you see they feel the point too, huh?
I don't like to repeat myself.
OK, senor.
I know, but I'm not saying that you created them, Jerry.
I am saying that because of your drunken stupidity
In leaving the cage door open, you
Created the horrible situation that now exists.
Look, Ann, this is a mistake any one of us might have made.
And I'm getting a little sick of being called
An irresponsible drunk, now believe me I am.
Excuse me.
Care for a cigarette?
Thanks.
And thank heavens you arrived today.
You said that before.
What's the strain?
If I don't make sense, please excuse me.
But it seems like everything is coming to a head at once.
Oh?
I want to leave, but I want my father to go with me.
Well then, why doesn't he?
We've discussed it many times, but he's adamant.
I'm sure Jerry has a lot to do with his decision.
He tried to convince me that the crisis
Will only last for a few...
Well.
This is certainly a cozy little scene.
Might even be called intimate.
Boy meets girl...
Stop it, Jerry.
That remark is uncalled for.
What I do or have to say does not concern you.
I can't disagree with you more, my dear.
I'm concerned with everything you do
And I intend to keep it that way.
Now on my book an engagement isn't a casual thing.
In my book it isn't either.
And last night ended ours.
[SHREWS CHATTERING]
[GUNSHOTS]
[THUNDER]
[THUNDER]
[SHREWS CHATTERING]
Help!
Help!
Captain Thorne!
Somebody help!
Help, Captain Thorne!
[THUNDER]
Be reasonable.
Everybody in the world is scared to death of something.
That's evident.
When they came at us last night you
Knocked me down getting inside the fence.
It's just that I can't stand them.
And I've discovered something I can't stand.
All right.
But I advise you not to mention it to anyone.
I'm going to complete these experiments with your father
Regardless of anything, do you understand that?
Nobody is going to take this chance away from me.
Where's Captain Sherman?
Checking the weather.
I'll get him.
Captain?
Time for dinner.
[SHREWS CHATTERING]
Help!
Somebody!
Help!
Help me!
No!
Somebody!
Help!
[GUNSHOTS]
Help!
Somebody help me!
Help me!
[SCREAMS]
[SCREAMING]
[THUNDER]
Well, a miss as good as a mile, I always say.
And if one of those trees crashes through
It might just knock the whole...
Look, any tree on this side of the house
Will fall away from us, so just relax.
But I think I'd better go back aboard.
Don't think I'm not grateful for your hospitality.
I am.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Thorne.
Your ship is safe.
Please, stay here with me.
Why?
You scared or lonesome?
Both.
I'll take a rain check on it.
Thorne.
You can't leave.
No one opens that gate after dark.
Well, who's going to stop me?
You?
With this.
No one opens that gate at night.
[SHREWS CHATTERING]
Look, I don't ask questions because it's
Against my principles.
But wouldn't you like to explain that?
All right.
Sit down and I will.
Give me the gun.
Not very becoming, anyway.
Do you believe in fairy tales?
Well, I'm a little old for that sort of thing,
But what did you have in mind?
Well I'll tell you about one.
A true fairy tale, and you're right in the middle of it.
Oh?
Have you ever heard of a shrew?
As in "Taming of the"...
No, the animal.
Radford called them sorex soricidae
When he showed you one.
Well, then shrew must be the common name
For those cute little animals.
Cute?
That's the last word you can use to describe
Those little monsters.
They're the most horrible animals
On the face of the earth.
As father told you, they breed within three weeks after birth.
Their lifespan is one year.
Yeah, I know what your father told me.
But what's that got to do with me opening that gate?
There are 200 or 300 giant shrews out there.
Monsters weighing between 50 and 100 pounds.
50 to 100... wait a minute.
You must be kidding.
I'm definitely not kidding.
That's as big as a full grown wolf.
And what's more, they are beginning to starve.
No wonder you didn't want me to go out there.
Thanks for saving my skin.
And I'm sorry I had to threaten you with a gun.
But I didn't know how else to stop you.
It was very effective.
But all you had to do was tell me about them.
I hoped I wouldn't have to.
But you changed everything when you started to leave.
And I had to stop you some way.
You say there's 200 or 300 out there?
Ann.
That's right, Captain Thorne.
And if you'd stuck with your row boat
And played captain instead of trying to play detective,
You wouldn't have to worry about how many are out there,
Would you?
That's enough, Jerry.
What's wrong, Ann?
Thorne decided to leave.
To dissuade him I started to tell him about the shrews.
He might as well know the whole story as half of it.
I guess we're all a little jumpy, captain.
I'm sorry.
Six months ago we managed to isolate
The path to controlling size.
Two litters were born.
Six individuals kept for study.
They were about the size of buckshot at birth.
But the rate of growth was abnormal.
They continued to grow and grow.
They were mutants.
But they inherited all the negative characteristics
Of their breed.
Somehow they managed to escape.
About a month later we saw one of their offspring.
They were multiplying.
We did everything in the world to exterminate them,
But no apparent luck.
Then we haven't seen any since daylight blinds them and they
Forage only at night unless starving.
But the fact that two of them charged Ann and Jerry
At the gate last evening indicates
That their available food on the island is nearing depletion.
Then what, Doctor?
They will exterminate each other.
It will take a couple days.
And what do we do during that time?
Stay indoors and wait until it's over.
I guess some wires blew down on the transformer.
I'm sorry.
I'll get some lamps.
Mario.
Mario.
Si, senor?
There's a lantern in the pantry.
Light it and bring it in here.
Radford, light all the candles you can find.
All right, I will.
Where's the generator?
Outside.
Can't get at it at night.
Here, let me help.
A lantern will give you all the light you need.
I will join you shortly, Jerry.
[THUNDER]
Well, Jerry, I felt she was sincere
And made sense from her standpoint.
Wanting her father to leave the island with her makes sense?
It'd be much better for the project
If I went with her for a few days.
As a matter of fact, I think I'll talk to Doctor about that.
That might be the answer.
And another thing, I don't take much to this Thorne Sherman.
He looks to me like the type that would try anything.
That left handed dinner invitation.
That was just to keep me here until after dark, wasn't it?
I wanted you here tonight.
I thought something terrible was going to happen.
Do you still feel the same way about it?
Not as much.
Not since you're here and know everything.
[SHREWS CHATTERING]
[HORSE NEIGHING]
I love an open fire, don't you?
Mm-hmm.
The wind has a lonesome sound, doesn't it?
Sure does.
Back in Sweden we don't have a wind this strong.
You're a strange man, Thorne.
I never met anyone like you.
Oh?
You seem so disinterested in everything.
Aren't you the least bit curious?
Don't you wonder about the unusual things around here?
The guns, the fence, shattered windows, my accent, anything?
I'll tell you something.
I'm only interested in anything that concerns me,
Then I do something about it.
[HORSE NEIGHING]
You're going to sail with me tomorrow whether your father
[INAUDIBLE].
[HORSE NEIGHING]
Thorne, no!
Father!
Rad!
Out there.
I don't think he was going out, Jerry.
I couldn't take a chance.
He's fool enough to.
Don't be stupid.
I had no intentions of going out there and opening
That gate unless somebody needed it.
Did you hear it, Doctor?
Sounded like a human voice.
I was thinking of Rook.
It was the livestock.
The shrews got into the barn.
What was it, father?
The livestock.
Did Mario forget to bar those doors?
No.
I put them in the barn myself.
They couldn't get through the wood doors.
They dug through the dirt floor.
Let me ask you something, Doctor.
How could you expose all our lives, yourself included,
With those things out there?
All you had to do was get the Coast Guard or the Navy
To come in here and burn them out.
Those things got loose...
Any unusual experiment can produce unusual results.
That's why I chose this island.
It's isolated.
Miles of open water in any direction.
Our project is privately financed.
It's not a product for the government or military.
And the world is no danger.
This species does not swim.
And as far as the shrews are concerned,
This island is their world.
Very soon, right here on this island,
There's going to be a miniature reproduction
Of an overpopulated world.
And you'll see the importance of what we're working to avoid.
I'm not concerned about all this theory.
What I'm concerned about is our lives.
There'll be ample time to panic when they run out of food
And go on a 24 hour forage.
How do you know they haven't already?
That's possible.
Their main diet has been small animals on the island.
That source could have been depleted 18 or 20 hours ago.
And that's why they went after the livestock.
There's still some food on this island
Before they reach the crisis.
Where?
No worry about them digging in here.
The floors are tile.
But the walls aren't, Doctor.
They're adobe.
Our safest bet would be on that boat.
You may be right.
You can reach your boat in daylight.
The shrews will gorge themselves on livestock.
That will keep them lethargic for several hours.
There's no sense looking at the dark side.
And there's no sense minimizing a serious situation.
It leaves you completely unprepared to cope with it.
Now we certainly can't make it tonight.
That's out of the question.
Maybe tomorrow.
I have it.
We'll get some sleep tonight, but we'll
Have a watch, an hour and a half apiece.
Doctor, you go first, and then Radford, Mario, Jerry,
And then me.
Shutter all the windows.
Make sure they're locked good and tight.
Check all these walls.
Come now.
No, I think I'll stay here by the fire.
I feel safer.
I couldn't stand it in that room alone.
All right.
As you wish.
But try to get some sleep.
I will.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Senor Farrell, it is Mario.
You are next to make the patrol, no?
(SLURRING) Sure, Mario, come on in.
Been waiting for you to finish.
I must have dozed off.
You kind of startled me.
Sit down.
Here.
Have a drink.
It'll help you to relax.
Gracias, senor.
Sit down.
Rest a while.
You just checked every room in the house, didn't you?
Si.
Fine.
You're a good man, Mario.
A man that can be trusted.
You know what I've been thinking about, Mario?
Ann and that captain.
You and me.
Imagine an intelligent girl like her going
For a common sea tramp like him.
I know why.
You do too.
In case anything goes wrong she's
Looking out for her own hide.
That's why I keep thinking about you and me.
Anything goes wrong, we're going to outlast them all.
[THUNDER]
I'm going to trust you to take my turn
At patrolling the house.
But when you finish, don't wake the captain.
Come back here and get me.
I'll probably feel good enough by then to take his turn.
OK, Mario?
Si.
OK.
[SHREWS SQUEAKING]
Senor, it is Mario.
Mario.
Come on in.
What is it?
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
A shrew in the cellar?
Si.
I hear him [INAUDIBLE] down there.
Well how did he get in?
The [INAUDIBLE] the kitchen window.
But I close it off.
He went down there.
Why should he go down there?
The food for the [INAUDIBLE].
I [INAUDIBLE].
They love it.
Well did you tell Jerry?
No, senor.
He [INAUDIBLE] your turn next.
Here is [INAUDIBLE].
We kill him, no?
Yeah.
Ann.
Ann, wake up.
A shrew got in.
It's all right.
He's down in the cellar.
Now, we're going down after him.
But I don't want you to let anybody
Open that door until I tell you to.
You understand?
Good girl.
OK.
Open it just a crack.
Open it.
Hold on to it.
OK.
Take that side.
Mario?
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
You see anything?
I see where he was.
I do not see where he is.
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
Si, senor.
I will be careful.
[GUNSHOT]
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
Here, let me fix that.
[SHREW SQUEAKING]
[GUNSHOT]
You all right down there?
Doctor, get down here quick.
Mario!
He... he's dead.
Dead?
I got this on him right away.
He couldn't have bled to death.
Might as well let go of it.
Won't do him any good now.
What could have killed him?
I'm not certain.
Until the autopsy.
Hemotoxic syndrome.
I'm afraid so.
We'll know after pathology.
Doctor, that's not the same animal you showed me.
That's a monster.
As I said, they are mutants.
In controlling the size factor, we
Seem to have crossed some of the other characteristics.
Well, you certainly did a good job of it.
I've known that for some time, Captain.
Would you please give me a hand with Mario?
Radford, bring up the animal.
Extremely high poison content in the shrew's saliva.
Mm-hmm.
Now compare it with this.
Careful count isn't necessary.
Any indication the same poison in Mario's blood
Will give you the answer.
Yes, you're right.
Look, Ann.
Brooding about it's not going to do any good.
Now why don't you try to think of something else?
Tell me, what do you do around here?
Are you a scientist?
I'm a zoologist.
Oh?
That's the study of animal life, isn't it?
Well, do you specialize?
What do you specialize in?
[INAUDIBLE].
I had a hand in this too.
I'm partly to blame.
[SHREWS CHATTERING]
[INAUDIBLE].
If we ever get off this island, I'll
Never have anything to do with it again.
What will you do?
Live normally, like normal women do.
May seem a little dull after the life I've been living.
But I'd rather dull and alive than excited and...
I'd take a dull alive woman every time.
Say, Thorne.
The autopsy has proved what we suspected.
Several weeks ago I concocted the most virulent poison
I could with the materials I had at hand.
I put it out as bait.
Mario was killed by poison.
Doctor, I wonder if you thought the system of the sorex
Enabled them to assimilate that poison.
It remained in the salivary glands of their jaws.
Isn't that wonderful?
I am sorry.
Of course I always speak from the clinical point of view.
Well, don't you have something to counteract that poison?
Once Mario was bitten I'm afraid there's nothing anyone
Could have done.
This indicates that we cannot afford to get even so much
As a scratch from these animals.
They're more poisonous than snakes.
What, do you think they're all effected?
Best way to find out is let them all
Bite you and see which bites you die after.
We might just all get that chance, Jerry.
You included.
Doctor, I've closed all the doors in the house.
I suggest we do the same thing with this hall and this lab.
It'll cut down the chances of getting
In the front of the house.
I think if we keep a close watch on those walls and windows
In there, we might make it until daybreak.
The walls are two feet thick.
Do you think they have a chance to dig in?
Of course there's a chance.
Anywhere that plaster's off, that adobe's as soft as mush
Where that rain hit it.
[SHREW SQUEAKING]
It's not a bad idea, Doctor.
But here's another possibility, Doctor.
It's very light out.
It's going to be daylight soon.
We take the shrew that killed Mario
And throw it over the fence and use it for bait.
If they show up for it, of course the run for the boat's
Out.
But if they don't, then I'll go down
And have Rook lay too with the lighter.
Then I'll return to the bend in the trail
And give you the all clear signal.
Sounds fine, Captain.
Good, then you explain it to the rest.
Yes, I will.
Well, the bait's been out there 20 minutes.
Nothing's touched it.
Even the wind has gone down.
Isn't that wonderful?
I'm afraid it's not over, my dear.
It's just a lull.
There'll be a lot more.
He's right.
I'll be back at the bend shortly.
Now you watch for my signal.
You can't go alone.
I'll go with him.
Not you, father.
You haven't even fired a gun.
Take Rad or Jerry.
Sure, I'll go.
And you'll be sure of getting a signal.
Don't shoot that gun unless you have to.
We've only got 20 rounds all together.
I know that as well as you do.
Sherman.
You stay away from her.
Do you have that gun pointed at me?
Right at the middle of your back.
Look, we got enough problems without worrying about Ann.
I'm telling you, stay away from her
Or when the shrews get through with you,
They won't even find a buckshot.
[SHREWS CHATTERING]
Hey, Rook!
Hey, Rook!
Rook!
[WHISTLES] Where's the skiff?
I'll follow that check line.
I've got to find him.
Since last night you won't find much of him.
Would you shut up?
I'm not going back.
You what?
I'm staying here.
All right.
You suit yourself.
But if I were you, I'd swim out to that boat.
Can't swim.
Then stay here.
Wait a minute.
You've got to give me a gun.
Give you a gun?
Sherman, wait!
This is the gun we had on the boat.
They don't leave much, do they?
Sherman, we've got to make a deal for...
[SHREWS SQUEAKING]
What is it?
Shh.
They've been trailing us on both sides.
Where?
I didn't see anything.
Look, Sherman, you've got to give me a gun.
All right.
Whatever you do, don't you run.
And you stay in front of me because I don't trust you.
[SHREWS CHATTERING]
They're coming!
Open the gate!
Open it!
[GUNSHOT]
Open the gate!
Open the gate!
Open up!
Let him in!
Jerry, open the door!
[GUNSHOT]
[INAUDIBLE].
Sherman!
The shrews were out there!
I couldn't take a chance!
[MEN YELLING]
For heaven's sakes.
Doctor, stop him!
All right, didn't he have it coming or didn't he?
What happened out there?
Oh, nothing much.
Jerry just tried to kill me twice in the last five minutes.
Rook came ashore last night.
He's dead.
This is all that was left.
Won't do us any good.
It's got no ammo.
I'm deeply sorry, Captain.
I wish he had followed your orders.
Look, Doctor, you casually mentioned animals.
You didn't explain to us what we were facing out there.
You have every right to feel the way that you do.
My mistake was only mine.
It was one of judgment.
I didn't know about the hurricane.
I didn't anticipate the effect it would have on the shrews.
I thought the house would be safe through the crisis.
How could you expose your own daughter?
How could you expose Ann to that?
She was going to leave last week, but the boat didn't come.
I need a drink.
Anybody else care for one?
I could use some coffee.
I'll make some.
Thank you, Ann.
Cream and sugar?
[SHREW CHATTERING]
Oh, my leg!
[GUNSHOTS]
Slam the door!
You all right, Doctor?
He just ripped my trousers, that's all.
Are you sure that's all?
I'm completely aware of it, Doctor.
I'll kill them!
[GUNSHOTS]
That was a stupid waste of ammunition.
Every one of them a clean miss.
There's still four of them in there.
How did they get in?
Through that kitchen window.
That rope must be rotten.
It's got him!
Radford!
He's dead.
Oh, no!
He recorded every symptom and reaction.
Right up to the moment of his death.
Jerry, tear down one of those drapes and cover him up.
Sure.
Sure.
Craigis will cover Ann and I'll cover him.
You'll cover me.
But who'll cover you?
Shut up.
We can get on [INAUDIBLE].
I told you to shut up.
Now you stop snivelling and think.
It'd take a tank to get us out of here.
Thorne!
There!
[SHREW SQUEAKING]
Won't take them long to dig around this.
You're right.
No telling where else they're digging too.
[GUNSHOTS]
Come on. [INAUDIBLE].
There's not enough stuff here to barricade those walls.
I'll tell you what, pile some of those crates up over there.
That roof's our last chance.
Help me, Doctor.
Find something light.
All right.
Here, [INAUDIBLE] Doctor.
Jerry, see if you can find some rope.
Doctor.
Yes?
Use these chemical drums as tanks.
Individual tanks.
Here, I'll show you.
Set it down now.
Slow.
All right.
All right?
Yeah.
It'll work.
It'll work.
But these drums are too tall for the base.
If the shrews don't push us over, the wind will.
Not if we lash them together.
Are there any more around here?
Only that one over there.
Have any [INAUDIBLE] chisels or hammers or anything
I could knock a hole in here and make [INAUDIBLE] pieces?
There are some tools over there in the corner.
Hey, here's another one.
Get that out there.
Hey, even better.
Give me a little more slack.
Get some rope and put it on that latch so we can [INAUDIBLE]
From the ground.
[SCREAMS]
[SHREW SHRIEKING]
Now hold this in.
All right.
All right.
We're all set.
Look, it's going to be rough, but we
Should be able to duck walk to the beach.
Where's Jerry?
There's a lot of them out there.
I can see them.
I'm not going.
Look, come down here!
That wind will blow you right off that roof.
I told you, I'm not going.
I'm staying here.
We've got to get him down here somehow.
Ann, see if you can coax him down here.
Jerry, Jerry please come down with us!
No.
Ann, they'll get you if you go out there.
Come down here, you fool!
Poor devil.
I hope he makes it.
We can't leave.
He's not responsible for himself.
We have to go now.
All right, Doctor.
Now hold it up.
Everybody ready?
I'm going to open that gate.
Ready.
Ready.
OK, here they come.
Hold on.
Hold on.
[SCREAMS]
Ann, what's the matter?
Your side's dragging.
You want to rest?
You tired?
[SPEAKING SWEDISH]
What'd you say?
She says she's all right.
She's keeping her eyes closed.
All right.
Keep your eyes closed.
They can't get at you through the slit.
This empty drum is too heavy for her.
I can barely hold up my side.
I'll be all right in a minute.
All right.
You walk.
I'll drag for a while.
Listen.
Don't let their head get under.
They'll flip us over.
[GUNSHOTS]
[SCREAMING]
[SCREAMS]
He got my foot!
Check your foot!
No, my foot is free but he got my boot.
Is there a scratch?
No.
Not a mark.
[GUNSHOT]
Keep moving.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Thorne, I don't think I...
What?
Sand!
We're at sand!
Sand, we're close!
We'll hit the water soon.
Doesn't sound like they're following us anymore.
We'd better walk deeper.
I'm about drowned out.
OK, let's swim for it.
OK.
[SPEAKING SWEDISH] We are safe, aren't we?
I mean, the storm.
Oh, sure.
She rode out the first half all right,
And that's always the roughest.
Anyway, riding an anchor out will give me a chance
To learn a little bit more about that Swedish accent.
In 24 hours, there'll be one shrew left on the island.
And he'll be dead of starvation.
An excellent example of overpopulation.
Well, you know something, Doctor?
What's that?
I'm not going to worry about overpopulation just yet.
TIME STOOD STILL
At 8,530 feet, on the Venerocolo glacier,
The construction of a dam is on the brink of completion.
During winter, the construction site is deserted.
There are only two men left.
They are the interpreters of this film.
Eat, you must eat, You have to!
Okay.
One, two, three and four.
I ate four of yours.
Stop showing off.
It's no fun playing with you.
Fortunately, Pedrazzini will be here tomorrow.
It'll be a better game.
- Is it still snowing ?
- Yes, heavily.
I won't come back until January 17th.
That's not possible.
I assure you it is.
This year we're lucky.
Look.
Thursday, it's Christmas,
Friday is a holiday too,
Saturday, we only work in the morning,
Sunday we don't work,
Thursday, New Year's Day,
Tuesday the 6th is Epiphany.
It's simple math.
It's the 22nd today,
We leave tomorrow, Tuesday the 23rd, the 24th, the 25th... the 26th, the 27th... the 31st... and the month of December is over.
After that comes January.
And the 2nd doesn't count.
So, the 3rd... the 4th, the 5th, the 6th, the 7th...
14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th.
It goes by fast.
Just about a month.
Just about.
About enough to get bored.
Not at all.
First, I'll spend a week in Gênes at my sister's place.
She lives near the port.
There are so many people around that you don't see time go by.
You should see all those ships!
They're marvelous!
Over there... they've got everything:
Shops, banquet halls,
- There're even cinematographs!
- Not possible.
I'm telling you.
And then, it's crowded.
Whites, blacks, there's all races!
And at night, it's so lit up you'd think it's day time.
That I can believe.
Marcello?
It's Venerocolo.
Hello, you're doing all right?
Not bad.
So?
Plus five, minus twelve.
Snowfall: 0.2
Snow on the ground: 3.4
Total: 5.2
Yes.
Wait, Salvetti wants to speak to you.
I'll put him on, goodbye.
Hello?
Marcello?
Yes, do you know if Pedrazzini is gone?
You don't know.
Tell me please, is the surveyor there?
Can you put him on?
Hello?
Mr. Surveyor?
Good morning, it's Salvetti.
I wanted to ask you if I could come down.
I want to go back home.
Around noon.
It's past 9:30, Pedrazzini must be boarding.
I may?
Thank you, best wishes.
It's fine, I'll be able to take the noon bus.
I'll get going then.
Bye, see you soon.
- Do you want anything?
- A pretty brunette!
I'll tell your wife!
Tell her if you like, she knows no woman will come up here.
Tell my son to study hard at school, because in one month I'm coming back down and I'll see his marks.
If he's been slacking off, his old man's going to give him a real lesson.
Tell my wife to buy him the boots.
He's been asking me for a month, to have her buy them.
- Okay.
- Watch your step so you don't fall in.
Don't worry, I know how to swim.
You swim in wine, but you'd drown in water.
Tell Pedrazzini to hurry up, or else the food will get cold.
Meet at 10:00.
Message for housewives.
And now, ladies...
Good evening.
I'm here to replace Pedrazzini.
My name is Roberto Seveso.
I just got here.
I spotted the hut thanks to the smoke.
Why isn't Pedrazzini here?
You're not up to date?
His wife gave birth.
This morning, she... it was so sudden, no one expected it, he was two months early.
And yet, there he was.
Pedrazzini was just about to leave when they called him.
It's a boy.
Thus, the surveyor called up the other guy... but Valentini had been chosen for the Olympic games and he has to train.
So, I told the surveyor that I could come.
I'm from the warehouse but I don't get a lot of work.
They don't have much use for me in the winter.
I put my luggage in the cable car.
Perhaps it's arrived.
You'd have to go check.
Where do I have to go?
- Come on, I'll go with you.
- Thanks.
The red one, it's my suitcase!
That one's mine, that one as well, that one no, that one yes.
It's slippery!
Where can I put my things?
On the other side.
Thank you.
Is this the dormitory for the construction site?
Yes.
- Is that one my bed?
- Yes.
There's a sock.
Oh, yes...
It belongs to Salvetti, the one who left.
Can I put it here?
Yes, I'll tidy up later.
Excuse me, would you happen to have a hammer?
It's there, in the drawer.
Thank you.
Ready-to-wear deluxe
My sister made it for me.
- Can I sit here?
- Yes.
- Bon appetit.
- Thanks, same to you.
It burns!
No, thank you.
I don't drink alcohol.
Does it have bacon in it?
- Yes.
- It's good.
It's the same soup as at home.
Do you know why I wanted to go up?
Because up here, I can do a little studying.
I have time at home as well, but there are too many temptations.
Right now, for example, because there are tourists, we go out dancing every night.
Or we watch television.
And since I have an economics exam in February,
I said to myself as I came up here,
I have practically one month to study and pass the exam.
I have to make sacrifices, but it's worth it.
But then again... if I really put myself into this, in ten, twelve years,
I can really go far.
If Pedrazzini's wife gets sick, or their son,
I could return after the holidays.
Well, I'm going to bed.
I'm tired.
I'm not used to walking so much.
Can I turn off the radio?
Goodnight.
The bathroom?
At the base of the dormitory.
- It's closed.
- That's normal.
The water froze.
So, what?
So...
you have to go outside.
Hello, this is Venerocolo.
Hello, Marcello.
What?
Pedrazzini?
Yes, I know.
He must be happy to have a boy.
And his wife also.
I imagine so.
Who?
He's still sleeping.
I have no idea, he must be sick.
He doesn't drink alcohol.
I know it's not an illness, but someone who doesn't drink, is just not right.
Anyway, tell Mr. Surveyor to send up less wine and more goat's milk.
Well then... minus twenty-four, plus six.
Yes, it's cold.
No precipitation.
The weather is serene and life is beautiful.
CONCENTRATED MILK
DANGER OF DEATH
Did you hear the avalanche?
Yes.
- Is there any risk?
- Of course not!
- Can I help you?
- No.
I know how to cook.
I think it's cooked.
Yes, it's been on for half an hour.
- Shall we start eating?
- Yes, start in.
Bon appetit.
Thank you.
Are there are ever avalanches here?
Of course not!
They're always in the same places.
That's it.
They're making a dam here.
They would have chosen a different place.
Of course.
Want to play checkers?
Why not.
Last year, in the residence hall,
I shared a room with someone obsessed with checkers.
We played every night.
He was too good.
White or black?
It's all the same to me.
I'll keep the whites.
They always bring me success.
Are you good?
I manage.
I go first.
No, you've got to eat.
One and two.
No, you really have to eat.
Two pieces.
Too late.
I've lost.
You play pretty good.
Shall we play another game?
It's almost 1:00, we can play tonight.
I have to go out to the dam.
Can I come?
If that doesn't bother you.
The only way down is on skis.
On skis?
Yes, we're going to the dam to check on the main bearing.
It's all empty on the inside!
- All the way to the end?
- Yes.
Is there a leak?
No, it's just that we're underneath the level of the lake.
- Can we go through there, as well?
- Yes.
- To go check on it?
- Yes.
- Do we have to check?
- If you want to.
Shall we?
Let's go.
On the inside, it seems so big.
Some echo!
And the water from the lake, where does it go out?
Upstream, it's a forced canal.
I can't see that.
It's in a tunnel in the rocks.
Why is it so big?
Because it's the peak of the dam.
- You've worked here?
- Yes.
- As what?
- Cable car attendant.
- Where are we going?
- To the main bearing.
Is it far?
- I'm not very good on skis.
- It's at the edge.
Put your body forward!
Bend down!
Forward!
You have to put your weight forward.
- What's that?
- A jack-rabbit.
A jack-rabbit?
We need a gun.
No, a bootlace is enough, a bit of wire, a bucket, and some carrots.
He comes to eat and pop!
There's one that hangs around the cafeteria shack.
Go, go, he's coming towards you!
Go, he's on your side, trap him!
You're nearly there!
The bulb is blown.
- Marcello?
- It doesn't work.
Our electricity's out.
Where's that?
Damn!
I heard that they came down today.
When are they coming?
Tomorrow morning?
Okay.
Don't worry about us, we'll manage for tonight.
- What happened?
- Nothing.
It's because of the avalanche.
Tomorrow, it'll be fixed.
- Damn it, the pump!
- What?
- It's windy!
- Yep.
As soon as the sun goes down, it gets cold.
You light the stove, I'll cut some wood.
They put the lights on at Pantano.
Yes, they've got electricity.
- Why is that?
- Their line is done.
But we still rely on the temporary line to the construction site.
It's not working.
That's normal.
The wind is going the other way.
It's useless.
The wind is blowing in the pipeline.
You have to be patient.
When it boils, put the cube in.
We'll have to make do with a broth.
I'm going to the warehouse to see if I can find a safety lamp.
Hello?
Yes, who is it?
You're from Pantano?
I'm listening.
Pedrazzini?
No, this is Seveso, I'm new.
He couldn't come because his wife just gave birth.
Who?
Noël?
Oh, the other guy!
He went looking for a lamp.
Yes, an avalanche cut the power.
What did you want to tell him?
No problem, thanks.
Thank you, goodbye.
The guys from Pantano called you.
They didn't know about Pedrazzini.
Is it a safety lamp?
It makes a lot of light.
How is the soup?
I put in the cube...
Your name is "Noël"?
The guys from Pantano told me.
Christmas is your day then.
Yes, all the better.
I get all the best from the other holidays.
It'll be better to bring the beds in here.
It's warmer in the kitchen.
It's going to be cold tonight.
Better add some wood.
Yes, indeed.
It's beautiful.
The "Heart".
- It's a beautiful book.
- Very beautiful.
I've read it.
It's very moving.
Yes, that's it.
It's full of beautiful things... that could never happen these days.
It's another world.
My dad always says that too.
But in the end, the world is always the same.
That's not true.
People's feelings have changed.
In the past, a man was a man.
He would have done anything to save his honor.
Today, we'd kill our parents for the price of a stamp.
Not everyone is like that.
I'm not saying that.
But in general, the world has changed.
I've got the proof: my own house.
I've got three children, two boys and one girl.
You can't imagine how smart they are.
At 12 years old,
I still believed that Jesus brought us presents.
I wasn't the only one.
Everyone my age believed it too.
When I discovered that it wasn't Jesus, believe me, it hurt me.
Today... before I came here, my oldest son asked me to buy him some boots.
He's fond of skiing and he has talent.
I answered that if he behaved himself, on Christmas day, the infant Jesus would bring him that present.
Here's his answer:
"What child?
"If you don't have any money, the child won't give you anything".
He's only 7.
No one can trick him.
We have to be careful what we say around the house.
Parents always hide things from their children.
He's there, he doesn't seem to be listening, but he hears everything.
He knows what we're going to say before we even say it.
When I was 20, I didn't know what the world was.
I first saw my wife, three months before I left for the army, but I didn't speak to her.
I spoke to her for the first time when I came back from the army.
While today, it's better not to speak of it.
I can see it very clearly, the summer, when there's tourists, the women are half-naked.
It's fashion.
What a fashion!
You know what my poor grandfather used to tell me?
That the meat displayed in the window... is never the highest quality.
The old do not make mistakes.
Damn!
The stove went out.
It's very cold.
That's normal.
It is a builder's hut, air comes in from everywhere
Better stay under the quilt!
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
I can't fall asleep.
You have to get used to this place.
What's that?
What is it?
We'd better go down to the church.
The air is coming in from all over and the fire went out.
Are we in danger?
No, but at the church there's less wind.
Damn!
I lost my pillow.
Where I fell, I think.
Give me a hand.
It's not bad, here.
When will they finish the caretaker's house?
It should have been finished last summer.
They began work, but when winter came, there was too much snow and they had to stop work.
This year, winter came one month early.
And this church?
It was constructed during the war.
The World War?
You see these chandeliers?
They are made out of the bullets from a '91.
The rifle of the Alpines.
Why is it shut off?
So it doesn't lose power.
We can hear less wind.
What happens if someone falls ill up here?
If someone gets sick.
He returns to his house.
And if he's too sick to leave?
In that case, the doctor comes up.
But with the storm, the cable car is closed.
I'm a little cold, now.
Noël?
Light the lamp, please.
I must have a fever.
That's just from the cold.
No, it's from the fever.
I know what it is.
Last year, I had the same symptoms.
I brought you a tablet and a big glass of milk.
Drink it while it's hot.
I want to go home.
Drink this milk, now.
It burns.
All the better, it will burn your stomach.
Tomorrow I'll call the surveyor Cattaneo and I'll tell him that I'm going home.
Will the cable car be working?
The wind has to let up.
- It already has.
- Yes, a bit.
It's strong.
Drink, drink, that will make you well.
Very good.
All that's left is to get under the quilt and perspire.
Is it hot enough?
Why did you turn it off?
It wasn't me, it ran out of power.
How's your fever?
It's all gone.
You were afraid!
Do you feel like going up?
I'll come back for the covers.
- Climb up on my back!
- No, that's okay.
Come on, go up, the snow is cold!
Was there brandy in the milk?
I smelled brandy.
That must have been the tablet.
Have you called Cattaneo?
When you call him, don't say anything about me.
That I was sick.
We have light!
All the better.

Go faster, will you?
I'm late for a party.
I hit her!
What?
!
There's no one here!
I was sure I'd hit someone...
Itsuko!
Stop watching the clock!
But it's awful Tamio's so late!
You'll regret marrying him.
Reporters are busy people.
So they all say!
Anyway, should we start?
All right.
Gather round!
We're going to cut Itsuko's birthday cake.
Shouldn't we wait for Tamio?
But father, we don't know when he'll get here.
That's true.
As punishment, we won't leave any for him!
Happy birthday!
Thank you.
Now, if you'd do the honors... where are the bandages?
Wada, bring a bandage.
Yes, miss.
Does it hurt?
No, I'm fine.
Your wife had cut her finger, too, when she disappeared.
Yes...a question of blood, perhaps...
Sorry I'm late.
You'll never guess what happened!
You always say that!
But it won't work tonight!
No, it's true!
My car hit a woman, who vanished.
Then I saw her again outside this house, in the garden!
Really?
!
Has anyone been here?
No, no one.
Sorry to mention it on your birthday, but that's why I'm late.
That's so strange!
But if that's your reason, I'll forgive you.
Itsuko, I'm disappointed in you!
Happy birthday.
Thank you!
Especially coming from you.
What's wrong with your finger?
I hurt it cutting the cake.
Is it okay?
Hey, hey, hey!
Whatever can that be?
I hate power failures!
Cleaning up is all the harder.
That's why I hate parties.
Some candles for the living room... that's the closed-up room on the second floor!
But that room hasn't been opened in 20 years!
Miwako!
It's you!
Miwako!
Where's your father?
Hmm...
Miwako, what happened to you?
!
Don't you know me?
It's me Shigekatsu!
Miwako!
This is uncanny...my wife Miwako, who vanished 20 years ago... but she looks so young unchanged in 20 years... she'd be 40 now, but still it's her.
This is eerie...perhaps I'm dreaming.
No.
This is no dream.
This must be the curse on those of Amakusa blood... she's done nothing but sleep like that.
Is such a thing possible?
Her heartbeat and vital signs are fine.
But the amazing thing is that her organs, skin and musculature are those of someone 20 years old.
Are you sure this is your wife, Mr. Matsumura?
Yes.
It couldn't be anyone else.
This is something beyond modern medical science.
They say that shock or great fear can delay natural processes... up to a point.
But medical science has never proved that.
I'll be going.
Thank you.
This is an intriguing case.
I'll come and see her again.
Let me know if there's any change.
We will.
My best to your mother.
Wait, Tamio!
Are you going to write about this for your paper?
No.
But a woman reappearing unchanged after 20 years is big news.
Please don't.
Dr. Sakakibara said this is medically impossible!
It'll be an embarrassment...
like a deformity or a disease!
I can't see how it'd hurt your family.
Please!
Promise me you won't.
You win.
A fine reporter I am!
Anyway, don't worry about it.
She'll be fine in a few days.
I'm sorry my party caused you all this trouble.
Forget it.
Let's go see the art competition display in Ueno.
Someone nobody's ever heard of won the Jury Prize.
All right.
It's just like her!
Who?
My mother!
Yes!
It's the exact image of her!
The eyes, the mouth...
as if she were the model!
Wait here... who did the Jury Prize picture?
Sorry...
I'm a reporter.
The picture's signed "Shiro Sofue".
But when they awarded the prize, people said there was no such person.
Then why did the competition accept the painting?
That I wouldn't know.
Miss... you seem to be taken with this picture.
Yes...somehow it reminds me of my mother.
Your mother?
I see... sorry.
I thought I'd ask who the model is, but no luck.
Who was that?
I don't know.
Oh?
Thank you.
Give everyone my regards.
Goodbye.
Matsumura
here you are.
"Unknown artist wins Jury Prize"
"The mystery masterpiece"!
Did everything go well?
And no one saw you?
Tiny!
Close the curtain!
Move!
The other side!
Quick!
The moon!
Are you all right, sir?
I'll open a window.
Yeah, it's me.
A murder?
Where?
We'll be right there.
Oki!
A murder!
Where?
Get going.
Fujii!
Right!
Any suspects?
We're looking.
What was the weapon?
Look, I'm busy...
You're the hotel manager?
Who's the girl?
How old was she?
What time was it?
Did she scream?
Hey!
Horrific scratch marks!
Woman employee murdered!
Mystery killing of hotel waitress!
Tanigawa speaking.
What?
Stolen?
Okay, I'll switch you to arts.
A story?
What is it?
Another murder?
Hell, no!
You know that prize-winning painting in Ueno?
Last night someone stole it.
That painting?
!
Look at you!
What's so special about that picture?
Uh, nothing...
What, your reporter's sixth sense again?
We've got a murder to work on.
I passed them on to arts.
What's all this about?
You didn't see who brought it?
Someone just left it inside the front gate.
It's strange no one saw anybody open the gate, though.
Look!
It seems to have been sent to you, father.
Do you know a Shiro Sofue?
Shiro Sofue?
Never heard of him.
Well, let's open it up.
Yes, sir.
Someone's at the door.
I'll get it.
Hello!
You've come at just the right time!
Hello.
How's Mrs. Matsumura?
She's still unconscious.
What does the doctor say?
He doesn't understand it.
I'm delighted she's come back, but I wish she'd wake up.
I see... that's... what's this doing here?
Someone sent it to me.
I've no idea who.
This is the stolen masterpiece!
Stolen?
It vanished from the art museum last night!
And it's... yes, father!
It's the picture I told you about...
the one that looks just like mother!
I'm scared!
Forgive me!
Miwako!
What's wrong?
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
You're awake!
It's me!
It's me, Shigekatsu!
Miwako!
Do you recognize me?
Who...?
Who are you?
Shigekatsu!
You're awake!
That's wonderful!
Miwako, this is our daughter, Itsuko.
Miwako, this is our daughter, Itsuko.
Look at how she's grown up in the 20 years you've been gone!
Tamio.
This is Mr. Oki, Itsuko's fiancé.
Tamio, I want to tell you something.
You too, Itsuko.
I haven't spoken of this before, but it's time I told you the story of the Matsumura family.
You've heard of Shiro Amakusa?
Of the Shimabara Uprising?
He led the Christians Iemitsu Tokugawa slaughtered at Shimabara in the 17th century.
Yes.
He and his followers were killed but the Matsumuras are his descendants.
I married Miwako and took her name but the blood of Shiro Amakusa flows in her veins.
Twenty years ago we thought we'd visit her ancestors' grave so we went down south, to Shimabara, in Kyushu.
Honey!
It's ready!
It's time to eat?
Miwako?
Miwako!
Miwako!
I looked and looked but Miwako never returned.
I was wandering along, as if drawn by some invisible force.
That's a wonderful painting... you've finally come.
I've waited.
Waited?
Yes.
With the scent of this flower I have drawn you to me.
It smells so nice...
I love you.
Accept my love, and you will live forever in unfailing, eternal youth.
My blood, unaged in centuries, will flow in your veins.
Be glad, Miwako.
Now you will become the true princess of my heart Princess of Kisaragi Castle.
I loved Princess Katsu, daughter of Shiro Amakusa with all my heart.
More than Deus, god of the Christians and more than St. Mary herself, I loved Princess Katsu.
But the armies of the shogun came for her as well bringing with them the time of resolve.
Your highness!
The time has come.
The moon is rising.
It joins my doom with that of Kisaragi Castle.
How hateful is the moon, how unkind...
Takenaka...honor me with your sword.
I will.
Out of love for the Princess, I drank of her blood.
But having drunk her life-blood, I cannot die, though die I would.
I must live forever seeking the blood of maidens, the blood of my Princess.
No!
I can't paint you!
There's hatred in your eyes!
Hatred for me!
Do you not accept my love?
Miwako...smile!
For me!
For the painting!
Smile!
Would you betray me?
!
Look!
Betray my love and you will bear that gold cross and stand among the statues of my display!
For years I waited for my chance.
And then one day I finally managed to escape.
Once out of the cave I ran, in a daze.
I have no memory of how I managed to get here.
The first thing I remember was a bright, bright moon shining like it is tonight.
Then I felt safe, and forgot everything.
He won't come when the moon's out.
He's terribly afraid of moonlight.
Moonlight?
Why?
What's wrong, Miwako?
Are you tired?
Mother?
Mother!
Police department
Mr. Matsumura?
This way, please.
Hey, who's that guy?
Mr. Matsumura?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
We're very busy with this... how can I help you?
Someone I've never heard of sent me something.
Sent you what?
A stolen picture.
That picture?
!
Kanto hotel homicide investigation unit
excuse me... will I have to wait much longer?
No.
You're the next witness on the list.
I've been here quite a while.
Could I come back tomorrow?
I have an important engagement this evening.
It won't be much longer.
Mr. Takenaka...you're in room 516, aren't you?
Yes, as I've said before.
The murder in the hotel last night took place in the hall outside of your room.
Your evidence will be very important in this case.
We're told the murder took place about 8 p.m.
Where were you then?
The moon!
Good evening.
What are you doing up there?
!
Get down!
You'll hurt someone!
The moon!
That dreadful moonlight!
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
Six women slashed in Ginza horror!
Monster wreaks havoc, kills six!
Madman or monster?
Ah, Miwako...
I'm feeling a little better today.
Another two or three days and you'll be fine.
What's wrong?
!
Mother!
That picture!
What about it?
I'm going to die!
The gold cross is coming for me!
The gold cross?
Who put that cross there?
!
Wada!
Where are you?
!
Yes, sir?
Who put that thing there?
!
I know who!
The master of the cave is coming for me!
Don't worry, Miwako.
You'll be safe here with me.
Perhaps you should rest... come on, mother... mother!
Wada, I asked the police to come and get this painting yesterday.
The sooner it's gone the better.
Call them again.
Someone's at the door.
Maybe it's Tamio.
Isn't that strange!
I'm sure I heard the buzzer.
Did you hear it?
Yes.
That's why I came to the door.
Isn't that strange!
Oh, dear!
Wada!
Wada!
Father... could I see you a moment?
Oh...
I'll be right back.
Don't leave me!
It's all right.
I won't be long.
Miwako why did you flee?
I've come all this way for you... why don't you answer?
Come back to the cave with me...
No!
I won't!
Miwako!
Just saying how strange it is won't accomplish anything.
Search the entire house.
And put this away somewhere.
Who are you?
!
Father!
Call the police!
Miwako's in danger!
Sir!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
It's me.
The Matsumuras'?
!
Right!
Let's go!
Itsuko!
Is your mother still missing?
Yes.
They haven't found her.
What should we do, Tamio?
!
Chief...
Here!
That weird signature's the same!
It is?
He's the killer!
He must be!
That room's empty right now, sir.
Empty?
!
A Mr. Nobutaka Takenaka, from Kyushu.
Was this the first time he'd stayed here?
Yes.
He was here ten days.
He checked out this morning?
Yes, sir.
It's him!
He must have gone back to Shimabara!
Let's go after him!
Where are you going?
Nagoya.
License, please.
Sorry to bother you.
Shimabara, Kyushu
So this Takenaka's come down here to Kyushu?
Is that his real name?
A criminal wouldn't just sign in at a hotel.
I thought so, too but this signature's our proof.
It matches the one on the painting that was slashed.
I see...
This is just like a suspense novel!
It's more than suspense.
It's right out of this world!
It'd sure make a great story!
Hello?
Yeah, it's me.
What?
They caught him?
Where?
Okay.
What?
The money's gone?
Yeah...yeah...
Thanks.
They got him?
What an idiot!
He says he went to bury the 3 million yen in the mountains and he saw this castle with monsters in it!
So he dropped the money and ran straight to the police!
A likely story!
He hid it somewhere.
What's this about castles and monsters?
There was a 3 million yen robbery not long ago.
That's what the guy they caught says.
That just might be it!
The place I'm looking for!
Can you lend me a car?
Just thinking about it gives me the shakes!
Enough of this nonsense!
It doesn't make sense!
Monsters, in this day and age!
But it's true, officer.
From a great big bald one to a tiny one.
I saw them!
It's true!
We're wasting our time here.
Let's go have a look.
This is the way, isn't it?
Uh, yeah...
I think this is right...
I was kind of in a fog.
It's true, officer!
All right, keep going.
Mr. Oki are you sure that fool isn't taking us for a ride?
Well, let's stick to our guns.
It's legwork that makes stories, I guess...
Itsuko!
Tamio!
Are you okay?
Yes.
Why don't you wait down below?
No.
We've got to help mother!
You're all right?
That's strange...where did they go?
Look out!
You stay here!
Hey!
Pull back!
Hello.
Tamio!
Tamio!
Itsuko!
Itsuko!
Itsuko!
What do you want?
!
No!
Where's my mother?
!
Give her back!
I'll give you what I gave her.
Wouldn't you like to live, eternally young, forever?
Look at me.
I have lived for centuries.
And now I will baptize you so you may do the same.
Milord beware the mother and child who would be faithless in their turn.
Bear in mind the laws of the great god of the Amakusa family.
Silence!
Milord may so bid me but should we violate his laws the wrath of god will fall upon this Kisaragi Castle.
Enough!
I want the blood of this girl!
She has Amakusa blood!
What?
!
Milord!
This will bring down the wrath of god!
It will be the end of Kisaragi Castle!
What?
!
Itsuko!
Tamio!
No one defiles this underground castle and lives!
Know the wrath of the Amakusa curse!
Itsuko!
Run!
Itsuko!
Hurry!
There it is!
There's a cave between those rocks.
You're sure?
Right!
This way!
What did I tell you?
Proceed with caution!
Why do you hate the Matsumura family?
!
I bear them no hate.
I loved Miwako.
In her runs the blood of Shiro Amakusa.
I love her just as centuries ago I loved the Princess Katsu.
Fool!
No one lives for centuries!
I have.
You see before you a body that will never die!
Liar!
Fraud!
A fraud, am I?
Stay back!
I do not die.
With Amakusa blood, I live forever!
The money!
3 million yen!
It was around here... here it is!
Here it is!
Miwako, my Princess!
The time has come for this cursed Amakusa blood to meet its end.
Watch now as immortality makes its last stand.
Tamio!
Itsuko!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
I should have got a picture!
Nobody'd believe it anyway...
just like we didn't believe that thief.
But we saw it with our own eyes!
Tamio... mother's in there...
She'll be happier there... this is the land of her ancestors.
Be brave.
The curse is lifted at last.

PART 3
- All's in order, sir!
- Good.
Attention!
- All's in order, sir!
- Good.
Salute!
At ease.
JANUARY 23RD - 20:00 HOURS 32° BELOW ZERO
Here he comes.
You recruits are feigning sleep, eh?
You can't rest until I've made my rounds.
All seems to be in order.
Recruits, fall in!
Turn on the light.
Legs apart and grit your teeth.
Idiots!
- Did that hurt?
- No, sir!
Good.
I'll teach you dogs a lesson!
Fools!
You know what that was for?
What about you?
- I dunno.
- What?
I don't know, sir!
You don't?
Well, I'll show you.
It was for this.
Since when do you use the water tank as an ashtray?
Speak up!
The duty officer specifically ordered that those tanks be kept clean and sanitary.
We received the order.
Who was on duty today?
Step forward!
Remove your glasses.
Get up!
Obara refilled the tanks before the evening mess.
I removed the ashtrays after "lights out."
You're implying that one of your superiors smoked after "lights out"?
Kaji, are you trying to pin blame on a senior serviceman?
No.
I only said that Obara showed no neglect.
Watch your language!
Recruit Obara admits his neglect.
Of course.
Why didn't you say so?
- I'm very sorry.
- You should be.
- I'll be more careful.
- It's too late for that!
Owaku, where are you going?
To change the water.
You don't have to do that.
Kaji, you dare talk back to PFC Bannai?
I didn't talk back.
The platoon leader demands discipline!
Who taught you to be insubordinate?
Your friend Shinjo over there?
Logic won't get you anywhere in this army.
Don't try acting big around here just because you went to college.
Any arguments?
PFC Bannai, leave this to me.
Very well.
You, report to me later!
Can't you even see the target?
I can.
Then your heart isn't in it.
Take careful aim.
Imagine it's the enemy out there.
Come on, Obara.
Hit it, please!
Draw a bead carefully onto the target at the bottom of the bull's-eye.
Hold your breath!
Apply pressure on the trigger and squeeze gently.
You idiot!
No luck.
We'll never get to lunch at this rate.
And always because of him!
- It can't be helped.
- Shut up, you yokel.
That's no excuse.
What's going on over there?
Stop acting like starved mongrels.
Kaji!
Show Obara how to do it.
Yes, sir!
Unstack arms.
Show him you can hit the target with eyes closed.
- With eyes closed?
- That's right.
With proper posture, you should at least hit the target.
Objective: the target!
Position: prone!
Obara, watch how he holds it and squeezes the trigger.
You see, Obara?
Bad eyesight is no excuse.
Try again.
Obara, try to relax.
Don't jerk the trigger.
Squeeze down on it.
Squeeze it slowly.
Slowly now...
You'd be better off dead!
You're a disgrace to the whole Kwangtung Army!
Obara, listen carefully.
A sense of responsibility is a soldier's life.
A grenade could wipe out your squad because of your missed shot.
Show some responsibility and some shame!
To the target on the double!
Kaji, you go with him.
Bayonet attack!
Charge!
Down!
Obara, stop crying!
Forward!
"At the time, Kaji was trying to save the lives of innocent Chinese.
This earned him the hatred of the Kenpeitai.
They arrested him and grilled him mercilessly.
If my husband had indeed been guilty, they would not have released him after just 20 days.
I fervently hope that this unfortunate incident... will not compromise his position as a member of your unit.
As the wife of a recruit, I address this appeal to you.
The life of a recruit under suspicion would be a living hell with no salvation."
Orderly!
Where's the orderly?
Entering, sir!
Your orderly, sir!
Call Warrant Officer Hino.
Salute the warrant officer!
Present arms!
Eyes front!
PFC Yamazaki now relieved of guard duty, sir.
Good.
Thank you for your work!
Knock it off!
See to your own duties.
Thank you.
We're very grateful.
Anything you need washed?
That's all right.
You're a hard worker, Kaji.
I hated laundry duty even more than beatings.
One might hate it, but there's no avoiding it.
You won't be a private forever like me.
You're tops among the recruits.
But don't forget:
You're under suspicion.
I know.
They can't afford to have a Red leading the pack.
They're hoping you'll make a misstep.
You and I can't even talk without being watched.
Anything suspicious about Kaji's actions?
Have you received reports to that effect?
I asked if you had.
None, sir, though I have him under surveillance.
What are Sergeant Hashitani's thoughts?
He's giving Kaji special sniper training now, sir.
- He's a good marksman?
- An unerring eye, sir.
- And his barracks discipline?
- Excellent, sir.
How is he with Shinjo?
They seem close, but...
Seem?
You don't know?
They're both blacklisted by the Kenpeitai.
They have no time now to do any plotting.
Why's that?
I've kept Shinjo on constant supply transport and guard duty.
Keep an eye on them.
They'll soon show their true colours.
If they straighten up, they could be our best soldiers.
Attention!
At ease.
Listen as you are.
Afternoon training is cancelled.
There'll be an arms inspection.
The tiniest speck of dust will not be tolerated.
After dark there'll be sentry training, followed by attack training at dawn.
What do you think?
Like the full schedule?
Owaku, you have a letter.
Kaji.
Obara.
- Corporal Shibata.
- Salute!
Arms inspection again?
From your wife?
Read it out loud.
No, I save it till I can't bear it any longer.
Oh, well.
You must have a good wife.
I wonder what that Wench of mine is up to.
Hey, Obara.
Think things will get better after basic?
It won't be this rough much longer.
I'm getting fed up.
Don't let little things get you down.
Little things, eh?
Bad news from home bothering you?
My mother and wife are fighting as usual.
My wife's threatening to leave home.
Doesn't mean she's leaving you.
You wouldn't understand.
You've had all the breaks.
It would leave my aging mother all alone.
Back one and drop the other.
To back 'em both is asking for trouble.
That's the wrong one.
Take it out.
You broke it.
You weren't paying attention.
You fool!
That was mine!
What are you gonna do about it?
I'm not apologising to the army for you.
That won't fix your rifle, Kubo.
Forgive him.
- No, I won't!
- Then don't.
You stay out of this.
Everybody here knows you're a Red.
And so?
I'm just saying no one loves a Red.
Hit me.
Hit me all you want.
Attention!
Eyes right!
Front!
- All right, they're ready.
- Thank you!
Start distributing.
- Is there a Private Shinjo here?
- Yes, one.
Private Shinjo will take two recruits and clean out the latrines.
Good luck.
On whose orders?
Sergeant Soga's.
He sets up the roster for latrine duty too?
Stop moaning, Shinjo.
Is a three-year man too good to clean latrines?
Tell the NCO on duty or Warrant Officer Hino that I'll do it alone.
I don't need help from any recruits.
Shinjo... better take somebody along.
It ain't easy carting' all that shit alone.
Will none of you recruits go with him?
Kaji, why don't you go?
You're a Red shit, just like him.
Kubo, come with us.
I don't take orders from you.
That's it, fight it out.
The liquor will be here soon.
Come on, one more!
Get moving.
Recruit Kaji to latrine duty!
Recruit Tanoue to latrine duty!
That's the spirit!
They're giving you and me all the dirty work.
Standing duty the other night,
I suddenly realised how haggard you looked.
You've been on constant duty.
You have stamina, Kaji.
I've about had it.
They're just waiting for me to cave in under the pressure.
Salute!
- All is in order.
- Good.
A huddle in the latrine?
A truly stinking discussion.
Sir... does the company commander approve all duty assignments?
I wouldn't know.
Ask WO Hino.
I'll do that.
One more question.
What happens if a soldier refuses an assignment?
When such assignment is unfair, of course.
I suggest you check the Army Penal Code.
Aren't you asking for trouble?
I don't care about going home, but I do want to get out of here.
What do you mean?
I'm not even sure myself.
To go to some unknown place and get a fresh start.
Someplace where no one knows me.
Is there such a place?
Escaping from here only means immediate recapture.
There's only one other possibility.
Is the border close?
Not far.
But it's all marshland up to the lake.
Get bogged down there and you're finished.
Which would you choose?
The land where people are promised freedom... or the land where your loving wife awaits you?
I promised my wife we'd start a new life together.
You really believe you'll get back alive?
I don't know... but I hope so.
A rare Sunday leave
Walking down the boulevard
With her hairdo of a married woman she led me up the stairs
To a tiny little room
"You're a Wisteria dangling above
And I'm a lily below"
Just five minutes
To get back to barracks
"Come on, let me go! "
No time to take a train
No money for a cab
With my legs strong from daily drills
I'll make a run for it
PFC Yoshida!
There's to be a transfer.
A transfer?
They can't toss us out of here after four years' service.
They've already decided who it is.
Who?
Kaji, got a copy of the Penal Code?
Don't let them get to you.
What's the Penal Code for, Shinjo?
What did you tell him just now?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
A senior serviceman addressed you and you didn't reply?
Sir, have I done something wrong?
That's better.
What did you say?
Use your head.
We're celebrating today.
A beating could hurt.
I mentioned that he seemed tired and shouldn't be reading.
Hear that?
Telling a three-year man what to do.
So the old veteran Shinjo is tired, eh?
Hey, Shinjo!
Sorry to fatigue you even more, but may I trouble you with a question?
It seems he didn't hear you.
I'll clean out his ears!
A fight means trouble for us both, Yoshida.
I was reading the Penal Code at Sergeant Soga's suggestion to learn how to refuse an order without being insubordinate.
Attention!
Attention!
Salute!
At ease.
What happened?
It's Private Shinjo, sir.
He was taken suddenly ill.
I put him to bed.
Does a feverish man account for broken bowls?
Pick up these pieces.
Salute!
Cherry tree the colour of my lapel
Your blossoms are scattered all over Mount Yoshino
If you're born a man in old Yamato
You must fall like a blossom at the battle front
It's ridiculous for a lady to come out here.
There's no place for you to stay.
What will you do?
I only wanted to see him.
I had no other concern.
The next train out is tomorrow afternoon.
Will you sleep outdoors?
Or spend the night walking home?
If you'll only let me see him, I'm willing to walk back.
Recruit Tanoue leaving to polish his boots!
Is Kaji here?
Report to the office.
You have a visitor.
- A visitor?
- Who is it?
A woman, no less!
Son of a bitch!
Better hurry up, Kaji, or someone might swipe her.
Don't be bashful.
Better hurry up.
I'll finish up for you.
Recruit Kaji reporting to the office!
Make sure you come back.
Damn!
Coming all the way out hereto get laid!
Permission to enter, sir!
- Yes?
- Entering, sir!
Recruit Kaji reporting!
You wanted something?
What did you want?
Recruit Kaji, leaving!
Hold it there.
You're a disgrace to military discipline.
Don't let your wife make you homesick.
You're hereby authorised to spend the night with your wife within the confines of the company storeroom.
I finally had to come.
It's so far.
How did you make it?
I've changed, haven't I?
It must be rough.
I'm used to it now.
But winter makes things tougher.
We went hunting today.
I'll bring some of the meat later.
You haven't lost any weight.
I'm relieved.
You've come all this way, and there's so little I can offer you.
I'm just a recruit.
Look at me.
I am.
You mustn't worry.
I'll come through it all right.
How much time did they give us?
Until morning.
Even less than when they shipped me off.
So... it's all right then?
Entering!
Recruit Sasa with our squad leader's meal!
Ma'am...
Kaji bagged this game for us today.
Eat heartily and enjoy yourselves.
Thanks.
My husband is much indebted to you.
We recruits are all in the same boat.
The army's one helluva place.
But Kaji's a lucky devil.
No other woman would come way out hereto see her man.
That's the truth.
There's so little time.
I hope it's not too much... but would you write my wife and tell her to do like you and come out to see me?
All she does is eat and sleep.
She cares about nothing else.
Tell her that things are rough out here and to bring lots of gifts for the senior servicemen.
Ride her good!
Recruit Sasa leaving!
Come on.
Let's eat.
A rookie allowed to monkey around with his wife!
The army sheds bitter tears!
Kaji, you're a sneaky one, keeping all the good things for yourself.
I request this favour.
He wants blankets.
Your wife should keep you warm.
Aren't your own blankets enough?
They are.
I'll make do.
Rolling around on a narrow futon.
Curse the blasted luck!
As long as we're alive, we'll be able to meet again.
I came here confident that I'd get to see you.
Even after you left, that Sergeant Watai kept coming by.
Wanted me to let him read your letters.
Nasty man!
Maybe he thinks you're planning to desert.
What would you do if I did?
Where would you go?
Across the border.
There's a man in my squad named Shinjo.
After three years, he's still a private.
His brother was arrested for communist leanings.
Even his girlfriend sold him out.
He claims there's a better world beyond that border.
A better world?
Where they treat people like human beings.
And you intend to escape there all by yourself?
You can't run away!
Not while you still have me!
The warrant officer said you were a top soldier, but you're still under suspicion, aren't you?
I won't go.
I won't run away.
I'll carry on here.
Please don't run away.
Come back to me.
All is in order!
You are relieved.
Assuming duty.
Forward... march!
Break step!
Don't forget your promise to come back alive.
I won't forget.
Aren't you sleepy?
Not a bit.
There wasn't anything else you wished to say?
No.
Even if there were, I couldn't express it in words.
I'm always thinking:
"I must tell you about this, mustn't forget to tell you that."
Me too.
Thanks for coming to see me.
It's only natural.
Thank you for such a wonderful night.
Don't thank me.
There's so little I can do.
Let's hope we never spend such a wretched yet beautiful night again.
Maybe it's because... you're headed for the front.
Why do you say that?
I just have this strange feeling.
Maybe that's why they let me see you.
No, you must come back to me!
You have to!
Will you grant me one last favour?
Anything.
Just ask.
I came here for your sake.
I realise it's cold... but I'd like you to undress and stand over by that window.
I must see you... all of you.
I want to burn that image into my mind.
I have nothing to offer you!
Nothing!
Please take me!
Reveille!
What's wrong, Kaji?
All worn out?
Bastard!
Come on, Kaji.
I'll give you a workout.
I'm not as easy to poke as your wife.
Come on!
I'm ready!
Enough!
Well done, Kaji.
PFC Yoshida... you let this recruit push you around?
Let's have another round like that.
I'm ready!
Don't retreat, Kaji.
Retreat is no way to victory.
I'm right here.
Come at me!
What is it?
I can't see you off.
We're leaving on manoeuvres.
Be careful on your way back.
Time to part once again.
Thank you for coming.
Hurry and go.
I can't bear it.
Let's not say "goodbye", all right?
A soldier's will before departing should convey his resolution to his family and inspire them to carry on in a fitting way.
What does a departing soldier's resolution imply?
Speak up.
It means to lay down one's life for one's country.
You parrot back the right answer, but what did you write in your letter?
"Driving you crazy", eh?
"So worried that I could never face death" - was that it?
Coward!
I've never seen a worse soldier in ten years of service!
Obara admits his fault, sir.
That's not the answer your commander seeks!
Such effeminate ideas are more harmful than Red propaganda.
Even a Red will fight bravely when the time comes, but your kind surrenders before fighting.
WO Hino... see that he writes to his wife again.
Let him reaffirm his resolution.
"Tomie... your thinking is completely mistaken.
It's the duty of a Japanese wife to look after her mother-in-law in her husband's absence.
Please consider how your endless complaining interferes with the performance of my duties.
I'm very busy here.
Your bickering with my mother hinders me in my training.
It's my wish that you look after my mother, but if you feel this to be impossible,
I must ask you to leave my house."
Buck up, Obara!
We're only halfway there!
Come on!
Regulate your breathing!
This march ends your basic training.
Don't disgrace the whole squad!
Obara, don't give up!
Come on!
Keep going!
Somebody help him with his pack.
What kind of buddies are you?
Very well!
I'll help him.
You gonna let that happen?
Can you hold your heads up if I do?
Lance Corporal, sir!
- I'll help him.
- Good!
Compassion for a mate.
But if he still drops out, leave him.
A cart will pick him up.
Give me your blanket, pick, shovel, and tent.
You can handle the rest, right?
Sorry, Kaji.
Forgive me.
Hurry up!
Let me rest a while.
Your pack is 20 pounds lighter.
You don't need a rest!
You go on ahead.
I don't want you dropping out on my account.
Shut up and walk!
Stop now and all you've suffered will have been in vain.
We're almost done with basic.
Show some guts for once!
Obara. get up!
Get up, Obara!
It's no use.
Leave me behind.
I can't go on.
You'd let my help be for nothing?
Think what the senior soldiers will do to you, you fool!
It's no use.
Then to hell with you!
Be a shirker!
I'm going on!
Hate me all you want.
You stopped before the fight was over.
But I won't stop!
You hear?
I'm going!
A bit fatigued, honourable recruits?
Bastard!
- Back a bit early, aren't you?
- Get up!
We've been waiting for you wretched dogs!
All you think about is food!
Stand up!
Stupid dog!
Pull yourself together!
Give 'em a shower!
Worthless scum!
Anyone who rides back on a cart isn't a man!
Don't you dogs have any balls?
If not, we can find a use for you.
Right, Obara?
Keep those fingers straight!
Get behind the gun rack and call out for customers.
"Hey, handsome, come on inside."
Go on.
Move it!
Show us how it's done.
The honourable Shosuke Obara, what made the man go broke
He loved his morning baths, morning chasers and morning lays
It finally wore the poor man out
Get on with it.
Hey, mister, come in and have some fun.
Absolutely no sex appeal!
Hey, handsome, come on inside.
That's it.
Now beckon with your hands.
Say, handsome, come inside.
- Any takers for the lady?
- That's one I'd rather not mount.
Here's a customer.
Come on, keep it up!
Come on inside, handsome.
Want me to come in?
I haven't gotten any in a long time.
No objections to me buying this one?
We appreciate the business!
You stinking' shit!
You dog!
In the infantry, we don't ride home like a bunch of whores!
We walk!
You got that?
You should be grateful.
We never had it this easy!
You scum!
Worthless shit!
Why don't you go kill yourself?
Just returning the book I borrowed.
Get up!
Mind if I go to the latrine?
Don't be a fool!
You're on duty.
You're dead if they catch you.
Say I'm patrolling outside.
Do whatever you want.
We all have to die... sometime.
Is that a sign that I shouldn't?
Yes!
After all, one can die at any time.
Does that give you something to think about?
On your feet!
Attention!
Your morals are putrid!
You're like a bunch of stinking women!
This shirker who committed suicide... wasn't the only one at fault here.
It proves you're all rotten.
When did I ever train you to be like that?
What about it?
If you feel I didn't train you right, speak up!
All right.
Dismissed.
Do we stand guard over the corpse?
He's dead now.
He was a human being, after all.
That dog Obara jinxed us to the very end!
Say that again!
What's wrong?
Why so worked up?
Will you back me?
Don't do it.
They're all on edge over Obara's suicide.
- You should have done it yesterday.
- Then why did you stop me?
Would you have stood a chance if you'd intervened?
I won't involve you, but I'll see this through.
Sir, I demand that PFC Yoshida be punished.
Demand?
That's no way to address your superiors.
Are you aware of the personal punishment he inflicted upon Obara yesterday?
I am not.
Not even a private 1st class is authorised to inflict such personal punishment upon a recruit.
But yesterday...
Hold it there!
Only dogs inform on others.
I'm not informing.
I'm demanding punishment.
Suicide is contrary to military discipline.
No matter the reason, there's no excuse.
Was Yoshida's action in accord with military discipline?
Forcing a helpless recruit to mimic a common harlot?
Silence!
You dog!
Regardless of what Yoshida did, this is all pure speculation on your part.
I don't claim it was the only reason... but it was the final humiliating blow.
Listen carefully.
A false step now could ruin your whole life.
I'm not concerned about myself.
What do you intend to do?
If you fail to adopt appropriate measures, I shall...
Spit it out!
It may be unwise, but there's no other way.
I'll be forced to take action myself.
You plan to make trouble, eh?
A personal feud could mean a stiff term in the guard house.
I won't be there alone.
Sir... please convey to PFC Yoshida that he'd better watch out for Kaji.
So you're implying that I indirectly caused my husband's death?
I can't honestly say otherwise.
I understand.
If only I hadn't written that letter.
It sounds cruel, but it's true.
I'm in a similar position.
I let him drop out during our march.
To help him walk would have meant dropping out myself.
If only I had left with him...
The army recognises no such reason for shirking one's duty.
When one drops out, what happens to him?
Please ask the warrant officer.
Shirkers are the dredges of the military, a disgrace to their company.
Then my husband's suicide has doubled his shame?
I had hoped you'd understand.
Are there special ways of handling men who drop out?
No, nothing specific.
However, their promotions are delayed.
I just can't believe it!
My husband wasn't the type to do such a thing.
There must have been some reason.
Won't you tell me the truth?
A demoralised home front is the main reason.
Good soldiers only come from wholesome families.
I wouldn't probe too deeply.
Please try to see it like this.
A part of Obara died due to your feuding with your mother-in-law.
Another part died when I deserted him.
What was left...
That's enough!
You're dismissed.
Recruit Kaji leaving!
Is it true you're contemplating revenge on a superior out of personal enmity?
Answer me!
I have not breached military discipline, but PFC Yoshida has.
It's unfair to question me first.
You scum!
Is that any way to address the commander?
It's all right.
Let him speak.
Go ahead.
He inflicted unauthorised personal punishment of a vile nature after Obara dropped out from sheer fatigue.
I only ask why this goes unpunished.
- You were given an A in marching?
- Yes, sir.
- How were you treated that day?
- Very well, sir.
- Did Yoshida harass you?
- No, sir.
Would he have if you had dropped out?
I believe so, sir.
- Was Obara the only man punished?
- There were three men, sir.
- All by Yoshida?
- No, by others too.
Did all three commit suicide?
No, sir.
- Just Obara?
- Yes, sir.
Then why do you single out Yoshida?
Because Obara killed himself.
But I'm ready to press charges against the others too.
Silence!
It's clear you're out to get Yoshida and cause disorder in the unit.
Obara's death is merely an excuse.
By blaming a superior for a weak soldier's suicide, you undermine our finest military traditions.
I do not blame PFC Yoshida alone.
His actions only revealed the absurdity of conditions here.
That's why I demand his punishment.
Obara's death was not caused by domestic troubles.
Then what did cause it?
With your eloquence, I'm sure you can explain.
Tell me.
Answer me!
The basic cause... is the military itself.
You'd make a good private 1st class if you'd shut up!
Hashitani, teach him a lesson.
That's enough.
I'll warn you again:
Personal feuds are forbidden.
Violations will be treated as insubordination.
All right.
You may go.
Recruit Kaji leaving!
That one has guts.
His type make good soldiers.
WO Hino, I want him kept on the promotion's list.
- Keep him on, sir?
- Yes.
Make sure he's well up on the list.
As his stars increase, his ideas will change.
Men are like springs.
The more pressure, the stronger they snap back.
It's best not to drive his kind too hard.
Put him on duty with the vets.
We're headed for the border in a few days anyway.
Thank you for your trying duties.
When did you come out here?
Today.
Half the guard's being replaced.
They keeping you out here?
Practically nothing but sentry duty.
That's just like WO Hino.
I admit it's effective.
I've about had it.
It's damn hot.
Take care of yourself.
They're wrong if they think they can wear me down.
What's that scoundrel Yoshida up to?
Don't do anything rash.
They're just waiting for an excuse to send you to prison.
So this is the real border!
You gonna try?
You coming along?
To the land of promise?
What'll you do over there?
That depends on them.
You believe unconditionally that true freedom can be found over there?
Not unconditionally.
It's all relative.
What use do they have for a deserter?
You'd be a mere tool.
A little tool in the service of their big promises.
You doubt that all races are equal?
I just don't share the same naive certainty.
What have the Japanese done?
Deserting the ranks of the invader doesn't prove the purity of your ideals.
You're still just a deserter.
What are you trying to say?
Prettier flowers blossoming on their soil... doesn't justify rejecting your own.
I could never do it.
This is WO Hino!
You hear me?
Send Kaji back immediately.
We need him for the intramural shooting match in two days.
Got that?
What?
I see.
They may not have plans to desert, but the danger definitely exists.
They were seen whispering together again last night.
Obara's death is shame enough for this company.
Have Shinjo transferred out at the first opportunity.
A signal flare!
It's close by!
Not that close.
Yes, it is.
Let's pick up a few merit points.
Come on.
I don't see anything.
You sure?
Might be farther away.
Damn!
Who goes there?
Stop or I'll shoot!
He was fishing.
You scared him and he ran off.
Does that prove he's innocent?
Son of a bitch!
You shot off that flare!
Confess!
I didn't!
I was just out fishing!
Please spare us!
He was really just fishing.
Shinjo, don't just stand there.
Take him to the guard post.
But if he's not the culprit...
Fool!
We'll make him the culprit.
That's ridiculous!
Do as I order you!
Forgive us!
Spare us!
What are you doing?
No, don't!
No!
Thanks for your troubles!
Kaji!
- There's mail from your wife.
- You've lost weight!
Havel?
I'm being sent out next week.
Was it rough?
Generally it shouldn't be too bad.
Three letters in three weeks.
Oh, and...
Obara's widow sent a letter to the entire squad.
What did she write?
She apologised for everything.
She also says the dead have no tongue, and she can't find out the truth about Obara's suicide.
Right?
What's that scoundrel Yoshida doing?
Five men for work duty!
At the storeroom.
One, two, three, four...
still one short!
Kaji?
Obara would have made it five, PFC Yoshida!
Yoshida!
Shinjo's been called up before WO Hino for letting a spy escape.
Long time no see, Kaji.
You know your mate's going to prison?
You're a disgrace to the Imperial Army!
Bannai shot the culprit anyway, so I'll let you off with the guard house.
I knew you'd end up there sooner or later.
Fire call!
Prairie fire!
Prairie fire!
Let's go!
Fan out to the right!
Move back to the left flank!
What the hell are you doing?
Move forward!
Careful, sir!
Hold your ground!
Move forward!
Start a backfire!
Retreat!
Everyone retreat!
Fall back!
Retreat!
Fall back!
Form a fire line where you are!
Stop!
Who's that?
Shinjo.
Deserter!
Sir, a deserter!
It's Shinjo, sir!
Cut that grass!
Kaji, wait!
It's too dangerous!
Stop!
Shinjo!
Shinjo, run for it!
Help me, Kaji!
Help me!
Yoshida, I'll save you if you'll make me a promise.
Can you hear me?
Admit to the CO that you made Obara commit suicide.
Can you hear me?
You're a lucky man.
You probably remember nothing.
We've shot you full of camphor.
I'm afraid it was too late for the other man.
He had hemorrhagic fever.
You were talking in your sleep, calling for Shinjo and a Michiko.
Your sweetheart?
Or your wife?
Both.
Who's been changing my bedpan?
Don't worry about that.
Just try to rest.
- Private Ishii?
- Yes.
- How many years of service?
- Three.
Well, you're not getting away with it!
Hey, medic... didn't you ever learn how to treat patients?
How long have you been in?
Three years, and still a private.
You may be a lance corporal, but don't try pulling rank.
What?
The slob took sputum from a TB patient to get shipped out.
Punishment should be per regulations.
We don't need people shouting in the middle of the night here.
Private Tange, eh?
Very well.
We'll see who has the last laugh.
PRIVATE TANGE
Don't overexert yourself.
They'll have you up and working soon anyway.
No point rushing things.
Patients get work detail too?
A rookie, eh?
Have a seat.
What was your profession, Honourable Veteran?
Forget the "honourable veteran" stuff.
I was a latheman, and a good one.
Weren't you guys exempted from service?
There are some guys it's safer to keep in the army.
Is that right?
Yes, it is.
You there!
Since when did you start walking?
No one does anything here without authorisation.
I'm practicing my walking, nurse.
Hon. Head Nurse!
Sorry, Hon. Head Nurse!
I was practicing walking.
What's so funny?
Lance Cpl. Minakami... this ward lacks discipline.
Army hospitals aren't playgrounds.
Tighten things up!
Try that again and you've had it.
They say Roosevelt's in Russia talking to Stalin.
If Germany surrenders, that leaves only Japan.
Yes, the end is drawing near.
But if the Russians enter the war...
Kaji!
Private Tange's being sent back to his unit.
When?
Tomorrow.
That's terrible.
It's bad news, isn't it?
Sent back to his unit, eh?
No one can ever know what will happen tomorrow.
Your unit's been ordered to the front.
They'll probably keep you here on hospital duty.
Really?
Even in here, there's always more bad news than good.
There was so much I wanted to discuss with you.
We'll meet again somewhere.
You can always meet those you really wish to.
Someone once told me that true human beings will always find kindred spirits.
You're proof of that.
Don't give me too much credit.
But I appreciate your words.
More work for you.
Writing to your wife?
But I don't dare write the truth.
Because of the censors?
Not just that.
Everything I write ends up as a half-truth.
I want her to know how lonely I am, but I don't want to worry her.
What's more, as much as I detest army life,
I actually want to stay here as long as I can.
Is it that nice here?
There are things here you don't get at the front.
For instance?
For instance... talking to you.
And now... stay back.
The steam is hot.
Is it all right for you to be here?
I probably shouldn't be.
Nurse Tokunaga, why did you leave your post?
What's the meaning of this misconduct?
A rendezvous in broad daylight...
while on duty!
Rendezvous?
Forgive me, but there's been no misconduct.
I asked Nurse Tokunaga to assist me.
A patient issuing orders to a nurse?
That's as bad as a rendezvous!
Hon. Head Nurse, I came of my own accord.
No excuses!
Get back to your post!
As you are outside my authority, I shall report this to your superiors.
It seems I repaid your kindness with injury.
You're being sent to the front because of me.
It's all right.
We had to part sooner or later.
We may even meet again somewhere.
I believe we will, whatever the odds.
You can always meet those you really wish to.
PART 4
Class-A fortifications with log-barrel cannons.
Must be the "scarecrow strategy."
This stinks!
Five years' artillery training, and they give us peashooters.
Let's put that one on old Commander Yamada.
Attention!
Is there a Private Kaji in this squad?
Yes, sir.
It's been a long time, Kaji.
So you're still alive?
At ease!
I am 2nd Lt. Kageyama.
I'm taking over your training as of today.
Who goes there?
Who goes there?
Firefly.
Snow.
Sounds of gun tractors or tanks for 10 minutes.
Otherwise all is in order, sir.
Good work.
What's that?
Probably a festival.
They shot off fireworks.
Doesn't make sense.
The fighting in Europe must have ended.
Germany must have surrendered.
A new batch of recruits arrives soon.
I want you to assist me in their training.
In what way?
The new men range from 20 to 44 years old.
Half active service, the remainder untrained.
Artillery men are a rough bunch.
They'd tear these men to shreds.
Basic is like that anywhere.
That's why I need your help.
Count me out.
I told you I gave up guarding the army's sheep.
I've reported that you're my assistant in the rifle squad.
I'll see that you make private 1st class.
Think you can bait me with a promotion?
No, I know I can't.
I just figured you could spare those recruits a lot of grief.
Need I say more?
I'll accept your proposal... on one condition.
What's that?
I want radical changes in squad composition.
And the training officer has agreed to separate the recruits from the veterans?
He has.
Hon. Squad Leader, if you approve, the company commander will as well.
Sure it's not just to keep the veterans off your own back?
That's part of it, but not all.
Many of the new untrained recruits are in their 40s.
Excessively rough treatment in the barracks would make it difficult for them to learn anything.
From my own days in basic I remember one case of suicide.
It's our duty to weed out such weaklings.
Training alone won't make men strong.
I'll work them hard during training but show them kindness in the barracks.
What would a two-year man like you know?
You have to put the screws on from the start to teach them what army life is really like.
So, PFC Kaji, you're the new assistant?
That is correct.
What will you teach them?
Just what I was taught.
And what were you taught?
Since you were picked as assistant, you must know a lot.
But there's one thing you have yet to learn.
Masui... teach the lad.
What could a mere private like me teach PFC Kaji?
Don't try to act big around me!
How long have you served?
I'll show you how artillery trains its men!
Cannon No. 1 loaded!
Kaji-san, you're a private 1st class in the infantry.
You could give Masui a beating if you wanted.
So our presence would interfere with training your recruits?
Want to lord it over them all alone, eh?
Won't let anyone lay a finger on your precious recruits, eh?
Then get ready for what you've got coming!
Open your mouth.
Wider!
Now listen carefully!
I didn't plug your ears, so you should be able to hear.
The pheasant that cries is apt to be killed.
This one won't cry anymore, the poor sap.
This is what you get for slighting the veterans.
When your beloved rookies arrive, forget the codes and manuals and teach them that!
Who'll save their hides under fire?
Not your codes or manuals, but the vets.
The same ones showing you such affection now.
Remember that!
The lieutenant!
What's going on here?
Take that slipper out of your mouth!
Take it out.
I'll overlook this whole matter... but only this once.
Such behaviour will not be tolerated!
Nice young kid.
Thank you for everything.
- Get your men settled in?
- Yes, sir.
The vets may have grumbled, but you got your way, even if it meant eating that slipper.
I want to train men who'll be willing to die with me.
How many men will the rifle squad get?
Twenty on light machine guns and twenty on mortars.
Well, are you tired out?
Is the border close to the enemy?
The enemy?
Yes, very close.
Then this is the very front line.
I can boast to Father.
What does he do?
He's an officer.
A major.
Worried about your kid?
I'm not the only one.
I'll be all right, sir.
Sir...
I'm gonna carry a picture, OK?
Watch the casual language.
What kind of picture?
Of a girl.
Sure.
Most pictures are of girls or boys.
- I told you.
- His is different.
It's a naked woman.
A good luck charm?
Something like that.
It'll never pass inspection.
Better sew it into your loincloth.
Listen here:
Use formal language when addressing veterans besides myself.
If they hear "ain't" or "gonna", you'll get a beating you'll never forget.
Understand?
With eager face and eager voice
My wife and children urge me on to great deeds
Come here.
A little early to go around with loose buttons.
Words don't seem to teach you men anything.
I'll be more careful.
May I have it back, please?
No, you may not.
You can come for it later.
The button must have worked itself loose.
Go to the veterans' room and don't waver.
Be prepared for a beating.
Go get it back.
You'll have to handle this yourself.
Recruit Koizumi to retrieve his button!
Enter!
- What's that?
Your button?
- It was my fault
Tashiro did it!
He pushed me!
What?
You dog!
Look at what they serve the veterans.
Don't tell me you scooped it up off the ground with those dainty hands you wipe your ass with!
Who cut our ration?
Why do you keep blaming me?
Tashiro, stop playing innocent!
What's that?
Cut it out!
Why fight over it now?
What should I do?
What should you do?
Hon. Lance Corporal, what should he do?
How about another helping from the kitchen?
No real hurry.
We'll wait.
Very well!
Dump the food back in the bucket.
Azumi, when that's done, take it to the vets.
We'll eat just rice.
It's better than nothing.
Take this!
Is that how Kaji taught you?
No, it was all my own mistake.
You polish your boots sitting on your ass?
What did you do, Enji?
Ah, the Honourable Assistant.
Kaji, how'd you teach your men to shine their boots?
- I was at fault.
- Shut your mouth!
How about it, Kaji?
I've yet to give them any special instructions.
He did teach us.
I was at fault.
You keep quiet.
I'll see that they're taught correctly.
Please forgive him.
Fine.
I'll stand by and watch how you teach him.
Hit him!
I understand you're opposed to striking your recruits.
I cannot do it.
Shall I show you how?
Like this!
Sir, strike me!
You're through here.
Go!
Son of a bitch!
It's not because I took a beating.
I want orders forbidding all corporal punishment of recruits.
I'd go along with you if we were stationed further back.
But it's different here.
The vets may be louts, but they can stand on their own two feet.
If I lost control over them, what would happen in battle?
I'd place my recruits and myself at your command.
In actual combat...
I couldn't trust you half as much as I trust those men.
Those jaded five-year vets wouldn't listen to a 2nd lieutenant fresh from the academy.
I understand, sir!
Just a minute.
Michiko wrote me.
I told her you were here with me.
She can't understand why you so rarely write, since you must be enjoying more freedom here.
More freedom, eh?
Want to read it?
Just give me the gist.
She's relieved.
Figures you have it easy under my command.
She has a lotto learn.
She asked me to keep an eye on you.
Be careful, Kaji.
Don't twist her words to support your own position.
Fool!
She's praying that our worthless lives might be spared, hoping against hope that you'll survive.
She repeats that over and over.
I'm sorry.
You're an officer.
You can write to her.
If you send a reply, here's what you should say:
"Kaji will not die.
No matter what happens, he'll make it out alive."
Please tell her that.
2nd Lt. Kageyama.
Okinawa has fallen, but we have the main island.
The 2.5 million soldiers waiting there...
- It's too late to pray for miracles.
- We're not!
Our strategy aims at final victory.
We all like to think so.
Though the home front expects the tide to turn, our men are being wiped out.
That's the true picture.
Meaning they died in vain?
Depends on how you look at it.
- Why, you...
- Calm down!
Save your heroism for your soldiers.
He who shouts loudest isn't always the bravest.
2nd Lt. Kageyama.
Aren't you making a mistake?
Japan's not as feeble as you might think.
From the Aleutians to Australia, from Tarawa to India,
Japan has pressed the battle across thousands of miles.
A pessimist like you can't begin to grasp its strength.
Yes, we've had to draw back our battle lines.
We've lost Okinawa and face battle on our mainland.
But that's all part of our basic strategy.
Look how the enemy doesn't yet dare attack our main island.
Their supply lines grow longer as our units grow more ready and compact.
Our main forces at home are still intact.
Our Pacific losses are like a single hair off the hide of a bull.
Can't you understand that?
- I understand.
- What do you understand?
That I'll probably die here.
And 2nd Lt. Nonaka... so will you.
What's going to happen to us?
If the Japanese lose...
Nonsense!
Japan will never lose.
It's un-Japanese to even consider it!
Un-Japanese?
It's only natural to be concerned about oneself.
Tucking your tails just 'cause we lost Okinawa!
You have no dedication!
PFC Kaji pampers you!
As far as I'm concerned, he's...
I'm what?
Afraid to say it to my face?
You've said nothing to us about the fall of Okinawa.
We need a pep talk.
We need faith in our ultimate victory.
You seem to love ultimate victory even more than food.
Personally, I love my wife more than ultimate victory.
You may consider that unmanly.
But when fighting starts,
I'll be the only one you can count on.
Hey, where's your salute?
Hold it!
You call that a salute?
Hon. Squad Leader!
I alone was at fault.
Let me alone be punished.
Save your breath.
Nice work, Hon. Squad Leader.
Mind taking over here?
Sir, spare the others!
Just shut up and keep it up!
- Hon. Squad Leader!
- Shut your trap!
Sir!
Naruto, shut up!
I'm taking it too.
You'll keep it up until he says you can stop... even if the commander says otherwise.
Got that?
You dog!
Get up or I'll whack you one!
Who's that?
Enji?
I'm sorry, sir.
When we were rookies, we kept this up for an hour.
Naruto!
Drinking after hours and raising hell!
You damned NCOs!
Scum!
You dare defy us?
Dog!
We'll murder you!
Yeah?
Just try it!
You're in for a surprise.
Son of a bitch!
I've been in and out of worse places.
Throw me in your guard house!
I don't care!
Naruto, they'll throw you in prison!
Out of my way!
What have you got to brag about?
You've never earned an honest meal in your lives!
To hell with all of you!
Sir, please leave this to me.
I'll assume custody of him.
Insubordination and insulting a superior.
What will happen?
Can you help him?
If the CO feels that locking up a recruit would disgrace the company...
Please try to convince him.
Salute the duty officer!
Eyes right!
Front!
Cpl. Takeda and command of eight men have duly transferred guard duties to Cpl. Fujimoto and command.
Out!
Was it tough?
Sorry to concern you.
It was only three days.
They're all waiting.
Naruto's back!
Go on inside.
Naruto, was it rough?
PFC Kaji, come here!
Some training you're giving your recruits.
Our men are worn out from guard duty.
What are your men doing?
I'm sorry.
I happened to be out.
That's no excuse!
You'd better teach them right.
And stop acting big because you're a PFC!
Take that!
Kaji... get ready!
You scum!
Get up!
Well, how do you like being sacrificed for your precious recruits?
That's enough, Akaboshi.
Let's see you do that again, Akaboshi.
Come on!
I'll cut you wide open!
Don't think I won't do it.
Pride and face mean nothing to me now.
Come on!
You filthy...
Wait!
Filthy braggarts!
Don't tell me you're afraid of one two-year man.
I'll swap my life for one of you stinking worms!
Wait, Kaji!
Afraid to fight man-to-man?
Sir!
Naruto, let me go!
- Sir!
- Let me go!
Don't you rats ever forget:
I'll get even with you someday!
Sir... next time let me lend a hand.
Tashiro will help too.
Thanks, but that would never do.
Why not?
We'd all be called up for mutiny.
We'll fight it in court.
We'd be sure to lose.
Naruto... we can't win right now.
Maybe we could give those vets a good licking... but they're not the real enemy.
Our real enemy... is the army.
Prepare for roll call!
Sir, don't get up.
I want Lt. Kageyama to get a good look at my face.
Roll call!
Attention!
First squad: total 36.
Absent: 4.
Present: 32.
Count off!
Unnumbered: 1.
Sick room: 4.
All accounted for.
Emergency orders for this squad.
PFC Kaji and 28 recruits will depart at 19:00 hrs. tomorrow for trench-digging detail.
You'll march at night to maintain secrecy.
You'll join Cpl. Hironaka's command on site.
Work detail:
approximately one month.
This is a cowardly trick... sending me outwith a work party to avoid friction with the vets.
Look at that way if you wish.
You may think you've rid the company of its cancerous growth, but I'll be back in a month... probably more malignant than ever.
I don't think so.
When you get back,
I'm sending you away for special training.
Sending the prodigal son out for a few knocks in the harsh world?
To South Manchuria.
Maybe even closer to Michiko.
Why stay here at the front if you have a chance to get away?
You agree?
You and I still have unfinished business.
You avoided the issue, while I pushed a little too hard.
Neither of us accomplished anything.
You're a clever man, but picking the army as the stage for your battles was a fool's work.
It's wiser to play it safe than to be stubborn.
Will you do this clever fool a favour?
The mother hen's leaving half her brood behind.
It causes her some concern.
My absence may make it easier to keep the vets in line.
Can I count on you?
Don't be such a pessimist.
If you must worry, worry about your wife.
You must be all out.
Take them.
Sir, please come back to us.
It's only a month.
I get the strange feeling I'm being stranded.
You and I here together makes some people nervous.
Neither of us is very patient.
Naruto, watch that temper.
Take any trouble to Lt. Kageyama, you hear?
Work party, fall in!
Attention!
Salute the honourable lieutenant!
Eyes centre!
Front!
PFC Kaji and party now departing!
Right face!
Forward... march!
Here comes our water!
Sir!
Take a look.
Good work.
Well done.
Feels like I'm building my own house.
Yes, I suppose you'd want to fight in here if possible.
I could battle fate with an easy mind here.
I see.
Sir, that bum wants to bring his mother and girlfriend to live here.
You idiot!
Your mother might want to sleep between you and your bride!
Are you engaged?
When the war's over, let Naruto build you a love nest.
He's a carpenter.
He'll be glad to.
Nakai, you can help handle his mother.
I'll help handle the bride anytime!
Sir, you've never told us about your wife.
She's a good wife.
You'll all have to meet her after the war.
Is she tall or short?
Medium build.
About 5'2", 105 lbs.
- Just my size!
- Fool!
Work party, fall in!
On the double!
Listen carefully!
At dawn today, our Seiundai fortifications were attacked by heavy Soviet forces.
It seems Major Ushijima and all his men died a glorious death.
The enemy is advancing inland along the entire Manchurian border.
We are to return immediately to barracks to await reassignment.
We are to construct fortifications along the new line of defense, where we shall meet and crush the advancing enemy!
Disperse!
Hit the dirt!
A reconnaissance plane.
Nonaka Platoon, listen carefully.
Those without rifles will lash their bayonets to birch staffs for use in close combat.
Don't we get rifles?
Birch breaks too easily to be of much use.
Is it my fault it's all that grows here?
We're moving out!
Break camp!
Prepare to depart in 10 minutes!
Volunteers to go pick up our weapons!
Tashiro to the supply depot for weapons!
Very well.
Be careful.
We're moving out!
Break camp!
We leave in one hour!
Sir... what's happening with our command unit?
These conflicting orders confuse and demoralise our troops.
Do your griping to the CO!
This is war!
Where's Doi Company?
Over here!
Hironaka Squad?
Over here!
What happened?
We're worn out.
Did you come from Seiundai?
There weren't any survivors there!
Only Onodera managed to sneak away.
I didn't sneak away.
I was sent outwith a message.
What's the difference?
Why so angry?
At least you got out alive.
Recruits, bring us some food!
What happened at Seiundai?
We got wiped out, including all your precious recruits.
Russian shells suddenly started whistling overhead.
And Lt. Kageyama?
Killed in action.
Aircraft approaching from the north!
Let's go!
Platoon... halt!
Fall out!
You'll find no loot around here.
Where's the senior officer?
Good question.
Hey, you know where he is?
Probably giving his girl a final workover.
In that case, Sergeant, will you issue orders for weapons?
Sorry, sir, but I'm not authorised to issue orders.
You'll need orders from HQ.
Where's the phone?
I'll talk to HQ.
Right there.
What's wrong with this thing?
The bombings cut the lines.
Sir, shall I liberate more candy from the canteen?
Good idea.
Stay where you are!
Traitors!
I'll kill you all!
I'm taking the rifles on my authority.
300 men can't possibly dig 1.5 miles of trenches in 48 hours.
You think the enemy will wait while you finish?
Instead of ineffective half measures, we should stop up the valleys with trenches and concentrate on strengthening our fortifications.
When you're the strategy officer, you can do it your way.
You're stationed in Area C, I believe?
I'm sorry to say this, but for strategic reasons, your area will suffer heavy casualties.
I'm not saying this to protect myself.
The task is simply impossible.
Even if I order you?
Lieutenant Doi... proceed with the work.
Yes, sir.
But the Hon. Staff Officer must remember that some areas will not be finished.
Should those breaches prove fatal, I cannot be held responsible.
To hell with your family.
The fate of Japan is at stake.
If we lose, we'll have no homes!
Easy for you to say with no family.
Even if we lose, if I survive, my wife has a future.
If parents survive, the kids have a chance to grow up.
It's not them.
You're just afraid to die.
That's enough, Terada.
You're always arguing with everybody.
Because they only think of themselves, not our country.
You're not afraid to die?
I am not.
I see.
Well, I am.
I thought you'd say that.
Now that we're in combat, may I speak my mind?
Go ahead.
You hate me because my father's a major.
That can't be helped.
But you defend this cowardly scum because you're critical of this war.
It's all right.
Let him talk.
Yes, I am critical of it.
I sold my soul for a military exemption.
I can't approve of how your father raised you.
So you mean you reject this war completely?
I mean I should have rejected it.
Then you're a coward with a split personality!
You've had your chance to speak.
Now it's my turn.
You're a fool!
A simpleton who wouldn't understand why his mother would shed tears if he was killed in action.
To die here is a dog's death.
Even you'll understand that someday, if you survive.
Here come our rifles!
Command squad leader Cpl. Hironaka.
Light machine gun squad, PFC Iwabuchi.
Rifle squad, PFC Kaji.
Antitank suicide squad, PFC Akaboshi.
At ease!
Attention!
Lt. Nonaka will assume command of Platoon III.
The enemy attack will presumably commence at dawn.
Each man will dig a foxhole by midnight in the spot designated by his squad leader and prepare to meet the enemy.
PFC Kaji.
You will take a scouting party and ascertain the location of the enemy.
You'll rejoin this main party before sundown.
Takasugi and Terada, step forward.
Ready ammunition!
This is ridiculous!
After five years of training, they want me crawling under tanks!
I'll bet you recruits don't want to die either.
Well, don't look at me.
You're on your own.
Your report conflicts with the others.
Did you penetrate deeply enough to confirm?
I did, sir.
Can your two men confirm the 15 tanks?
I left them behind the embankment, sir.
Why?
We were ordered to remain behind until called.
And he didn't call you?
- I did not, sir.
- Why not?
Recruits are not trained in scouting tactics.
Very considerate of you.
You never got close enough to confirm those tanks.
Coward!
I'm scared out of my wits.
This waiting's getting on my nerves.
It's already decided who will live and who will die.
It's just a few hours till dawn.
We're like condemned men awaiting execution.
There's white cloth in my foxhole.
It must be a grave.
There are no graves here.
It has to be a grave.
It must be filled with crumbling bones.
Stop driving yourself crazy!
You're not a child anymore.
Please let me change places with someone.
Sir...
I'll swap with him.
No!
You'll soon be glad to hide under corpses.
Why worry about a grave?
Terada, go join Cpl. Hironaka as orderly and runner.
Well, the end has come.
Orders may not be heard above the din of battle.
Each of you must think for himself.
There are just two things I want to say.
Don't be a coward.
Like it or not, what comes will come.
The other thing is:
Never give up.
Not for the sake of victory, but for yourself.
If things get too hot, take cover and think about home... or your girl.
That's what I plan to do.
Nakai, you got that girl in your loincloth?
Of course!
Good.
Hang on to her.
They're coming!
Send up the signal flare!
Lt. Nonaka, prepare for action.
Nonaka Platoon, every man to his station.
Hold your fire.
Commence firing at 300.
Distance 800.
Fire!
Blast 'em!
Wipe 'em all out!
Hold your fire!
Save your ammo!
To your right, 400!
Fire!
Get those tanks!
Rifle squad... when the big guns open up, keep your heads down!
Ihara!
Sir!
What is it?
Tanks closing in on our rear!
- Where's the CO?
- Over there!
I'm going!
Wait!
They're still firing.
I'll be okay.
Fire!
Keep your heads down!
Sir!
Koizumi...
Mimura...
Our only alternative is to attack.
Send a runner to the CO.
Ask what he plans to do.
Terada, take the message!
Terada relaying the message!
I'm out of ammo, sir!
Azumi, you got ammo?
Let me have some.
No, I'm short too.
You're not even firing!
Fine, keep it!
I'm out of ammo, sir!
I warned you about wasting it.
Here.
Wait!
Stay here.
We'll fire together.
Commander!
Where's that runner?
Enemy troops to our rear!
We're trapped!
We all feel safer with you here, sir.
And I want to send you home safe to your mothers.
Enji!
I'm out of ammo, sir!
I'll take him some.
You'll go?
I'm out.
Ammo!
I'll be right back.
No, if you go, stay there.
Make every bullet count, OK?
Get ready.
I'll cover you.
Go!
Tashiro!
Nakai, stay down!
Tashiro!
Sons of bitches!
Lieutenant, should we retreat?
Fool!
Long live the Japanese Empire!
You fool, come back!
Terada, what are you doing?
Where's the tank?
It's gone.
Does it hurt?
They'll come back for us again.
The major's son fought bravely.
You just might make it through this.
I'll sear your wound.
Close your eyes.
Rifle squad!
Rifle squad, show yourselves!
Anyone there?
I refuse to die.
- What'll we do?
- One final charge.
A final charge?
Watch out, Kaji!
Onodera.
Will we make it?
They coming this way?
- You got a grenade?
- No.
If we have to, we jump at 'em.
Please save me!
Are they gone?
- Are they?
- Quiet!
They're still up there.
Stop shooting!
He'll get us all killed!
- Stop shooting!
- I got him in the leg!
The battle's over.
No, it's not!
I'm gonna attack!
If you wanna die like a dog, go ahead.
What do we do now?
We were lucky to come through it alive.
Let's try and stay that way.
All right, we get it!
We know how tough you are.
Stop showing off!
You don't know the Kwangtung Army!
He's raving mad!
Pin him down, Kaji!
Come on, you damned Ruskies!
I'll chop you up!
Onodera, it's too dangerous!
Quiet!
You don't know how tough I am!
Quiet or we'll all be killed!
Onodera, be quiet!
Be quiet!
What happened?
He's dead.
I won't claim I put him out of his misery.
I killed him!
You didn't have to kill him.
Do you blame me?
Do you?
I'm a monster!
But I'm going to stay alive!
Is anyone there?
Isn't anyone left alive?
Answer me!
Is anyone else still alive?

- All's in order, sir!
- Good.
Attention!
All's in order, sir!
- Good.
Salute!
At ease.
JANUARY 23RD - 20:00 HOURS 32° BELOW ZERO
Here he comes.
You recruits are feigning sleep, eh?
You can't rest until I've made my rounds.
All seems to be in order.
Recruits, fall in!
Turn on the light.
Legs apart and grit your teeth.
Idiots!
Did that hurt?
- No, sir!
Good.
I'll teach you dogs a lesson!
Fools!
You know what that was for?
What about you?
- I dunno.
- What?
I don't know, sir!
You don't?
Well, I'll show you.
It was for this.
Since when do you use the water tank as an ashtray?
Speak up!
The duty officer specifically ordered that those tanks be kept clean and sanitary.
We received the order.
Who was on duty today?
Step forward!
Remove your glasses.
Get up!
Obara refilled the tanks before evening mess.
I removed the ash trays after "lights out."
You're implying that one of your superiors smoked after "lights out"?
Kaji, are you trying to pin blame on a senior serviceman?
No.
I only said that Obara showed no neglect.
Watch your language!
Recruit Obara admits his neglect.
Of course.
Why didn't you say so?
- I'm very sorry.
- You should be.
- I'll be more careful.
- It's too late for that!
Owaku, where are you going?
To change the water.
You don't have to do that.
Kaji, you dare talk back to PFC Bannai?
I didn't talk back.
The platoon leader demands discipline!
Who taught you to be insubordinate?
Your friend Shinjo over there?
Logic won't get you anywhere in this army.
Don't try acting big around here just because you went to college.
Any arguments?
PFC Bannai, leave this to me.
Very well.
You, report to me later!
Can't you even see the target?
I can.
Then your heart isn't in it.
Take careful aim.
Imagine it's the enemy out there.
Come on, Obara.
Hit it, please!
Draw a bead carefully onto the target at the bottom of the bull's -eye.
Hold your breath!
Apply pressure on the trigger and squeeze gently.
You idiot!
No luck.
We'll never get to lunch at this rate.
And always because of him!
- It can't be helped.
- Shut up, you hick.
That's no excuse.
What's going on over there?
Stop acting like starved mongrels.
Kaji!
Show Obara how to do it.
Yes, sir!
Unstack arms.
Show him you can hit the target with eyes closed.
- With eyes closed?
- That's right.
With proper posture, you should at least hit the target.
Objective - the target!
Position - prone!
Obara, watch how he holds it and squeezes the trigger.
You see, Obara?
Bad eyesight is no excuse.
Try again.
Obara, try to relax.
Don't jerk the trigger.
Squeeze down on it.
Squeeze it slowly.
Slowly now...
You'd be better off dead!
You're a disgrace to the whole Kwangtung Army!
Obara, listen carefully.
A sense of responsibility is a soldier's life.
A grenade could wipe out your squad because of your missed shot.
Show some responsibility and some shame!
To the target on the double!
Kaji, you go with him.
Bayonet attack!
Charge!
Down!
Obara, stop crying!
Forward!
"A t the time, Kaji was trying to save the lives of innocent Chinese.
This earned him the hatred of the Kenpeitai.
They arrested him and grilled him mercilessly.
If my husband had indeed been guilty, they would not have released him after just 20 days.
I fervently hope that this unfortunate incident... will not compromise his position as a member of your unit.
As the wife of a recruit, I address this appeal to you.
The life of a recruit under suspicion would be a living hell with no salvation."
Orderly!
Where's the orderly?
Entering, sir!
Your orderly, sir!
Call Warrant Officer Hino.
Salute the warrant officer!
Present arms!
Eyes front!
PFC Yamazaki now relieved of guard duty, sir.
Good.
Thank you for your work!
Knock it off!
See to your own duties.
Thank you.
We're very grateful.
Anything you need washed?
That's all right.
You're a hard worker, Kaji.
I hated laundry duty even more than beatings.
One might hate it, but there's no avoiding it.
You won't be a private forever like me.
You're tops among the recruits.
But don't forget:
You're under suspicion.
I know.
They can't afford to have a Red leading the pack.
They're hoping you'll make a misstep.
You and I can't even talk without being watched.
Anything suspicious about Kaji's actions?
Have you received reports to that effect?
I asked if you had.
None, sir, though I have him under surveillance.
What are Sergeant Hashitani's thoughts?
He's giving Kaji special sniper training now, sir.
- He's a good marksman?
- An unerring eye, sir.
- And his barracks discipline?
- Excellent, sir.
How is he with Shinjo?
They seem close, but -
Seem?
You don't know?
They're both blacklisted by the Kenpeitai.
They have no time now to do any plotting.
Why's that?
I've kept Shinjo on constant supply transport and guard duty.
Keep an eye on them.
They'll soon show their true colors.
If they straighten up, they could be our best soldiers.
Attention!
At ease.
Listen as you are.
Afternoon training is canceled.
There'll be an arms inspection.
The tiniest speck of dust will not be tolerated.
After dark there'll be sentry training, followed by attack training at dawn.
What do you think?
Like the full schedule?
Owaku, you have a letter.
Kaji.
Obara.
Corporal Shibata.
- Salute!
Arms inspection again?
From your wife?
Read it out loud.
No, I save it till I can't bear it any longer.
Oh, well.
You must have a good wife.
I wonder what that wench of mine is up to.
Hey, Obara.
Think things will get better after basic?
It won't be this rough much longer.
I'm getting fed up.
Don't let little things get you down.
Little things, eh?
Bad news from home bothering you?
My mother and wife are fighting as usual.
My wife's threatening to leave home.
Doesn't mean she's leaving you.
You wouldn't understand.
You've had all the breaks.
It would leave my aging mother all alone.
Back one and drop the other.
To back 'em both is asking for trouble.
That's the wrong one.
Take it out.
You broke it.
You weren't paying attention.
You fool!
That was mine!
What are you gonna do about it?
I'm not apologizing to the army for you.
That won't fix your rifle, Kubo.
Forgive him.
- No, I won't!
- Then don't.
You stay out of this.
Everybody here knows you're a Red.
And so?
I'm just saying no one loves a Red.
Hit me.
Hit me all you want.
Attention!
Eyes right!
Front!
- All right, they're ready.
- Thank you!
Start distributing.
- Is there a Private Shinjo here?
- Yes, one.
Private Shinjo will take two recruits and clean out the latrines.
Good luck.
On whose orders?
Sergeant Soga's.
He sets up the roster for latrine duty too?
Quit your griping, Shinjo.
Is a three-year man too good to clean latrines?
Tell the NCO on duty or Warrant Officer Hino that I'll do it alone.
I don't need help from any recruits.
Shinjo... better take somebody along.
It ain't easy carting' all that shit alone.
Will none of you recruits go with him?
Kaji, why don't you go?
You're another Red shit like him.
Kubo, come with us.
I don't take orders from you.
That's it, fight it out.
The liquor will be here soon.
Come on, one more!
Get moving.
Recruit Kaji to latrine duty!
Recruit Tanoue to latrine duty!
That's the spirit!
They're giving you and me all the dirty work.
Standing duty the other night,
I suddenly realized how haggard you looked.
You've been on constant duty.
You have stamina, Kaji.
I've about had it.
They're just waiting for me to cave in under the pressure.
Salute!
- All is in order.
- Good.
A huddle in the latrine?
A truly stinking discussion.
Sir... does the company commander approve all duty assignments?
I wouldn't know.
Ask WO Hino.
I'll do that.
One more question.
What happens if a soldier refuses an assignment?
When such assignment is unfair, of course.
I suggest you check the Army Penal Code.
Aren't you asking for trouble?
I don't care about going home, but I do want to get out of here.
What do you mean?
I'm not even sure myself.
To go to some unknown place and get a fresh start.
Someplace where no one knows me.
Is there such a place?
Escaping from here only means immediate recapture.
There's only one other possibility.
Is the border close?
Not far.
But it's all marshland up to the lake.
Get bogged down there and you're finished.
Which would you choose?
The land where people are promised freedom... or the land where your loving wife awaits you?
I promised my wife we'd start a new life together.
You really believe you'll get back alive?
I don't know... but I hope so.
A rare Sunday leave
Walking down the boulevard
With her hairdo of a married woman
She led me up the stairs
To a tiny little room
" You're a wisteria dangling above
And I'm a lily below"
Just five minutes
To get back to barracks
"Come on, let me go!"
No time to take a train
No money for a cab
With my legs strong from daily drills
I'll make a run for it
PFC Yoshida!
There's to be a transfer.
A transfer?
They can't toss us out of here after four years' service.
They've already decided who it is.
Who?
Kaji, got a copy of the Penal Code?
Don't let them get to you.
What's the Penal Code for, Shinjo?
What did you tell him just now?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
A senior serviceman addressed you and you didn't reply?
Sir, have I done something wrong?
That's better.
What did you say?
Use your head.
We're celebrating today.
A beating could hurt.
I mentioned that he seemed tired and shouldn't be reading.
Hear that?
Telling a three-year man what to do.
So the old veteran Shinjo is tired, eh?
Hey, Shinjo!
Sorry to fatigue you even more, but may I trouble you with a question?
It seems he didn't hear you.
I'll clean out his ears!
A fight means trouble for us both, Yoshida.
I was reading the Penal Code at Sergeant Soga's suggestion to learn how to refuse an order without being insubordinate.
Attention!
Attention!
Salute!
At ease.
What happened?
It's Private Shinjo, sir.
He was taken suddenly ill.
I put him to bed.
Does a feverish man account for broken bowls?
Pick up these pieces.
Salute!
Cherry tree the color of my lapel
Your blossoms are scattered all over Mount Yoshino
If you're born a man in old Yamato
You must fall like a blossom at the battle front
It's ridiculous for a lady to come out here.
There's no place for you to stay.
What will you do?
I only wanted to see him.
I had no other concern.
The next train out is tomorrow afternoon.
Will you sleep outdoors?
Or spend the night walking home?
If you'll only let me see him, I'm willing to walk back.
Recruit Tanoue leaving to polish his boots!
Is Kaji here?
Report to the office.
You have a visitor.
- A visitor?
- Who is it?
A dame, no less!
Son of a bitch!
Better hurry up, Kaji, or someone might swipe her.
Don't be bashful.
Better hurry up.
I'll finish up for you.
Recruit Kaji reporting to the office!
Make sure you come back.
Damn!
Coming all the way out here to get laid!
Permission to enter, sir!
- Yes?
- Entering, sir!
Recruit Kaji reporting!
You wanted something?
What did you want?
Recruit Kaji, leaving!
Hold it there.
You're a disgrace to military discipline.
Don't let your wife make you homesick.
You're hereby authorized to spend the night with your wife within the confines of the company storeroom.
I finally had to come.
It's so far.
How did you make it?
I've changed, haven't I?
It must be rough.
I'm used to it now.
But winter makes things tougher.
We went hunting today.
I'll bring some of the meat later.
You haven't lost any weight.
I'm relieved.
You've come all this way, and there's so little I can offer you.
I'm just a recruit.
Look at me.
I am.
You mustn't worry.
I'll come through it all right.
How much time did they give us?
Until morning.
Even less than when they shipped me off.
So... it's all right then?
Entering!
Recruit Sasa with our squad leader's meal!
Ma'am...
Kaji bagged this game for us today.
Eat heartily and enjoy yourselves.
Thanks.
My husband is much indebted to you.
We recruits are all in the same boat.
The army's one helluva place.
But Kaji's a lucky devil.
No other woman would come way out here to see her man.
That's the truth.
There's so little time.
I hope it's not too much... but would you write my wife and tell her to do like you and come out to see me?
All she does is eat and sleep.
She cares about nothing else.
Tell her that things are rough out here and to bring lots of gifts for the senior servicemen.
Ride her good!
Recruit Sasa leaving!
Come on.
Let's eat.
A rookie allowed to monkey around with his wife!
The army sheds bitter tears!
Kaji, you're a sneaky one, keeping all the good things for yourself.
I request this favor.
He wants blankets.
Your wife should keep you warm.
Aren't your own blankets enough?
They are.
I'll make do.
Rolling around on a narrow futon.
Curse the blasted luck!
As long as we're alive, we'll be able to meet again.
I came here confident that I'd get to see you.
Even after you left, that Sergeant Watai kept coming by.
Wanted me to let him read your letters.
Nasty man!
Maybe he thinks you're planning to desert.
What would you do if I did?
Where would you go?
Across the border.
There's a man in my squad named Shinjo.
After three years, he's still a private.
His brother was arrested for communist leanings.
Even his girlfriend sold him out.
He claims there's a better world beyond that border.
A better world?
Where they treat people like human beings.
And you intend to escape there all by yourself?
You can't run away!
Not while you still have me!
The warrant officer said you were a top soldier, but you're still under suspicion, aren't you?
I won't go.
I won't run away.
I'll carry on here.
Please don't run away.
Come back to me.
All is in order!
You are relieved.
Assuming duty.
Forward... march!
Break step!
Don't forget your promise to come back alive.
I won't forget.
Aren't you sleepy?
Not a bit.
There wasn't anything else you wished to say?
No.
Even if there were, I couldn't express it in words.
I'm always thinking
I must tell you about this, mustn't forget to tell you that.
Me too.
Thanks for coming to see me.
It's only natural.
Thank you for such a wonderful night.
Don't thank me.
There's so little I can do.
Let's hope we never spend such a wretched yet beautiful night again.
Maybe it's because... you're headed for the front.
Why do you say that?
I just have this strange feeling.
Maybe that's why they let me see you.
No, you must come back to me!
You have to!
Will you grant me one last favor?
Anything.
Just ask.
I came here for your sake.
I realize it's cold... but I'd like you to undress and stand over by that window.
I must see you... all of you.
I want to burn that image into my mind.
I have nothing to offer you!
Nothing!
Please take me!
Reveille!
What's wrong, Kaji?
All worn out?
Bastard!
Come on, Kaji.
I'll give you a workout.
I'm not as easy to poke as your wife.
Come on!
I'm ready!
Enough!
Well done, Kaji.
PFC Yoshida... you let this recruit push you around?
Let's have another round like that.
I'm ready!
Don't retreat, Kaji.
Retreat is no way to victory.
I'm right here.
Come at me!
What is it?
I can't see you off.
We're leaving on maneuvers.
Be careful on your way back.
Time to part once again.
Thank you for coming.
Hurry and go.
I can't bear it.
Let's not say "good-bye", all right?
A soldier's will before departing should convey his resolution to his family and inspire them to carry on in a fitting way.
What does a departing soldier's resolution imply?
Speak up.
It means to lay down one's life for one's country.
You parrot back the right answer, but what did you write in your letter?
"Driving you crazy," eh?
"So worried that I could never face death" - was that it?
Coward!
I've never seen a worse soldier in ten years of service!
Obara admits his fault, sir.
That's not the answer your commander seeks!
Such effeminate ideas are more harmful than Red propaganda.
Even a Red will fight bravely when the time comes, but your kind surrenders before fighting.
WO Hino... see that he writes to his wife again.
Let him reaffirm his resolution.
" Tomie... your thinking is completely mistaken.
It's the duty of a Japanese wife to look after her mother-in-law in her husband's absence.
Please consider how your endless complaining interferes with the performance of my duties.
I'm very busy here.
Your bickering with my mother hinders me in my training.
It's my wish that you look after my mother, but if you feel this to be impossible,
I must ask you to leave my house."
Buck up, Obara!
We're only halfway there!
Come on!
Regulate your breathing!
This march ends your basic training.
Don't disgrace the whole squad!
Obara, don't give up!
Come on!
Keep going!
Somebody help him with his pack.
What kind of buddies are you?
Very well!
I'll help him.
You gonna let that happen?
Can you hold up your heads up if I do?
Lance Corporal, sir!
- I'll help him.
- Good!
Compassion for a buddy.
But if he still drops out, leave him.
A cart will pick him up.
Give me your blanket, pick, shovel, and tent.
You can handle the rest, right?
Sorry, Kaji.
Forgive me.
Hurry up!
Let me rest a while.
Your pack is 20 pounds lighter.
You don't need a rest!
You go on ahead.
I don't want you dropping out on my account.
Shut up and walk!
Quit now and all you've suffered will have been in vain.
We're almost done with basic.
Show some guts for once!
Obara, get up!
Get up, Obara!
It's no use.
Leave me behind.
I can't go on.
You'd let my help be for nothing?
Think what the senior soldiers will do to you, you fool!
It's no use.
Then to hell with you!
Be a quitter!
I'm going on!
Hate me all you want.
You quit before the fight was over.
But I won't quit!
You hear?
I'm going!
A bit fatigued, honorable recruits?
Bastard!
- Back a bit early, aren't you?
- Get up!
We've been waiting for you wretched dogs!
All you think about is food!
Stand up!
Stupid dog!
Pull yourself together!
Give 'em a shower!
Worthless scum!
Anyone who rides back on a cart isn't a man!
Don't you dogs have any balls?
If not, we can find a use for you.
Right, Obara?
Keep those fingers straight!
Get behind the gun rack and call out for customers.
"Hey, handsome, come on inside."
Go on.
Move it!
Show us how it's done.
The honorable Shosuke Obara What made the man go broke
He loved his morning baths, morning chasers and morning lays
It finally wore the poor man out
Get on with it.
Hey, mister, come in and have some fun.
Absolutely no sex appeal!
Hey, handsome, come on inside.
That's it.
Now beckon with your hands.
Say, handsome, come inside.
- Any takers for the lady?
- That's one I'd rather not mount.
Here's a customer.
Come on, keep it up!
Come on inside, handsome.
Want me to come in?
I haven't gotten any in a long time.
No objections to me buying this one?
We appreciate the business!
You stinking' shit!
You dog!
In the infantry, we don't ride home like a bunch of whores!
We walk!
You got that?
You should be grateful.
We never had it this easy!
You scum!
Worthless shit!
Why don't you go kill yourself?
Just returning the book I borrowed.
Get up!
Mind if I go to the latrine?
Don't be a fool!
You're on duty.
You're dead if they catch you.
Say I'm patrolling outside.
Do whatever you want.
We all have to die... sometime.
Is that a sign that I shouldn't?
Yes!
After all, one can die at any time.
Does that give you something to think about?
On your feet!
Attention!
Your morals are putrid!
You're like a bunch of stinking women!
This quitter who committed suicide... wasn't the only one at fault here.
It proves you're all rotten.
When did I ever train you to be like that?
What about it?
If you feel I didn't train you right, speak up!
All right.
Dismissed.
Do we stand guard over the corpse?
He's dead now.
He was a human being, after all.
That dog Obara jinxed us to the very end!
Say that again!
What's wrong?
Why so worked up?
Will you back me?
Don't do it.
They're all on edge over Obara's suicide.
You should have done it yesterday.
- Then why did you stop me?
Would you have stood a chance if you'd intervened?
I won't involve you, but I'll see this through.
Sir, I demand that PFC Yoshida be punished.
Demand?
That's no way to address your superiors.
Are you aware of the personal punishment he inflicted upon Obara yesterday?
I am not.
Not even a private 1st class is authorized to inflict such personal punishment upon a recruit.
But yesterday -
Hold it there!
Only dogs inform on others.
I'm not informing.
I'm demanding punishment.
Suicide is contrary to military discipline.
No matter the reason, there's no excuse.
Was Yoshida's action in accord with military discipline?
Forcing a helpless recruit to mimic a common harlot?
Silence!
You dog!
Regardless of what Yoshida did, this is all pure speculation on your part.
I don't claim it was the only reason... but it was the final humiliating blow.
Listen carefully.
A false step now could ruin your whole life.
I'm not concerned about myself.
What do you intend to do?
If you fail to adopt appropriate measures, I shall -
Spit it out!
It may be unwise, but there's no other way.
I'll be forced to take action myself.
You plan to make trouble, eh?
A personal feud could mean a stiff term in the guard house.
I won't be there alone.
Sir... please convey to PFC Yoshida that he'd better watch out for Kaji.
So you're implying that I indirectly caused my husband's death?
I can't honestly say otherwise.
I understand.
If only I hadn't written that letter.
It sounds cruel, but it's true.
I'm in a similar position.
I let him drop out during our march.
To help him walk would have meant dropping out myself.
If only I had quit with him -
The army recognizes no such reason for shirking one's duty.
When one drops out, what happens to him?
Please ask the warrant officer.
Quitters are the dredges of the military, a disgrace to their company.
Then my husband's suicide has doubled his shame?
I had hoped you'd understand.
Are there special ways of handling men who drop out?
No, nothing specific.
However, their promotions are delayed.
I just can't believe it!
My husband wasn't the type to do such a thing.
There must have been some reason.
Won't you tell me the truth?
A demoralized home front is the main reason.
Good soldiers only come from wholesome families.
I wouldn't probe too deeply.
Please try to see it like this.
A part of Obara died due to your feuding with your mother-in-law.
Another part died when I deserted him.
What was left -
That's enough!
You're dismissed.
Recruit Kaji leaving!
Is it true you're contemplating revenge on a superior out of personal enmity?
Answer me!
I have not breached military discipline, but PFC Yoshida has.
It's unfair to question me first.
You scum!
Is that any way to address the commander?
It's all right.
Let him speak.
Go ahead.
He inflicted unauthorized personal punishment of a vile nature after Obara dropped out from sheer fatigue.
I only ask why this goes unpunished.
- You were given an A in marching?
- Yes, sir.
- How were you treated that day?
- Very well, sir.
- Did Yoshida harass you?
- No, sir.
Would he have if you had dropped out?
I believe so, sir.
- Was Obara the only man punished?
- There were three men, sir.
- All by Yoshida?
- No, by others too.
Did all three commit suicide?
No, sir.
- Just Obara?
- Yes, sir.
Then why do you single out Yoshida?
Because Obara killed himself.
But I'm ready to press charges against the others too.
Silence!
It's clear you're out to get Yoshida and cause disorder in the unit.
Obara's death is merely an excuse.
By blaming a superior for a weak soldier's suicide, you undermine our finest military traditions.
I do not blame PFC Yoshida alone.
His actions only revealed the absurdity of conditions here.
That's why I demand his punishment.
Obara's death was not caused by domestic troubles.
Then what did cause it?
With your eloquence, I'm sure you can explain.
Tell me.
Answer me!
The basic cause... is the military itself.
You'd make a good private 1st class if you'd shut up!
Hashitani, teach him a lesson.
That's enough.
I'll warn you again:
Personal feuds are forbidden.
Violations will be treated as insubordination.
All right.
You may go.
Recruit Kaji leaving!
That one has guts.
His type make good soldiers.
WO Hino, I want him kept on the promotions list.
- Keep him on, sir?
- Yes.
Make sure he's well up on the list.
As his stars increase, his ideas will change.
Men are like springs.
The more pressure, the stronger they snap back.
It's best not to drive his kind too hard.
Put him on duty with the vets.
We're headed for the border in a few days anyway.
Thank you for your trying duties.
When did you come out here?
Today.
Half the guard's being replaced.
They keeping you out here?
Practically nothing but sentry duty.
That's just like WO Hino.
I admit it's effective.
I've about had it.
It's damn hot.
Take care of yourself.
They're wrong if they think they can wear me down.
What's that scoundrel Yoshida up to?
Don't do anything rash.
They're just waiting for an excuse to send you to prison.
So this is the real border!
You gonna try?
You coming along?
To the land of promise?
What'll you do over there?
That depends on them.
You believe unconditionally that true freedom can be found over there?
Not unconditionally.
It's all relative.
What use do they have for a deserter?
You'd be a mere tool.
A little tool in the service of their big promises.
You doubt that all races are equal?
I just don't share the same naive certainty.
What have the Japanese done?
Deserting the ranks of the invader doesn't prove the purity of your ideals.
You're still just a deserter.
What are you trying to say?
Prettier flowers blossoming on their soil... doesn't justify rejecting your own.
I could never do it.
This is WO Hino!
You hear me?
Send Kaji back immediately.
We need him for the intramural shooting match in two days.
Got that?
What?
I see.
They may not have plans to desert, but the danger definitely exists.
They were seen whispering together again last night.
Obara's death is shame enough for this company.
Have Shinjo transferred out at the first opportunity.
A signal flare!
It's close by!
Not that close.
Yes, it is.
Let's pick up a few merit points.
Come on.
I don't see anything.
You sure?
Might be farther away.
Damn!
Who goes there?
Stop or I'll shoot!
He was fishing.
You scared him and he ran off.
Does that prove he's innocent?
Son of a bitch!
You shot off that flare!
Confess!
I didn't!
I was just out fishing!
Please spare us!
He was really just fishing.
Shinjo, don't just stand there.
Take him to the guard post.
But if he's not the culprit -
Fool!
We'll make him the culprit.
That's ridiculous!
Do as I order you!
Forgive us!
Spare us!
What are you doing?
No, don't!
No!
Thanks for your troubles!
Kaji!
- There's mail from your wife.
- You've lost weight!
Have I?
I'm being sent out next week.
Was it rough?
Generally it shouldn't be too bad.
Three letters in three weeks.
Oh, and...
Obara's widow sent a letter to the entire squad.
What did she write?
She apologized for everything.
She also says the dead have no tongue, and she can't find out the truth about Obara's suicide.
Right?
What's that scoundrel Yoshida doing?
Five men for work duty!
At the storeroom.
One, two, three, four - still one short!
Kaji?
Obara would have made it five, PFC Yoshida!
Yoshida!
Shinjo's been called up before WO Hino for letting a spy escape.
Long time no see, Kaji.
You know your buddy's going to prison?
You're a disgrace to the Imperial Army!
Bannai shot the culprit anyway, so I'll let you off with the guard house.
I knew you'd end up there sooner or later.
Fire call!
Prairie fire!
Prairie fire!
Let's go!
Fan out to the right!
Move back to the left flank!
What the hell are you doing?
Move forward!
Careful, sir!
Hold your ground!
Move forward!
Start a backfire!
Retreat!
Everyone retreat!
Fall back!
Retreat!
Fall back!
Form a fire line where you are!
Stop!
Who's that?
Shinjo.
Deserter!
Sir, a deserter!
It's Shinjo, sir!
Cut that grass!
Kaji, wait!
It's too dangerous!
Stop!
Shinjo!
Shinjo, run for it!
Help me, Kaji!
Help me!
Yoshida, I'll save you if you'll make me a promise.
Can you hear me?
Admit to the CO that you made Obara commit suicide.
Can you hear me?
You're a lucky man.
You probably remember nothing.
We've shot you full of camphor.
I'm afraid it was too late for the other man.
He had hemorrhagic fever.
You were talking in your sleep, calling for Shinjo and a Michiko.
Your sweetheart?
Or your wife?
Both.
Who's been changing my bedpan?
Don't worry about that.
Just try to rest.
- Private Ishii?
- Yes.
- How many years of service?
- Three.
Well, you're not getting away with it!
Hey, medic... didn't you ever learn how to treat patients?
How long have you been in?
Three years, and still a private.
You may be a lance corporal, but don't try pulling rank.
What?
The slob took sputum from a TB patient to get shipped out.
Punishment should be per regulations.
We don't need people shouting in the middle of the night here.
Private Tange, eh?
Very well.
We'll see who has the last laugh.
PRIVATE TANGE
Don't overexert yourself.
They'll have you up and working soon anyway.
No point rushing things.
Patients get work detail too?
A rookie, eh?
Have a seat.
What was your profession, Honorable Veteran?
Forget the "honorable veteran" stuff.
I was a latheman, and a good one.
Weren't you guys exempted from service?
There are some guys it's safer to keep in the army.
Is that right?
Yes, it is.
You there!
Since when did you start walking?
No one does anything here without authorization.
I'm practicing my walking, nurse.
Hon. Head Nurse!
Sorry, Hon. Head Nurse!
I was practicing walking.
What's so funny?
Lance Cpl. Minakami... this ward lacks discipline.
Army hospitals aren't playgrounds.
Tighten things up!
Try that again and you've had it.
They say Roosevelt's in Russia talking to Stalin.
If Germany surrenders, that leaves only Japan.
Yes, the end is drawing near.
But if the Russians enter the war -
Kaji.
Private Tange's being sent back to his unit.
When?
Tomorrow.
That's terrible.
It's bad news, isn't it?
Sent back to his unit, eh?
No one can ever know what will happen tomorrow.
Your unit's been ordered to the front.
They'll probably keep you here on hospital duty.
Really?
Even in here, there's always more bad news than good.
There was so much I wanted to discuss with you.
We'll meet again somewhere.
You can always meet those you really wish to.
Someone once told me that true human beings will always find kindred spirits.
You're proof of that.
Don't give me too much credit.
But I appreciate your words.
More work for you.
Writing to your wife?
But I don't dare write the truth.
Because of the censors?
Not just that.
Everything I write ends up as a half-truth.
I want her to know how lonely I am, but I don't want to worry her.
What's more, as much as I detest army life,
I actually want to stay here as long as I can.
Is it that nice here?
There are things here you don't get at the front.
For instance?
For instance... talking to you.
And now... stay back.
The steam is hot.
Is it all right for you to be here?
I probably shouldn't be.
Nurse Tokunaga, why did you leave your post?
What's the meaning of this misconduct?
A rendezvous in broad daylight - while on duty!
Rendezvous?
Forgive me, but there's been no misconduct.
I asked Nurse Tokunaga to assist me.
A patient issuing orders to a nurse?
That's as bad as a rendezvous!
Hon. Head Nurse, I came of my own accord.
No excuses!
Get back to your post!
As you are outside my authority, I shall report this to your superiors.
It seems I repaid your kindness with injury.
You're being sent to the front because of me.
It's all right.
We had to part sooner or later.
We may even meet again somewhere.
I believe we will, whatever the odds.
You can always meet those you really wish to.
PART 4
Class-A fortifications with log-barrel cannons.
Must be the "scarecrow strategy."
This stinks!
Five years' artillery training, and they give us peashooters.
Let's put that one to old Commander Yamada.
Attention!
Is there a Private Kaji in this squad?
Yes, sir.
It's been a long time, Kaji.
So you're still alive?
At ease!
I am 2nd Lt. Kageyama.
I'm taking over your training as of today.
Who goes there?
Who goes there?
Firefly.
Snow.
Sounds of gun tractors or tanks for 10 minutes.
Otherwise all is in order, sir.
Good work.
What's that?
Probably a festival.
They shot off fireworks.
Doesn't make sense.
The fighting in Europe must have ended.
Germany must have surrendered.
A new batch of recruits arrives soon.
I want you to assist me in their training.
In what way?
The new men range from 20 to 44 years old.
Half active service, the remainder untrained.
Artillery men are a rough bunch.
They'd tear these men to shreds.
Basic is like that anywhere.
That's why I need your help.
Count me out.
I told you I gave up guarding the army's sheep.
I've reported that you're my assistant in the rifle squad.
I'll see that you make private 1st class.
Think you can bait me with a promotion?
No, I know I can't.
I just figured you could spare those recruits a lot of grief.
Need I say more?
I'll accept your proposal... on one condition.
What's that?
I want radical changes in squad composition.
And the training officer has agreed to separate the recruits from the veterans?
He has.
Hon. Squad Leader, if you approve, the company commander will as well.
Sure it's not just to keep the veterans off your own back?
That's part of it, but not all.
Many of the new untrained recruits are in their 40s.
Excessively rough treatment in the barracks would make it difficult for them to learn anything.
From my own days in basic I remember one case of suicide.
It's our duty to weed out such weaklings.
Training alone won't make men strong.
I'll work them hard during training but show them kindness in the barracks.
What would a two-year man like you know?
You have to put the screws on from the start to teach them what army life is really like.
So, PFC Kaji, you're the new assistant?
That is correct.
What will you teach them?
Just what I was taught.
And what were you taught?
Since you were picked as assistant, you must know a lot.
But there's one thing you have yet to learn.
Masui... teach the lad.
What could a mere private like me teach PFC Kaji?
Don't try to act big around me!
How long have you served?
I'll show you how artillery trains its men!
Cannon No. 1 loaded!
Kaji-san, you're a private 1st class in the infantry.
You could give Masui a beating if you wanted.
So our presence would interfere with training your recruits?
Want to lord it over them all alone, eh?
Won't let anyone lay a finger on your precious recruits, eh?
Then get ready for what you've got coming!
Open your mouth.
Wider!
Now listen carefully!
I didn't plug your ears, so you should be able to hear.
The pheasant that cries is apt to be killed.
This one won't cry anymore, the poor sap.
This is what you get for slighting the veterans.
When your beloved rookies arrive, forget the codes and manuals and teach them that!
Who'll save their hides under fire?
Not your codes or manuals, but the vets.
The same ones showing you such affection now.
Remember that!
The lieutenant!
What's going on here?
Take that slipper out of your mouth!
Take it out.
I'll overlook this whole matter... but only this once.
Such behavior will not be tolerated!
Nice young kid.
Thank you for everything.
- Get your men settled in?
- Yes, sir.
The vets may have grumbled, but you got your way, even if it meant eating that slipper.
I want to train men who'll be willing to die with me.
How many men will the rifle squad get?
Twenty on light machine guns and 20 on mortars.
Well, are you tired out?
Is the border close to the enemy?
The enemy?
Yes, very close.
Then this is the very front line.
I can boast to Father.
What does he do?
He's an officer.
A major.
Worried about your kid?
I'm not the only one.
I'll be all right, sir.
Sir...
I'm gonna carry a picture, okay?
Watch the casual language.
What kind of picture?
Of a girl.
Sure.
Most pictures are of girls or boys.
- I told you.
- His is different.
It's a naked woman.
A good luck charm?
Something like that.
It'll never pass inspection.
Better sew it into your loincloth.
Listen here:
Use formal language when addressing veterans besides myself.
If they hear "ain't" or "gonna,"
you'll get a beating you'll never forget.
Understand?
With eager face and eager voice
My wife and children urge me on to great deeds
Come here.
A little early to go around with loose buttons.
Words don't seem to teach you men anything.
I'll be more careful.
May I have it back, please?
No, you may not.
You can come for it later.
The button must have worked itself loose.
Go to the veterans' room and don't waver.
Be prepared for a beating.
Go get it back.
You'll have to handle this yourself.
Recruit Koizumi to retrieve his button!
Enter!
- What's that?
Your button?
- It was my fault.
Tashiro did it!
He pushed me!
What?
You dog!
Look at what they serve the veterans.
Don't tell me you scooped it up off the ground with those dainty hands you wipe your ass with!
Who cut our ration?
Why do you keep blaming me?
Tashiro, stop playing innocent!
What's that?
Cut it out!
Why fight over it now?
What should I do?
What should you do?
Hon. Lance Corporal, what should he do?
How about another helping from the kitchen?
No real hurry.
We'll wait.
Very well!
Dump the food back in the bucket.
Azumi, when that's done, take it to the vets.
We'll eat just rice.
It's better than nothing.
Take this!
Is that how Kaji taught you?
No, it was all my own mistake.
You polish your boots sitting on your ass?
What did you do, Enji?
Ah, the Honorable Assistant.
Kaji, how'd you teach your men to shine their boots?
- I was at fault.
- Shut your mouth!
How about it, Kaji?
I've yet to give them any special instructions.
He did teach us.
I was at fault.
You keep quiet.
I'll see that they're taught correctly.
Please forgive him.
Fine.
I'll stand by and watch how you teach him.
Hit him!
I understand you're opposed to striking your recruits.
I cannot do it.
Shall I show you how?
Like this!
Sir, strike me!
You're through here.
Go!
Son of a bitch!
It's not because I took a beating.
I want orders forbidding all corporal punishment of recruits.
I'd go along with you if we were stationed further back.
But it's different here.
The vets may be louts, but they can stand on their own two feet.
If I lost control over them, what would happen in battle?
I'd place my recruits and myself at your command.
In actual combat...
I couldn't trust you half as much as I trust those men.
Those jaded five-year vets wouldn't listen to a 2nd lieutenant fresh from the academy.
I understand, sir!
Just a minute.
Michiko wrote me.
I told her you were here with me.
She can't understand why you so rarely write, since you must be enjoying more freedom here.
More freedom, eh?
Want to read it?
Just give me the gist.
She's relieved.
Figures you have it easy under my command.
She has a lot to learn.
She asked me to keep an eye on you.
Be careful, Kaji.
Don't twist her words to support your own position.
Fool!
She's praying that our worthless lives might be spared, hoping against hope that you'll survive.
She repeats that over and over.
I'm sorry.
You're an officer.
You can write to her.
If you send a reply, here's what you should say:
"Kaji will not die.
No matter what happens, he'll make it out alive."
Please tell her that.
2nd Lt. Kageyama.
Okinawa has fallen, but we have the main island.
The 2.5 million soldiers waiting there -
- It's too late to pray for miracles.
- We're not!
Our strategy aims at final victory.
We all like to think so.
Though the home front expects the tide to turn, our men are being wiped out.
That's the true picture.
Meaning they died in vain?
Depends on how you look at it.
- Why, you -
- Calm down!
Save your heroism for your soldiers.
He who shouts loudest isn't always the bravest.
2nd Lt. Kageyama.
Aren't you making a mistake?
Japan's not as feeble as you might think.
From the Aleutians to Australia, from Tarawa to India,
Japan has pressed the battle across thousands of miles.
A pessimist like you can't begin to grasp her strength.
Yes, we've had to draw back our battle lines.
We've lost Okinawa and face battle on our mainland.
But that's all part of our basic strategy.
Look how the enemy doesn't yet dare attack our main island.
Their supply lines grow longer as our units grow more ready and compact.
Our main forces at home are still intact.
Our Pacific losses are like a single hair off the hide of a bull.
Can't you understand that?
- I understand.
- What do you understand?
That I'll probably die here.
And 2nd Lt. Nonaka... so will you.
What's going to happen to us?
If the Japanese lose -
Nonsense!
Japan will never lose.
It's un-Japanese to even consider it!
Un-Japanese?
It's only natural to be concerned about oneself.
Tucking your tails just 'cause we lost Okinawa!
You have no dedication!
PFC Kaji pampers you!
As far as I'm concerned, he's -
I'm what?
Afraid to say it to my face?
You've said nothing to us about the fall of Okinawa.
We need a pep talk.
We need faith in our ultimate victory.
You seem to love ultimate victory even more than food.
Personally, I love my wife more than ultimate victory.
You may consider that unmanly.
But when fighting starts,
I'll be the only one you can count on.
Hey, where's your salute?
Hold it!
You call that a salute?
Hon. Squad Leader!
I alone was at fault.
Let me alone be punished.
Save your breath.
Nice work, Hon. Squad Leader.
Mind taking over here?
Sir, spare the others!
Just shut up and keep it up!
- Hon. Squad Leader!
- Shut your trap!
Sir!
Naruto, shut up!
I'm taking it too.
You'll keep it up until he says you can stop... even if the commander says otherwise.
Got that?
You dog!
Get up or I'll whack you one!
Who's that?
Enji?
I'm sorry, sir.
When we were rookies, we kept this up for an hour.
Naruto!
Drinking after hours and raising hell!
You damned NCOs!
Scum!
You dare defy us?
Dog!
We'll murder you!
Yeah?
Just try it!
You're in for a surprise.
Son of a bitch!
I've been in and out of worse places.
Throw me in your guard house - I don't care!
Naruto, they'll throw you in prison!
Out of my way!
What have you got to brag about?
You've never earned an honest meal in your lives!
To hell with all of you!
Sir, please leave this to me.
I'll assume custody of him.
Insubordination and insulting a superior.
What will happen?
Can you help him?
If the CO feels that locking up a recruit would disgrace the company...
Please try to convince him.
Salute the duty officer!
Eyes right!
Front!
Cpl. Takeda and command of eight men have duly transferred guard duties to Cpl. Fujimoto and command.
Out!
Was it tough?
Sorry to concern you.
It was only three days.
They're all waiting.
Naruto's back!
Go on inside.
Naruto, was it rough?
PFC Kaji, come here!
Some training you're giving your recruits.
Our men are worn out from guard duty.
What are your men doing?
I'm sorry.
I happened to be out.
That's no excuse!
You'd better teach them right.
And stop acting big because you're a PFC!
Take that!
Kaji... get ready!
You scum!
Get up!
Well, how do you like being sacrificed for your precious recruits?
That's enough, Akaboshi.
Let's see you do that again, Akaboshi.
Come on!
I'll cut you wide open!
Don't think I won't do it.
Pride and face mean nothing to me now.
Come on!
You filthy -
Wait!
Filthy braggarts!
Don't tell me you're afraid of one two-year man.
I'll swap my life for one of you stinking worms!
Wait, Kaji!
Afraid to fight man-to-man?
Sir!
Naruto, let me go!
- Sir!
- Let me go!
Don't you rats ever forget:
I'll get even with you someday!
Sir... next time let me lend a hand.
Tashiro will help too.
Thanks, but that would never do.
Why not?
We'd all be called up for mutiny.
We'll fight it in court.
We'd be sure to lose.
Naruto... we can't win right now.
Maybe we could give those vets a good licking... but they're not the real enemy.
Our real enemy... is the army.
Prepare for roll call!
Sir, don't get up.
I want Lt. Kageyama to get a good look at my face.
Roll call!
Attention!
First squad:
Total 36.
Absent: 4.
Present: 32.
Count off!
Unnumbered: 1.
Sick room: 4.
All accounted for.
Emergency orders for this squad.
PFC Kaji and 28 recruits will depart at 19:00 hrs.
Tomorrow for trench-digging detail.
You'll march at night to maintain secrecy.
You'll join Cpl. Hironaka's command on site.
Work detail:
Approximately one month.
This is a cowardly trick... sending me out with a work party to avoid friction with the vets.
Look at that way if you wish.
You may think you've rid the company of its cancerous growth, but I'll be back in a month... probably more malignant than ever.
I don't think so.
When you get back,
I'm sending you away for special training.
Sending the prodigal son out for a few knocks in the harsh world?
To South Manchuria.
Maybe even close to Michiko.
Why stay here at the front if you have a chance to get away?
You agree?
You and I still have unfinished business.
You avoided the issue, while I pushed a little too hard.
Neither of us accomplished anything.
You're a clever man, but picking the army as the stage for your battles was a fool's work.
It's wiser to play it safe than to be stubborn.
Will you do this clever fool a favor?
The mother hen's leaving half her brood behind.
It causes her some concern.
My absence may make it easier to keep the vets in line.
Can I count on you?
Don't be such a pessimist.
If you must worry, worry about your wife.
You must be all out.
Take them.
Sir, please come back to us.
It's only a month.
I get the strange feeling I'm being stranded.
You and I here together makes some people nervous.
Neither of us is very patient.
Naruto, watch that temper.
Take any trouble to Lt. Kageyama, you hear?
Work party, fall in!
Attention!
Salute the honorable lieutenant!
Eyes center!
Front!
PFC Kaji and party now departing!
Right face!
Forward... march!
Here comes our water!
Sir!
Take a look.
Good work.
Well done.
Feels like I'm building my own house.
Yes, I suppose you'd want to fight in here if possible.
I could battle fate with an easy mind here.
I see.
Sir, that bum wants to bring his mother and girlfriend to live here.
You idiot!
Your mother might want to sleep between you and your bride!
Are you engaged?
When the war's over, let Naruto build you a love nest.
He's a carpenter.
He'll be glad to.
Nakai, you can help handle his mother.
I'll help handle the bride anytime!
Sir, you've never told us about your wife.
She's a good wife.
You'll all have to meet her after the war.
Is she tall or short?
Medium build.
About 5'2 ", 105 Ibs.
- Just my size!
- Fool!
Work party, fall in!
On the double!
Listen carefully!
At dawn today, our Seiundai fortifications were attacked by heavy Soviet forces.
It seems Major Ushijima and all his men died a glorious death.
The enemy is advancing inland along the entire Manchurian border.
We are to return immediately to barracks to await reassignment.
We are to construct fortifications along the new line of defense, where we shall meet and crush the advancing enemy!
Disperse!
Hit the dirt!
A reconnaissance plane.
Nonaka Platoon, listen carefully.
Those without rifles will lash their bayonets to birch staffs for use in close combat.
Don't we get rifles?
Birch breaks too easily to be of much use.
Is it my fault it's all that grows here?
We're moving out!
Break camp!
Prepare to depart in 10 minutes!
Volunteers to go pick up our weapons!
Tashiro to the supply depot for weapons!
Very well.
Be careful.
We're moving out!
Break camp!
We leave in one hour!
Sir... what's happening with our command unit?
These conflicting orders confuse and demoralize our troops.
Do your griping to the CO!
This is war!
Where's Doi Company?
Over here!
Hironaka Squad?
Over here!
What happened?
We're worn out.
Did you come from Seiundai?
There weren't any survivors there!
Only Onodera managed to sneak away.
I didn't sneak away.
I was sent out with a message.
What's the difference?
Why so angry?
At least you got out alive.
Recruits, bring us some food!
What happened at Seiundai?
We got wiped out, including all your precious recruits.
Russian shells suddenly started whistling overhead.
And Lt. Kageyama?
Killed in action.
Aircraft approaching from the north!
Let's go!
Platoon... halt!
Fall out!
You'll find no loot around here.
Where's the senior officer?
Good question.
Hey, you know where he is?
Probably giving his girl a final workover.
In that case, Sergeant, will you issue orders for weapons?
Sorry, sir, but I'm not authorized to issue orders.
You'll need orders from HQ.
Where's the phone?
I'll talk to HQ.
Right there.
What's wrong with this thing?
The bombings cut the lines.
Sir, shall I liberate more candy from the canteen?
Good idea.
Stay where you are!
Traitors!
I'll kill you all!
I'm taking the rifles on my authority.
300 men can't possibly dig 1.5 miles of trenches in 48 hours.
You think the enemy will wait while you finish?
Instead of ineffective half measures, we should stop up the valleys with trenches and concentrate on strengthening our fortifications.
When you're the strategy officer, you can do it your way.
You're stationed in Area C, I believe?
I'm sorry to say this, but for strategic reasons, your area will suffer heavy casualties.
I'm not saying this to protect myself.
The task is simply impossible.
Even if I order you?
Lieutenant Doi... proceed with the work.
Yes, sir.
But the Hon. Staff Officer must remember that some areas will not be finished.
Should those breaches prove fatal, I cannot be held responsible.
To hell with your family.
The fate of Japan is at stake.
If we lose, we'll have no homes!
Easy for you to say with no family.
Even if we lose, if I survive, my wife has a future.
If parents survive, the kids have a chance to grow up.
It's not them.
You're just afraid to die.
That's enough, Terada.
You're always arguing with everybody.
Because they only think of themselves, not our country.
You're not afraid to die?
I am not.
I see.
Well, I am.
I thought you'd say that.
Now that we're in combat, may I speak my mind?
Go ahead.
You hate me because my father's a major.
That can't be helped.
But you defend this cowardly scum because you're critical of this war.
It's all right.
Let him talk.
Yes, I am critical of it.
I sold my soul for a military exemption.
I can't approve of how your father raised you.
So you mean you reject this war completely?
I mean I should have rejected it.
Then you're a coward with a split personality!
You've had your chance to speak.
Now it's my turn.
You're a fool!
A simpleton who wouldn't understand why his mother would shed tears if he was killed in action.
To die here is a dog's death.
Even you'll understand that someday, if you survive.
Here come our rifles!
Command squad leader Cpl. Hironaka.
Light machine gun squad, PFC Iwabuchi.
Rifle squad, PFC Kaji.
Antitank suicide squad, PFC Akaboshi.
At ease!
Attention!
Lt. Nonaka will assume command of Platoon III.
The enemy attack will presumably commence at dawn.
Each man will dig a foxhole by midnight in the spot designated by his squad leader and prepare to meet the enemy.
PFC Kaji.
You will take a scouting party and ascertain the location of the enemy.
You'll rejoin this main party before sundown.
Takasugi and Terada, step forward.
Ready ammunition!
This is ridiculous!
After five years of training, they want me crawling under tanks!
I'll bet you recruits don't want to die either.
Well, don't look to me.
You're on your own.
Your report conflicts with the others.
Did you penetrate deeply enough to confirm?
I did, sir.
Can your two men confirm the 15 tanks?
I left them behind the embankment, sir.
Why?
We were ordered to remain behind until called.
And he didn't call you?
- I did not, sir.
- Why not?
Recruits are not trained in scouting tactics.
Very considerate of you.
You never got close enough to confirm those tanks.
Coward!
I'm scared out of my wits.
This waiting's getting on my nerves.
It's already decided who will live and who will die.
It's just a few hours till dawn.
We're like condemned men awaiting execution.
There's white cloth in my foxhole.
It must be a grave.
There are no graves here.
It has to be a grave.
It must be filled with crumbling bones.
Stop driving yourself crazy!
You're not a child anymore.
Please let me change places with someone.
Sir...
I'll swap with him.
No!
You'll soon be glad to hide under corpses.
Why worry about a grave?
Terada, go join Cpl. Hironaka as orderly and runner.
Well, the end has come.
Orders may not be heard above the din of battle.
Each of you must think for himself.
There are just two things I want to say.
Don't be a coward.
Like it or not, what comes will come.
The other thing is:
Never give up.
Not for the sake of victory, but for yourself.
If things get too hot, take cover and think about home... or your girl.
That's what I plan to do.
Nakai, you got that girl in your loincloth?
Of course!
Good.
Hang on to her.
They're coming!
Send up the signal flare!
Lt. Nonaka, prepare for action.
Nonaka Platoon, every man to his station.
Hold your fire.
Commence firing at 300.
Distance 800.
Fire!
Blast 'em!
Wipe 'em all out!
Hold your fire!
Save your ammo!
To your right, 400!
Fire!
Get those tanks!
Rifle squad... when the big guns open up, keep your heads down!
Lhara!
Sir!
What is it?
Tanks closing in on our rear!
Where's the CO?
- Over there!
I'm going!
Wait!
They're still firing.
I'll be okay.
Fire!
Keep your heads down!
Sir!
Koizumi...
Mimura...
Our only alternative is to attack.
Send a runner to the CO.
Ask what he plans to do.
Terada, take the message!
Terada relaying the message!
I'm out of ammo, sir!
Azumi, you got ammo?
Let me have some.
No, I'm short too.
You're not even firing!
Fine, keep it!
I'm out of ammo, sir!
I warned you about wasting it.
Here.
Wait!
Stay here.
We'll fire together.
Commander!
Where's that runner?
Enemy troops to our rear!
We're trapped!
We all feel safer with you here, sir.
And I want to send you home safe to your mothers.
Enji!
I'm out of ammo, sir!
I'll take him some.
You'll go?
I'm out.
Ammo!
I'll be right back.
No, if you go, stay there.
Make every bullet count, okay?
Get ready.
I'll cover you.
Go!
Tashiro!
Nakai, stay down!
Tashiro!
Sons of bitches!
Lieutenant, should we retreat?
Fool!
Long live the Japanese empire!
You fool, come back!
Terada, what are you doing?
Where's the tank?
It's gone.
Does it hurt?
They'll come back for us again.
The major's son fought bravely.
You just might make it through this.
I'll sear your wound.
Close your eyes.
Rifle squad!
Rifle squad, show yourselves!
Anyone there?
I refuse to die.
- What'll we do?
- One final charge.
A final charge?
Watch out, Kaji!
Onodera.
Will we make it?
They coming this way?
- You got a grenade?
- No.
If we have to, we jump at 'em.
Please save me!
Are they gone?
Are they?
- Quiet!
They're still up there.
Stop shooting!
He'll get us all killed!
- Stop shooting!
- I got him in the leg!
The battle's over.
No, it's not!
I'm gonna attack!
If you wanna die like a dog, go ahead.
What do we do now?
We were lucky to come through it alive.
Let's try and stay that way.
All right, we get it!
We know how tough you are.
Stop showing off!
You don't know the Kwangtung Army!
He's raving mad!
Pin him down, Kaji!
Come on, you damned Ruskies!
I'll chop you up!
Onodera, it's too dangerous!
Quiet!
You don't know how tough I am!
Quiet or we'll all be killed!
Onodera, be quiet!
Be quiet!
What happened?
He's dead.
I won't claim I put him out of his misery.
I killed him!
You didn't have to kill him.
Do you blame me?
Do you?
I'm a monster!
But I'm going to stay alive!
Is anyone there?
Isn't anyone left alive?
Answer me!
Is anyone else still alive?

THIRD PART
All's well sir!
Salute!
All is well, sir.
Salute!
Jan. 23rd, 20:00 hrs.
Temperature: 32 degrees below Zero.
Here he comes!
Recruits feigning sleep, eh?
There is no sleep until I do my rounds.
Seems to be in order.
Recruits... out of bed!
Turn on the light.
Get ready for what's coming!
Fools!
Well... did it hurt?
Not at all!
What brought that on?
Well... how about it?
Don't know!
What?
I don't know Sir!
You don't know?
Well, I'll show you.
That's why!
Since do you use this watertank as an ash tray?
Speak up!
The duty officer ordered all tanks... to be kept full with clean water.
We are aware of that.
Who was on duty today?
Step forward!
Remove your glasses.
Get up!
Obara did refill the tank
I removed the ash trays after "Taps".
You're insinuating that... one of your superiors smoked after "Taps"?
Kaji!
Are you trying to place the blame on your superiors?
No!
I only said that Obara was not at fault.
Watch your language!
Obara admits his neglect.
Of course!
Why didn't you say so?
It was my fault.
I'll be more careful.
It's too late for that!
Owaku...going somewhere?
To change the water.
Don't!
That's not up to you.
Kaji!
You dare upset Superior Pvt. Bannai?
- I didn't upset him.
- We demand discipline!
Who taught you insubordination?
Your friend, Shinjo, perhaps?
College logic or reason won't help
You get along in this army.
Any more arguments?
Superior Pvt. Bannai...
let me handle this.
Sure!
You'll report me later.
Are you blind?
See that target?
I can see it.
You lack concentration.
Take careful aim.
Pretend it's an enemy.
What's wrong with Obara?
Can't he see straight?
Draw the bead carefully onto the target below center.
Stop breathing!
Apply pressure on the trigger and now...squeeze.
Idiot!
No luck!
We'll never get to eat at this rate.
Always his fault, too!
Shut up, you hick!
Stay out of this.
What's going on there?
Stop acting like starved mongrels.
Kaji!
Come here and show Obara.
Hit the target with eyes closed.
eyes closed?
That's right!
You should be able to at least hit the target.
Objective... the target!
Position... prone!
Obara!
Watch how he aims and squeezes the trigger.
You see.
Obara... bad eye-sight is no excuse.
Try it again.
Obara, try to relax.
Don't jerk the trigger.
Squeeze down on it.
Don't try to rush it calmly!
You're better off dead!
A disgrace to the whole Kwangtung Army.
Listen carefully, Obara
The army demands men of responsibility.
Because you missed your shot, a grenade could wipe out your squad.
Consider the disgrace!
The target on the double!
Kaji, you go with him.
Bayonet attack
Charge!
Down!
Obara, stop sniffling!
Forward!
"At the time, Kaji was trying to save the lives of innocent Chinese.
This earned him the hatred of the KEMPEITAI.
They arrested and grilled him without mercy.
Then he was released 20 days later if my husband had been guilty, would they have released him?
I fervently hope that this unfortunate incident will not compromise his position
as a member of your unit.
As the wife of a private, 2nd. cl., I address this appeal to you.
A recruit's life is strenuous enough without this added disadvantage".
Orderly!
Where's the orderly?
Entering!
Orderly, sir!
Call Warrant Officer Hino.
Salute the W.O.!
Eyes center!
Front!
Sup.
Pvt. Yamazaki now relieved of guard duty, sir.
Thank you for a job well done.
Don't worry about me.
Mind your own chores.
Thank you.
We're very grateful.
Can I wash anything for you?
A willing worker, eh?
I preferred a beating to washing.
Let's say, I have very little choice.
You're not a Pvt. ad infinitum like me.
You're top among the recruits.
But you're still being watched.
I realize that.
They can't tolerate a Red leading the pack.
They'll break you yet.
Can't even talk without being watched.
Any new reports on Pvt. 2nd Cl.
Kaji?
You have information, sir?
I asked if you had.
None, sir, but I have him under surveillance.
How does Sgt. Hashitani feel?
He's giving Kaji sniper training, sir.
- He's a goods marksman?
- An unerring eye, sir.
And his barrack routine?
Nothing to report.
Friendly with Shinjo?
They seem intimate, but...
They seem?
You don't know?
They're both black listed by the KEMPEITAI.
They have no time to do any plotting.
Why not?
I've kept Shinjo on guard duty straight through.
Keep an eye on them.
They'll show their true color, soon.
Might even turn into a good soldier.
Salute!
At ease!
Afternoon training program is cancelled.
Arms inspection will take place.
Make sureyour arms are spotless.
After dark there will be sentry duty training.
Followed by dawn attack training.
I know you'll pleased to know that.
Owaku, a letter for you.
Kaji.
Obara.
Nothing but inspections!
Kaji, your wife again?
Read it out loud.
I like to hold off as long as I can.
You know... you have a good wife.
Compared to the bitch I got!
Obara!
Will things ever become easier for us?
It won't be much longer.
I'm tired of this whole mess.
Well, don't start getting ideas.
It's all beyond me.
Some bad news from home?
My mother and wife are still fighting.
My wife is threatening to leave home.
But she's not leaving you.
You wouldn't understand you've been lucky.
If she walks out, it would mean my aging mother will be alone.
Back bone, it's your choice.
Can't have it both ways.
You're doing it wrong, remove it.
You've broken it, you dumb cluck!
You fool!
You broke mine!
You fool.
I'm not taking the rap for you.
That's enough, Kubo.
It won't help any.
You stay out of this!
What's it to you anyway?
Everybody here knows you're a filthy Red.
So what?
Nobody wants anything to do with you.
Hit me!
Do what you want with me.
Start distributing.
Start now!
Pvt. 1st Cl.
Shinjo!
He's here, alone.
Pvt. 1st Cl.
Shinjo together with two recruits will clean out the latrines.
Good luck!
Under whose orders?
By orders of Sgt. Soga.
All the dirty work for me?
Shut up, Shinjo!
Is a three-year man too good to clean latrines?
Tell sergeant or W.O. Hino, if you prefer, that I'll do it myself.
I'm not taking any recruits.
Shinjo, why not take them along?
Carting the crap won't be easy.
You recruits go with him.
Kaji, aren't you going with him?
You're two of a kind.
Kubo, you come with us.
You can't order me.
That's it... fight!
The liquor will be here soon.
Come on, one more!
Get moving.
Kaji to latrine duty!
Tanoue to latrine duty!
That's a nice old boy!
They're making things tough for us.
The other night, I suddenly realized how haggard you looked.
On duty straight through.
I envy your stamina, Kaji.
I can't move much more of this.
They're waiting to get rid of me the easy way.
Salute!
- We are on duty.
- Good.
Hatching any new plots?
A few stinking propositions.
Honorable Duty Noncommissioned Officer, has the Commanding Officer approved our assignments?
I wouldn't know!
Ask WO Hino.
I'll do that.
One more question.
What happens if I refuse to go on duty?
When such duty assignments are unfair, of course.
I suggest you read the Army Penal Code.
That's asking for trouble.
Kaji,
I don't care about going home but I do want to get out of here.
What do you mean?
I'm not quite sure myself.
I just want to get away to some unknown place,
and start all over again.
Is there such a place?
Desertion means immediate recapture
There's only one way.
Is the border far off?
Not very far.
It's just beyond the swamplands.
The swamp could mean death.
Which would you choose?
The land where people are promised freedom or the land where your wife awaits you?
I promised her that we'd start out on life anew.
You expect to get out alive?
I don't know.
But I hope to.
A personnel move.
Another transfer?
They can't move me after four years here.
It's already decided.
Who is it?
Kaji, lend me your Penal Code.
Don't let them bother you.
Why the Penal Code?
Kaji.
What did you just say to Shinjo?
Nothing.
You didn't?
You mean he spoke to you and you didn't reply?
Hon. Sup.
Pvt., have I done anything wrong?
You'd like to know?
What did you say?
Be careful!
A beating is no way to celebrate this festive day.
I told him not to read as he seemed tired.
Hear that?
Telling a three-year man what to do!
So dear Shinjo is tired, eh?
Hey, Shinjo!
I know you must be fatigued, but may I aska question?
He didn't hear me.
I'll clean out his ear.
A fight means trouble for us both.
I was instructed to read this Code by Sgt. Soga.
To learn how to refuse an order without be insubordinate.
At ease!
What happened?
Pvt. 1st Cl.
Shinjo, sir!
He was taken suddenly ill.
Does that account for the broken China?
Clean it up!
Salute!
It was rash of you to come out here.
There's no place for you to stay.
What will you do?
If I am able to meet him,
I have no other concern.
The next train leaves tomorrow.
Will you sleep outdoors?
Or do you plan to walk all night?
If you let me see him, I'm willing to walk home.
Tanoue, leaving to polish boots!
Is Kaji here?
Step into the office.
You have a visitor.
- A visitor?
- Who is it?
A dame, no less!
Damn!
Come, Kaji, hurry up or someone might swipe her.
Why worry about us?
Go ahead!
I'll wipe off your rifle.
Kaji, to the office.
Damn!
Coming all the way out here to see him.
Entering!
Kaji reporting!
You want something?
What did you want?
Kaji leaving!
Wait there!
A disgrace to military discipline!
Don't let your wife make you homesick.
You are authorized to pass the night with your wife within the limits of the company storeroom.
I finally had to come.
How did you ever make it?
I've changed, haven't I?
It's that trying?
I'm used to it now.
The cold makes it worse.
We went hunting today.
I'll get some fresh meat for us later.
You've lost no weight
I'm relieved.
There's so little I can offer you.
I'm only a private.
Look at me.
I am.
You don't need to worry.
I'll fight my way through this.
How much time did they give us?
Until morning.
That's worse than when I left home.
Then it is all right?
Entering!
Sasa with our Hon. Leader's meal!
Madam.
This meat is fresh bagged by Kaji.
Dine hearty and enjoy yourself.
Thanks.
My husband is much indebted to you.
We're all in the same boat here.
An unbelievable place, the army!
But Kaji, he's a fortunate rascal.
No other woman would think of coming this far to see her man.
I mustn't tarry.
I hope you don't think I'm asking too much but would you write to my wife and tell her to get smart like you, and come out to see me?
All she thinks about is eating and sleeping; nothing else.
Tell her things are rough out here and would she butter up my superiors?
Good luck
Sasa leaving!
Come, let's eat.
A rookie allowed to spend the night with his wife!
The army is no more!
It's not nice, Kaji, to monopolize the pleasures.
Please.
Want blankets?
Stick to her in the clinches.
That'll keep you warm.
All right!
I'll make do.
In each other's arms, eh?
Curse the blasted luck!
As long as we're alive, we'll be able to meet again.
I came here confident that I would get to see you.
Since you left,
Sgt. Watai has been pestering me to let him read through your letters.
Nasty fellow!
He thinks you're planning to desert
Well, what if I do?
Where to?
Across the border.
There's a man in my squad named Shinjo.
He's still a Pvt. 1st Class.
His brother was arrested for Communistic leanings and his girlfriend left him.
He insists there's a better world beyond that border.
A better world?
It's a world where mean are treated like human beings.
And you you intend to escape there all by yourself?
You wouldn't!
Not while you still have me.
The WO said you were a good soldier.
But they're watching your every move.
I won't run away never!
I'll fight my way out.
You mustn't run away!
Come back to me.
Guard post, all is well!
You are relieved.
I duly take over.
Forward!
March!
Breakstep!
Don't forget your promise.
You're coming back to me alive!
I won't
Aren't you sleepy?
Not a bit.
There's nothing more you wished to say to me?
Nothing...
I could never express it in words.
I had so many things I intended to say to you.
I did, too.
Thanks for coming to see me.
Why shouldn't I?
It was a wonderful night.
Forgive me, there was so little I could do for you.
Michiko, let's hope we never see another wretched night like this.
I wonder...
You're going to the front?
Why?
I have a strange feeling that's why they let me see you.
No, please, you must come back to me!
You promise?
Michiko, forgive me if I beg one last favor of you.
Ask me anything!
After all, I came here for your sake.
I realize it's cold but I want you to strip off your clothes
and stand by the window.
One last look as you really are.
That's how I want to remember you.
I have nothing to offer you, nothing!
What's wrong, Kaji... tired?
Come, Kaji, I'll work you over.
I'm not as easy to poke as your wife.
I'm ready.
Enough!
Quite a boy, Kaji.
Sup.
Pvt. Yoshida you let this recruit shame you?
I'll take over.
Ready?
I'm ready!
Don't retreat, Kaji!
To attack is to win!
Now!
Press the attack.
What happened?
I can't see you off.
We're leaving on maneuvers.
Take care of yourself.
Time to part again?
Thanks for coming to see me.
Please, go!
I can't bear it.
We won't say "good bye", right?
A soldier's will should convey his resolution to his family.
To inspire them to carry on in a fitting way.
What is the resolution of a soldier?
It means to lay down one's life for one's country.
You recite the words well.
How about your letter?
Driving you crazy, eh?
"My concern is so great, I could never face death".
Was that it?
You coward!
The worst I've seen in 10 years of service.
It was my mistake.
It was my mistake.
Such effeminate ideas are more harmful than communism.
Even a Red can be brave, under fire.
But men like you know only surrender.
WO Hino, see that he writes.
Let him reaffirm his resolution.
"Tomie, your attitude is completely wrong.
It is your duty as a soldier's wife to look after my aging mother.
Your endless whining interferes with the performance of my duties.
I am a busy man.
Your bickering with my mother has handicapped me in my training.
It is my desire that you look after my mother, but if you feels this to be impossible,
I must ask you to depart from my house".
Obara!
Don't give up.
Breathe!
If you fail now, shame will be on us.
Don't forget that!
Obara, keep going!
Come on!
Somebody help him with his pack.
No one wants to aid a comrade?
All right!
I'll help him.
You have no objections?
You stand by and let me carry his pack?
Hon. Lance Corporal,
I'll help him!
Good!
Help your comrade.
If he drops out, leave him be.
Give me your blanket, pick and shovel.
You can take the rest?
Thanks, Kaji; forgive me.
Hurry up!
Let me rest awhile.
Your pack is 10 kgs lighter.
You don't need a rest.
Go on ahead.
I don't want you dropping out because of me.
Shut up and walk!
Quit now and all your misery will have been in vain.
We're almost there.
Show some guts for a change!
Obara, get up!
Get up, Obara!
It's no use!
Leave me, I can't go on.
You let me lug your load for nothing?
Think of the beating you'll get later.
You fool!
I can't go on.
To hell with you!
Be a quitter!
I'm going on!
Hate me all you want.
You're nothing but a quitter.
But I won't quit!
I'm going, all right?
You are fatigued, Hon. recruits?
You arrive back early.
We expected this disgraceful curs!
All you think about is food!
Get up!
Idiots!
Give 'em a shower!
No man worth his salt would ride home.
Have you nothing between your thighs?
If not, we can use you, Obara.
Keep both hands rigid!
Get the gun rack.
Drum up some business.
Hi, come in and have fun!
You with the glasses.
- Hurry up!
-Yes, put on the act.
Get started!
Hi, mister, come in and have fun.
Absolutely no sex appeal!
I say, just a minute, Handsome!
That's it!
But don't forget to beckon.
Say, handsome, come on inside!
- Is someone interested?
- I'm not convinced.
Here's a customer.
Come on, keep it up!
You want my company?
Wouldn't mine one myself.
It's been so long...
Is this guy really up for sale?
Yes indeed.
What a pervert!
Listen Obara, in the infantry, we don't ride home like a bunch of whores.
We walk, you understand?
When I was a rookie, it was even tougher.
You should be grateful!
Bastard!
Go kill yourself!
The book I borrowed, thanks!
Get up!
You mind if I go to the latrine?
Don't be a fool!
You're on duty.
You're gone if they catch you.
Say I'm patrolling outside.
Do as you please!
We all have to die sooner or later.
An omen, warning me against it.
Yes!
After all, one can die anytime.
That's something to think about!
On your feet!
Attention!
Your morals are putrid!
A bunch of stinking women!
The fact that one of you was a quitter and committed suicide is the responsibility of all.
You are all spoiled.
Did I teach you to quit?
If you feel that I didn't train you right, speak up!
Good.
Dismissed!
Do you want to stand guard over the corpse?
He's dead, he deserves respect.
The bum... a jinx to the very end!
Let's hear you say that again!
What's wrong?
Why the temper?
Will you back me?
Don't do it.
They'll all upset by the suicide.
It's too late!
Why did you stop me?
Would you have stood a chance after intervening?
You can keep your nose clean.
I'll go myself!
I demand that Sup.
Pvt. Yoshida be punished!
Demand?
That's no way to address your superiors.
Are you aware of the shameful actions committed by him on Obara's person?
I am not.
Although a superior private, he's not authorized to inflict private punishment.
His doings yesterday...
Wait!
Only dogs inform against others.
I am not informing.
I am demanding punishment.
Suicide is contrary to discipline.
There can be no excuse.
And Yoshida's action is above reproach?
Forcing helpless recruits to mimic a command harlot?
Silence!
Regardless of what Yoshida did, he is not to blame for Obara's death.
It's not all his fault.
But the final disgrace blow was...
Listen carefully!
A false move now could ruin your whole life.
I'm not worried about myself.
What will you do?
If you fail to adopt appropriate measures, I shall...
Go on.
There can be no other way.
I'll see justice done personally.
Plan to make trouble?
Private feuds could mean prison term.
I won't be there alone!
You may warn Sup.
Pvt. Yoshida that Kaji is out after his hide.
Your are saying
I indirectly caused his death?
I couldn't honestly deny that.
I understand
If only I hadn't written that letter...
It's sounds cruel, but it's true.
I'm responsible, too.
I let him drop out... during routine march.
I was forced to do so to save myself.
If I had quit with him... the army recognizes no such reason for shirking one's duty.
When one fails by the wayside, what happens to him?
Ask the Warrant Officer.
Quitters are outcasts of the military.
A disgrace!
And Obara's suicide has doubled his shame?
One can consider it so.
Are there punishments for men who drop out?
They are not punished.
However, their promotions will be delayed.
I can't believe it!
My husband was not one to do such a thing.
There must be a reason!
Tell me the truth!
A demoralized home-front is poor soil to raise good fighting men.
I wouldn't dig too deep.
Look at it this way.
A part of Obara died... due to your feuding with your mother-in-law.
The remainder died when I deserted him.
That was it!
Enough!
You may go.
Kaji leaving!
You complete revenge on a superior for a personal reasons?
Speak up!
I have committed no crime, yet.
Sup.
Pvt. Yoshida has!
It is unfair to question me first.
Hold your filthy tongue!
Let him talk.
He caused Obara's death by inflicting unauthorized personal punishment.
Why is he not punished, sir?
- Your marching ability was A-class?
- Yes.
How were you treated?
Very well, sir.
- Did Yoshida pester you?
- No.
Would he have if you had dropped out?
I believe so, sir.
Was Obara the only man thus punished?
All three, sir.
- All by Yoshida?
- No.
Did all three commit suicide?
No.
- Only Obara then?
- That's correct.
Why did you single out Yoshida?
Because one man died!
But I am willing to press charges against the others.
Enough!
It is evident that you seek only to satisfy a personal grudge.
Obara's death is merely an excuse.
By attempting to blame a superior for the suicide.
You undermine our finest traditions.
I don't blame Sup.
Pvt. Yoshida alone.
I demanded punishment for him as representing the absurd conditions which this incident has revealed.
Obara's death was not due to domestic worries.
Then what did cause it?
You're a glib one.
Don't tell me you're afraid to speak up.
Answer me!
The fault lies with the military.
You'd make a good man if you'd shut up!
Hashanti!
Teach him a lesson.
That's enough!
Kaji,
I'm warning you!
Private feuds will be recognized as insubordination.
Good!
You may leave.
Kaji leaving!
That man has guts!
Men like him make good solders.
WO Hino, see that he is put up for promotion.
Him?
For promotion, sir?
Make sure he is up on the promotion list.
He'll see things differently.
Men are like springs.
Pressure only makes them snap back it is better not to drive his kind too hard.
Put him on duty with the vets.
We're headed for the border anyway.
Salutations.
You just arrive?
Yeas, replacement squad.
You're staying out here?
Nothing but patrol duty.
It's just like WO Hino.
An effective method, too.
I'm worn out.
It's the damned heat!
Be careful.
They can't wear me down.
What's Yoshida doing?
Watch your step.
They're waiting for an excuse to send you to prison.
So this is the border, eh?
You're crossing?
Are you coming?
To the land of promise?
What'll they do over there?
That's up to them.
You're convinced that true freedom can be found over there?
Well, comparatively speaking, yes!
What use have they for a desert?
You'd be a mere tool.
A minor tool of a big promise.
You doubt that men are equal?
I'm not as convinced as you are.
What has Japan done?
Deserting the ranks of the invader doesn't prove your innocence.
You're only a deserter!
What's on your mind?
Prettier flowers on the other side don't justify desertion.
I could never do that.
WO Hino!
You hear me?
Send Kaji back immediately.
We need him for the inter-unit rifle match the day after tomorrow.
What?
Good!
Over!
The danger of desertion does definitely exist.
Shino and Kaji were seen together again last night.
Obara's death is enough shame for us.
Arrange to have Shino transferred to some other unit.
A signal flare!
It's close by!
It's pretty far out.
It's not!
I could use a little extra glory.
Come on!
I don't see anything.
You notice anything?
Must have been over there.
Damn!
Who goes there?
Stop or I'll shoot!
Fishing?
He was afraid and ran off?
Doesn't that prove he's innocent?
You rascal!
You shot the flare!
Confess!
I beg forgiveness!
He was only casting for fish.
Shinjo, quit stalling!
Take him to the guard post.
But what if he's innocent?
Fool!
We'll prove he's the culprit.
Ridiculous!
Do as I order you!
Forgive him!
Spare him!
What are you doing?
No, no!
You mustn't!
Hi!
Have a rough time?
Mail from home!
You've lost weight!
I'm going out next week
Was it really rough?
It's not as bad as all that.
Three letters in three weeks!
Also Obara's widow sent a letter to the squad thanking us.
What did she write?
Begging our forgiveness, etc.
She also says the dead have no tongue
And she cannot find out why Obara died.
What's Yoshida doing?
Give men for work duty!
At the store room. 1, 2, 3, 4.
Still one short!
Kaji?
Obarawould have made it 5, Hon. Superior Private!
Yoshida!
Shinjo is on the carpet for letting a prisoner escape.
He's wanted by WO Hino.
It's you, Kaji?
Did you know your buddy is going to prison?
A disgrace to the Imperial Army!
Bannai shot the culprit but it's the guard house for you!
I knew you'd end up there someday.
Fire call!
Fire call!
Prairie fire!
Hurry!
Go ahead!
Retreat!
Retreat!
Where you are!
From the fire lines here!
Who's that?
Cut off the weed!
It's Shinjo!
A deserter!
Hon. Warrant Officer, a deserter!
It's Shingo, sir!
Cut those weeds!
Wait, Kaji!
It's too dangerous, stop!
Shinjo!
Shinjo, run, run for it!
Help me, Kaji!
Wait!
Yoshida, will you make me a promise?
Can you hear me?
Admit to the CO that you caused Obara's death.
Hey, can you hear me?
You're a lucky man.
You don't recall?
We've shot you full of camphor.
The other man...
I'm sorry but he was already beyond help.
fever and blood loss.
You call out in your sleep for Shinjo and a Michiko.
Your sweetheart?
Or your wife?
She's both.
Who's been caring for me all this time?
Don't worry about that.
Just get a good rest.
- Pvt. 1st Cl.
Ishi?
- Yes.
- How many years?
- Three.
Even that's not going to help.
Is that any way to treat a patient?
How many years?
Third, but simple Pvt.
Don't try to pull rank on me.
He borrowed sputum from a TB patient.
Throw the book at him.
We're sick men.
We don't like people shouting in here.
Pvt. 1st Cl.
Tange, eh?
I'll teach you a lesson.
Don't exert yourself.
Stay in bed or they'll put you to work.
Nothing to be gained.
They make patients work?
You're a rookie?
Well, sit down.
Where were you, Hon. Veteran?
Forget the "Hon. Veteran,"
I was a lathe-man and a good one!
Weren't you exempted from service?
It's safer to keep some fellows in the army.
I see.
You there!
Who gave you permission to walk?
No one does anything without authorization.
Limbering my legs, nurse.
Hon. Head Nurse!
Sorry, Hon. Head Nurse!
I was trying to walk.
What's so funny?
Lance Cpl. Minakami!
These men need discipline.
They're not on vacation.
Tighten the reins!
Try that again and you've had it!
Roosevelt is in Russia talking to Stalin, they say.
If Germans surrender, only Japan remains.
Yes, the end is drawing near.
But if the Russians...
Pvt.1st Cl.
Kaji!
Tange is being sent back to his unit.
- When will it be?
- Tomorrow.
That's hard on him.
It is bad news.
Return to duty!
No one can foretell what will happen tomorrow.
Your original unit has been mobilized.
You'll probably be stationed here on hospital duty.
Really?
Even in here, there's always more bad news than good.
There was so much I wanted to talk over with you.
We'll meet again, if we try hard enough.
Someone once told me that real men would never lack for true comrades.
Your presence proved it.
Don't be too sure.
But I appreciate your words.
Excuse me.
Writing to your wife?
Yes, but I don't dare write the truth.
Because of censors?
Partly.
And no matter what I write, it ends up as a half-truth.
I want to tell her how lonely I am but I don't want to worry her.
What's more...
I detest army life.
I always thought of going home, yet, I actually want to remain here.
You really like it here?
Here I have things I never had before.
For instance?
For instance, talking to you.
Stand back!
The steam is hot.
You shouldn't be here.
I realize that.
Nurse Tokunaga, why have you left your post?
Disgraceful!
In broad daylight...
and while still on duty!
Forgive me for debating the point but we've committed no wrong.
I asked Nurse Tokugana to assist me.
A patient issues orders to a nurse?
That's as bad as a clandestine meeting.
Hon. Head Nurse, I am to blame.
Make no excuses!
Return to your post.
As you are outside my authority,
I shall report to your superiors.
It seems I have repaid your favors with injury.
Sent up front because of me!
It's all right!
We had to part sooner or later.
We may even meet again somewhere.
I have faith!
Anything is possible with faith.
Part IV
Wooden guns along the front line!
Must be Operation SCARECROW.
It's disgusting!
5 years of shooting training, but we don't have guns for fighting.
Let's go complain to the general.
Salute!
Pvt. 1st Cl.
Kaji in this squad?
Yes, sir!
Hello, Kaji.
Nice to find you still alive.
At ease!
I am 2nd Lt. Kageyama.
I have come to take over duties with this company.
Who goes there?
Who goes there?
Firefly!
Snow!
Sound of guns tractors or tanks.
Otherwise, all is well, sir!
Thank you.
What is that?
Festival probably.
They shot fireworks.
Doesn't sound possible.
War must have ended in Europe.
Germany must have surrendered.
A new batch of recruits arrives soon.
Will you be my assistant?
How can I help?
The new men range from 20 to 44 years.
From the active list and reserves.
Artillery men are a rough enough bunch.
They'd tear these men to shreds.
Basic is the same way in any outfit.
That's why I need your help.
Stop kidding me!
I should guard the army's sheep?
I've reported you as my assistant in the rifle squad.
You'll make superior private.
Should that influence my decision?
I'm sure it wouldn't.
But I could spare them a lot of grief.
Need I say more?
I accept your proposal under one condition.
Which is?
That their quarters be isolated.
Separating the rookies that's what you decided?
That's it.
If you agree with that, the officer will agree, too.
You fear to be mixed with vets?
That's not it.
Many of the new recruits are in their forties.
Basic training will be wasted on them if they are faced with rough treatment.
One such man killed himself during our basic.
It is our job to prevent such unfortunate incidents.
Training alone isn't enough.
I'll lash them during training.
But I would show them kindness in the barracks.
What could you know about it?
You have to beat into them the fact that army life is the way.
Sup.
Pvt. Kaji, the new assistant?
That is correct.
What will you teach?
Just as I have been taught.
What were you taught?
Seeing as you're the assistant, you must know almost everything.
However, here's something new.
Masui, teach it to him.
What could a private 1st class teach the Hon. Sup.
Pvt. Kaji?
Don't try pulling your rank on me.
How long have you served?
Here's how the ARMY trains men!
Wow!
Loaded and ready, sir!
Kaji, after all, you needn't take the beating.
You outrank him, you know.
We'd get in the way of your men, eh?
Want to lord over them all alone?
You won't let anyone lay a finger on your darling recruits, eh?
Isn't that right?
You've had this coming!
Open your mouth, wider!
Now, listen carefully!
Your ears are still open.
Should be able to hear.
A crying pheasant dies.
Well, this one won't cry for awhile.
This is what you get for slighting the veterans.
Teach that to your rookies and forget about the codes and manuals.
Who'll save their hides under fire?
Not your codes or manuals...
the vets!
The vets who fondle you so endearingly now.
Remember that!
The lieutenant!
What's going on?
Remove that slipper.
Remove it!
I shall ignore the whole matter this time, but such action will not be tolerated any more.
The young squirt!
Thanks you.
- Get your men settled down?
- Yes.
Vets are not joyful.
You won your point at the price of eating that slipper.
I want men who will die with me.
How many do we get?
Forty... 20 light guns 20 mortars.
Well... are you tired?
Is the border near the enemy?
The enemy?
Yes, very near.
Then this is the front line!
I must write father about that.
What does he do?
He's an officer, a major.
Worried about your kid?
I'm not the only father here.
I'll be all right.
Chief, can we hang on to our old photographs?
What kind of photo?
Of a woman.
Man or woman, just keep it the same.
You see.
But it's a picture of a naked woman!
- A good luckcharm?
- In a way...
It'll never pass inspection.
Better sew it into your loin cloth.
Don't forget your military speech when speaking to the veterans.
If they catch you using civilian terms, you'll really get it.
You understand?
Come here!
You don't need that button.
You scum never seem to learn.
I'll be careful please, return it.
If you want it back, you can come for it later.
The button somehow worked itself loose.
Face up to your punishment like a man.
Go get it back!
It's your own fault.
Koizumi, get back his button!
What's that?
Your button?
It was my fault.
Tashiro did it!
He pushed me.
Bastard!
Is this mess fit to serve the veterans?
Don't tell me you scooped it up off the ground.
With your dirty hands!
Why this short ration?
Why blame me for the whole mess?
To save your hide?
Who's the coward?
Stop it!
Cut it out!
No sense in arguing now.
What should I do?
What to do?
Hon. Lance Cpl., any good ideas?
You could go get us another helping.
No worry... we'll wait.
I understand.
Dump all the food back!
When your through, Azumi, take it to the vets!
We'll eat the rice alone.
It's better than nothing.
Did Kaji teach you that way?
I'm sorry, it was all my own mistake.
You'll polish your boots standing up!
What's up Enji?
The Honorable ASSISTANT!
Kaji!
How'd you teach your men to shine boots?
It was all my fault!
Shut up!
How about it, Kaji?
No special instructions, as yet.
What?
He did teach us, it was all my fault!
You keep quiet!
Please, forgive him.
I'll see that they learn.
Good!
I'll stand by and watch how you teach him.
Strike him!
I understand you're opposed to beating your men.
I can't do it.
Shall I show you how?
This is the way!
Hon. Sup.
Pvt., hit me!
You're through here.
Go!
Bastard!
Not because they struck me.
I want orders forbidding all personal punishment.
I'd go along with you if you were stationed further back
But not at the front!
Those vets are men capable of operating independently.
If they deserted me under fire, who could save me?
I'll place my recruits at your command.
In battle, you'd be worth... only half what those vets are to me.
What's more, those 5-year vets would ignore a green lieutenant!
I understand, sir!
Just a minute!
Michiko wrote me.
I told her you were here with me.
Although things must be better for you, she complains that you rarely write.
Better?
I wonder!
Want to read it?
Just tell me what she says.
That you must be having it easy with me here.
She has much to learn.
She told me to look after you,
that you should have self-respect.
Don't misunderstand the letter.
Fool!
She's hoping that we live through this situation.
She repeated that two, three times.
I'm sorry.
You can write because you're an officer.
Kaji won't die.
If you're going to write her,
Please, tell her so.
Officer Kageyama.
If we lose Okinawa, we still have the main island defended by The 25,000 solders
The time for hope has passed.
Our strategy aims at final victory!
We all like to think so.
Yet, our men are being wiped out despite the faith of our people.
That is the true picture!
Meaning they died in vain?
A matter of opinion.
Calm down!
Save your heroism for the soldiers.
He who shouts loudest is not always the bravest.
- 2nd Lt. Kageyama!
- Yes.
Aren't you making a mistake?
Japan is not as feeble as you think
The Aleutians to Australia...
From Tarawa to India, covering tens of thousands of kilometers.
An army which has once held this vast area cannot be belittled.
I admit that our lines have been shortened.
That we lost Okinawa.
However, this is all part of our basic strategy.
The enemy does not yet dare attack our main island.
Their supply lines grow daily longer, as our home awaits their attack
The pacific theater is but a side-show compared to that operation.
Can't you understand?
- I understand.
- What do you understand?
That I'll probably die here.
2nd Lt. Nonaka... that goes for you, too.
What will happens to us here?
If Japan looses the war...
Nonsense!
Japan will never lose.
To doubt is sacrilege!
Sacrilege?
It's only natural that we think about ourselves.
The fall of Okinawa is not the end.
You're a bunch of faint-hearted curs!
All because that Sup.
Pvt. Kaji pampers you!
I have a feeling, he...
He... what?
Afraid to say it to me?
You have ignored the fall of Okinawa altogether.
We need a morale builder and faith in our ultimate victory.
Ultimate victory is your favorite line.
Personally I've more faith in my wife than in your victory.
You say that's effeminate.
However, when bullets fly, you'll be looking to me for guidance.
Hey!
Why don'tyou salute?
Wait!
Call that a salute?
It was my fault!
Let me punished alone.
Save your breath!
Teaching them a lesson?
Mind taking over for me?
Hon. Leader, spare the others!
Shut up and keep it up!
- Leader!
- Shut up.
Naruto, shut up!
I'm taking it, too.
Keep it up until he says you can stop.
You'll stop under no one else's orders, do you understand?
You scum!
Get up or I'll whack you one!
Who is it?
Enji?
I'm sorry, Hon Sup.
Private!
When we were rookies, we kept this up for a hour.
Naruto!
Drinking after hours and raising hell!
Damned NCOs!
Scum!
You dare defy us?
Dog we'll murder you!
Just try it!
You're in for quite a surprise.
I've been in and out of worse places.
Nuts to your guard house.
Naruto, stop it!
You'll be convicted.
What have they to brag about?
They've never earned an honest meal in their life.
Hon. Leader, don't make itworse!
I'll assume custody of him.
It's insubordination and insulting a superior.
How about it?
Can you get him out of this?
If the CO decides a conviction will disgrace the company,
try to convince him.
Salute the Duty Officer!
Cpl. Takeda and command of 8 men have duly transferred guard duties to Cpl. Fujimoto and command.
Come on out!
Was it tough?
Not too bad... it was only 3 days.
They're waiting.
Naruto's coming back!
Go on inside.
Naruto, was it bad?
How was it?
Sup.
Pvt. Kaji, step inside!
What've been teaching the recruits?
Our men have just come off guard duty?
What're your men doing?
I'm sorry!
I happened to be out.
That's no excuse.
You better teach them right.
We'll show you how it's done.
Kaji, get ready for what's coming!
How do you like it?
A willing sacrifice for your darling boys?
That's enough, Akaboshi.
Let's see you do that again, Akaboshi.
Come on, I'll rip you wide open!
Think I'm afraid to do it?
I'm decided.
Come on!
Don't do it!
Filthy braggarts!
Don't tell me you're afraid of one man.
Come on!
I'll swipe you my life for yours.
Wait, Kaji!
Afraid to fight man to man?
Naruto, let me go.
Let go of me!
Don't forget it!
I'll get even with you for this someday.
Hon Sup.
Private, next time let me give you a little help.
Tashiro will help, too.
Thanks, but it won't do.
Why not?
It would be considered mutiny.
We'll fight it in court.
When we do that, we're licked.
Naruto... right now, there's no chance on our side.
We could beat the hell out of those vets.
But they're not the real enemy.
It's here the military.
Prepare for roll call!
Hon. Sup.
Pvt., stay in bed.
I want Lt. Kageyama to have a good lookat my swollen face.
Roll call!
Attention!
First Squad;
Total 36;
Absentees 4;
Present 32.
Count off!
Unnumbered 1;
Sick Room 4.
All accounted for.
Emergency orders for this squad.
Sup.
Pvt. Kaji and 28 recruits depart at 17:00 hrs. tomorrow to engage in trench-digging duties.
To maintain secrecy, marching will be at night.
You will join Cpl. Hironaka's command.
You will dig trenches.
Workshift: approximately 1 month.
A dirty trick!
Sending me out with a work party to avoid friction with the vets.
One way of looking at it.
You may think your rid of me, but I'll return in one month to make more trouble.
I don't think so.
When you return, I'm sending you out for special training.
Sending the prodigal son out to see the world, eh?
To South Manchuria.
Possibly close to Michiko.
Why remain here at the border if one can manage to get away?
You agree?
There are matters requiring settlement between us.
You avoid the issue...
I pushed the matter a little too hard.
We both failed to do anything.
Picking the military as the testing ground for your gripes
was not very smart.
Don't be stubborn!
Play it safe.
Will you do this fool a favor?
I'm leaving behind half my men.
It causes me much concern.
My absence may make it easier for you to handle the vets.
Can I depend on you?
Stop worrying!
Worry more about your wife if you have to.
You're short aren't you?
Take them.
Hon. Sup.
Pvt., we'll be waiting.
It'll only be for a month.
Somehow, I have the feeling I'm being stranded.
Two of us together get into their hair.
Neither of us is very even tempered.
Naruto... watch the temper.
Take your troubles to Lt. Kageyama.
Work party... fall in!
Attention!
Salute the lieutenant!
Eyes center!
Front!
Sup.
Pvt. Kaji and party now departing.
Right face!
March!
Here comes our water!
Hon. Sup.
Private.
How does this look?
Fine!
Well done.
Feels like I'm building my own house.
If given a choice, I suppose you want to fight here.
I would at least have a fighting chance in here.
I see.
Hon. Sup.
Private!
This guy wants to live here with his girl.
Idiot.
Watch out for your mother.
Might get jealous.
Engaged to a girl?
When you get married, have Naruto build you a house.
He's a carpenter, he'll be glad to.
Nakai, you look after his mother.
I'd rather look after the bride.
You've never told us about your wife.
She's a good wife.
I'll introduce you all, after the war.
How tall is she?
Medium build:
about five-two, 105 Ibs.
That's just my size!
Idiot!
Work party, fall in!
An important announcement.
At dawn today, our Seiundai fortifications were attacked
by strong Soviet military forces.
The battalion commander and his men have died a glorious death.
The enemy continues their advance into Manchuria alone the border line.
You will return immediately to barracks to await restationing.
You will construct new fortifications along a new line of defense where we shall meet and crush the advancing enemy.
Disperse!
Hug the ground!
Reconnaissance plane!
Men without rifles will lash bayonets to staff of birch.
We'll use them on close combat.
Don't we get any rifles?
Birch lances won't do us much good.
Is it my fault the birch is all we can find?
We're moving on!
Breakcamp!
Prepare to depart in 10 minutes.
Volunteers to go pick up our weapons!
Tashiro, to the supply depot for weapons!
Yes, be careful.
Ready to move!
Breakcamp!
We depart in an hour.
Hon. Leader, what's up?
These conflicting orders confuse and demoralize our troops.
Do your griping to the CO!
This is war!
Where's the Doi Company?
Here, over here!
Where's the Hironaka squad?
Over here!
- What happened?
- We're worn out.
From Seiundai?
There weren't any survivors there.
Only Ondera... he sneaked away.
I didn't!
I was carrying a message.
Sure, all right!
Why so toughly?
Hey recruits!
Bring us some food.
What happened at Seiundai?
Wiped out!
Including all your darling recruits.
Russian shells suddenly came whizzing over!
And Lt. Kageyama?
Killed in action.
Aircraft!
Approaching from the north.
Platoon, halt!
Fall out!
Nothing good to eat.
Where's the senior officer?
Now I wonder.
You know where he is?
Probably out giving his girl a final work-over.
Sergeant, will you issue orders for weapons?
Sorry, sir, I'm not authorized to issue orders.
You'll need HQ orders.
Right.
I'll phone Headquarters.
There's the phone.
It's out of order!
The bombings... they've cut us off.
Hon. Sergeant, let's liberate more candy.
Yep, good idea.
Don't move, you traitors!
I'll slay you all!
I'll take the rifles on my authority.
300 men cannot dig 3 km of anti-tanktrenches in 48 hours.
Impossible!
Would that justify you're not trying?
Anti-tanks trenches should be... concentrated in the valleys and fortifications on the hillside strengthened.
When you're the staff officer, do it your way.
You were Area C, I believe?
Unfortunately, for reasons of strategic nature, your area will suffer heavy casualties.
This is not the point!
Strategy or not... it can't be done!
Even if I order you?
Lt. Doi, startwork immediately!
Yes, sir!
But Hon. Staff Officer must remember that we cannot finish.
And that unfinished sector could be the fatal flaw in his plans.
To hell with your family!
The fate of Japan is at stake.
If we lose, we'll have no home!
That's because you have no family.
Even if we lose, if I'm alive my wife has a future.
And my kids will have a chance.
The truth is your afraid to die!
Cut it, Terada!
Stop arguing with everybody.
All they think about is themselves.
You're ready to die?
At any time.
I see!
I'm not ready yet.
I thought you'd say so.
You mind if I have my say now?
Not at all.
Go ahead!
You hate me because my father is a major.
That can't be helped.
But you defend those cowards because you're critical of this war.
It's all right!
Let him talk.
Yes.
I am critical.
I sold my soul for an army exemption.
I cannot approve of the kind of education your father gave you.
Meaning that you disavow this war completely?
I mean I should have disavowed it.
A split personality and a coward!
You've been blunt enough with me.
Now, let me!
You're just a fool!
A fool who can't understand why your mother should shed tears over your death.
Dying here is a dog's death.
If you live, you'll see what I mean.
Here come our rifles!
HQ Squad, Cpl. Hironaka.
Light MGSquad, Sup.
Pvt. Iwabuchi.
Rifle Squad, Sup Pvt. Kaji.
Anti-TankSquad, Sup.
Pvt. Akaboshi.
At ease!
Attention!
Lt. Nonaka will command Platoon III.
Enemy attack will presumably commence at dawn.
Each man will dig a fox hole at the spot designated and resist the advance of the enemy.
Sup.
Pvt. Kaji!
You will push forward with an advance scouting party and report the location of the enemy.
You will rejoin this main party before sundown.
Takasugi, Terada... step forward!
Ready ammunition!
Nuts!
After five years of service, they want me crawling undertanks!
I don't suppose your recruits want to die either.
Don't look at me for help.
You're on your own!
Your reports conflicts with previous reports.
Are you positive?
I am positive, sir.
Can your men confirm the 15 tanks, too?
I left them behind, sir.
For what reason?
We were ordered to remain behind until called.
You didn't call them?
- No.
- And why not?
Because recruits are untrained in scouting tactics.
Likely story!
You weren't close enough to confirm the presence of those tanks.
You coward!
I'm scared silly!
This waiting gets on my nerves.
The Fates have already decided which of us will survive and who will die.
Only a few hours until dawn!
Like a criminal sentenced to death.
I found cloth in my fox hole!
It must be a grave.
There's no grave here.
It must be a grave!
It must be filled with crumbling bones.
You imagine things.
You're no kid anymore!
Please, let me change places!
Hon. Sup.
Pvt., I'll swap him.
No!
Soon we'll be hiding behind the dead.
Why worry about a grave?
Terada!
You join Cpl. Hironaka as a messenger.
Well...that is it.
Orders may not be heard above the din of battle.
You must think for yourself.
Two things I wish to impress on you.
Don't be a coward.
Like it or not, what comes will come.
And one more, never give up!
Not over victory for yourselves!
If things get too hot, take cover and think about your girl.
That's what I'm doing.
Nakai, your girl in your loin cloth?
Of course!
Keep it close.
They are coming!
Shoot the signal flare!
Lt. Nonaka prepare for action!
Nonka Platoon!
Every man to his station.
Hold your fire!
Let 'em close in.
Distance... 800!
Fire!
Blast 'em!
Wipe them all out!
Wait!
Save your ammunition.
To your right, 400!
fire!
Wipe out those tanks!
Rifle Squad., when the big guns open up, stay under cover!
Hon. Sup.
Private!
What?
Tanks closing in on our rear!
Where's the CO?
Over there!
- I'm going!
- Wait!
It's still dangerous.
I'll be okay.
Fire!
Keep your heads down!
Hon. Sup.
Private!
Our only alternative is to attack!
Send a report to the CO!
Terada... take the message!
Terada...to rely a message!
Out of ammunition!
Azumi, any ammunition left?
Let me have a clip.
No!
I'm short, too.
You're not firing!
All right, keep it!
Hon. Sup.
Pvt., no ammunition!
I warned against wasting any.
Here!
Wait, stay here!
We'll shoot together.
Hon. Commander!
Where's the messenger?
Enemy troops to our rear!
I feel safe here with you.
I'll send you home to Mama.
Enji!
Hon. Sup.
Pvt.!
No ammunition!
I'll take him some.
You'll go?
Ammunition!
I need ammunition!
I'll be right back
If you go, don't come back!
Make every bullet count!
Okay?
Get ready to go!
I'll cover you.
Go!
Nakai, stay down!
Lieutenant!
Should we retreat?
The Japanese Empire...
BANZAI!
You fool, come back!
Where's the tank?
It's gone.
Does it hurt?
They'll come back for us again.
The major's son has been brave.
Yes...it's possible that you might live through this.
I'll sear your wound.
Close your eyes!
Rifle Squad!
Rifle Squad, show your head!
I refuse to die!
- What to do?
- One final attack!
Attack?
Watch out, Kaji!
Onodera!
Are we safe?
Coming?
Will they see us?
- You have a grenade?
- No.
We attack, if we must.
Please, save me!
Are they gone?
Be quite!
They're still nearby.
I'll fix them!
Stop him!
He'll get us killed.
Don't shoot!
I hit him in the leg!
The battle is over.
It's not!
We can attack!
Go ahead, if you want to die.
What'll we do?
We were lucky enough to come out alive.
Let's stay that way.
I got it!
We know how tough you are.
Stop trying to show off!
We'll show you yet!
Raving mad!
Pin him down, Kaji!
Come on, you bloody Russians!
I'll chop you up!
Throw this!
Calm down!
Be quiet, or you'll get killed.
Be quiet, please.
What happened?
He's dead.
I won't say I put him out of his misery.
I killed him!
Why'd you have to kill him?
You're trying to blame me?
Are you?
I am a monster!
But I will stay alive!
Anyone there?
Isn't anyone left alive?
Answer me!
Anyone alive?

What will you say to Shinjo?
He was not told anything.
You mean that he spoke to you And not responded?
Superior, did commit any mistake?
Do you want to know?
What you say?
Beautiful.
A beating is not so To celebrate this holiday.
He told them not to read When you are tired.
Do heard?
The rookie gives instructions His superior.
So Shinjo is tired.
Shinjo,
I know you are tired but, Can I get a question?
I do not hear.
I will destaparte ears.

It is an omen I warned.
After all, one can To die at any time.
Did you thought well?
We Stand up!
Attention!
Their spirits are rotten.
Podridos up bones.
There is a suicide in the division It is the responsibility of all.
Are we taught to surrender?
They are irrecoverable.
My discipline is not effective?

Well, dispérsense.
Should we keep guard Next to the corpse?

I demand that the Higher Yoshida Be punished.
Do Exiges?
That is not how From head to your superiors.

The shameful actions At forcing Obara?
There it was.
In the army, even a superior ...
Have permission to Private inflict punishment.
Expect!
Only dogs complaints!
Yo no complaint to anyone.

Suicide is contrary to the discipline.
This can not be forgiven.
Do Yoshida was Within the rules ...

Do Shut up!
No matter what Yoshida has done,
Unable culpárselo Obara's death.
It was all because of him,
But it gave him the final blow.
Listen well.
One wrong move could Ruin your whole life.
It worries me.
What do you think?
If you do not agree to take Adequate measures must ...
It continues!
There will be no other way.
I will personally That justice is done.
The rebellion staff Here is severely punished.
Irías the dungeon.
Not only would.
You can warn Yoshida Kaji who walks behind him.
Will says that indirectly Causé the death of my husband?
Honestly, It could not be denied.
I understand.
If only it had not Writing that letter ...
It is cruel but accurate.
I am also responsible.
We left during Our march routine.
I was forced to save me alone.
If I had failed him ...
It is unthinkable collapse Because otherwise, in the army.
What happens when there is accomplished Perform an exercise?
Ask that the assistant Hino.
You become a waste Army.
A shame!
And suicide Obara Redoubled their shame?
It can be considered as well.
Are there penalties for Men who fail?
They are not punished,
But his promotion was delayed.
I can not believe it.
My husband would not One thing well.
He had to have a good reason.
Tell me the truth.
A home is a demoralized soil Poor to grow a good soldier.

Why do you accuse him only?
Because Obara committed suicide.
I am willing to acknowledge The others also.
Do Enough!
It is clear that only looking Meet your personal rancor.
The suicide Obara It is only a pretext.
Trying to blame A higher suicide ...
Our socavas Most valuable traditions.
I demand punishment for him As a representative ...
The absurd circumstances This incident has revealed.
Obara's death should not be Domestic concerns.
What caused it then?
Since you are so eloquent, let me know.
¡Respóndeme!
The real culprit Is the army.

With those hands dirty!
Why receives so little?
Why do I blame me?
Tashiro, why not say anything?
To save your neck?

That will reclaim Another portion.
There is no hurry.

And I understood.
Devuelvan everything they took.
Azumi, when finalizing Llévaselo the veterans.

You Higher golpéeme my!
You can go.
You Idiot!
It is not because I beat.
I want it banned Any punishment personnel.
Elsewhere continue your opinion, But not in the front.
These veterans are capable To act independently.
If I drop out in combat,
Who saved me?
I colocaré my recruits Under your orders.
In combat valdrían half What worth these veterans.
Worse still, these veterans Ignore a second lieutenant.
I understand.
Expect!
I wrote Michiko.
I told him that you are with me.
She complains that He writes little ...
Although things Van better for you.
Is Best?
That I would!
Do you want to read it?

She has a lot To learn.
Ask me to care for you,
You have to be cautious.
No malentiendas that letter.

Not malgastadas unnecessarily.
Expects resist The face of adversity.
We repeated several times.
Sorry.
You can write Because you are official.
If you write, tell that ...
Kaji not die.
Whatever happens.
Tell, please.
Official Kegayama.
We lost but Okinawa We still have the main island.
Enough to have the luck!
We have a strategy For the final victory.
We would like to believe in that.
But our men They are crushed ...
Despite the faith Our people.
That is the reality!
Are the soldiers died for nothing?
- It is a matter of opinion.
- Cretino!
Calm down.
Save your heroism For the soldiers.
The screaming stronger It is not the most courageous.
Lieutenant-Kageyama.
- Yes.
I think that is confused!
Japan is not as weak as thought.
From the Aleutian Australia, From Tarawa to India,
Covering thousands of miles.
An army which controlled that vast Area can not be underestimated.
I admit that fronts were reduced And we lost Okinawa.
However, it is all part Our strategy.
The enemy will not attack us On the main island.
Its provisions are growing daily, And it is hoped their attack.
The army maintains order On our soil.
The sacrifices are in the Pacific Result of a transaction.
Do Entendiste well?
- I understand.
What understood?
To die here.
And also you,
Cape Nonaka.
What will happen to us?
If Japan loses, We ...
Japan will not lose ever.
Dudarlo is sacrilegious.
So what?
Everybody Think about yourself.
The fall of Okinawa is not fatal.
You have no identification.
Kaji is very lenient.
What do you mean?
Can not say In front of me?
It told us nothing On the fall of Okinawa.
We need moral support For the final victory.
The final victory Is your favorite quote.
I have more faith in my wife In your victory.
Perhaps this sounds afeminado.
But when the bullets fly,
Perhaps it is only in my Who can trust.
Why not salute?
Expect!
Do Flames to a greeting that?
It was my fault.
Let me be punished alone.
You Save your breath!
Do Enseñándoles a lesson?
Would you mind reemplazarme?
We plead that To forgive others.
It remains silent.

- Shut up!
We head!

END OF PART FOUR [SUBTITULOS:
IDEEN]
Two Men in Manhattan
It was 3:32 PM on December 23rd when the old 1912 gaslight forgotten by urban planners lit up for the kids on 43rd Street.
An Irish boy, an Italian, a Jew...
The trio neatly symbolized the great glass building on First Avenue known as the United Nations.
There was nothing special about the General Assembly's agenda that day simply a vote in favor of a state seeking membership in the organization.
That's all.
And yet...
An empty seat indicated the absence of the leader of a national delegation.
An unimportant fact duly reported by press agencies the world over.
Meanwhile, the new member broadcast his state's gratitude to the world.
In a speech recorded for posterity on wax in lieu of marble.
Soon, news of the absent delegate reached the French Press Agency in New York's Rockefeller Plaza.
NY AFP, how may I direct your call?
Get me the Waldorf.
The absence of the French delegate has been widely noted.
No explanation was offered by the press office.
Was there a reason for the delegate's absence?
No, I've heard nothing, I was just asking.
Yes, I'm much obliged.
Sorry to have troubled you.
Do you understand?
If there's something new I'll call you, even at night.
Have a second?
I know it's quitting time but our UN delegate has disappeared.
A missing person?
He wasn't at the session today.
Try to find him.
You're a night owl who knows Manhattan.
You spy on me?
That's nice.
McKimmie may know where Fevre-Berthier is at.
Delmas is more likely.
The dreadful Delmas?
You have sleazy friends.
I choose my own informants.
That alcoholic photographer revolts me.
Suppose he finds Fevre-Berthier?
Give him a bottle of Bourbon.
He only drinks Scotch.
I'll call as soon as I hear anything.
What brings the great journalist here?
Our delegate has disappeared.
Disappeared?
Let's not be overly dramatic!
Was there a reason?
Who knows?
Maybe he was avoiding having to explain a vote against.
Then, considering the voting by the Western bloc the Eastern bloc or the Afro-Asian bloc it may have been politic not to attend.
So it's routine?
No, Fevre-Berthier's family has been wondering since midday which proves his absence wasn't premeditated.
What's the general view?
No one knows except the family... and you.
What sort of man is he?
The classy type.
That pre-war vintage.
Brilliant.
...when statesmen forgot they were politicians.
Pining for 1925?
Who wouldn't regret the "Roaring Twenties"?
It's only when such men are gone that wars break out.
Where could I find him?
Try his secretary in Greenwich Village.
Sorry to bother you.
I'm with the French Press Agency.
Were there political reasons for Fevre-Berthier's absence today?
What political reasons?
An abstention perhaps.
The UN has its own information services.
I know:
McKimmie sent me.
He said you might be able to help.
I don't see how.
He doesn't confide in me.
Could there be a diplomatic reason?
It's curious the way Frenchmen forget their own adage...
What's that?
Americans use it all the time...
Cherchez la femme
He'd skip out on the UN just to chase women?
Not hitherto, but today maybe.
Who is she?
I don't care.
You mean you don't care...
any more?
The insoluble problem of male-female relations is not in my line.
Good evening.
Hi, pal.
Sorry, I'm a bit out of focus.
I need you to stick your head under a tap.
Here you go.
Good morning.
Good evening.
Talking of morals, like your landlady...
Who is Fevre-Berthier's mistress?
Excuse me...
Take your pick.
Which would you say?
I'm not invited.
I just take pictures.
We'll see all three.
To get their autographs?
You guessed it.
Why take that?
I hate to feel alone.
Without a glass or a camera in hand, there's just me.
I know what you mean.
But tonight:
No camera, no reporting.
She's like me...
hates to feel alone.
Who is she?
Judith Nelson, an actress with the Mercury Theater.
We'll start there.
What's this?
One of my spare wheels.
In short...
I can park here.
American women are very direct.
She must be of English descent...
from the Trafalgar Nelson.
- Did you pass her well mister?
- Reasonably.
Who's next?
Virginia Graham.
She's recording tonight at Capitol.
We'll go and see her at Capitol.
I didn't tell you:
Fevre-Berthier has disappeared.
Keep it quiet.
They think he's with his mistress.
Who?
That's why I got you out of bed.
What's all this about Fevre-Berthier disappearing?
That's what I must find out.
Such things can blow up into diplomatic incidents.
Maybe there's money in it.
For both, clearly.
He's a womanizer?
For the moment.
I know a girl who specializes in diplomats.
Should we visit her?
I doubt she knows anything.
Who knows?
Perhaps she can give us a lead.
We'll have to call first.
5433
Forms of prostitution are a measure of civilization.
Who said that?
Delma.
Who is this charmer?
Burlesque dancer.
Where?
In "darkest Brooklyn."
Cheap bags.
Poor girls.
I can see you banging a Salvation Army drum.
And you'd rush in to pass the hat.
Delmas...
Five years from now.
It takes a yogi 40 years to reach that state and a monk years of prayer.
He and I?
We can reach beatitude in a few hours.
Stay here and keep watch.
She was Fevre-Berthier's mistress.
Era?
He's dead.
Dead!
How?
Where?
She won't say.
Don't let anyone in.
Careful.
She's very weak.
Quick, I have the keys to her apartment.
Careful.
No accidents now.
Did you notice which floor?
The eighth.
Oh, shit!
No news, sir...
Hold on.
The boss is on the other line.
He wants to see you.
Give me your number.
34822
I found Fevre-Berthier and the reason for his absence.
But he's not talking about anything.
It'd like to tell you and the boss in person.
It's serious.
No, nothing political.
Stay there, I'll call you back.
Are you crazy?
You can't do that.
Be quiet.
Hello, Moreau?
No, no details.
You found him?
What?
Dead?
Where are you?
On the left or right?
It's the only door.
I'll stop there.
Is nothing sacred?
Something.
This.
My boss is coming.
I should have stopped you.
A shot on the sofa might bring in twenty dollars.
But, rumpled up on the bed half undressed, next to his cutie's picture.
Do you know what that means?
I'm stunned.
Me too, for different reasons.
Ah, Mister Scruples...
You're nearly 40.
Don't you want to get somewhere?
This is your chance to make a fortune.
I can't do it.
Why not?
You started it, not me.
You're the Sorcerer's Apprentice.
You can't stop it now.
It's easy.
Did I come looking for you?
You turned up and hauled me out of bed.
Now we're going to see it through.
To the very end, understand?
Get out of here before my boss comes.
Your boss!
To hell with him.
I put everything back just as it was.
Too late.
What happened?
A coronary, or something like it.
What is this place?
His girlfriend's.
We traced him through her.
His?
Where is he?
You're not alone in this?
A French photographer helped me.
Which paper?
French Match.
I know your editor well.
Is that right?
I met this man when he left France for London in 1942.
The General sent him back on a mission.
He parachuted in without preparation.
"Blind," as we used to say.
He broke a leg and was thrown into prison.
Interrogated, tortured,
His leg, finally in plaster sentenced to death, under an assumed name he contrived to escape.
Two months later, in London...
He joked about it, like someone else's adventure.
He parachuted into France again.
His exploits were cited by Winston Churchill as the true bedrock of the Resistance.
He worked on opposing fractions like the Communist Party or the Secret Army establishing contacts between them and persuading them to cooperate.
It took more than diplomacy, believe me.
It took faith, too.
That rare faith that makes self-sacrifice easy.
Later, he was arrested under his own name, and deported.
He returned from the camps broken in body but not in heart or spirit...
Yours is an honorable profession, Monsieur Delmas.
History is no long written, but photographed.
But some pictures can not...
must not be...
I never leave film in my camera.
Monsieur Delmas... the man did not die here.
Do you understand?
There can be no photographs showing him here.
How interesting.
What do you suggest?
I'm asking for those pictures.
Though I've never worked for you, I know your reputation.
You are well-versed in journalistic tradition.
When did a press officer ever surrender documentary evidence?
There is more to journalism than such traditions.
Reporting is not just saying and showing everything.
Not telling, sometimes, might be more honest.
You're against freedom of the press?
It has occasioned many excesses.
Do you remember the scurrilous campaign against a Third Republic minister?
And how it ended?
Too late for suicide this time!
Are you truly as cynical as you seem?
Much more so.
Very well Mr. Moreau, they've gone.
Tell me, what happens if an employee disagrees with you?
We argue, decide who is right.
The perfect democratic organization!
I'll use what influence I have to stop the publication of those pictures.
We want them, Pierre.
How much are they worth?
The minority yields.
That's democracy too, isn't it?
I wish that you saw it our way.
Don't ask too much.
I need you.
You too, Monsieur Delmas.
We can't leave him here.
We'll put him in my car.
The police will find him here.
Dead from heart failure.
To avoid questions about his time of death I'll see that there's no autopsy.
Goodbye Monsieur Delmas, please forget our little differences.
See me at the office tomorrow, Moreau, to settle the details.
Can I drop you somewhere?
I'll get a taxi, thanks.
I'll buy you a drink.
Wait.
No one's going to get near this car.
_M_?
At least I'll scoop his picture.
Let's go.
I've got work to do.
You behaved like an absolute prick.
You messed up your once big chance to get rich.
Suit yourself, but I intend to do my job.
I'm going to recoup my losses the best way I know how by taking pictures of the widow.
She doesn't know she's a widow, yet.
So, I'll tell her and get a picture of her crying.
You made me miss out on thousands of dollars.
At least let me earn my living.
Where does she live?
No idea.
What a help.
Let's have that drink.
I'll call for the address.
If you're squeamish, you can opt out now.
And have you say...
"Are you the Widow Fevre-Berthier?"
"I'm not a widow, Sir."
"Want to bet?"
Cut the gutter talk, Pierre.
Pardon the interruption, Madame.
Have you heard from your husband?
No, I haven't.
May we come in?
Have a seat please.
Don't do that, please!
It's ridiculous.
Momma, leave me alone with these gentlemen.
I'll explain later.
Should I thank you for what you did or worry?
How did you find out?
I followed you two all night.
When I saw you at McKimmie's office I knew you were on my father's trail.
I followed them...
Where can I get a taxi?
Use my car.
Where's he going?
I wish I knew.
Tell me about it.
It's complicated.
First, let's check the all-night photo lab on 97th Street.
Tell me about it?
I was conned.
How could I ever imagine he'd give us those photos?
What pictures?
He took them in the apartment...
Judith Nelson's apartment?
You knew about that?
Yes.
But the main this is that mother doesn't.
What happened?
He's probably developing them at home.
Let's try the papers.
There must be plenty of other labs in New York.
But how do we catch up with the bastard?
He has a two hour lead.
He'll have sold the pictures...
Probably got the editor of "Life" out of bed.
If he's really on the ball he'll wait for the early editions to give the "official version" then come out with pictures and the true story.
He was right.
It's a goldmine.
You're having regrets?
I think I know where he'll be gloating over a whisky at the Pike Slip Inn.
You kept the real film and sold it!
You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses, would you?
Let's get out of here, Anne.

No camera, no reporting.
She's like me...
hates to feel alone.
Who is she?
Judith Nelson, an actress with the Mercury Theater.
We'll start there.
What's this?
One of my spare wheels.
In short...
I can park here.
American women are very direct.
She must be of English descent...
from the Trafalgar Nelson.
- Did you pass her well mister?
- Reasonably.
Who's next?
Virginia Graham.
She's recording tonight at Capitol.
We'll go and see her at Capitol.
I didn't tell you:
Fevre-Berthier has disappeared.
Keep it quiet.
They think he's with his mistress.
Who?
That's why I got you out of bed.
What's all this about Fevre-Berthier disappearing?
That's what I must find out.
Such things can blow up into diplomatic incidents.
Maybe there's money in it.
For both, clearly.
He's a womanizer?
For the moment.
I know a girl who specializes in diplomats.
Should we visit her?
I doubt she knows anything.
Who knows?
Perhaps she can give us a lead.
We'll have to call first.
5433
Forms of prostitution are a measure of civilization.
Who said that?
Delma.
Who is this charmer?
Burlesque dancer.
Where?
In "darkest Brooklyn."
Cheap bags.
Poor girls.
I can see you banging a Salvation Army drum.
And you'd rush in to pass the hat.
Delmas...
Five years from now.
It takes a yogi 40 years to reach that state and a monk years of prayer.
He and I?
We can reach beatitude in a few hours.
Stay here and keep watch.
She was Fevre-Berthier's mistress.
Era?
He's dead.
Dead!
How?
Where?
She won't say.
Don't let anyone in.
Careful.
She's very weak.
Quick, I have the keys to her apartment.
Careful.
No accidents now.
Did you notice which floor?
The eighth.
Oh, shit!
No news, sir...
Hold on.
The boss is on the other line.
He wants to see you.
Give me your number.
34822
I found Fevre-Berthier and the reason for his absence.
But he's not talking about anything.
It'd like to tell you and the boss in person.
It's serious.
No, nothing political.
Stay there, I'll call you back.
Are you crazy?
You can't do that.
Be quiet.
Hello, Moreau?
No, no details.
You found him?
What?
Dead?
Where are you?
On the left or right?
It's the only door.
I'll stop there.
Is nothing sacred?
Something.
This.
My boss is coming.
I should have stopped you.
A shot on the sofa might bring in twenty dollars.
But, rumpled up on the bed half undressed, next to his cutie's picture.
Do you know what that means?
I'm stunned.
Me too, for different reasons.
Ah, Mister Scruples...
You're nearly 40.
Don't you want to get somewhere?
This is your chance to make a fortune.
I can't do it.
Why not?
You started it, not me.
You're the Sorcerer's Apprentice.
You can't stop it now.
It's easy.
Did I come looking for you?
You turned up and hauled me out of bed.
Now we're going to see it through.
To the very end, understand?
Get out of here before my boss comes.
Your boss!
To hell with him.
I put everything back just as it was.
Too late.
What happened?
A coronary, or something like it.
What is this place?
His girlfriend's.
We traced him through her.
His?
Where is he?
You're not alone in this?
A French photographer helped me.
Which paper?
French Match.
I know your editor well.
Is that right?
I met this man when he left France for London in 1942.
The General sent him back on a mission.
He parachuted in without preparation.
"Blind," as we used to say.
He broke a leg and was thrown into prison.
Interrogated, tortured,
His leg, finally in plaster sentenced to death, under an assumed name he contrived to escape.
Two months later, in London...
He joked about it, like someone else's adventure.
He parachuted into France again.
His exploits were cited by Winston Churchill as the true bedrock of the Resistance.
He worked on opposing fractions like the Communist Party or the Secret Army establishing contacts between them and persuading them to cooperate.
It took more than diplomacy, believe me.
It took faith, too.
That rare faith that makes self-sacrifice easy.
Later, he was arrested under his own name, and deported.
He returned from the camps broken in body but not in heart or spirit...
Yours is an honorable profession, Monsieur Delmas.
History is no long written, but photographed.
But some pictures can not...
must not be...
I never leave film in my camera.
Monsieur Delmas... the man did not die here.
Do you understand?
There can be no photographs showing him here.
How interesting.
What do you suggest?
I'm asking for those pictures.
Though I've never worked for you, I know your reputation.
You are well-versed in journalistic tradition.
When did a press officer ever surrender documentary evidence?
There is more to journalism than such traditions.
Reporting is not just saying and showing everything.
Not telling, sometimes, might be more honest.
You're against freedom of the press?
It has occasioned many excesses.
Do you remember the scurrilous campaign against a Third Republic minister?
And how it ended?
Too late for suicide this time!
Are you truly as cynical as you seem?
Much more so.
Very well Mr. Moreau, they've gone.
Tell me, what happens if an employee disagrees with you?
We argue, decide who is right.
The perfect democratic organization!
I'll use what influence I have to stop the publication of those pictures.
We want them, Pierre.
How much are they worth?
The minority yields.
That's democracy too, isn't it?
I wish that you saw it our way.
Don't ask too much.
I need you.
You too, Monsieur Delmas.
We can't leave him here.
We'll put him in my car.
The police will find him here.
Dead from heart failure.
To avoid questions about his time of death I'll see that there's no autopsy.
Goodbye Monsieur Delmas, please forget our little differences.
See me at the office tomorrow, Moreau, to settle the details.
Can I drop you somewhere?
I'll get a taxi, thanks.
I'll buy you a drink.
Wait.
No one's going to get near this car.
_M_?
At least I'll scoop his picture.
Let's go.
I've got work to do.
You behaved like an absolute prick.
You messed up your once big chance to get rich.
Suit yourself, but I intend to do my job.
I'm going to recoup my losses the best way I know how by taking pictures of the widow.
She doesn't know she's a widow, yet.
So, I'll tell her and get a picture of her crying.
You made me miss out on thousands of dollars.
At least let me earn my living.
Where does she live?
No idea.
What a help.
Let's have that drink.
I'll call for the address.
If you're squeamish, you can opt out now.
And have you say...
"Are you the Widow Fevre-Berthier?"
"I'm not a widow, Sir."
"Want to bet?"
Cut the gutter talk, Pierre.
Pardon the interruption, Madame.
Have you heard from your husband?
No, I haven't.
May we come in?
Have a seat please.
Don't do that, please!
It's ridiculous.
Momma, leave me alone with these gentlemen.
I'll explain later.
Should I thank you for what you did or worry?
How did you find out?
I followed you two all night.
When I saw you at McKimmie's office I knew you were on my father's trail.
I followed them...
Where can I get a taxi?
Use my car.
Where's he going?
I wish I knew.
Tell me about it.
It's complicated.
First, let's check the all-night photo lab on 97th Street.
Tell me about it?
I was conned.
How could I ever imagine he'd give us those photos?
What pictures?
He took them in the apartment...
Judith Nelson's apartment?
You knew about that?
Yes.
But the main this is that mother doesn't.
What happened?
He's probably developing them at home.
Let's try the papers.
There must be plenty of other labs in New York.
But how do we catch up with the bastard?
He has a two hour lead.
He'll have sold the pictures...
Probably got the editor of "Life" out of bed.
If he's really on the ball he'll wait for the early editions to give the "official version" then come out with pictures and the true story.
He was right.
It's a goldmine.
You're having regrets?
I think I know where he'll be gloating over a whisky at the Pike Slip Inn.
You kept the real film and sold it!
You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses, would you?
Let's get out of here, Anne.
In baseball, as in sumo...
- A new age arrives.
- What about cinema?
Me!
COMING FROM TELEVISION

kagetsuhisoka@KG
[mysterious music playing]
- Dad, are you alright?
- Hmm.
What is it that happens?
You never tell me.
I'm sorry, Alison.
You wouldn't understand.
You've got to stop these experiments.
After all these years of study at the university... how little I have actually learned.
I wish you'd take some rest.
Suppose the power for good dies, when the mind dies.
What if Shakespeare were right?
That only the evil that men do lives after them.
Forgive me Allison, you came here for something?
- Didn't you find my message?
- Message?
Uncle Ken called.
Ken?
What did he want?
Umm... he said he'd seen somebody named Tsantsas.
That isn't the way he would have said it.
What did my brother say exactly?
You must remember!
Well... maybe I misunderstood.
Is it that important?
Alison...
This is what the Jivaro Indians of Ecuador called Tsantsas.
But that can't possibly have anything to do with uncle Ken.
He doesn't know anything about your work or your experiments.
There's no way to get to him by plane.
The train will take two days.
Dad will arrive Thursday, Alison.
My brother will be here Thursday, Rogers.
- Have the guest room ready.
-[Rogers] Yes, sir.
[eerie music playing]
[music builds]
[gasps]
[mysterious music playing]
[car door closes] [doorbell rings]
YES, sir?
Lieutenant Rowan, Police Department.
Police?
We received a call from a...
Miss Alison Drake to look in here, she thought there might be trouble.
Trouble, yes!
But none to concern the police of.
Well, you better let me decide that.
My master passed away last night sir.
Most unexpectedly.
- Natural causes?
- Oh, yes.
The body is on its way to be embalmed.
But Dr. Bradford, his personal physician is still here if you care to talk to him.
Yes.
Dr. Bradford, this is lieutenant Rowan of the police.
- Glad to know you, Doctor.
- Lieutenant.
This is Dr. Zurich.
Dr. Zurich is a friend of the family.
But you're Mr. Drake's personal physician?
Yes, that's right.
Dr. Zurich is an archaeologist.
He deals with the dead, not the living.
The butler here tells me that Mr. Drake died suddenly?
It was a natural death.
Would you like to see the certificate?
Yes, please.
Coronary occlusion, you sure?
There is a long history of Cardiovascular failure in the Drake family.
Probably a congenital weakness, something in the heredity.
What makes you say that?
For the last three generations, every male member of the Drake family has died in the same way.
And at almost the same age, 60.
Then an autopsy would be a waste of time.
And money.
It might help pin point the exact area of malfunction,
-but...
- I see.
Miss Alison Drake told me... that the dead man had been worried about something to do with a... shrunken head.
That's strange.
Rogers found one of those horrible looking thing, hanging outside the window there last night.
You mean that head had something to do with Mr. Drake's death?
It's a little preposterous, isn't it, Lieutenant?
Sure, if Mr. Drake's had died naturally.
Do any of you know if this head represents a... superstition or something?
I am familiar with Tsantsas.
Tsantsas?
The Jivaro Indian name for shrunken heads.
I am considered something of an authority, on the Indian culture.
That is why Rogers sent for me, when... this was found, hanging in the window.
A particularly fine specimen.
Well, goodbye, Dr. Zurich.
- Dr. Bradford.
- Lieutenant.
I...
I understand Jonathan Drake is expected here.
Yes, sir.
We are holding services for Mr. Kenneth Drake in the morning.
He should be here by then.
Well, tell him I was here, and if needs me for anything more, to please call me.
Certainly sir.
[car door closing]
Leave the coffin in the living room, please.
That's where the services will be held.
[mysterious music playing]
[car door closing]
[doorbell]
Mr. Jonathan!
- What is it, Rogers?
- Your brother, sir.
How did Ken die?
Dr. Bradford said it was his heart, sir.
Jonathan, I'm glad you could get here.
George, are you sure it was his heart?
Could it have been anything else?
Jonathan, are you still trying to convince me about that ancient curse?
I know what I am talking about.
It was a natural death, nothing else.
Why is the coffin closed?
Your brother's face, sir, we thought it was better to keep the coffin closed.
- Open it.
- What?
Open it, or I will.
Zutai.
Everything is ready.
Kenneth Drake, you have paid for the evil of your ancestors.
- Alison.
- How is he, doctor?
Organically, perfectly sound, as nearly as I can determine.
But when a sensitive man like your father sustains such a shock at his age...
He will be alright?
He's been resting comfortably under sedation.
How are you feeling?
I was Kenneth's only hope.
I was too late.
It's as I said, Alison.
"The evil that men do... lives after them."
After what happened to Uncle Ken, do you think there could be some truth in what my father believes?
Your father studied these things most of his life, Alison.
He'd know a great deal more about it than I would.
Miss Alison, there's a Lieutenant Rowan of the police
-waiting to see you.
- Oh, yes.
You will call me if there is any change, won't you?
Certainly.
The mutilation of your uncle's corpse makes it a criminal case.
Now all I have been getting so far is a lot of double talk.
Somebody's gotta come up with a few answers that make sense.
What do you think I can tell you?
You called me about a shrunken head before your uncle died.
Okay.
Now, one of those heads was found in that window.
What made you think it might turn up?
I only know that my... father was worried about his brother.
And that it had something to do with Tsantsas.
Just as I told you.
Miss Drake, just what is it you want me to think?
I'm not sure, Lieutenant.
All I know is that I want you to find whoever it was, who did that thing to my uncle before it happens again.
[mysterious music playing]
Zutai.
Zutai.
Next will be Jonathan Drake.
And then the curse will be finished.
All these years you must have wondered why your father chose to study the occult and the supernatural.
I've tried to understand.
I'd hoped that if I could learn enough,
I could someday destroy the curse on the Drake family.
Dad, please listen to me.
I know a lot of things have been happening that we can't explain.
But there will be an explanation.
Maybe even the police will find it.
But it can't have anything to do with the supernatural.
I just can't believe it.
I never really expected you to.
I had to live all my life, knowing exactly what was going to happen someday Alice.
It's been a heavy cross to bear.
Perhaps it has even prevented me from being the right kind of father to you.
I want to tell you now, I'm... terribly sorry.
Dad, you've been working too hard.
Why don't you take a rest?
You could get some time off from the university.
I've always wanted to keep you from this.
Now I can't.
You've never been in the Drake family vault.
- No.
- Then it's time.
This is the only key to the vault.
From now on, you keep it.
[mysterious music playing]
Since the house was built... this has been the final resting place for all the family.
With one exception.
- Captain Wilfred Drake.
- My great-great-grandfather.
Same thing happened to him, that happened to Kenneth.
The curse began with Captain...
Wilfred, who had a training station on the upper Amazon.
When the Jivaro Indians kidnapped his Swiss agent,
Captain Wilfred led an expedition into the jungle to try and save him.
They found the agent alright.
He was at the Jivaro village.
The Indians had taken his head.
The captain and his men killed every Jivaro man and male child, except one.
The Chingui.
The witch doctor.
He escaped and hid in the jungle.
And he's the one who put the curse on every Drake male descendant.
My grandfather, Gilbert Drake... dropped dead on his 60th birthday.
Buried without a head.
My father, David Wilson Drake, buried a headless corpse, age 60.
And now, my brother.
Come.
I want to show you something.
The skulls were always returned to the vault, by someone or something.
How?
No one knows.
Just the skulls, that's all.
The rest of the heads were missing.
There it is, finished.
Perfect.
Soon as you return this to the Drake family, you will be ready for Professor Jonathan Drake.
- Glad you could come Lieutenant.
- Trouble?
Could we talk out here?
I don't want my father to get alarmed.
Sure, we could go in the car.
[car door closing]
Now, what's happened?
Lieutenant, my father thinks... that he will be the next one to die.
Anybody threaten him?
No, not directly.
Before I go on, I want you to understand that my father is an intelligent man.
Sure.
University professor for 27 years.
An authority in the field of the occult sciences.
He is 60 years old, his hobbies are--
Why did you get this information?
I told you, it's a criminal case now.
We have to find out everything we can.
We checked on you too.
Just routine, you don't have to worry about it.
Thank you.
Now, what did you want to tell me about your father?
He insists that there is a curse on the men of the Drake family.
Curses don't have anything to do with fact, Miss Drake.
When somebody mutilates a corpse, that's a fact.
Will you please listen to what I have to say, Lieutenant?
Let me tell you exactly what my father thinks.
Okay...
I'm in no rush.
Well, that's it, the whole story.
Do you still think there is a threat to my father's life?
Can... can you get me into that vault?
What good would it do?
Well, I can answer that better when I have seen it.
Alright.
I'll get the key, but I don't want my father to know.
If you like, I'll go alone.
No, I'd rather be with you, than stay here.
Now that's your uncle's, alright?
Just as you said.
And the skulls are where?
In there.
Do you have the key?
Did you say two skulls?
Yes. my great-grandfather's and my grandfather's.
And your family had the only keys, and gave them to no one else?
That's right, why?
Look.
[gasping]
Three skulls now.
Maybe now we know what happened to Kenneth Drake.
Let me bring you a glass of hot milk, sir.
- It might help you sleep.
- If you like.
Very good, sir.
[mysterious music playing]
I brought you...
Jeff, look!
Hold it!
[gunshot]
[Zutai screams]
Whatever it was, I must have hit him.
You stay here.
Miss Alison, can you come up, please?
Your father!
Jeff, come quick, please!
Jeff, please!
No sign of a pulse.
I'm afraid your father is beyond hope.
But he can't be.
Roger said he saw the man who was in here before--
The shock must have been too much for your father's heart.
Doctor... isn't that his blood on the pillow?
- A slight wound.
- Just a scratch on his neck.
Didn't you say this Indian or whatever he was had a Stiletto?
Yes, it was long and thin, sharp as a needle it looked.
- Get that pillowcase off the bed
- Yes.
But why?
I want to take it to the police lab, and have it analyzed.
Come on, Lee, come on!
If that stuff is what I think it is,
Drake may be dying off poison right now.
How did you know?
Yes, its poison, alright?
- Curare.
- Curare?
[dialing phone]
We're not too late.
Hello, Rogers.
This is Lieutenant Rowan.
Put Dr. Bradford on for me.
The only people I know that use curare as poison are some Indians in South America.
Hmm, I don't get this.
Makes two of us.
Hello, Dr. Bradford.
Look, get Drake an Antidote for Curare poisoning as quick as you can.
No, it has nothing to do with his heart.
I'll be there soon.
In the meantime, make sure nobody touches anything in or around the house.
Thank you.
Attempted Murder?
Get your equipment, I've got a job for you.
Alright.
Dave, I want a man posted at the Drake house 24 hours a day.
Right.
Ah!
it's a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't wanna live here.
Where do you wanna get the prints?
Over there.
See what you find on that.
If you find fingerprints on it, it means somebody has been getting in and out of this vault without a key.
If I do find some fingerprints, and if you don't find a way to get in and out of here, then what you're gonna think it was that put this skull back?
You're beginning to sound like the Drake girl.
You know it's gonna take a lot of proving to convince me that there is anything supernatural about this.
Then you better take a look at this.
Tell me what you see on that skull.
What is this?
What is this, some kind of gag?
It's no gag, Jeff.
Those impressions were on the fingers of whoever it was that put the skull in the cabinet.
Did you find anything that looks like a secret entrance in here?
No, the vault is air tight.
Then, how do you feel about something supernatural now?
- Lee.
- Yeah?
Test these other skulls, and tell me what you find.
But you said one of these skulls has been in here for over 100 years.
That's right.
Then how do you expect to find the same fingerprints on them?
The same man couldn't have put all the skulls in the cabinet.
I hope you are right.
- The fingerprints are identical.
- Yeah.
Jeff, what have we got here?
I do not know.
Here, you lock up.
I'll see you back at the lab later.
I want to have a talk with that girl and Dr. Bradford.
Fine.
[door opened] [door closed]
Did you get the antidote, Doctor?
It wasn't difficult.
Curare is one of the Phenolic Alkaloids.
I can only hope, I was able to administer it in time.
It doesn't seem to be having much effect.
I'm sorry, Alison.
I tried to rush the analysis, the lab man did the best he could.
I'm sure he did.
I am very grateful.
[Jonathan mumbling]
He's coming out of it.
Thank you, Jeff.
Don't touch me.
- No, leave me alone!
- Jonathan, lay still, rest.
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me, no!
No!
- What's happening to him?
- He's still in shock.
Alison
His pulse is coming back to normal.
You would be alright, Dad.
It'd be alright.
Alison, he shouldn't be disturbed now.
Do you think he'll be alright, if we leave him alone?
I have a guard posted outside.
I'll check your father again in a little while.
There's nothing else we can do now.
I...
I found something out in the vault.
We better have a talk about it.
Could one man have lived long enough... to have put all three skulls in there?
I know of no such case in medical history.
Jeff, Dr. Bradford, look.
That's it.
That's the way the impressions appeared on the skulls.
"The cult of headless men was composed of High Priests, or Witch Doctors, of jungle tribes, deep in the Amazon country of South America."
"There is no proof, legend has it that the men of this cult achieved immortality through the infusion into the body of a fluid... created by the tribal priests."
"When the operation was successfully completed, the man had achieved immortality, for he would no longer need food or oxygen to exist."
"The lips were sewn tight to prove the theory."
"Then, the brand of the cult, small impressions of skulls were branded on the fingers."
Okay, so it's a legend.
I don't believe it ever happened.
I don't believe it could happen.
Somewhere in the past, many legends have a basis in the fact.
I'm going out and have a look around the garage, you two want to come with me?
Well I better stay here, if Jonathan needs me.
I'll go.
- What do you expect to find?
- I'm not sure.
When I shot before, I hit something, and hit it bad by the way he yelled.
But when I looked, he was gone.
It's the best disappearing act I have ever seen.
Are you sure it was something human?
- Come on.
- Jeff!
Hmm.
Ah, you satisfied?
Only human beings wear sandals or shoes.
That means he must have been right here on this spot.
What is it?
The ground is soft enough for footprints.
But he didn't leave any.
And for an average straight thinking cop that is impossible.
But there has to be an answer.
If he...
A bullet hole, probably from one of the shots I fired.
I wanna take these back to the lab.
Go back to the house and stay there.
I don't want you to go wondering around these grounds.
I don't want anything else to happen.
I'll be careful.
Jonathan Drake, your life was saved by Dr. Bradford.
But it will not happen again.
And now, you will hear my words.
You will hear what I say to you.
My words will enter into your mind.
You will see what I see.
Everything that comes into my mind... will come to yours.
You will see... your fate.
You will know... that you must die.
As your ancestors died... as your brother died.
Nothing can save you now.
Watch, Jonathan Drake, watch, as your skull joins the others.
Miss Alison...
Rogers, get an ambulance Immediately.
Yes, sir.
[door closing]
His heart is strong enough, but he's gone back into shock.
Worse than before.
What could have happened?
The way the pupils of the eyes are dilated, something must have terrified him.
A nightmare, or something worse.
There's a policeman outside, nobody could have gotten in without being seen.
You're forgetting.
The thing that came after your father before left no footprints.
Now, perhaps the thing was real and tangible, but what if it wasn't?
Everything is done that can be done.
You aren't going to the hospital?
I think there is something of more importance to your father that must be taken care of first.
I'll be at the hospital later.
Dr. Bradford.
Such a pleasure.
Come in.
- Come in.
- Thank you, Dr. Zurich.
- Please sit down, Dr. Bradford.
- Thank you.
Is there something I can do for you?
Something is puzzling me, and as you are an expert on such matters,
-perhaps you can help me.
- Yes?
Curare is the favorite arrow poison of the Jivaro Indians, is it not?
And also of the Incas, and others of the Amazon tribes.
The Jivaros are the headhunters, who shrink their trophies?
That is correct.
But why this sudden interest in curare?
Because I am convinced that curare, not heart failure, caused the death of Kenneth Drake.
And tonight, someone used the same poison on Jonathan Drake.
But he did not die.
How did you know that?
How very fortunate for Mr. Drake that you were present to save his life.
What?
Tell me, how did you know that?
It makes no difference, since you will never leave here to save his life again.
- What?
- Zutai!
No!
- Make any sense out of it?
- No.
I analyzed the bullet and the sandal, and nothing makes any sense.
Jeff, you hit something with that bullet alright, but... what is something else?
- No blood on it?
- Yeah, a little.
Jeff, the internal composition of the thing you hit is about one third blood and the rest curare.
- Curare?
- That thing should be dead, it's practically embalmed with this stuff.
What about the sandal?
- You got a strong stomach?
- Hmm.
It's made from human skin.
- Lee, are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
Jeff, in the name of all that's holy, what have you tied onto in this case?
I do not know, I'm going around in circles.
But there is a, there is a doctor, a guy named Zurich.
Maybe he can come up with a few answers.
- Is he a regular M.D.?
- No, archaeologist, but he is, he is an expert on primitive culture, headhunting, curare, all that sort of thing.
You should have talked to him before.
There is a lot of things I didn't believe in before.
But I'm beginning to change my mind.
See you later.
Lieutenant Rowan, this is a surprise.
Sorry to bother you, Dr. Zurich, but I thought you might give me some help.
- Yes?
- It's the Drake case.
- Oh, yes, please come in.
- Thank you.
I must apologize for this room.
I use it very little.
I'm usually occupied by my studies.
I'm a policeman, Dr. Zurich, trained to deal in facts.
And anything to do with head hunting... doesn't seem very factual to you.
You're the expert, Doctor.
But its more than head-hunting.
Something attacked Jonathan Drake.
I managed to get off a few shots at it, and I hit it once.
I also found the bullet that I hit it with.
The police lab tells me that it was... stained with a solution of blood... and curare.
Mostly curare.
That is strange, quite strange indeed.
And you don't have any explanation for it?
Lieutenant, have you considered the supernatural aspects?
Oh, yes, yes, I have considered them, and I come up with exactly nothing.
Then perhaps, it isn't a police matter at all.
Attempted murder is always a police matter.
You asked for my help.
I'm trying to give it to you in the only way I know.
Sorry.
It depends strictly on your point of view, Lieutenant.
Throughout history, some of our strongest cultures were based on the taking of heads.
When the practice was abandoned, or suppressed, the local civilization degenerated and soon disappeared.
Even today, the practice still flourishes in several parts of the world, the Philippines, India, New Guinea, the upper regions of the Amazon.
Until a few years ago, it was prevalent in civilized Europe.
Maybe.
But there are still better ways to kill somebody, then... by hacking off his head.
I see, I haven't changed your point of view.
No.
When the head of a strong valiant enemy is properly taken, the possessor acquires the spirit, the soul, the vital spark that kept his enemy alive.
A degree of immortality.
Spill something?
A red dye.
It'll come out.
What did you mean by taking the head properly?
Can there be a wrong way to do it?
It was a sacred ritual of ancient cultures.
The skull could not be damaged, otherwise the soul would escape.
Come here.
The cut must be made just here.
Above the shoulder, neither higher nor lower.
The incision is made with a bamboo blade, never with a metal knife, the iron would contaminate the soul.
I see.
Afterward, the trophy is preserved in the usual fashion.
The removal of the skull, sewing up the openings of the eyes, nose and mouth.
Then... a slow shrinking process with hot sand, smoke and heated pebbles.
Which still doesn't explain why someone would wanna kill Drake.
Did you expect me to answer that for you?
I wasn't sure just what you could answer, Dr. Zurich.
You know anything about the curse on the Drake family?
A curse?
No, I didn't.
What is it, some sort of legend?
Maybe that's all it really is, I do not know.
But there is something else I found outside the Drake house.
A sandal made out of human skin.
Just give that some thought, Doctor.
Anything occurs to you on that one, call me at headquarters.
Yes, I certainly will, Lieutenant.
Thank you for calling, such a pleasure.
Yeah...
Thank you, Doctor.
I'll be talking to you.
Zutai.
The police are becoming suspicious.
We must finish with Jonathan Drake at once.
Immediately.
Get everything ready now.
- Car 117.
-[woman] 117.
Get Coulter for me, I want to talk with him.
Coulter talking.
Lee, this is Jeff.
I just came from the Zurich house, I may be onto something.
Get a run down on him for me.
How much, or how little, or is it everything?
[Jeff] Yes, everything.
His full name is Emil Zurich.
Are you coming right back here?
No...
No I'm going back to stake out the house.
There was a stain on the floor, that could've been blood,
I wanna have another look.
Now watch yourself.
[Jeff] Right, check with you later.
[mysterious music playing]
What happened?
Where is Drake?
They have taken him away.
Wait here.
Don't let yourself be seen.
I'd like to talk to Professor Drake.
It's very important.
Haven't you heard, sir?
He's been taken to the general hospital.
No, I haven't heard.
I'm very sorry.
Miss Alison will be back from the hospital shortly, sir.
I'll leave word that you called, if you wish?
Fine, fine, thank you, Rogers.
- Is there anything else, sir?
- No, thank you.
Good night.
Good night, sir.
They've taken him to hospital.
Impossible to get him there.
There is only one other thing to do.
Force him to come to us.
- Car 117.
-[woman] Car ten, come in.
Quick, get me Coulter again.
Coulter talking.
Lee, this is Jeff.
Now tell me in a hurry, man, were you able to find out anything about Emil Zurich?
Plenty, you better get back here pronto, you got more trouble than you know.
-[Jeff] Slowly, I've got to--
- Now wait, Jeff, listen to me, you won't do any good.
You could have every man on the force out looking for Zurich, and you'll get nowhere.
That guy is a ghost.
A ghost?
Lee, you must be cracked.
Now look, I'm on the level, get back here and fast.
Okay.
I'm at the stage, where I'm ready to believe anything.
I'll be right back.
Miss Drake.
Dr. Zurich, I didn't see you there.
What are you doing here?
That doesn't matter.
The hospital just telephoned.
Your father has taken a turn for the worst.
But I just left there, he is feeling much better.
I'm terribly sorry, but...
that was the message.
You better get right back there at once.
- The cab...
- My car is parked nearby,
I'll be very glad to take you.
Please, please hurry.
Well, first we checked the medical directories, then the college faculties and associations.
Everybody that's ever been awarded a doctor's degree for anything.
The whole department has been on it.
And Jeff, there is no Dr. Emil Zurich.
- What?
- Not now.
What are you talking about?
I was just with him three hours ago.
Do you know what you were actually with?
What?
Somebody who existed 180 years ago.
Oh, come on, Lee.
If you think I'm gonna--
Wait, Jeff, listen to me.
We got the whole rundown.
The man you were talking to is a Dr. Emil Zurich of Switzerland.
He was agent for a company owned by Captain Wilfred Drake, and he was killed by the Jivaro Indians on the Amazon River almost 200 years ago.
No... no, it's impossible!
The police manual only covers live criminals.
How you're gonna handle it?
The Drake family got me into this, and they are going to get me out.
I'm going to the Drake house and talk to the professor.
- Jeff?
- Yeah?
Don't get too brave.
Wait here.
Don't go away.
Professor Jonathan!
You shouldn't have left the hospital.
- Is my daughter here?
- Miss Alison?
No, sir.
She didn't come back after she left me at the hospital?
I haven't seen her.
- Then he wasn't lying.
- Sir?
There is only one thing I can do now, he's left me no choice.
Professor Jonathan, what is it?
What's wrong?
Dr. Zurich called me at the hospital.
He's holding my daughter prisoner.
Dr. Zurich!
Professor, you're ill, let me call the police.
No, if the police came, Zurich would kill her.
Goodbye, Rogers.
Please, Professor, I know you're upset, sir, but the police will take care of it.
Please sir.
There.
Now you've seen the entire process, Miss Drake.
Dr. Bradford has achieved a certain immortality.
As your father will soon, very soon.
My father has done nothing to harm you.
Why do you want to do this to him?
It isn't what I want.
It's what I must do.
Lieutenant, I was just about to telephone you when I heard your car.
- What happened?
- Well, I'm not quite sure, sir.
But apparently, Miss Alison has been kidnapped by Dr. Zurich.
- Zurich?
- Yes, sir.
Professor Jonathan has gone after her now.
He told me not to inform the police.
Call headquarters, tell them I've gone to Zurich's house and to give me exactly an hour.
If they don't hear from me by then, they're to send help.
Yes, sir.
When your father dies, when the Tsantsas made from his head joins the others,
then the ancient pledge will be fulfilled, and I shall rest.
And suppose it is not fulfilled.
Now that you are here, why suppose that?
Because I've learned how to destroy you, Zurich.
With a gun?
Jonathan Drake of all men should know how futile that would be.
I know... a living dead thing.
The head of a decapitated white man on the body of a jungle Indian.
Since you know that I am dead, you know that you can't kill me.
I can destroy you another way, Zurich.
If you can't carry out the curse, you will never find eternal peace.
You will become the cursed one.
All I have to do is put this gun against my head and pull the trigger.
- Don't, Drake!
- Dad, no!
Once the skull is damaged, the soul will escape, and you will have lost, Zurich.
Dad!
[Alison screams]
Rowan, wait!
Wait!
This is the only thing that will stop him.
HOW?
Try to get near enough to wound him, just break the skin.
Dad, you're too weak.
Stay here.
No, I can't.
It's our only chance.
[suspenseful music playing]
- Jeff.
- It worked, Professor.
You're through with him.
No, not yet.
Not until the head of the white man is separated from the brown body.
- Dad!
- Alison, all that will be destroyed is evil... nothing human.
These men, white and Indian, died 180 years ago.
Look!
[Alison] It's turning to dust!
[Professor] The fourth skull.
I hear him.
Mornin', Brigade.
I've been looking to find you, Billy.
I know.
I've been seein' your dust for three days.
I figured it better to let you catch up and have it out'n over.
The others?
Where are they?
They went on ahead.
I told 'em I'd be along after I buried you.
Mount up.
We're going back.
You know I can't do that.
It's the only thing you can do.
If I was to ride south with you, there's them that'd see me hang.
You left a dead man in the street in Santa Cruz.
- Fair fight.
- He was killed from behind.
Like the others.
I don't know how much they're paying you to bring me in, but it ain't near enough.
I'd hunt you free.
Let's go.
I guess that makes me out a liar, don't it?
Them boys didn't go ahead.
They're scattered all in rocks.
There's no way for you to get outta here.
Now, look, Brigade,
I got no quarrel with you.
If you ride outta here, I'd forget about this whole thing.
What's one more bounty to a man like you?
Money's got blood on it.
We're goin' on back.
You don't understand.
I give the word, you're dead.
Maybe.
But before I hit the ground I'll blow you half in two.
- You're bluffin'.
- Am I?
Call 'em off, Billy.
Hold your fire boys.
It ain't gonna work.
I knew I should'a done it my way.
In the back?
Charlie!
Charlie!
You all find my brother Frank.
You tell him what's happened.
Tell 'em Ben Brigade's takin' me to Santa Cruz.
You hear me, Charlie?
Well, you tell him that.
He'll know what to do.
Now, get goin'.
You better put them on tight.
Hop on.
You know my brother, Frank?
Heard of 'im.
Then I guess you know you ain't gonna get me to Santa Cruz.
Wells Junction.
There's nobody out'n about.
You don't suppose Frank'n the boys circled high around and are waitin' do you?
Let's see.
- Anybody home?
- Stay right there.
- Drop the gun.
- Better had.
Well, I'll be.
Ben Brigade.
Hello, Boone.
Fancy running' into you in all this empty,
I saw you come up over that rise.
Couldn't quite make you out.
A man can't be too careful in this part of the country.
You're a long way from home.
- No more than you.
- I can go back.
- You must be Billy John.
- So?
I heard a lot about you!
You ain't as small as I thought you'd be.
You staying for the night, or going to Santa Cruz?
Did I say I was goin' to Santa Cruz?
Not in words.
I came through there a while back.
I heard that Billy John had killed a man.
The man knotting' tie rope said it was murder.
- Where is the station man?
- He ain't here.
Had some of his animals loose-herded up on that flat.
Went out this mornin' to gather 'em before the Eastbound come through,
- but they beat 'em to it.
- Who's they?
Freeds, Mescaleros, Sunday-school teachers, for all I know.
He went to find 'em.
- Left you here to tend the station?
- Not exactly.
Whit!
The woman, bring 'er out here.
Never mind.
Now you all get your horses and ride on outta here.
Now, look, lady.
Just do like I say.
That's no way to act.
Me and Whit's been doin' you a service, with your man away.
- Tell her we ain't here to harm her.
- Why are you here, Boone?
A man needs a reason to ride this country.
You got a reason?
Don't matter.
I want you gone.
All of you.
But ma'am, we can't do that.
Just up and ride off.
No tellin' when your man'll find them horses'n get back.
Besides, woman ain't safe out here alone.
- She won't be alone.
- No?
No, the Westbound's comin'.
They're in a hurry.
Whit, fetch up them animals in the corral.
We can make up the team change for the lady before we go.
I don't need your help.
No, but the folks on the coach do.
They ain't had a meal hot or square since they left Santa Cruz.
If I were you I'd look to feed 'em.
I know what you're thinkin'.
You're thinkin' that me and Whit's been sittin' here waitin' for the coach to pull in.
Waitin' to take off with the Fargo box or somethin' pure awful like that.
- Well, you're wrong.
- Am I?
Plum.
Mescalero.
Don't come out here!
Nothin for a woman to see.
What call they got to do a thing like that?
Murder raid.
That or they wanted the horses.
- Butchers.
- Boone, that dust boil.
You figure they drew off when they sighted the station?
Looks that way.
Enough of 'em, they'll try to scald us out before dark.
Whatta we gonna do?
- Only thing we can, bury the dead and wait.
- Wait?
If they catch us in the open, come night, we wouldn't have a chance.
We'll fort up in the station till morning.
What about Billy?
What about him?
Well, him sitting out there between you and Santa Cruz, kinda makes the hill higher to climb, doesn't it?
You could swing north, take Billy to Bisbee.
- A rope's a rope.
- He's going to Santa Cruz.
- No matter what.
- No matter what.
If you ask me, it ain't Christian.
Covering these folks without reading over them.
I don't know if it's gonna help them now.
Yeah.
- Whit.
- Yeah?
- I shouldn't think it like this.
- What?
Look out there.
War signs.
Well, we got a treaty with the Mescaleros, ain't we?
Just words on paper.
Yes, we been gettin' along.
I knew a man once.
Got along with his wife.
One day she up'n shot him.
Dead?
- But why?
- Got mad.
Mescalero, they're mad.
But we ain't done nothin' to 'em.
We're white.
That's good enough.
Come on.
Sam.
You figure Brigade knows why we're here?
Not yet.
Guess there ain't no way him finding out, is there?
Only one.
I'm gonna tell him.
- Tell him?
- Tonight.
If I were you,
I'd hold onto that shovel 'cause likely as not we're gonna be needin' it again.
Soon.
- I make it three.
- Four.
- Coffee?
- Thank you.
My husband should have been back by now.
He said he'd keep after as far as Dry Fork.
If he hadn't picked up the animals by then, he'd double on back.
That would have put him here before dark.
He likely got cut off.
- He wouldn't leave me here alone.
- Not if he had a choice.
You think something's happened to him?
I didn't say that.
There's any number of reasons for his not getting back.
Even if he found the horses he'd have to loose-herd them clear here by himself.
Could take him half the night, maybe longer.
He never shoulda gone.
You'd have him lose his animals and not go after them.
Not talkin' about animals, talkin about you.
- Me?
- He left you alone.
I can take care of myself.
If you were mine, you wouldn't have to.
Meaning?
Meaning I'd never of brought ya here in the first place.
Nowhere for a woman.
Running a swing station is my husband's job, Mr. Brigade.
He should find a better one.
Like bounty hunting, for instance.
You cook good coffee.
Mr. Brigade...
You'd better get some sleep.
We'll be leaving first thing come morning.
- Leaving?
- Three days'll put us in Santa Cruz.
But I...
If your husband's not back, we'll swing toward Dry Fork, pick him up on the way.
- Well, I...
- Good night, Mrs. Lane.
Best cooking' I had in a long time.
Mighty handsome woman, Mrs. Lane.
Don't look like they're gonna try us, does it?
- Brigade?
- Yeah.
You were sayin, a man needs a reason to ride this country.
You were right.
I don't suppose you heard about the poster they got out on Billy John.
Poster?
Gotten tacked to near every tree 'n stump 'tween here'n Rio Bravo.
Claims the territory'll grant amnesty to anybody that brings Billy in.
You know you won't believe this.
But me'n Whit went near a week before we found out what that word amnesty meant.
A fella selling' Bibles over in Santa Cruz told us.
It means the law's willin' to drop any and all charges it's got against a man.
All he's gotta do is turn the key on Billy.
I know that ain't the reason you rode 'im down.
But that's why me and Whit's gonna tag along with you.
We figured that when Billy's brother Frank, hears that you're ridin' him in to hang, he's gonna come killing'.
But, if anybody can get Billy safe to Santa Cruz, it's you.
If I do.
Then there's only one man standin' between me'n starting' life clean over.
Make doubly sure Whit keeps that Winchester on Billy John.
We wouldn't wanna lose 'im, would we?
We sure wouldn't.
Brigade!
Brigade!
We can't take those animals along.
It'd slow us down.
- But we're responsible...
- They'll eat their way to the next swing stop.
Time comes, you can pick them up there.
Got out that black for you to ride.
The sooner you get on it, the sooner we'll get clear from here.
Don't look like you and Mrs. Lane get along too well.
We'll stay on the stage road to Dry Fork.
- Dry Fork?
- Swing south from there.
That's the long way, ain't it?
- Gotta pick up the station man.
- Or what's left of 'im.
Whit's right.
If he had been alive, that fella'd be back by now.
We're goin' to Dry Fork.
Not right away we ain't.
Look.
- What do they want?
- They'll get around to it.
- What's he doing?
- He wants to talk.
Stay here.
He's got a horse.
Wants to make a trade.
For what?
You.
He said they'd been seein' you here.
He wants to take you for his squaw.
So what we do now?
- Play along with 'em.
- Play along with...
If we don't we're apt to stir up every buck in the country.
Come on.
- Just do like I tell you.
- Brigade.
Can't abide to see a woman's hair hangin' from a Mescalero war-lance.
I hope you know what you're doin'.
- He'll offer his trade.
I'll turn him down.
- Then?
With any luck they'll ride off.
Out in the hills, try to figure how else to get you away from us.
I see.
No matter what happens don't break down in front of 'em.
If you do, they'll take it wrong.
Shame 'em.
I don't scare easy, Mr. Brigade.
I hope not.
That tears it.
Looks like you won.
They'll be back if they want her bad enough.
I thought you didn't scare, Mrs. Lane.
That was my husband's horse.
Too bad about the woman.
She sure is takin' it hard.
I tried to tell her it wasn't for certain her man was dead.
She wouldn't listen.
The way they treated 'em on the coach, I don't hardly blame her.
I can't get over the way them Indians wanted to trade her for a horse.
If it'd be me, I'd give a whole herd.
She's about the best all over good-lookin' woman I ever seen.
- She ain't ugly.
- She sure ain't.
You got a reason for stayin' in this open country?
Seems to me you'd keep a hill close to your back, considering.
The way I see it, brother Frank can't be too far back.
Talk had 'im up Val Verde way.
Heard about Billy, he wouldn't waste any time.
Likely ride out the night.
To do that, it'd put 'im behind us even sooner.
Dobe Corral's just over that rise.
We're headin' there.
I don't think Frank's gonna come along before...
I'm not talkin' about Frank.
I'm talking about Mescaleros.
Medicine country.
They figure to jump us up it'll be somewhere soon.
Maybe them four at Wells Junction went for more?
- I know they did.
- How can you be sure?
'Cause there they are.
Keep movin'.
You sure Dobe's just over that rise?
Positive.
Ain't we gonna hurry?
Yeah, now!
Move!
Take her out.
Get him!
Sure beats all, don't it?
What a man'll put himself through to get his hands on a woman.
I can't blame 'im though.
Haul their dead to the crest of the hill.
- Does that hurt you?
- It'll be just fine.
Yes, ma'am.
Better get it cleaned up.
There's five horses.
Musta' pulled out early this morning.
What we do now, Frank?
- We keep after them.
- But our animals are nearly dead.
Said we keep after 'em.
This'll keep the chill off.
Well, you can say thanks.
It just don't seem right.
What don't?
Brigade wanting' to stay the night here.
It seems he'd be more in a hurry to get to Santa Cruz.
- Maybe he figures a Mescalero...
- No, it ain't that.
It's somethin' else.
What?
I know it sounds crazy, but I think he wants Frank to catch up.
- Catch up?
- The way he's been stickin' to open country.
Staying to the flat instead of the ridges.
Seemin' not to care whether or not he's bein' followed.
But why would he want to fool a thing like that?
I don't know.
Could be he figures it'd make it just that much harder on us.
- On us?
- We're ridin' with 'im.
Frank might not hold kindly to that.
He could get us killed.
I never thought about that.
One way or the other, Brigade's gotta face it out and he knows it.
Maybe we should forget about the whole thing.
Ride away alive.
We can't do that.
- Lf Frank's goin' to come down here...
- You've been up north of Socorro?
- Some.
- I got a place up there.
- You got a place?
- It ain't much.
Not yet, it ain't.
Got my herd to build, wire to stretch'n such.
Only trouble is, if I ride back there, there's them that'll see me hang.
Unless, of course, the territory was to drop the charge.
Oh, that word.
- Yeah, amnesty.
- Amnesty.
So, we get ole' Billy Boy back to Santa Cruz and be just that close and never...
Never havin' to look over your shoulder again and sleep with a gun in your hand.
Going off dead inside when you see a man wearing' tin on him.
We just come too far, Whit.
Can't turn back now.
We just can't.
Will he be all right?
If I could get 'im on his feet he would.
The leg isn't broken.
- He can't get up?
- Won't.
Got it in his head he's down for good.
Hurts him to stand.
Won't even try.
There's nothing you can do?
Stay with 'im.
Let him know he's not alone.
I'm sorry about everything.
I know I'm a lot of trouble.
You...
You took an awful chance out there.
Seemed like a good idea.
Hi, boy.
I guess I always knew.
- Knew?
- That it would end like this.
My husband didn't want me to come out here.
Put in for a transfer the day we took over the swing stop at the junction, for a town job.
Every month it was supposed to come through.
It never did.
I tried to tell myself it didn't matter, that my place was with him.
Then I found myself watching for coaches and hoping.
He must've noticed.
He asked me to go on to Bisbee and wait for him.
Said I'd be safe there.
As much as I wanted to, I couldn't do it.
I couldn't leave him alone.
- He was a good man.
- Yes, ma'am, he'd have to be.
They told me why you're taking the boy to Santa Cruz.
Did they?
- They'll hang him, won't they?
- Yes, ma'am.
- He's so young.
- He killed a man.
- It doesn't bother you?
Bringing him in.
- No, ma'am.
You just don't seem like the kind that would hunt a man for money.
I am.
Good night, Mr. Brigade.
Mrs. Lane,
I made a place for you inside the wall.
- You'll be safe there.
- Thank you.
Good night.
She's sure something, ain't she?
Said she was married to that station fella near a year.
Can you imagine having her around all that time?
All them days.
Nights.
Just thinking on it gives me a way down shiver.
I wonder what she'll do now, she's without a man?
Find another.
But if she loved that fella hard enough, she'd stay a widow, wouldn't she?
Ain't the kind.
Not her.
Some are.
Some can get along without.
Not her.
She's the kind that's got a need.
Deep lonely need only a man can get at.
How do you know?
I've seen it in her eyes.
In her eyes.
Is Brigade still trying to get that animal up?
Yeah.
He was at it all night.
Why doesn't he shoot him and get it over with?
He said he wanted to wait.
He claims animals are like people.
Feel the morning sun on them makes forget all the hurt they got.
Makes them want to start over.
There are sure times he doesn't act like a man that makes his way killing.
Miss Lane.
Could I have a word?
Something you ought to know.
My brother, Frank, he'll be along most any time now.
Won't anywhere be safe once he gets here.
And you being a woman, I'd hate to see anything happen to you.
- Is that all?
- No.
No ma'am, what I was thinking was,
I'd see to it that Frank made it right by you if you was to help me.
- Help you?
- Yes, ma'am.
Yeah.
I've been watching Brigade ever since the junction.
The way he looks at you, kind of hungry.
You shouldn't have any trouble getting yourself close against him.
- Close enough to help me get safe away.
- I don't understand.
- Come on, sure you do.
- She said she didn't.
You can't blame a man for trying.
- Is this what you wanted her to get for you?
- I sure could use it.
We're moving out.
I'll be riding your horse.
- What am I suppose to do?
- Walk.
I don't think so.
You let me go.
If you don't, I'll swear I'll cut you in two.
No, you won't, Billy Boy.
Not unless you jacked that saddle gun.
That's my Winchester you got.
You pump a round into it, did you?
'Cause if you didn't, you got a hammer hanging over an empty chamber.
I shot myself in the leg once riding.
I never carried it around under the pin since.
You're lying.
There's one way to find out.
Pull the trigger.
That is if you think you have time to jack that gun before I blow your brains out.
Go ahead, pull.
Or ain't you used to killing a man from the front?
- You just put it down, Billy Boy.
- No.
I said, drop it.
I could've swore.
Looks like we don't have to shoot him, either.
The woman, she's falling behind.
- Now, Boone, back there...
- Yeah?
Thanks for getting that gun out of my middle.
I couldn't let him shoot you without a chance.
Why?
You'd have had Billy.
Never would've enjoyed being a free man done you that way.
Thought maybe you was afraid you might need me with Frank to catch up.
- It crossed my mind.
- I figured it did.
- Top of that hump, we'll be in Santa Cruz.
- We?
Look, Brigade.
You and me going against each other, it just ain't right.
I said to Whit more than once, I'd give most anything if we could work out something short of killing.
Such as?
Them dollars they're giving you to bring Billy in.
I'll match them, double if you say.
It'll take me awhile, but I'll get it.
How?
Stopping coaches?
Killing?
- That's all over with.
- Is it?
Gotta be.
A man gets half way, he ought to have something of his own to belong to and be proud of.
- They say that.
- I've got me a place.
Gonna run beef.
Work the ground.
Be able to walk down the street like anybody.
All I need is Billy.
I set out to take him to Santa Cruz.
I full intend to do it.
Well, I just wanted you to know how it was.
Way I look at it, it ain't near as hard for a man if he knows why he's gonna die.
They stayed here the night.
Can't be more than a half a day ahead.
- That'd put them in Santa Cruz by morning.
- Could, but it won't.
Should have known all along.
Brigade knows we're after him.
But he's still taking his time moving in the clear, not covering his tracks.
It's been plain from the first.
So plain I couldn't see it.
But I don't follow.
It ain't Billy he wants.
It's me.
But Billy's the one with the bounty on him.
It ain't the money Brigade wants.
Not the money at all.
I did him a hurt once.
Long ago.
So long I almost forgot.
And all the time I was thinking that was why he was taking Billy in to hang.
To get even.
That isn't it.
He knew I'd come after him.
He wants me to catch up.
And I think I know where.
Let's let the boys rest their horses.
There's no hurry.
He'll be waiting.
Hang tree.
You can be glad it ain't long ago, Billy Boy.
It was, like as not Brigade here to hang you over that jury limb and have it over.
Gone dead now, but in its time, more than one danced their last on that.
Ain't that right, Brigade?
- Brigade...
- I heard you.
Come to think of it, you strung a few there yourself.
You talk too much.
We'll night at the river bed.
Touchy, touchy.
- Quit it.
- It's something to do.
I said, quit it.
Don't you ever get tired of holding that gun on me?
It won't be long now.
I'll have you in Santa Cruz by morning.
Brigade figures to split the bounty with you, does he?
- Nope.
- Then why are you helping him?
- I ain't.
- You're holding a gun.
- I got a reason.
- Such as what?
- Amnesty.
- Amnesty?
- Some word, ain't it?
- What's it mean?
Free.
Free?
That's what we'll go as soon as we get you to Cruz.
Me and Boone.
We ain't always seen eye to eye to the law.
If we get you next to a rope, it'll make us even.
We can start over.
- Boone's got a place...
- Hey did you...
You mean they'd do that just for bringing me in to hang?
We got a poster on it.
I guess that kind gives me a worth, don't it?
To us it does.
What about Brigade?
What about him?
He's the one that caught me.
I don't figure he's going to hold kind to you taking me away from him.
I thought about that.
I thought about that a lot.
It really don't matter.
You ain't going to get me to Santa Cruz anyway.
If Frank was coming, he'd have been here by now.
Maybe.
It's a shame about that woman.
There's going to be a lot of killing if Frank gets here.
Not knowing she's along, you can't tell what's going to happen.
Frank wouldn't shoot a woman, would he?
Not only Frank.
There's the boys.
I never thought about that.
Whit?
Whit.
Why don't you let the hammer down nice and easy on that gun and the two of us ride right on out of here.
Yeah.
You wouldn't want to see a woman all shot up and dead, would you?
- Well, no.
- Well, then?
- Then what, Billy?
- You're every place, ain't you?
He was trying to talk me out of my gun.
Where's Mrs. Lane?
Down there by the river bank.
If he tries to talk that gun away from you again, let him have it.
Yeah.
- I didn't mean to startle you.
- I couldn't sleep.
I'm glad.
We'll be in Santa Cruz tomorrow, won't we?
If we get an early start, we should be there by noon.
And what then, Mrs. Lane?
For you, I mean?
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
This country's nowhere for a woman without a man.
I'd be obliged to look after you.
- I can manage.
- I'm sure of that.
The first I saw you at the junction, I said to Whit,
"There's a woman who can take care of herself. "
I saw it in your face.
The way you hold your head.
The way you walk.
All over proud of being a woman.
Not afraid to let a man look at you.
Think what he wants.
Burn inside to put his arms around you.
Not like some I know.
Always acting like it was Sunday.
Thinking every man who looks at them wants them.
No, sir.
A man had you, Mrs. Lane, he'd never know a black lonesome night.
- Good night, Mr. Boone.
- Mrs. Lane.
If you're counting on Brigade being any help to you, better forget it.
He won't be going all the way to Santa Cruz.
I got to kill him.
Hang tree.
So that's what they call it.
Mr. Brigade,
I try very hard, but there's some things I just don't understand.
Back at Dobe, when Billy had that gun on you,
- Boone saved your life, didn't he?
- Yes, ma'am.
Then why would he want to kill you now?
- He told you that?
- Yes.
- Why?
- He wants Billy.
Billy?
You mean you'd kill each other for bounty?
- Like two dogs fighting over a bone.
- You could say that.
- I see.
- No, ma'am, you don't.
It's not Billy I want or any of the others I've had to ride down to make my way on the one man I'm after.
And will he bring enough bounty to see you through to your next dead man?
Mrs. Lane.
Long ago I was the Sheriff of Santa Cruz.
I rode Billy's brother Frank in for murder.
The jury found him part guilty, sent him to Yuma.
He swore that when he got out he'd get even.
He was young, wild.
I had a wife.
Looked a lot like you.
She wanted me to turn and run.
Keep running.
Pleaded with me.
I couldn't do it.
Word came that Frank was out.
I waited for him in the street.
He didn't come.
When I got home, my wife had gone.
Frank had taken her.
Brought her here.
- Here?
- Yes, ma'am.
He hung her.
Whit.
Get on that rise, when you see dust, high end it back here.
- Sam.
- Yeah.
When are we going to kill Brigade?
- Soon.
- You know, I've been thinking, he ain't a man you can go straight at.
We have to figure some way to get him between us.
- Can't kill a man like Brigade from behind.
- We could stand off.
I don't hold to ending a man with a long gun.
Don't worry, when the time comes, I'll take care of him.
I hope so.
I hate to see you lose your place up Socorro way.
- I'll be mighty proud to work for you.
- Work for me?
I plowed when I was young.
I ain't much with chickens, but I can slop pigs with the best of them.
How long you and me been riding together?
- About two years.
- More like five.
So?
So you ain't going to be working for me.
You're going to be a partner.
- Partner?
- Right down the middle.
How come?
'Cause I like you.
I never knew that.
- Now get on that rise.
- Yes, sir.
I'd like to say it again, Mrs. Lane.
I'd be obliged to look after you.
I could help you bury Brigade and live happy ever after, is that it?
There's some things a man just can't ride around.
Hey!
Frank's coming!
- How far back?
- A mile, maybe less.
I saw him from the top of the rim.
- Do we cut and run, or don't we?
- This is as far as I go for now.
Figured it was.
Whit, look after Mrs. Lane.
Should have known it when you wouldn't swing north to Bisbee.
It's been Frank all along.
- You...
You wait...
- Shut up.
I said shut up!
Last night I heard you tell Mrs. Lane why you've been hunting for Frank.
So?
Billy can wait.
Me and Whit will be covering you in the brush.
Look, Boone.
- This won't change anything.
- I never figured it would.
Get up on your animal, Billy.
- But I...
- Do like I tell you.
Look, Brigade.
You know you ain't got a chance.
One.
You.
What are you going to do?
That's up to Frank.
That's close enough.
You're fixing to have a little hanging I see.
I thought that tree would be dead and down by now.
Cut him loose.
- You're standing alone.
- I wouldn't count on it.
- He's got two Winchesters behind him.
- Is that so?
- So what do we do now?
- Sit there and watch your brother hang.
- You don't mean that.
- Don't I?
- He's only a boy.
- He's as old as his gun.
It's me you're after.
You got no quarrel with Billy.
What quarrel did you have with her?
That was a long time ago.
I'd almost forgot.
- A man can do that.
- Don't let him do it, Frank.
I done you enough.
Don't make me kill you.
- I can't let you do that.
- Stop me.
Any shooting and that horse will go right out from under Billy.
If his neck don't snap, you can cut him down in time.
That is, if you're alive.
You don't leave a man much choice, do you?
I thought for a minute you were gonna let him swing.
So did I.
Brigade.
I don't suppose there's any way of getting Billy from you?
Aside from going over you?
Come and get him.
Better get Whit to catch up Billy's horse, unless you want him to walk to Santa Cruz.
You mean I can have him?
Take him.
I got no more use for him.
You heard what he said, Whit!
Get them horses!
Yes, sir.
Funny how a thing can seem one way, and then turn out altogether something else.
You said you wanted to start over.
I hope so.
'Cause if you don't, I'll be the one who comes looking to find you.
- I'll remember that.
- Good luck.
Mr. Brigade.
- Will you be going on to Santa Cruz?
- No, ma'am.
- I think I understand.
- I figured you would.
Good bye, Mr. Brigade.
Well, that figures.
I hear him.
Mornin', Brigade.
I've been looking to find you, Billy.
I know.
I've been seein' your dust for three days.
I figured it better to let you catch up and have it out'n over.
The others?
Where are they?
They went on ahead.
I told 'em I'd be along after I buried you.
Mount up.
We're going back.
You know I can't do that.
It's the only thing you can do.
If I was to ride south with you, there's them that'd see me hang.
You left a dead man in the street in Santa Cruz.
- Fair fight.
- He was killed from behind.
Like the others.
I don't know how much they're paying you to bring me in, but it ain't near enough.
I'd hunt you free.
Let's go.
I guess that makes me out a liar, don't it?
Them boys didn't go ahead.
They're scattered all in rocks.
There's no way for you to get outta here.
Now, look, Brigade,
I got no quarrel with you.
If you ride outta here, I'd forget about this whole thing.
What's one more bounty to a man like you?
Money's got blood on it.
We're goin' on back.
You don't understand.
I give the word, you're dead.
Maybe.
But before I hit the ground I'll blow you half in two.
- You're bluffin'.
- Am I?
Call 'em off, Billy.
Hold your fire boys.
It ain't gonna work.
I knew I should'a done it my way.
In the back?
Charlie!
Charlie!
You all find my brother Frank.
You tell him what's happened.
Tell 'em Ben Brigade's takin' me to Santa Cruz.
You hear me, Charlie?
Well, you tell him that.
He'll know what to do.
Now, get goin'.
You better put them on tight.
Hop on.
You know my brother, Frank?
Heard of 'im.
Then I guess you know you ain't gonna get me to Santa Cruz.
Wells Junction.
There's nobody out'n about.
You don't suppose Frank'n the boys circled high around and are waitin' do you?
Let's see.
- Anybody home?
- Stay right there.
- Drop the gun.
- Better had.
Well, I'll be.
Ben Brigade.
Hello, Boone.
Fancy running' into you in all this empty,
I saw you come up over that rise.
Couldn't quite make you out.
A man can't be too careful in this part of the country.
You're a long way from home.
- No more than you.
- I can go back.
- You must be Billy John.
- So?
I heard a lot about you!
You ain't as small as I thought you'd be.
You staying for the night, or going to Santa Cruz?
Did I say I was goin' to Santa Cruz?
Not in words.
I came through there a while back.
I heard that Billy John had killed a man.
The man knotting' tie rope said it was murder.
- Where is the station man?
- He ain't here.
Had some of his animals loose-herded up on that flat.
Went out this mornin' to gather 'em before the Eastbound come through,
- but they beat 'em to it.
- Who's they?
Freeds, Mescaleros, Sunday-school teachers, for all I know.
He went to find 'em.
- Left you here to tend the station?
- Not exactly.
Whit!
The woman, bring 'er out here.
Never mind.
Now you all get your horses and ride on outta here.
Now, look, lady.
Just do like I say.
That's no way to act.
Me and Whit's been doin' you a service, with your man away.
- Tell her we ain't here to harm her.
- Why are you here, Boone?
A man needs a reason to ride this country.
You got a reason?
Don't matter.
I want you gone.
All of you.
But ma'am, we can't do that.
Just up and ride off.
No tellin' when your man'll find them horses'n get back.
Besides, woman ain't safe out here alone.
- She won't be alone.
- No?
No, the Westbound's comin'.
They're in a hurry.
Whit, fetch up them animals in the corral.
We can make up the team change for the lady before we go.
I don't need your help.
No, but the folks on the coach do.
They ain't had a meal hot or square since they left Santa Cruz.
If I were you I'd look to feed 'em.
I know what you're thinkin'.
You're thinkin' that me and Whit's been sittin' here waitin' for the coach to pull in.
Waitin' to take off with the Fargo box or somethin' pure awful like that.
- Well, you're wrong.
- Am I?
Plum.
Mescalero.
Don't come out here!
Nothin for a woman to see.
What call they got to do a thing like that?
Murder raid.
That or they wanted the horses.
- Butchers.
- Boone, that dust boil.
You figure they drew off when they sighted the station?
Looks that way.
Enough of 'em, they'll try to scald us out before dark.
Whatta we gonna do?
- Only thing we can, bury the dead and wait.
- Wait?
If they catch us in the open, come night, we wouldn't have a chance.
We'll fort up in the station till morning.
What about Billy?
What about him?
Well, him sitting out there between you and Santa Cruz, kinda makes the hill higher to climb, doesn't it?
You could swing north, take Billy to Bisbee.
- A rope's a rope.
- He's going to Santa Cruz.
- No matter what.
- No matter what.
If you ask me, it ain't Christian.
Covering these folks without reading over them.
I don't know if it's gonna help them now.
Yeah.
- Whit.
- Yeah?
- I shouldn't think it like this.
- What?
Look out there.
War signs.
Well, we got a treaty with the Mescaleros, ain't we?
Just words on paper.
Yes, we been gettin' along.
I knew a man once.
Got along with his wife.
One day she up'n shot him.
Dead?
- But why?
- Got mad.
Mescalero, they're mad.
But we ain't done nothin' to 'em.
We're white.
That's good enough.
Come on.
Sam.
You figure Brigade knows why we're here?
Not yet.
Guess there ain't no way him finding out, is there?
Only one.
I'm gonna tell him.
- Tell him?
- Tonight.
If I were you,
I'd hold onto that shovel 'cause likely as not we're gonna be needin' it again.
Soon.
- I make it three.
- Four.
- Coffee?
- Thank you.
My husband should have been back by now.
He said he'd keep after as far as Dry Fork.
If he hadn't picked up the animals by then, he'd double on back.
That would have put him here before dark.
He likely got cut off.
- He wouldn't leave me here alone.
- Not if he had a choice.
You think something's happened to him?
I didn't say that.
There's any number of reasons for his not getting back.
Even if he found the horses he'd have to loose-herd them clear here by himself.
Could take him half the night, maybe longer.
He never shoulda gone.
You'd have him lose his animals and not go after them.
Not talkin' about animals, talkin about you.
- Me?
- He left you alone.
I can take care of myself.
If you were mine, you wouldn't have to.
Meaning?
Meaning I'd never of brought ya here in the first place.
Nowhere for a woman.
Running a swing station is my husband's job, Mr. Brigade.
He should find a better one.
Like bounty hunting, for instance.
You cook good coffee.
Mr. Brigade...
You'd better get some sleep.
We'll be leaving first thing come morning.
- Leaving?
- Three days'll put us in Santa Cruz.
But I...
If your husband's not back, we'll swing toward Dry Fork, pick him up on the way.
- Well, I...
- Good night, Mrs. Lane.
Best cooking' I had in a long time.
Mighty handsome woman, Mrs. Lane.
Don't look like they're gonna try us, does it?
- Brigade?
- Yeah.
You were sayin, a man needs a reason to ride this country.
You were right.
I don't suppose you heard about the poster they got out on Billy John.
Poster?
Gotten tacked to near every tree 'n stump 'tween here'n Rio Bravo.
Claims the territory'll grant amnesty to anybody that brings Billy in.
You know you won't believe this.
But me'n Whit went near a week before we found out what that word amnesty meant.
A fella selling' Bibles over in Santa Cruz told us.
It means the law's willin' to drop any and all charges it's got against a man.
All he's gotta do is turn the key on Billy.
I know that ain't the reason you rode 'im down.
But that's why me and Whit's gonna tag along with you.
We figured that when Billy's brother Frank, hears that you're ridin' him in to hang, he's gonna come killing'.
But, if anybody can get Billy safe to Santa Cruz, it's you.
If I do.
Then there's only one man standin' between me'n starting' life clean over.
Make doubly sure Whit keeps that Winchester on Billy John.
We wouldn't wanna lose 'im, would we?
We sure wouldn't.
Brigade!
Brigade!
We can't take those animals along.
It'd slow us down.
- But we're responsible...
- They'll eat their way to the next swing stop.
Time comes, you can pick them up there.
Got out that black for you to ride.
The sooner you get on it, the sooner we'll get clear from here.
Don't look like you and Mrs. Lane get along too well.
We'll stay on the stage road to Dry Fork.
- Dry Fork?
- Swing south from there.
That's the long way, ain't it?
- Gotta pick up the station man.
- Or what's left of 'im.
Whit's right.
If he had been alive, that fella'd be back by now.
We're goin' to Dry Fork.
Not right away we ain't.
Look.
- What do they want?
- They'll get around to it.
- What's he doing?
- He wants to talk.
Stay here.
He's got a horse.
Wants to make a trade.
For what?
You.
He said they'd been seein' you here.
He wants to take you for his squaw.
So what we do now?
- Play along with 'em.
- Play along with...
If we don't we're apt to stir up every buck in the country.
Come on.
- Just do like I tell you.
- Brigade.
Can't abide to see a woman's hair hangin' from a Mescalero war-lance.
I hope you know what you're doin'.
- He'll offer his trade.
I'll turn him down.
- Then?
With any luck they'll ride off.
Out in the hills, try to figure how else to get you away from us.
I see.
No matter what happens don't break down in front of 'em.
If you do, they'll take it wrong.
Shame 'em.
I don't scare easy, Mr. Brigade.
I hope not.
That tears it.
Looks like you won.
They'll be back if they want her bad enough.
I thought you didn't scare, Mrs. Lane.
That was my husband's horse.
Too bad about the woman.
She sure is takin' it hard.
I tried to tell her it wasn't for certain her man was dead.
She wouldn't listen.
The way they treated 'em on the coach, I don't hardly blame her.
I can't get over the way them Indians wanted to trade her for a horse.
If it'd be me, I'd give a whole herd.
She's about the best all over good-lookin' woman I ever seen.
- She ain't ugly.
- She sure ain't.
You got a reason for stayin' in this open country?
Seems to me you'd keep a hill close to your back, considering.
The way I see it, brother Frank can't be too far back.
Talk had 'im up Val Verde way.
Heard about Billy, he wouldn't waste any time.
Likely ride out the night.
To do that, it'd put 'im behind us even sooner.
Dobe Corral's just over that rise.
We're headin' there.
I don't think Frank's gonna come along before...
I'm not talkin' about Frank.
I'm talking about Mescaleros.
Medicine country.
They figure to jump us up it'll be somewhere soon.
Maybe them four at Wells Junction went for more?
- I know they did.
- How can you be sure?
'Cause there they are.
Keep movin'.
You sure Dobe's just over that rise?
Positive.
Ain't we gonna hurry?
Yeah, now!
Move!
Take her out.
Get him!
Sure beats all, don't it?
What a man'll put himself through to get his hands on a woman.
I can't blame 'im though.
Haul their dead to the crest of the hill.
- Does that hurt you?
- It'll be just fine.
Yes, ma'am.
Better get it cleaned up.
There's five horses.
Musta' pulled out early this morning.
What we do now, Frank?
- We keep after them.
- But our animals are nearly dead.
Said we keep after 'em.
This'll keep the chill off.
Well, you can say thanks.
It just don't seem right.
What don't?
Brigade wanting' to stay the night here.
It seems he'd be more in a hurry to get to Santa Cruz.
- Maybe he figures a Mescalero...
- No, it ain't that.
It's somethin' else.
What?
I know it sounds crazy, but I think he wants Frank to catch up.
- Catch up?
- The way he's been stickin' to open country.
Staying to the flat instead of the ridges.
Seemin' not to care whether or not he's bein' followed.
But why would he want to fool a thing like that?
I don't know.
Could be he figures it'd make it just that much harder on us.
- On us?
- We're ridin' with 'im.
Frank might not hold kindly to that.
He could get us killed.
I never thought about that.
One way or the other, Brigade's gotta face it out and he knows it.
Maybe we should forget about the whole thing.
Ride away alive.
We can't do that.
- Lf Frank's goin' to come down here...
- You've been up north of Socorro?
- Some.
- I got a place up there.
- You got a place?
- It ain't much.
Not yet, it ain't.
Got my herd to build, wire to stretch'n such.
Only trouble is, if I ride back there, there's them that'll see me hang.
Unless, of course, the territory was to drop the charge.
Oh, that word.
- Yeah, amnesty.
- Amnesty.
So, we get ole' Billy Boy back to Santa Cruz and be just that close and never...
Never havin' to look over your shoulder again and sleep with a gun in your hand.
Going off dead inside when you see a man wearing' tin on him.
We just come too far, Whit.
Can't turn back now.
We just can't.
Will he be all right?
If I could get 'im on his feet he would.
The leg isn't broken.
- He can't get up?
- Won't.
Got it in his head he's down for good.
Hurts him to stand.
Won't even try.
There's nothing you can do?
Stay with 'im.
Let him know he's not alone.
I'm sorry about everything.
I know I'm a lot of trouble.
You...
You took an awful chance out there.
Seemed like a good idea.
Hi, boy.
I guess I always knew.
- Knew?
- That it would end like this.
My husband didn't want me to come out here.
Put in for a transfer the day we took over the swing stop at the junction, for a town job.
Every month it was supposed to come through.
It never did.
I tried to tell myself it didn't matter, that my place was with him.
Then I found myself watching for coaches and hoping.
He must've noticed.
He asked me to go on to Bisbee and wait for him.
Said I'd be safe there.
As much as I wanted to, I couldn't do it.
I couldn't leave him alone.
- He was a good man.
- Yes, ma'am, he'd have to be.
They told me why you're taking the boy to Santa Cruz.
Did they?
- They'll hang him, won't they?
- Yes, ma'am.
- He's so young.
- He killed a man.
- It doesn't bother you?
Bringing him in.
- No, ma'am.
You just don't seem like the kind that would hunt a man for money.
I am.
Good night, Mr. Brigade.
Mrs. Lane,
I made a place for you inside the wall.
- You'll be safe there.
- Thank you.
Good night.
She's sure something, ain't she?
Said she was married to that station fella near a year.
Can you imagine having her around all that time?
All them days.
Nights.
Just thinking on it gives me a way down shiver.
I wonder what she'll do now, she's without a man?
Find another.
But if she loved that fella hard enough, she'd stay a widow, wouldn't she?
Ain't the kind.
Not her.
Some are.
Some can get along without.
Not her.
She's the kind that's got a need.
Deep lonely need only a man can get at.
How do you know?
I've seen it in her eyes.
In her eyes.
Is Brigade still trying to get that animal up?
Yeah.
He was at it all night.
Why doesn't he shoot him and get it over with?
He said he wanted to wait.
He claims animals are like people.
Feel the morning sun on them makes forget all the hurt they got.
Makes them want to start over.
There are sure times he doesn't act like a man that makes his way killing.
Miss Lane.
Could I have a word?
Something you ought to know.
My brother, Frank, he'll be along most any time now.
Won't anywhere be safe once he gets here.
And you being a woman, I'd hate to see anything happen to you.
- Is that all?
- No.
No ma'am, what I was thinking was,
I'd see to it that Frank made it right by you if you was to help me.
- Help you?
- Yes, ma'am.
Yeah.
I've been watching Brigade ever since the junction.
The way he looks at you, kind of hungry.
You shouldn't have any trouble getting yourself close against him.
- Close enough to help me get safe away.
- I don't understand.
- Come on, sure you do.
- She said she didn't.
You can't blame a man for trying.
- Is this what you wanted her to get for you?
- I sure could use it.
We're moving out.
I'll be riding your horse.
- What am I suppose to do?
- Walk.
I don't think so.
You let me go.
If you don't, I'll swear I'll cut you in two.
No, you won't, Billy Boy.
Not unless you jacked that saddle gun.
That's my Winchester you got.
You pump a round into it, did you?
'Cause if you didn't, you got a hammer hanging over an empty chamber.
I shot myself in the leg once riding.
I never carried it around under the pin since.
You're lying.
There's one way to find out.
Pull the trigger.
That is if you think you have time to jack that gun before I blow your brains out.
Go ahead, pull.
Or ain't you used to killing a man from the front?
- You just put it down, Billy Boy.
- No.
I said, drop it.
I could've swore.
Looks like we don't have to shoot him, either.
The woman, she's falling behind.
- Now, Boone, back there...
- Yeah?
Thanks for getting that gun out of my middle.
I couldn't let him shoot you without a chance.
Why?
You'd have had Billy.
Never would've enjoyed being a free man done you that way.
Thought maybe you was afraid you might need me with Frank to catch up.
- It crossed my mind.
- I figured it did.
- Top of that hump, we'll be in Santa Cruz.
- We?
Look, Brigade.
You and me going against each other, it just ain't right.
I said to Whit more than once, I'd give most anything if we could work out something short of killing.
Such as?
Them dollars they're giving you to bring Billy in.
I'll match them, double if you say.
It'll take me awhile, but I'll get it.
How?
Stopping coaches?
Killing?
- That's all over with.
- Is it?
Gotta be.
A man gets half way, he ought to have something of his own to belong to and be proud of.
- They say that.
- I've got me a place.
Gonna run beef.
Work the ground.
Be able to walk down the street like anybody.
All I need is Billy.
I set out to take him to Santa Cruz.
I full intend to do it.
Well, I just wanted you to know how it was.
Way I look at it, it ain't near as hard for a man if he knows why he's gonna die.
They stayed here the night.
Can't be more than a half a day ahead.
- That'd put them in Santa Cruz by morning.
- Could, but it won't.
Should have known all along.
Brigade knows we're after him.
But he's still taking his time moving in the clear, not covering his tracks.
It's been plain from the first.
So plain I couldn't see it.
But I don't follow.
It ain't Billy he wants.
It's me.
But Billy's the one with the bounty on him.
It ain't the money Brigade wants.
Not the money at all.
I did him a hurt once.
Long ago.
So long I almost forgot.
And all the time I was thinking that was why he was taking Billy in to hang.
To get even.
That isn't it.
He knew I'd come after him.
He wants me to catch up.
And I think I know where.
Let's let the boys rest their horses.
There's no hurry.
He'll be waiting.
Hang tree.
You can be glad it ain't long ago, Billy Boy.
It was, like as not Brigade here to hang you over that jury limb and have it over.
Gone dead now, but in its time, more than one danced their last on that.
Ain't that right, Brigade?
- Brigade...
- I heard you.
Come to think of it, you strung a few there yourself.
You talk too much.
We'll night at the river bed.
Touchy, touchy.
- Quit it.
- It's something to do.
I said, quit it.
Don't you ever get tired of holding that gun on me?
It won't be long now.
I'll have you in Santa Cruz by morning.
Brigade figures to split the bounty with you, does he?
- Nope.
- Then why are you helping him?
- I ain't.
- You're holding a gun.
- I got a reason.
- Such as what?
- Amnesty.
- Amnesty?
- Some word, ain't it?
- What's it mean?
Free.
Free?
That's what we'll go as soon as we get you to Cruz.
Me and Boone.
We ain't always seen eye to eye to the law.
If we get you next to a rope, it'll make us even.
We can start over.
- Boone's got a place...
- Hey did you...
You mean they'd do that just for bringing me in to hang?
We got a poster on it.
I guess that kind gives me a worth, don't it?
To us it does.
What about Brigade?
What about him?
He's the one that caught me.
I don't figure he's going to hold kind to you taking me away from him.
I thought about that.
I thought about that a lot.
It really don't matter.
You ain't going to get me to Santa Cruz anyway.
If Frank was coming, he'd have been here by now.
Maybe.
It's a shame about that woman.
There's going to be a lot of killing if Frank gets here.
Not knowing she's along, you can't tell what's going to happen.
Frank wouldn't shoot a woman, would he?
Not only Frank.
There's the boys.
I never thought about that.
Whit?
Whit.
Why don't you let the hammer down nice and easy on that gun and the two of us ride right on out of here.
Yeah.
You wouldn't want to see a woman all shot up and dead, would you?
- Well, no.
- Well, then?
- Then what, Billy?
- You're every place, ain't you?
He was trying to talk me out of my gun.
Where's Mrs. Lane?
Down there by the river bank.
If he tries to talk that gun away from you again, let him have it.
Yeah.
- I didn't mean to startle you.
- I couldn't sleep.
I'm glad.
We'll be in Santa Cruz tomorrow, won't we?
If we get an early start, we should be there by noon.
And what then, Mrs. Lane?
For you, I mean?
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
This country's nowhere for a woman without a man.
I'd be obliged to look after you.
- I can manage.
- I'm sure of that.
The first I saw you at the junction, I said to Whit,
"There's a woman who can take care of herself. "
I saw it in your face.
The way you hold your head.
The way you walk.
All over proud of being a woman.
Not afraid to let a man look at you.
Think what he wants.
Burn inside to put his arms around you.
Not like some I know.
Always acting like it was Sunday.
Thinking every man who looks at them wants them.
No, sir.
A man had you, Mrs. Lane, he'd never know a black lonesome night.
- Good night, Mr. Boone.
- Mrs. Lane.
If you're counting on Brigade being any help to you, better forget it.
He won't be going all the way to Santa Cruz.
I got to kill him.
Hang tree.
So that's what they call it.
Mr. Brigade,
I try very hard, but there's some things I just don't understand.
Back at Dobe, when Billy had that gun on you,
- Boone saved your life, didn't he?
- Yes, ma'am.
Then why would he want to kill you now?
- He told you that?
- Yes.
- Why?
- He wants Billy.
Billy?
You mean you'd kill each other for bounty?
- Like two dogs fighting over a bone.
- You could say that.
- I see.
- No, ma'am, you don't.
It's not Billy I want or any of the others I've had to ride down to make my way on the one man I'm after.
And will he bring enough bounty to see you through to your next dead man?
Mrs. Lane.
Long ago I was the Sheriff of Santa Cruz.
I rode Billy's brother Frank in for murder.
The jury found him part guilty, sent him to Yuma.
He swore that when he got out he'd get even.
He was young, wild.
I had a wife.
Looked a lot like you.
She wanted me to turn and run.
Keep running.
Pleaded with me.
I couldn't do it.
Word came that Frank was out.
I waited for him in the street.
He didn't come.
When I got home, my wife had gone.
Frank had taken her.
Brought her here.
- Here?
- Yes, ma'am.
He hung her.
Whit.
Get on that rise, when you see dust, high end it back here.
- Sam.
- Yeah.
When are we going to kill Brigade?
- Soon.
- You know, I've been thinking, he ain't a man you can go straight at.
We have to figure some way to get him between us.
- Can't kill a man like Brigade from behind.
- We could stand off.
I don't hold to ending a man with a long gun.
Don't worry, when the time comes, I'll take care of him.
I hope so.
I hate to see you lose your place up Socorro way.
- I'll be mighty proud to work for you.
- Work for me?
I plowed when I was young.
I ain't much with chickens, but I can slop pigs with the best of them.
How long you and me been riding together?
- About two years.
- More like five.
So?
So you ain't going to be working for me.
You're going to be a partner.
- Partner?
- Right down the middle.
How come?
'Cause I like you.
I never knew that.
- Now get on that rise.
- Yes, sir.
I'd like to say it again, Mrs. Lane.
I'd be obliged to look after you.
I could help you bury Brigade and live happy ever after, is that it?
There's some things a man just can't ride around.
Hey!
Frank's coming!
- How far back?
- A mile, maybe less.
I saw him from the top of the rim.
- Do we cut and run, or don't we?
- This is as far as I go for now.
Figured it was.
Whit, look after Mrs. Lane.
Should have known it when you wouldn't swing north to Bisbee.
It's been Frank all along.
- You...
You wait...
- Shut up.
I said shut up!
Last night I heard you tell Mrs. Lane why you've been hunting for Frank.
So?
