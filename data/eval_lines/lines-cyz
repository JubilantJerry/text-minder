It licked me...
It's alive.
Sousuke, we're leaving!
Lisa, I caught a goldfish!
This wind feels strange...
Sousuke, I'm starting the car!
Did you find her?
What?
Captured by a human?
This is bad...
Very bad.
Are you dead?
You're alive!
Sousuke!
I'm going to be late!
Lisa!
I caught a goldfish.
A goldfish?
Down by the rocks.
I'm sorry, but you can't use weed killer here.
Heavens, no!
This is pure sea water.
It keeps me humidified.
As long as it's not weed killer.
Good day!
This is very bad.
What a creepy guy.
But don't you say that about strangers, Sousuke.
I won't.
Are you taking that to school?
Won't your teacher complain?
Don't worry, I'll take care of you.
She's cute!
They're using the dry dock.
Here, eat this before we get there.
Maybe she's hungry.
Want some?
Hey, my cut is gone!
Lisa, I'm going to call her Ponyo.
She's really special!
She can do magic.
She fixed my cut.
Want some ham?
Lisa, Ponyo likes ham!
That makes two of us.
Oh, no...
Disgusting!
Hurry, Lisa-san!
Such filth!
Intolerable!
Good morning!
Look, Ponyo.
There's our house.
Morning.
I'll drop you here.
Okay.
Have fun.
See you.
Morning.
Sorry, I'm late.
Could you get Noriko-san's wheelchair?
Yes.
Good morning, Sou-chan.
I'm busy, Yoshie-san.
Talk to you later.
My!
Hello, Sousuke-chan.
Can't talk now, Toki-san.
Oh, my.
Maybe the teacher will get mad.
I know!
Wait here.
I'll be back soon.
What if a cat comes?
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
See you later.
Oh, hi, Toshi-chan.
It's all right.
She'll be just fine.
Okay, thanks.
Bye-bye.
Good morning, Sensei.
Hello Sou-chan.
How are you?
Sousuke!
Kumiko-chan...
Like my dress?
Mommy got it for me.
Oh...
Let's play, Sousuke!
Not now.
I'm busy.
How come?
I told you, I'm busy.
You're no fun.
Yeah!
Ponyo!
Sousuke!
Kumiko-chan...
What's that?
You're not supposed to bring stuff.
But these trees aren't on school grounds, so that should be fine.
Show me.
Oh, a goldfish.
It's not a goldfish.
It's Ponyo.
Ponyo?
I want to see!
Promise not to tell?
I promise.
Isn't she cute?
It looks weird and fat.
My goldfish is much cuter.
It's Kumiko-chan's fault.
She was mean to you.
I'll give you some more water.
Ponyo!
You scared me.
Why, how odd.
That was Sousuke-chan's voice.
But he's supposed to be in school.
I must be hearing things.
I'm here, Yoshie-san.
I knew I heard your voice.
Do I have a secret?
Yes!
Bingo!
Okay, what color is my secret?
Red!
Good guess.
How'd you know?
Show us.
All right.
Oh, how pretty!
Very cute!
Her name is Ponyo.
She loves ham and she can do magic.
I cut my thumb, but she fixed it.
I wonder if she'd fix our legs.
We could run around just like you.
Well, I'd have to ask Ponyo first.
Can I take a look?
Sure, Toki-san.
Heavens, it has a face!
Put it back before it brings a tsunami!
You're so superstitious, Toki-san.
That's what the old stories say.
Fish like that are bad luck.
The tsunami!
It's here!
The tsunami is here!
Tsunami...
What's wrong, Toki-san?
Just look at my clothes!
Sousuke!
Sousuke!
Sousuke!
Sousuke!
Come back here and apologize to Toki-san!
Don't worry.
I'll protect you.
Sousuke.
Sousuke.
Ponyo!
Ponyo.
Sousuke.
Ponyo...
loves Sousuke!
I love you too.
Ponyo loves Sousuke!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Sousuke!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Listen, Sousuke.
Maybe it was fate.
It just can't be helped.
Ponyo was born in the sea.
She went back home.
That's all.
Anyway, let's hope that creepy guy is gone.
One lick?
Hurry, it's melting!
Not bad!
Cheer up.
Koichi will be home tonight.
He'll be disappointed if you're feeling down.
No more ocean today, okay?
Sousuke?
Time to come inside.
Do you think this bucket will help Ponyo find us?
There's only one way to find out.
Can you get that, Sousuke?
It must be Koichi.
Hello?
Yes, it's me.
Yes, I'm fine.
I can't get back tonight.
I'll signal when I'm offshore.
Okay.
Here's Lisa.
Koichi?
Yes...
What?
!
Can't you get out of it?
Fine...
Leave your wife and son up on the cliff!
I give up!
Why bother?
C'mon, Sousuke.
Let's eat out!
I want to eat here.
There he is!
Turn off the lights, Lisa.
It's Sousuke!
He's a genius.
Only five years old.
Your wife must be upset.
He says he's sorry.

LOVE AND KISSES
Don't cry, Lisa.
I won't cry.
I promised Ponyo, I'd take care of her.
I hope she isn't crying.
Okay, let's cheer up!
"I'm happy as can be..."
Ow!
Don't worry, Sousuke.
I'm sure Ponyo is fine too.
Now, let's eat.
We'll eat Koichi's dinner too!
This is all my fault.
Bringing you along to watch me was a mistake.
How often have I warned you about humans?
Their very breath is polluted.
Come, you must eat.
Can't you hear me, Brunhilde?
I want ham!
H-Ham?
!
What on earth have you been doing?
Answer me, Brunhilde!
My name's not Brunhilde.
It's Ponyo.
Ponyo?
Ponyo loves Sousuke.
I want to be human!
Human?
How could you love such disgusting creatures?
They rob the sea of life.
I was human myself... once.
I finally escaped that awful heritage...
I want hands!
I don't like this!
I want legs like Sousuke!
Of all the nonsense!
Look at me!
Hands and feet!
Look at me!
No...
Don't tell me you tasted human blood?
!
Wanna see Sousuke!
No!
His blood has deranged your DNA!
Revert...
Revert...
Go back...
Go back!
It's not working.
I need more power.
Let me out!
Be still, you evil blood.
Revert, revert!
Just like her mother...
So strong.
She should remain innocent and pure forever.
I can't hold her for long.
I need her mother's help.
No!
My elixir is too strong for you!
Shoo!
Go away!
My crab shields were weakening.
I nearly upset Nature's balance.
I must stay calm.
When I think of meeting her again, I'm starting to get nervous.
This batch should be ready.
No leaks down here.
This door is loose.
I'll fix it later.
If even one creature got in here...
Superb!
I feel the ocean's power in my very DNA.
When this well is full, the Era of the Ocean will begin.
An explosion of life to match the Cambrian Era!
This revolting era of Man will be over.
Better fix this door.
Teeth!
I'm going back to Sousuke!
A waterspout?
Captain, look there!
Tsunami!
Turn her into the waves!
What's that?
Captain!
Radio's out, the radar too!
A little girl?
She must be Sousuke's age!
Bye-bye.
See you tomorrow.
Thanks.
Take care.
Sou-chan, do you want to wait here together?
It's okay.
I'll take the shortcut.
Goodbye, Sensei.
Goodbye.
Be careful out there.
Sorry, Sousuke.
The door wouldn't open, would it?
The power's out.
Was the school okay?
Lisa-san, we'll be fine.
Go home.
Are you sure?
Don't worry.
We'll be just fine.
We're spending the night anyway.
You should go while you can.
Wait for me, Sousuke.
Yoshie-san.
Why, Sou-chan...
It's so dark, I didn't see you.
This is for you.
My, what is it?
One for you, Noriko-san.
Thank you.
Can't see a thing.
This is such foolishness!
I don't want to spend the night.
The power's on.
Oh, good.
Certainly is.
It's a goldfish!
Maybe Sou-chan's magic made the lights go on?
Extremely powerful...
Micro typhoon...
Ships should exercise extreme caution...
This TV is useless.
Those idiots couldn't forecast their way out of a paper bag.
You should go home, Sou-chan.
Your goldfish will bring us luck.
We're not afraid anymore.
Here's yours, Toki-san.
It's all wrinkled.
What is it?
Like this.
I know!
It's a grasshopper.
No, the Koganei Maru.
That's your father's ship, isn't it?
Still looks like a grasshopper.
We're leaving, Sousuke.
Say goodbye to everyone.
Goodbye, everybody.
Goodbye.
Don't let the wind blow you away!
Climb over.
The phones are out too.
The sea is puffed up!
Will the ships sink?
They're safe out at sea.
I'm sure that's where Koichi is.
I see fish, Lisa.
Fasten your seatbelt!
You've got to turn back!
People are going to the shelters.
But there are people at the senior center!
They'll be all right.
They're on the leeward side.
I've just got to get home.
You'd better go around the mountain.
Here we go, Sousuke.
No!
Stop!
Look out for that wave!
Here it comes!
Run for it, Lisa-san!
The fish are following us.
Fasten your seatbelt, Sousuke!
Hold on tight!
That wave won't quit!
A little girl fell in.
She was riding a fish.
Where?
The sea keeps rising.
Where did you see her?
Running on top of a fish.
A fish?
!
Come on, Sousuke.
Hang on, Sousuke!
We're almost home.
A little girl!
It's dangerous out here.
You'd better come with us.
Stay there, Sousuke.
Sousuke, do you know her?
Ponyo?
Yes, it's me!
It's you!
Ponyo's a little girl now, Lisa!
I made it!
Now listen, children.
No matter how strange everything seems we have to stay calm, all right?
Now be good.
Take off your rain coat, Sousuke.
Here, Ponyo.
You hold the light.
I'll bring you a towel.
C'mon, Ponyo!
It smells just like you!
Ouch!
Ponyo!
Gotcha!
Let's get you dried off.
Such pretty red hair!
But your clothes are dry...
Ponyo was a fish.
Water doesn't make her wet.
I like this!
All right!
Who wants a hot drink?
Help me with the light, Ponyo.
Coming!
Think we'll have water?
Sure!
Water!
We have a tank outside.
What about the gas?
Presto!
All right!
It's propane.
Okay, take your seats.
Okay!
Over here, Ponyo.
Sit down, like this.
Put your stuff down.
You need your hands.
I have feet!
Wow!
What are you two doing?
Her feet are like hands.
There you go.
One for you.
Thanks for the tea!
That was delicious.
What shall we do now?
I want ham!
She's crazy about ham.
Then let's eat.
But first let's start the generator.
We need electricity to talk to Koichi.
Koichi is my father.
Is he a bad sorcerer?
No, he's a ship captain.
What about your father, Ponyo?
Fujimoto!
He keeps me prisoner.
I ran away.
What about your mother?
I love my mother!
She's really scary.
Sounds like Lisa.
Can you help me, Ponyo?
Maybe the fuel's too old?
Is it clogged?
Clogged.
It's clogged there.
Success!
All bright!
Wow, Ponyo!
Antenna!
Antenna!
Did all the ships sink, Lisa?
I can't see a single light.
So loud!
What's wrong?
Even the radio is out of whack.
This is JA4LL...
JA4LL.
Come in, Koichi.
It's Lisa, Sousuke and Ponyo.
We're all doing fine.
We're going to have dinner.
Ham!
Ready?
Be careful.
It's hot.
It's not ready yet.
It takes three minutes.
Close your eyes!
Not yet!
No peeking, Ponyo.
Okay, you can look now.
And... presto!
Ham!
Good for you, Ponyo.
Lisa, Ponyo fell asleep.
Is her home far away?
I think it must be.
Look, Sousuke.
The sea is calmer.
Because Ponyo's asleep?
Look over there!
It's moving.
Someone's up there.
People from the senior center?
It's gone.
That's the peak road.
Sousuke, stay there with Ponyo.
Maybe I could get through on the mountain road.
Sosuke, I'm going to the senior center.
I'll go too.
Stay here with Ponyo.
I'm going too.
Let's take Ponyo with us.
I'm going with you!
Sousuke, our house is a lighthouse in the storm.
Everyone out there is depending on us.
Someone has to stay here.
Lots of things are happening that I don't understand.
But right now I'm worried about the people at the senior center.
Just knowing you're here will help me.
Don't worry.
I promise to come back.
Promise?
I promise.
You promised!
I love you, Sousuke.
I see the lights of the town!
Finally...
Now we can navigate.
I've never seen that town before.
Did the storm blow us to America?
That's not a mountain.
And that's no harbor...
Those are ships!
The sea is piled up into a mountain!
It's a ship graveyard.
What's going on?
We lost power!
Heave to!
Drop the sea anchor!
Aye, aye!
Something is coming!
A sea goddess?
!
The engine!
We're saved!
The engine started again.
It was Her!
Protect us from harm...
Come on, come on.
A barrier spell!
Where did she learn this?
Good heavens...
She's human!
Hey, watch out!
What are you doing?
Stop!
This is dangerous!
Stop that at once!
I'm simply trying to save your sister.
She's here.
She answered my call!
Fujimoto...
You came, my beloved.
Such a beautiful ocean.
So full of magic, like my ancient Devonian sea.
It's Ponyo!
She tasted human blood and plundered all of my elixir.
Ponyo...
What a lovely name.
It's all my fault.
She's totally beyond my control.
It's a complete mess.
She doesn't understand what she's done.
Now she's human, and she's up there with her boyfriend!
If we don't stop her, the planet is doomed!
No!
The satellites are falling.
Earth's gravitational field...
Be still...
Sousuke...
That is his name, yes?
You love your sister, don't you?
Listen, dear...
What if Ponyo really became human?
Use the old magic.
If Sousuke's love is real, she'll lose her powers forever.
But if it's not, she'll turn to sea foam!
That's where we all came from, dear.
But he's only five.
That's impossible!
Sleep well, little children.
Sousuke!
Sousuke!
Ow!
Good morning, Ponyo.
Morning, Sousuke.
We almost got flooded.
Where's Lisa?
She must be stuck someplace.
I wish we had a boat.
There's a boat!
We can't fit.
Can so.
Awesome!
The candle's bigger too.
We can fit.
This is cool.
Cool!
Grab that end.
Ready?
Ready!
She's seaworthy!
Awesome.
No leaks!
Now we fill the boiler.
The water goes in here.
It goes in the boiler.
It's like a rocket!
Everything's shipshape.
Shipshape...
Shipshape?
Shipshape!
Shipshape!
Shipshape!
Is it hot?
Hot!
Hot!
It's hot.
The candle's burning.
It's burning!
Hot!
Hot!
Hot!
It's hot.
Awesome!
We're shipshape, Sousuke!
This is great.
This is so much fun.
It's burning, Sousuke.
It's really hot.
Keep a lookout in front.
I'll steer the boat.
Okay, I'm the lookout.
There's a road.
That's the road Lisa took.
I don't see her.
You will.
She gave me her promise.
Ancient fish... from the Devonian age!
There's Bothriolepis.
That one is...
Dipnorhynchus.
Dipnorhynchus!
That one's really huge.
That's Devonynchus.
Devonynchus!
Ahoy!
A boat!
Ahoy!
They're calling us.
Ahoy!
Ow!
Pretty good, huh?
Now, Ponyo.
Hello.
That's a wonderful boat you have.
It's Lisa's little boy, Sou-chan.
It's Sousuke, not Sou-chan!
This is Ponyo.
I was a fish before.
A fish?
Ponyo...
That's a nice name.
Mister, have you seen Lisa?
Lisa-san?
She's not with you?
She's at the center.
The senior center?
This is my baby.
Oh, my.
What happened?
Is that for us?
Give me the cup, dear.
Thank you.
Let's try it.
Delicious soup!
Lisa made it.
It's for the baby.
Oh, I'm sorry.
He can't handle soup yet.
But this will help me make milk for him.
Lisa gave me her milk too.
Ponyo, may I have this?
Sure.
Thank you.
People from the town.
It's like a festival.
You there!
Do you need assistance?
Thanks, we're okay right now!
Then please follow us.
We're going to the hotel on the peak.
Okay!
Will do.
The whole town's here.
I hope everyone's all right...
Let's go, Ponyo.
Hold on a second.
Milk!
Oh, my...
Milk!
She ate up all the ham.
Thank you.
This will help me make good milk.
Can you use another candle for your boat, Sousuke-kun?
Yeah.
Ponyo will make it bigger.
Thanks.
Be careful!
Thank you both!
What is it, dear?
Don't cry.
Ponyo!
Sou-chan!
It's Sou-chan!
Amazing!
Looks cool!
Where's Lisa-san?
Isn't she with you?
I'm going to pick her up.
So she survived that wave?
Sousuke, take me with you!
Later, Kumiko-chan.
I'm busy right now.
Everyone from the center evacuated to the park.
Take care!
You can do it!
We'll send a boat for them later.
Good luck, captain!
Time for a new candle, Ponyo.
We're okay.
I have another one.
Ow!
It's still pretty hot.
Bye-bye.
Can you make this candle bigger?
All right.
Are you sleepy, Ponyo?
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Good...
It's shallow enough to walk.
A road!
It's shrinking!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo, wake up!
Sousuke...
I'm relieved.
I thought you were turning into a fish.
Lisa's car!
Ponyo, that's her car!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Here's your boat.
Your eyes are wet.
Let's find Lisa.
You forgot your wrap!
Who needs it?
Hurry up!
Look, it's a whale!
My knees don't hurt anymore!
What were we so afraid of?
Is this the Other Side?
Who cares?
It's wonderful.
Attention, please!
Gather around.
Coming!
Shall we?
It's so nice to run.
Meet you there!
The winner!
You're so fast, Kayo-san.
Quiet, everyone!
The moment of truth is at hand.
Sousuke-kun and Ponyo are almost here.
It's so romantic.
Will love triumph?
I'm so excited!
Quiet!
Very soon, you will bear witness to a sacred trial of love.
I'm asking you to wait patiently.
Fujimoto-san, you're not up to something, are you?
I hope not!
Nonsense.
He's her father.
They'll be fine if she doesn't wake up.
Now excuse me!
I'd like to believe him...
Where's Lisa-san gone to?
She's been talking with Ponyo's mother for ages.
I hope she's okay.
What are they talking about?
Let's find out.
Lisa-san!
Lisa-san!
We're all rooting for Sousuke and Ponyo!
Lisa-san!
You must be worried.
Sou-chan will be fine.
He's a strong little boy.
Thanks, everyone.
He'll need your support.
Ponyo, it's a tunnel.
Note:
STOP
I've been here before.
Ponyo?
I don't like this place.
Don't let go of my hand.
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Please don't die!
Ponyo!
Wake up, Ponyo!
Let her sleep.
I've been waiting for you, Sousuke-kun.
Lisa-san and the old ladies are waiting too.
Lisa-san?
!
Won't you come with me?
You and Ponyo.
Let's not wake her up.
Sousuke!
Don't listen to him!
He tricked everyone into going with him.
Toki-san!
But he couldn't fool me!
There's no time, I tell you.
Don't you see what's happening?
If the Moon comes any closer, we're finished!
Liar!
Is that the best you can do?
Sousuke, come here!
Listen to me, Sousuke-kun.
You're the planet's last hope.
Don't make me use force.
Ponyo!
Is this how you treat your father?
Ponyo!
Run, Sousuke!
You don't understand!
You can make it!
Jump!
Now what?
Lisa!
Sousuke!
Ponyo!
Look over there.
Where are we?
So you are Sousuke-san.
Hello.
Are you Ponyo's mother?
Yes.
I want to thank you for bringing my daughter back to me.
Sousuke-san...
Ponyo wanted to be like you, but she unleashed a terrible power.
To become human, she must be loved for who she really is.
Do you know that Ponyo was a fish?
Yes.
Your blood made her almost human.
That's right!
Ponyo licked my cut and made it better.
So that's why she changed!
Can you accept her as she is?
I'll always love Ponyo whether she's a fish, a human or in between.
Come, Ponyo.
Ponyo, Sousuke-san has promised to accept you as you are.
But first, you must give up your powers.
Can you do that?
Kiss this bubble when you return to land and Ponyo will be a little girl.
Way to go, Ponyo!
Thank you, Ponyo's mother!
Now the planet is safe again.
Splendid, Sou-chan!
Sousuke!
Sousuke!
Sousuke!
I'm grateful, Lisa.
Thank you, Gran Mamare.
Is everyone all right?
Wait, I'll get the wheelchairs.
Don't bother.
We'll walk.
It's all so exciting.
I believe this is yours.
Thanks.
I hope you'll forgive me...
Um...
May I?
Take good care of her.
It's Koichi!
Koichi!
It's Lisa!
And there's Sousuke!
Look, Ponyo.
It's Koichi!
Ponyo Ponyo Ponyo, tiny little fish
She's a little fish from the deep blue sea
Ponyo Ponyo Ponyo, she's a little girl
She's a little girl with a round tummy
Pitter patter, hop hop and jump
Look, I have legs!
I'm gonna run!
Squishy squeeze, wave them around
Look, I have hands!
Let's hold them now!
When I'm skipping with him
My heart does this dance
Munch, munch!
Kiss, hug!
Oh, he's my favorite little boy
Rosy rosy red red
Ponyo Ponyo Ponyo, tiny little fish
She's a little fish from the deep blue sea
Ponyo Ponyo Ponyo, she's a little girl
She's a little girl with a round tummy

Sosuke, come right back!
Okay
A goldfish.
It's stuck.
That was weird.
OW!
Is it dead?
It licked me.
It's alive.
Sosuke, we're Leaving!
Lisa, I caught a goldfish!
This wind feels strange.
Sosuke, I'm starting the car!
Did you find her?
What, captured by a human?
This is bad. ...very bad.
Are you dead?
You're alive!
Sosuke!
I'm going to be late!
Lisa!
I caught a goldfish.
A goldfish?
Down by the rocks.
I'm sorry, but you can't use weed killer here.
Heavens no!
This is pure sea water.
It keeps me humidified.
As Long as it's not weed killer.
Good day!
This is very bad.
What a creepy guy.
But don't you say that about strangers, Sosuke.
I won't.
Are you taking that to school?
Won't the teacher complain?
Don't worry..
I'll take care of you.
She's cute!
They're using the dry dock.
Here, eat this before we get there.
Maybe she's hungry.
Want some?
Hey, my cut is gone!
I'm going to call her Ponyo.
She's really special!
She can do magic.
She fixed my cut.
Want some ham?
- Ponyo likes ham, Lisa!
- That makes two of us.
Oh no.
Disgusting!
Hurry, Lisa!
Such filth!
Intolerable!
Good morning!
Look, Ponyo.
There's our house.
- I'll drop you here.
- Okay.
Have fun.
See you.
Morning.
Sorry I'm Late.
Could you get Noriko's wheelchair?
I
Good morning..
Sosuke.
I'm busy, Yoshie.
Talk to you Later.
My!
Hello, Sosuke.
Can't talk now, Toki
Maybe the teacher will get mad.
I know!
Wait here.
I'll be back soon.
What if a cat comes?
Stay here, I'll be right back.
See you later.
It's all right.
She'll be just fine.
Okay, thanks.
Bye-bye.
Good morning.. teacher.
Hello Sosuke.
How are you?
- Sosuke
- Kumiko.
Like my dress?
Mommy got it for me.
Oh.
Let's play, Sosuke!
Not now.
I'm busy.
How come?
- I told you, I'm busy.
- You're no fun.
Yeah!
Ponyo!
Sosuke!
Kumiko.
What's that?
You're not supposed to bring stuff.
But these trees aren't on school grounds.
Show me.
Oh, a goldfish.
It's not a goldfish.
It's Ponyo.
Ponyo?
I want to see!
Promise not to tell?
I promise.
Isn't she cute?
It looks fat.
My goldfish is lots cuter.
It's Kumiko's fault.
She was mean to you.
I'll give you some more water.
Ponyo!
You scared me.
Why, how odd.
That was Sosuke's voice.
But he's supposed to be in school
I must be hearing things.
Here I am, Yoshie.
I knew I heard your voice.
Do I have a secret?
Yes
Bingo!
Okay, what colour is my secret?
- Red!
- Red!
Good guess.
How'd you know?
Show us.
All right.
Oh, how pretty!
Very cute!
Her name is Ponyo.
She loves ham and she can do magic.
I cut my thumb, but she fixed it.
I wonder if she'd fix our Legs.
We could run around just like you.
Well ..
I'd have to ask Ponyo first.
Can I take a look?
Sure, Toki
Heavens, it has a face
Put it back before it brings a tsunami !
You're so superstitious, Toki
That's what the old stories say.
Fish like that are bad luck.
The tsunami!
It's here!
The tsunami is here!
What's wrong, Toki?
Just look at my clothes!
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Come back here and apologise!
Don't worry, I'll protect you.
Sosuke.
Sosuke.
Ponyo!
Ponyo.
Sosuke.
Ponyo.
.Loves.
..SOsuke!
I Love you too.
Ponyo loves Sosuke!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Sosuke!
Ponyo!
Listen, Sosuke.
Maybe it was fate.
It just can't be helped.
Ponyo was born in the sea.
She went back home,.
that's all
Anyway, let's hope that creepy guy is gone.
One lick?
Hurry, it's melting!
Not bad!
Cheer up.
Koichi will be home tonight.
He'll be disappointed if you're feeling down.
No more ocean today, okay?
Sosuke?
Time to come inside.
Do you think this bucket will help Ponyo find us?
There's only one way to find out.
Can you get that, Sosuke?
It must be Koichi
Hello?
Yes.. it's me.
Yes, I'm fine.
I can't get back tonight.
I'll signal when I'm offshore.
Okay.
Here's Lisa.
Koichi?
Yes.
What?
!
Can't you get out of it?
Fine.
Leave your wife and son up on the cliff!
I give up!
Why bother ?
C'mon Sosuke, Let's eat out!
I want to eat here.
There he is!
Turn Off the lights, Lisa.
It's Sosuke!
He's a genius.
Only five years old.
Your wife must be upset.
He says he's sorry.

Don't cry, Lisa.
I won't cry.
I promised Ponyo I'd take care of her.
I
I
Okay, let's cheer up!
'I'm happy as can be. .. '
OW!
.
Don't worry..
Sosuke.
I'm sure Ponyo is fine too.
Now let's eat.
We'll eat Koichi's dinner too!
This is all my fault.
Bringing you along to watch me was a mistake.
How often have I warned you about humans?
Their very breath is polluted.
Come, you must eat.
Can't you hear me..
Brunhilde?
I want ham!
Ham?
What on earth have you been doing?
Answer me, Brunhilde!
My name's not Brunhilde.
It's Ponyo.
Ponyo?
Ponyo loves Sosuke.
I want to be human!
Human?
How could you love such disgusting creatures?
They rob the sea of life.
I was human myself. .once.
I finally escaped that awful heritage.
I want hands!
I don't like this!
I want legs like Sosuke!
Of all the nonsense!
Look at me!
Hands and feet!
NO.. .don't tell me you tasted human blood!
Wanna see Sosuke!
No!
His blood has deranged your DNA!
Revert. revert.
Go back. .go back!
It's not working.
I need more power.
Let me out!
Be still, you evil blood.
Revert, revert!
Just like her mother. .so strong.
She should remain innocent and pure forever.
I can't hold her for long.
I need her mother's help.
No!
My elixir is too strong for you!
Shoo!
Go away!
My crab shields were weakening.
I nearly upset nature's balance.
I must stay calm.
When I think of meeting HER again. !
This batch should be ready.
No leaks down here.
This door is loose.
I'll fix it later.
If even one creature got in here. !
Superb!
I feel the ocean's power in my very DNA.
When this well is full, the Era of the Ocean will begin.
An explosion of life to match the Cambrian Era!
This revolting era of Man will be over.
Better fix this door.
Teeth!
I'm going back to Sosuke!
A waterspout?
Captain, look there!
- Tsunami!
- Turn her into the waves!
What's that?
Captain!
Radio's out.. the radar too!
A little girl?
She must be Sosuke's age!
- Bye-bye.
- See you tomorrow.
- Thanks.
- Take care.
Do you want to wait here for Lisa?
It's okay, I'll take the shortcut.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Be careful out there.
I
Sorry..
Sosuke.
The power's out.
The door wouldn't open, would it?
Was the school okay?
Go home..
Lisa.
We'll be fine.
Are you sure?
Don't worry, We'll be just fine.
Were spending the night anyway.
You should go while you can.
Wait for me, Sosuke.
Yoshie.
Why, Sosuke.
It's so dark, I didn't see you.
This is for you.
My, what is it?
One for you..
Noriko.
Thank you,
Can't see a thing.
This is such foolishness!
I don't want to spend the night.
- Oh good, the power's on.
- It's a goldfish!
Maybe Sosuke's magic made the lights go on?
Extremely powerful micro-typhoon.
Ships should exercise extreme caution.
This TV is useless.
Those idiots couldn't forecast their way out of a paper bag.
You should go home, Sosuke.
Your goldfish will I bring us luck.
We're not afraid now.
Here's yours, Toki.
It's all wrinkled.
What is it?
Like this.
I know!
It's a grasshopper.
No, the Koganie Maru.
That's your father's ship.
Still looks like a grasshopper.
We're leaving, Sosuke.
Say goodbye to everyone.
Goodbye, everybody.
Goodbye.
Don't let the wind blow you away!
Climb over.
The phones are out too.
The sea is puffed up!
Will the ships sink?
They're safe out at sea.
I'm sure that's where Koichi is.
- I see fish, Lisa.
- Seat belt!
You've got to turn back!
People are going to the shelters.
But there are people at the senior centre!
They'll be alright.
They're on the leeward side.
I've just got to get home.
You'd better go around the mountain.
Here we go..
Sosuke.
No!
Stop!
Look out for that wave!
Here it comes!
Run for it, Lisa!
- The fish are following us.
- Seat belt..
Sosuke!
Hold on tight!
That wave won't quit!
A little girl fell in.
She was riding a fish.
Where?
The sea keeps rising.
Where did you see her?
Running On top of a fish.
A fish!
?
Come on, Sosuke.
Hang on, Sosuke!
Were almost home.
A little girl !
Here.. you'd better come with us.
Stay there, Sosuke.
Sosuke, do you know her?
Ponyo?
Yes.. it's me!
It's you!
Ponyo's a little girl now, Lisa!
I made it !
Now I listen, children.
No matter how strange everything seems.
..we have to stay calm.
Now be good.
Take off your rain coat, Sosuke.
Here Ponyo.. you hold the light.
I'll bring you a towel
C'mon, Ponyo!
It smells just I like you!
Ouch!
Ponyo!
Gotcha!
Let's get you dried off.
Such pretty red hair!
But your clothes are dry.
Ponyo was a fish.
Water doesn't make her wet.
I like this!
All right!
Who wants a hot drink?
Help me with the light, Ponyo.
Coming!
Think we'll have water?
Sure!
Sure!
Water!
Water!
We have a tank outside.
What about the gas?
Presto!
All right!
All right!
It's propane.
Okay, take your seats.
Okay
Over here, Ponyo.
Sit down, like this.
Put your stuff down.
You need your hands.
I have feet!
wow!
What are you two doing?
Her feet are like hands.
There you go.
This is the best!
That hit the spot.
What shall we do now?
I want ham!
She's crazy about ham.
Then let's eat.
But first let's start the generator.
We need electricity to talk to Koichi
Koichi is my father.
Is he a bad sorcerer?
No, silly.
He's a ship captain.
What about your father..
Ponyo?
Fujimoto!
He keeps me prisoner.
I ran away.
What about your mother?
I love my mother!
She's really scary.
Sounds like Lisa.
Can you help me, Ponyo?
Maybe the fuel's too old?
Is it clogged?
Clogged.
It's clogged there.
Success
All bright!
Wow..
Ponyo!
Antenna!
Antenna!
Did all the ships sink, Lisa?
I can't see a single light.
So loud!
What's wrong?
Even the radio is out of whack.
This is JA4LL. .JA4LL.
Come in, Koichi
It's Lisa, Sosuke and Ponyo.
We're all doing fine.
Were going to have dinner.
Ham!
Ready?
Careful, it's hot.
It's not ready yet.
It takes three minutes.
Close your eyes!
Not yet!
No peeking, Ponyo.
Okay.. you can look now.
And. .presto!
Ham!
Good for you, Ponyo.
Ponyo went to sleep.
Is her home far away?
I think it must be.
Look Sosuke.
The sea is calmer.
Because Ponyo's asleep?
Look over there!
It's moving.
Someone's up there.
People from the senior centre?
It's gone.
That's the peak road.
Sosuke, stay there with Ponyo.
Maybe I could get through on the mountain road.
I'm going to the senior centre.
I'll go too.
Stay here with Ponyo.
I'm going too.
Let's take Ponyo with us.
I'm going with you!
Sosuke, our house is a Lighthouse in the storm.
Everyone out there is depending on us.
Someone has to stay here.
Lots of things are happening that I don't understand.
But right now I'm worried about the people at the senior centre.
Just knowing you're here will help me.
Don't worry.
I promise to come back.
Promise?
I promise.
You promised!
I love you, Sosuke.
I see the lights of the town!
Finally.
Now we can navigate.
I've never seen that town before.
Did the storm blow us to America?
That's not a mountain.
And that's no harbour.
Those are ships!
The sea is piled up into a mountain!
It's a ship graveyard.
What's going on?
We lost power!
Heave to!
Drop the sea anchor!
Aye-aye!
Something is coming!
A sea goddess!
?
The engine!
We're saved!
The engine started again.
It was Her!
Protect us from harm. .
Come on, come on.
A barrier spell!
Where did she learn this?
Good heavens. .she's human!
Hey, watch out!
What are you doing?
Stop!
This is unsafe!
Stop that at once!
I'm simply trying to save your sister.
She's here.
She answered my call!
- Fujimoto.
- You came, my beloved.
Such a beautiful ocean.
So full of magic, I like my ancient Devonian sea.
It's Ponyo!
She tasted human blood and plundered all of my elixir.
Ponyo.. .what a lovely name.
It's all my fault.
She's totally beyond my control It's complete chaos.
She doesn't understand what she's done.
Now she's human, and she's up there with her boyfriend!
If we don't stop her, the planet is doomed!
No!
The satellites are failing.
Earth's gravitational field.
Be still
Sosuke. .that is his name, yes?
You love your sister, don't you?
.
Listen, dear. ..what if Ponyo really became human?
Use the old magic.
If Sosuke's love is real, she'll lose her powers forever.
But if it's not..
she'll turn to sea foam!
That's where we all came from,. dear.
But he's Only five!
Sleep well..
little children.
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
OW!
.
Good morning..
Ponyo.
Morning..
Sosuke.
We almost got flooded.
- Where's Lisa?
- She must be stuck someplace.
I wish we had a boat.
I
There's a boat!
We can't fit.
Can so.
Awesome!
The candle's bigger too.
We can fit.
This is cool
Cool!
Grab that end.
Ready?
Ready!
She's seaworthy!
Awesome.
No leaks!
Now we fill the boiler.
The water goes in here.
It goes in the boiler.
It's I like a rocket!
Every thing's shipshape.
Shipshape.
Shipshape?
Shipshape!
Shipshape!
Shipshape!
Is it not?
Hot!
It's hot.
- The candle's burning.
- It's burning!
Hot hot hot!
It's hot.
Awesome!
Were shipshape, Sosuke!
This is great.
This is so much fun.
It's burning, Sosuke.
It's really hot.
Keep a lookout in front.
I'll steer the boat.
Okay..
I'm the lookout.
There's a road.
That's the road Lisa took.
I don't see her.
You will.
She gave me her promise.
Ancient fish.
from the Devonian age!
There's Bothriolepis.
That one is.
Dipnorhynchus.
Dipnorhynchus!
That one's really huge.
That's Devonynchus.
Devonynchus!
Ahoy!
A boat!
Ahoy!
They're calling us.
Ahoy!
OW!
.
Pretty good, huh?
Now..
Ponyo.
Hello.
That's a wonderful boat you have.
Why.. you're Lisa's little boy.
He's not little.. he's Sosuke.
This is Ponyo.
I was a fish before.
A fish?
Ponyo. .that's a nice name.
Have you seen Lisa?
Lisa?
She's not with you?
She's at the centre.
The senior centre...?
This is my baby.
Oh my, what happened?
Is that for us?
Give me the cup, dear.
Thank you,
Let's try it.
It's delicious!
Lisa made it.
It's for the baby.
Oh, I'm sorry.
He can't handle soup yet.
But this will help me make milk for him.
Lisa gave me her milk too.
Ponyo, may I have this soup?
Sure.
Thank you,
People from the town.
It's like a festival
You there!
Do you need assistance?
Thanks, we're okay right now!
Then please follow us.
We're going to the hotel on the peak.
Okay!
Will do.
The whole town's here.
I hope everyone's all right.
- Let's go, Ponyo.
- Hold on a second.
Milk!
Oh my.
Milk!
She ate up all the ham.
This will help me make good milk.
Can you use another candle for your boat, Sosuke?
Thanks.
Ponyo will make it bigger.
Be careful !
Thank you both!
What is it, dear?
Don't cry.
Ponyo!
Sosuke!
Where's Lisa?
Isn't she with you?
I'm going to pick her up.
So she survived that wave?
Sosuke, take me with you!
Later, Kumiko.
I'm busy now.
Everyone from the centre evacuated to the park.
- Keep safe!
- You can do it!
We'll send a boat for them later.
Good luck, captain!
Time for a new candle, Ponyo.
Were okay.
I have another one.
Ow!
It's still pretty hot.
Bye-bye.
Can you make this candle bigger?
all right.
Are you sleepy..
Ponyo?
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Good. it's shallow enough to walk.
A road!
It's shrinking!
Ponyo!
Ponyo, wake up!
Sosuke.
Don't scare me.
I thought you were turning into a fish.
I
Lisa's car!
Ponyo, that's her car!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Here's your boat.
Your eyes are wet.
Let's find Lisa.
- You forgot your wrap!
- Who needs it?
Look.. it's a whale!
- My knees don't hurt anymore!
- What were we so afraid of?
- Is this the Other Side?
- Who cares?
It's wonderful
Attention, please!
Gather round.
Coming!
Shall we?
It's so nice to run.
Meet you there!
The winner!
You're so fast, Kayo.
Quiet, everyone!
The moment of truth is at hand.
Sosuke and Ponyo are almost here.
It's so romantic.
- Will love triumph?
- I'm so excited!
quiet!
Very soon, you will bear witness to a sacred trial of love.
Mr. Fujimoto, you're not up to something, are you?
Nonsense, he's her father.
They'll be fine..
if she doesn't wake up.
Now excuse me!
I'd like to believe him...
Where's Lisa gone to?
She's been talking with Ponyo's mother for ages.
I hope she's okay.
What are they talking about?
Let's find out.
Lisa!
Lisa!
Were all rooting for Sosuke and Ponyo!
Lisa!
- You must be worried.
- Sosuke will be just fine.
He's a strong little boy.
Thanks, everyone.
He'll need your support.
Ponyo, it's a tunnel
'STOP'
I've been here before.
Ponyo?
I don't like this place.
Don't let go of my hand.
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Please don't die!
Ponyo!
Wake up, Ponyo!
Let her sleep.
I've been waiting for you, Sosuke.
Lisa and the old ladies are waiting too.
Lisa?
!
.
Won't you come with me?
You and Ponyo.
Let's not wake her.
Sosuke!
Don't listen to him!
He tricked everyone into going with him.
Toki !
But he couldn't fool me!
There's no time, I tell you.
Don't you see what's happening?
If the Moon comes any closer, we're finished!
Is that the best you can do?
Sosuke, come here!
Listen to me..
Sosuke.
You're the planet's best hope.
Don't make me use force.
Ponyo!
Is this how you treat your father?
Ponyo!
Run, Sosuke!
You don't understand!
You can make it!
Jump!
Now what?
Lisa!
Sosuke!
Ponyo!
- Look over there.
- Where are we?
So, you are Sosuke.
Hello.
Are you Ponyo's mother?
Yes,
I want to thank you for bringing my daughter back to me.
Ponyo wanted to be like you, but she unleashed a terrible power.
To become human, she must be loved.
.for who she really is.
DO you know that Ponyo was a fish?
Yes
Your blood made her human...almost.
That's right!
Ponyo licked my cut and made it better.
So that's why she changed!
Can you accept her as she is?
I'll always love Ponyo.
..whether she's a fish.. a human.
.or in between.
Come, Ponyo.
Sosuke has promised to accept you as you are.
But first, you must give up your powers.
Can you do that?
Kiss this bubble when you return to land.
. .and
Ponyo will be a little girl
Way to go, Ponyo!
Thank you, Ponyo's mother!
Now the planet is safe again.
Splendid, Sosuke!
Sosuke!
I'm grateful , Lisa.
Thank you, Gran Mamare.
There you are!
Are you all right?
Wait, I'll get the wheelchairs.
Don't bother, we'll walk.
It's all so exciting.
I believe this is yours.
Thanks.
I hope you'll forgive me. ..may I?
Take good care of her.
It's Koichi!
Koichi!
It's Lisa!
And there's Sosuke!
Look..
Ponyo.
It's Koichi !

Ponyo on the Cliff
Seaweeds waving gently, in the big blue sea
Together with countless siblings
Bubbles is our language
Remember, a long time ago
Cruising with you on the big blue sea
Jellyfish and sea urchin, fishes and crabs
We are a big family
Sosuke, come home soon ok?
Ok.
It's a goldfish.
It's stuck.
Strange...
Ouch!
Is it dead?
It licked my finger.
Its Still alive!
Sosuke, we need to go now.
Risa, there's a goldfish.
Strange wind.
Sosuke, I'll start the engine first.
Find it?
What?
Captured by a human?
This is bad, really bad.
its Dead already?
It's alive!
Sosuke, we're getting late.
Risa, the goldfish is still alive.
Goldfish?
I found it by the seaside.
I see...
Although I don't know you,
But please don't spray pesticide here.
Oh, this is not pesticide.
This is deep sea water to avoid dehydration.
Good, as long as it's not poisonous.
Excuse me.
Oh no, it's getting worse.
What a strange guy.
Don't be mean, Sosuke.
Don't judge a book by it's cover.
I won't.
Are You Bringing it to the kindergarten?
Yes
Is it ok with your teacher?
No problem, I'll protect it.
So cute.
The ship is leaving.
Sosuke, eat this.
Do you eat this?
Eat?
Oh hey, my cut is gone.
Risa, her name is Ponyo ("Po-Nyo").
She looks like a little mermaid.
And she is magic.
After she licked my cut, it disapeared.
You like ham?
Risa, Ponyo likes to eat ham.
Just like you.
Faster.
This is filthy, really filthy.
Good morning.
Ponyo, we arrived.
see.
It will be fine here.
Take care.
I gotta go.
Morning, pardon me.
Please take Granny Noriko's chair.
Ok
Little Sosuke, morning.
Granny, I'm busy now.
Talk to you later.
Little Sosuke.
See you in a while.
Teacher will agree?
Yea
Wait for me here.
I will be right back.
I wonder if any cat will come here?
You stay put ok.
I will be right back.
See you.
Ah, Sui-chan.
A little bit of a fever.
But she looks healthy, she should be fine.
Thank you.
Bye bye.
Good morning, sensei (teacher).
Good morning, Sosuke.
Sosuke, how are you?
Sosuke.
Oh, Kumiko.
Look at this.
Pretty?
My mom bought it for me.
Sosuke, let's play together.
I'm busy right now, maybe later.
Busy with?
I said I'm busy.
Strange Sosuke.
So strange.
Oh.
Ponyo!
Sosuke.
Kumiko.
What is this?
You can't bring this to kindergarten.
These trees does not belong to the kindergarten.
It belongs to the Sunflower's Home, so it's ok.
Let me see.
Oh, a goldfish.
Its not a goldfish, Ponyo.
Ponyo?
I want to see.
If I let you see, you can't tell anyone else.
Ok, I won't tell.
See, cute right?
So odd looking.
And fat.
Goldfishes at my home are more beautiful.
It's Kumiko fault.
Its her fault to say something bad about you.
Here lets get you some fresh water.
Oh.
Ponyo.
That's great.
Isn't that little Sosuke's voice?
Sosuke should be in kindergarten.
My Hearing must be getting worse.
Granny Megumi, I'm here.
It's little Sosuke.
Wanna guess what is this?
Must be some good stuff.
That's right.
Guess what colour?
Red?
Red.
Correct.
How do you know?
Let me take a look.
Oh.
It's pretty.
Cute.
Her name is Ponyo.
She likes ham, and she is magic.
The cut i had disappeared.
Because she licked it.
Can she lick my leg?
If you could run like little Sosuke that would be great.
I must ask Ponyo then.
Let me see as well.
Sure.
Oh, disgusting.
Isn't it a mermaid?
Quickly return it to the sea.
It will bring a tsunami.
What?
a tsunami, that's too much.
When a mermaid comes on land.
a Tsunami will follow.
It's been a myth since a long time ago.
Is a tsunami. a Tsunami is here
A Tsunami is here, tsunami...
What happened granny Shi?
My clothes...
Sosuke.
Sosuke.
Sosuke.
Sosuke, apologize to granny Shi.
Don't worry, I will protect you.
Sosuke.
Ponyo.
Ponyo
Ponyo...
Sosuke...
Ponyo, Sosuke.
I Like You.
I like you too!
Ponyo, like Sosuke.
Ponyo!
Ponyo Ponyo
Ponyo?
Ponyo...
Sosuke.
Ponyo...
Sosuke, dont worry, have faith.
Even with more pain, it won't change her destiny.
Ponyo is destined to live in the sea.
That's why she must return to the sea.
That Mr. Pesticide guy was suspicious.
Give me a bite.
Come on, let me try its Quite tasty.
Cheer up a bit.
Today is the day Koichi returns.
(Koichi is Sosuke's father).
If you dont cheer up, He will be sad.
Don't go to the sea anymore today ok?
Ok.
Sosuke, come inside.
If I put the bucket here, Ponyo will know this is her home.
Right, if you want to put it there...
Then go ahead.
Sosuke, please answer the telephone.
It must be Koichi
Its me.
I'm fine.
I cant home home today.
Crossing the border, as usual.
Will lose the signal.
Heres Risa.
Koichi?
Can't you just refuse such a request?
You can't just leave your wife and son on the cliff.
I don't know!
What is this!
?
Sosuke, let's eat outside.
I want to eat inside.
Its Koichi.
Risa, is Koichi's ship.
Quick, turn off the lights.
He's a genius, hes just 5 years old.
Your wife must be mad.
I-AM-SORRY
Risa, he said sorry.
B.A.K.A.
BAKA... (stupid)
Ka Ka Ka...
Risa, he said "I LOVE U".
Very very much.
(stupid stupid stupid...)
So beautiful.
(Smooth sailing)
(Thank you)
(Good night)
Risa, don't cry.
Im didnt cry.
I promised to protect Ponyo.
Ponyo... you are not crying right?
Ok, let's cheer up.
(Totoro theme song)
Ouch!
You gonna cheer up too?
Just like Me, Ponyo is cheerful too.
Ya.
Let's eat.
Let's eat Koichi's portion too.
It's all because of me.
I Shouldn't have brought all of you to visit the farm.
I've told all of you, The human's air water are so filthy.
Come eat this, come.
Hear me? "Polumisharudin" (Supposed Ponyo real name)
I want to eat ham.
Ham?
Where did you learn such horrible thing?
Spill it, Polumisharudin.
I'm not Polumisharudin, I am Ponyo.
Po...po...ponyo?
Ponyo is good.
I want to be a human.
A Human?
What is so good about that stupid and horrible creature?
Humans take lives from the sea.
I was once a human.
I sacrificed a lot not to be one of them.
I want hands.
And not these kinda legs.
I want legs like Sosuke.
That's enough...
Hey, i have hands.
I have legs too...
Let me out, Let me out.
You've tasted human blood havnt you?
I am going to go see Sosuke.
(spell)
Return... return...
(spell)
Ah, i dont have enough power.
Go out... go out...
Calm down, starry path (spell)
Return.
Return.
Return.
Definitely the child of 'that person'.
She has Such great power.
If i hold her like this, she should be fine...
My powers can only hold her for a while.
Looks like only 'that person' can do it.
No.
It's too much for all of you.
(sho... sho...)
No way...
Danger danger...
The barrier to stop crabs is failing.
it might disrupt the balance of nature.
Calm down, calm down.
I get a bad feeling everytime when i goto meet 'that person'.
Oh no, oh no.
I have yet to finish cleaning up.
It doesn't get weak here. (the barrier)
This is so hard to open.
I'll need to come and fix it later.
I can't let even one sea creature enter here.
Unless there will be big trouble.
Well-done.
The Powers of the sea are spreading to every corner.
When this well is filled up.
The time of the sea will arrive.
And the end of those dangerous creatures.
The time of filthy human will end.
Close it, close it (spell)
Ha~
Haha~ Haha~
I'm going to Sosuke.
Sosuke.
Ha~
Tsunami?
Captain, whats that, whats that...
Is A Tsunami!
Everyone get inside the ship.
What's that?
Captain, the radio and radar is out.
It's a girl.
About Sosuke's age.
Thank you.
Thanks for your hard work.
Sosuke, wait here for a while ok?
Sensei will company you.
I'm going home with Risa, I will be fine.
See you sensei.
See you.
Be careful.
Sorry, Sosuke.
was the door hard to open?
the power is out.
Is the kindergarten ok?
Yes.
Miss Risa, it's ok.
You can go home first.
is Granny Kaneko not here yet?
Ya, don't worry.
She's just a bit late.
After all we will be here the whole night.
You better get going while you still can.
Sosuke, wait for a while.
Ok.
Granny Megumi.
Little Sosuke.
It's too dark, i can't see a thing.
Here i'll give you this.
Oh?
What is this?
Give one to granny Noriko too.
Thank you.
Its so dark, i can't see a thing.
Such a heavy storm, further more with a black out.
That's why I don't want to stay here.
The power is back.
Great.
Its so bright.
Ahh, a Goldfish!
i wonder if the power came back because Sosuke is here?
There's a storm tonight.
A strong one.
Useless TV.
Can't see a thing.
The Weather forecast is not accurate at all.
Little Sosuke go home quickly.
We got the goldfish charm, We won't be scared of anything.
Ok.
I have one for you too.
So rough.
What is this?
It's like this.
It's a bat, a bat.
No it's not.
Is 'Koganei Maru'.
The ship of Sosuke's father.
Ya.
it looks like a bat.
Sosuke, its time to go, say goodbye to everyone.
Ok.
Goodbye everyone.
Goodbye.
Don't get blown away by the wind.
Lets get out of here.
It looks like the phone is down too.
The sea is rising.
Those ships won't sink will they?
Those ship's that set sail are not afraid of the storm.
Same as Koichi.
Its a fish.
Risa, its a fish.
Put on your seat belt.
Miss Risa, you can't pass here.
Theres Already an order to take refuge.
Take refuge?
There are old folks at Sunflower's Home staying overnight.
That's inner land.
And at higher ground, they will be fine.
Anyway, I must go home.
You can't stay here anymore.
Go through the mountain.
Sosuke, let's go.
Ok.
Please, don't.
Oh no, a big wave is coming.
Miss Risa.
Don't be silly.
It's coming.
Sosuke, sit tight.
Im going to speed up.
What a nasty wave.
A girl fell into it.
What?
Coming from the back of a fish.
Where?
The tide is getting higher.
Sosuke, where is the girl?
There, running at the back of those fishes.
Fishes?
Let's go, Sosuke.
Hold on, Sosuke.
We're almost home.
There is the girl.
Its dangerous, come over here.
Sosuke, don't move.
Sosuke, do you know her?
Ponyo?
Its Ponyo.
Yup!
I'm Ponyo.
Risa, Ponyo returned as a little girl.
I'm back.
Listen, Sosuke and Ponyo.
No matter how happy you are.
You must calm down now.
Understand?
Ok.
Take off your rain coat Sosuke.
Ponyo didn't wear shoes right?
Hold it.
I'll go get something to dry you up.
Ponyo, this way.
Its got the smell of Sosuke.
Ponyo
Gotcha.
Don't stay all wet.
Ponyo's hair looks good in red.
Your clothes are not even wet.
Ponyo used to be a fish.
It's ok to be wet.
Ya.
Ponyo like this.
Great, let's have tea.
Ponyo, bring the lights here.
Will water come out?
Yes it will!
It will!
Its coming out.
Because we have a tank on top.
Fire will come from here.
That's wonderful.
Wonderful.
Because it's single.
Sit down.

Ponyo sit here.
You should sit this way.
Put them down like this.
You can't use your hands that way.
I have my feet.
Wow, that's great.
Oh, what's that?
Ponyo's feet are like hands.
Please.
Take it.
I'm going ahead.
It's delicious.
What's next, what to do?
Ponyo thinks ham is good.
Ponyo likes to eat ham.
Then we will have dinner.
But before that, we will have to start the power generator.
We will Connect the power and then talk to Koichi.
Koichi is my father.
Evil magician?
No, he is the captain of Koganei Maru.
What about Ponyo's father?
Fujimoto, he locked me up.
Ponyo ran away.
Ponyo's mother?
Mommy, my favorite.
But very scary.
Just like Risa...
Thank for helping Ponyo.
Out of fuel?
Stuck?
It's stuck!
Stuck over there.
Great!
Its so bright.
Ponyo is so great.
Radio, radio.
Risa, did the ship sink?
Theres no lights.
Its very noisy.
Everything ok?
Looks like the radio is not working.
This is JA4 LL
JA4 LL

This is Risa and Sosuke and Ponyo.
Everyone is fine here.
Let's eat.

Something is moving.
Somebody is over there.
Granny Megumi?
It's gone.

Sosuke wait here with Ponyo.
I'm going over.
I should be fine driving on the mountain's road.
Sosuke, I'm going to the Sunflower's Home.
I'm going too.
Sosuke and Ponyo please wait here.
I want to go, just bring Ponyo along.
I am going with you.
Sosuke, this home..
is a lighthouse and in a storm brings lights and hope to those in the dark.
Someone must be here.
lots of strange things have happened.
But I'm not sure why.
There must be a reason.
I'm worried about those at the Sunflower's Home.
If Sosuke protects this place.
Risa will have support.
I will be fine.
I will come home.
Are you Sure?
Yes I'm Sure.
Make sure then.
I will always love you Sosuke.
The moon is coming out.
We can see the lights from town.
Thank god.
We can navigate now.
We Haven't been to town.
Did we reach America?
That's not the mountain, or the land.
It's all boats.
Carried by the wave.
Gathered as a mountain here.
Must be a grave of boats.
A path to the other side has opened.
The engine stoped!
Fix it quickly.
Drop the anchor.
Aye.
What's at the back?
I saw a goddess!
It started!
We're saved!
It's a goddess.
All thanks to the goddess.
Amitaba (prayer).
Go higher, higher.
Oh, this is a barrier.
Where did she learn this.
What's going on?
She became a human.
Danger.
What are they doing?
All of you.
Danger.
No.
All of you.
Dad is doing this for your sister.
'That person'
Is coming.
Fujimoto
So you came huh?
Beautiful ocean.
Full of magic.
As if I'm back to 'De Po Ji' big ocean.
Ponyo tasted human's blood.
The elixir of life that I collected are gone too.
Ponyo?
What a very nice name.
It's my fault.
Ponyo misused her magical powers.
And opened a big hole on earth.
She has no idea what she's doing.
Some more have turn into a humans.
And ran away to a boy's home.
If this continues, the world will be destroyed.
This is bad.
The satelites are falling too.
The gravity of the planet...
Silent.
Sosuke.
It's a boy named Sosuke huh.
All of you love your big sister.
My dear, just let Ponyo become a true human.
Huh?
An elder believes.
If the boy is faithful.
Ponyo can turn into a real human, in exchange for her magical power.
But if that failed,
Ponyo will turn into bubbles.
We are, after all made of bubbles.
But, she's only 5.
She can't possibly make it.
Just let them rest for now.
Our child.
Sosuke.
Sosuke.
Ouch.
Morning Ponyo.
Morning Sosuke.
The ocean has become calm.
Risa is not around.
The roads are flooded.
If only we had a boat right now.
We have one.
We can't use that.
Yes we can.
Wow, that's perfect.
There's even a candle.
You can sit here.
Wow, it's just like a real one.
Exactly like a real one.
You hold that side.
Ready?
Ready!
It's floating.
There's no leaking either.
Alright.
We have to fill it with water.
We need to fill water into the center part.

Ponyo has broken the seal in order to become a human.
She wanted to become a human.
She requires a man that will understand Ponyo and will accept her.
You know she's a fish.
Yes.
She turned into a mermaid because she tasted your blood.
Is that so?
Knowing that she's half fish half human.
Are you ok with that?
Yes.
It doesnt matter if she's a fish, a mermaid or a human, I still like (love) her.
Come here Ponyo.
Ponyo.
Looks like Sosuke has accepted you.
You must abandon your magic power in order to become a human.
Can you do that?
Yes.
When you return to surface, kiss this bubble once.
Ponyo will then transform into a 5 year old girl like you.
Ponyo That's too wonderful.

Sosuke.
Don't judge a book by its cover.

And it's fat.
My goldfish are better than that.
It was Kumiko's fault.
She said something bad about you.
Let's change your water.
You're OK!
Isn't that little Sosuke's voice?
Shouldn't somebody be in kindergarten?
Or maybe my hearing is getting worse.
Granny Megumi.
It is little Sosuke.
Wanna guess what this is?
Must be good!
That's right.
Guess what color?
Red?
You're right!
How did you know?
Let me take a look.
OK.
It's pretty.
Cute.
Her name is Ponyo.
and she knows magic.
but it disappeared.
Because she licked it.
Can she lick my sore knee?
that would be great.
I'll ask Ponyo then.
Let me see too.
Granny Toki.
Disgusting!
Isn't that a mermaid?
return it to the sea!
Or it will bring a tsunami!

he said "I LOVE U".
VERY VERY MUCH
Wow!
Beautiful!
(SMOOTH SAILING)
(THANK YOU)
(GOOD NIGHT)
it's OK to cry.
I cried some too when Ponyo ...
left.
are you crying right now?
you!
(singing My Neighbor Totoro theme song)
Hey!
we both need some cheering up!
so I know Ponyo's cheerful too.
Yeah ...
Let's eat!
Koichi can have the leftovers!
This is my fault.
I shouldn't have brought all of you here.
the humans make the air and water so filthy.
Open wide ... come on.
Brunnhilde?
(Ponyo's real name)
I want ham!
HAM?
Where did you learn about that?
Brunnhilde!
I'm Ponyo!
Ponyo likes humans!
Ponyo wants to be human.
Human?
What's so good about those stupid and horrible creatures?
Humans befoul the sea.
I was once human.
I sacrificed a lot not to be one of them any more.
Ponyo wants hands!
I don't want these fins!
I want legs!
That's enough!
My hands came out!
My legs too!
Come out!
Come out!
You've tasted human blood?
I'm going back to ... (chanting spell)
Return return return return ...
I need more power!
Let me out!
Let me out!
You're definitely "her" child.
Such power.
This will hold you for now.
But only for a while.
Looks like "she" is the only one who can handle you.
No.
Stay out of there!
Shoo!
Shoo!
The crab barrier is failing!
The balance has been disrupted!
calm down ...
I get a bad feeling every time "she" shows up.
I have to get busy filling the well ...
At least the barrier is still strong here.
Getting harder to open.
Gotta fix that lock.
it'll be big trouble.
Yes.
This power will soon spread to every corner of Earth.
then it will be our turn.
And the air breathers will be sorry.
The filthy humans will finally learn the true meaning of sea power!
close it.
Ha!
here I come!
Tsunami?
Captain!
That's ... that's tsunami!
Close all watertight doors!
What's that?
radio and radar are out!
It's a girl!
About Sosuke's age!
Thank you.
Thanks for your hard work.
OK?
I'll keep you company.
Lisa's here.
I'll be fine.
teacher.
See you.
Be careful!
Sosuke.
Was the door hard to open?
The power's out.
Is the kindergarten OK?
Yes.
it's OK.
You can go home first.
Isn't Granny Kaneko here yet?
but don't worry.
She's just a little late.
we're going to be here all night.
You'd better get going while you can.
wait just a little more.
OK.
Granny Megumi.
Little Sosuke.
I can't see a thing.
take this.
Oh?
What is it?
Granny Noriko.
Thank you.
So it would kill them to turn on a light or two around here?
And they promised clear and sunny!
This is why I don't want to stay here.
Power's back!
Thank goodness.
So bright.
Did Sosuke turn on the lights?
Weather radar is showing a strong storm moving into the area.
The TV's useless.
Can't see a thing.
And the weather forecast!
I could do better myself with a Ouija board!
you'd better leave fast.
We've got your goldfish charms now.
We won't be scared any more.
Yeah.
Granny Toki.
It's so rough.
What is this?
It goes like this.
It's a bat!
A bat!
No it's not.
It's the Koganei Maru.
Sosuke's father's ship.
Yeah.
Still looks like a bat.
it's time to go!
Say goodbye to everyone.
OK.
everyone.
Goodbye.
bat man.
Let's go.
The phone's out too.
The sea is rising.
Those ships won't sink?
They're big enough to ride out the storm.
I hope.
A fish ... it's a fish!
Put on your seat belt.
you need to turn back!
There's already been an order to take shelter!
Take shelter?
There are old folks up at Sunflower's Home staying overnight!
And one's missing!
Don't worry about them!
They'll be fine!
I have to get home.
Don't!
You can't stay here any more!
Turn around and go back to the shelter!
let's go.
No!
don't!
a big wave is coming!
Miss Lisa!
Don't be stupid!
Here it comes!
sit tight.
Grab something and hold on!
That one almost got us.
A girl fell in the water!
What?
She's on the backs of those fish!
Where?
The tide is getting higher.
where is this girl?
running on the backs of the fish!
Fish?
Sosuke.
Hold on!
We're almost home.
There IS a girl there!
baby!
It's dangerous there!
don't move.
do you know her?
Ponyo?
It's Ponyo!
It's Ponyo!
Ponyo came back as a little girl!
Ponyo's back!
Ponyo.
We all need to calm down now.
Understand?
OK.
Sosuke.
Ponyo?
hold this.
I'll go get something to dry off.
this way.
I smell Sosuke everywhere!
Ponyo ...
Gotcha!
Let's get you dried off.
You have such pretty red hair.
Your clothes aren't wet?
Ponyo used to be a fish.
So it's OK for her to be wet.
Ponyo likes this.
let's have tea.
bring the light here.
Will water come out?
Yes it will!
It will!
It's coming out!
Because we have a tank on top.
Fire comes out of here ...
Wonderful.
Because we have a gas tank!
Sit here.
OK.
sit here.
You should sit this way.
Put it down like this.
But you can't use your hands!
I still have my feet!
amazing!
what's that?
Ponyo's feet are just like hands.
Please have some.
Let's eat!
That was good.
what should we do next?
Ponyo likes ham!
Ponyo really likes ham.
Then we'll have dinner.
I'll have to start the generator.
then we can talk to Koichi.
Koichi's my father.
Is he an evil magician too?
he's the captain of the Koganei Maru.
What about Ponyo's father?
Fujimoto!
He locked up Ponyo!
Ponyo ran away.
And Ponyo's mother?
Mommy!
I love her a lot!
But she's very scary.
Just like Lisa.
Ponyo.
Is it out of fuel?
Or stuck?
It's stuck!
It's stuck over there.
All right!
It's so bright.
She's amazing.
Antenna!
Antenna!
did the ship sink?
I don't see any lights.
Too loud!
Is everything OK?
Looks like the radio's not working.
Hello.
This is JA4 LL...
Koichi?
Sosuke and Ponyo.
Everyone is fine here.
We're about to eat!
Ham!
so be careful.
It's not ready yet.
You have to wait first.
Close your eyes.
Don't open them yet!
no peeking!
you can open your eyes now!
Enjoy it!
Wow.
Ham!
huh Ponyo?
Hot!
Hot!
look!
Ponyo fell asleep.
Did Ponyo come from far far away?
she must have.
look.
The storm stopped.
Is it because Ponyo fell asleep?
look over there.
Something's moving.
Somebody's over there.
Is it Granny Kaneko?
It's gone now.
Somebody made it.
wait here with Ponyo.
I'm going over there.
Looks like the mountain road's OK.
I'm going to Sunflower Home.
I wanna go too!
Sosuke.
Stay here with Ponyo.
I want to go!
We can bring Ponyo with us!
I'm going with you!
you know this is like a lighthouse.
We can talk to the sailors out there in the dark.
Sosuke.
Many strange things have happened tonight.
I'm not sure why.
But there must be a reason.
and if Granny Kaneko made it there.
I need you to stay here and protect this place.
It'll help a lot if you do.
It's okay.
I'll be back real soon.
You sure?
I'm sure.
Make sure then.
Sosuke.
The moon's coming out.
I can see the lights from town!
Thank goodness.
We can navigate now.
What town is that?
Did the storm blow us to America?
Those lights aren't from town.
Or from any land.
Those are ships!
They were blown here by the storm!
Gathered in a huge pile.
It's a ship's graveyard!
The engines have stopped!
Fix them fast!
Drop the anchor!
Aye.
What's that in the water?
It's a mermaid!
The engines have started!
We're saved!
It's the mermaid!
mermaid!
higher.
A barrier?
!
Where did she learn how to do that?
What's going on here?
She became human!
Oh no!
What are they doing?
don't do that!
Stop it!
all of you!
Dad is doing this for your sister.
She" is here.
Fujimoto.
So here you are.
So warm and alive!
dear.
Ponyo has tasted human blood.
She's used up all the magic I'd been storing in the well too.
Ponyo"?
I rather like that name.
It's my fault.
Ponyo misused her power.
And caused all of this.
But she couldn't know what she's doing.
She's turned into a human.
And ran away to a boy's home.
she'll destroy everything!
See?
The very stars are falling!
Earth's gravity must be in a ...
Calm yourself.
Sosuke ...
So the boy's name is Sosuke.
I know you all love your big sister.
Ponyo can't remain human by herself.
She needs Sosuke's faith to stay that way.
Yes.
Then Ponyo can stay a human if she gives up her powers.
Ponyo might disappear like a bubble!
I think they're both too powerful for that to happen!
she's only five!
She can't possibly ... my child.
Ouch!
Ponyo!
Sosuke!
Look!
The ocean's calm!
Lisa's not here.
The roads are flooded.
If we only had a boat.
There's one!
We can't use that!
Wanna bet?
Perfect!
There's even a candle!
I can sit here.
it's just like a real one.
A real one!
Pick up that end.
Ready?
Ready!
It works!
It's not leaking.
We have to fill the center part with water.
You blow water through here.
Then the candle makes it go!
It's like a rocket!
Ponyo.
Well done?
well done.
Well done!
Well done!
Hot?
Very hot.
Very hot!
Very hot!
it lit.
It lit.
Hot!
Hot!
Hot!
It's moving.
Well done.
Yeah.
I'm proud of it.
Is Sosuke happy?
Yes.
it's burning.
Yeah.
it's hot.
sit in front.
I'll drive.
OK.
In the front.
Is that a path?
That's the mountain road.
Lisa's not there?
Lisa's OK.
We promised.
(extinct Gogonasus andrewsae)
A Gogonasus!
He used to live back in the old times!
He's shy.
(extinct Dipnorhynchus)
He's beautiful.
Mr. Shy?
There's a BIG one!
He's huge.
Huge.
There's a boat.
They're calling us.
Ahoy!
They must have spotted us.
Ponyo.
Hi.
Hi.
That's a nice boat.
little Sosuke.
Not little.
He's just Sosuke.
She's Ponyo.
Ponyo is a goldfish!
Ponyo is a nice name.
Do you know where Lisa is?
Lisa?
She's not with you?
She went out.
Went out?
This is my baby.
What's the matter?
Are you giving the cup to her?
Here.
Thank you.
Let's eat!
That's good soup!
Lisa made it.
That's for the baby!
but the baby can't eat the soup by herself.
then I'll have milk for the baby.
Lisa says I used to drink milk that way too.
may I have some of this soup?
Yes.
Thank you.
Look!
More boats over there.
It's like a parade!
Do you need help with anything?
but we're fine for now.
Then please be careful on your way up to the shelter.
Yes.
We will!
Lots of people there.
everyone is fine.
let's move on.
Hold on.
Milk.
Milk.
They'll just get stale.
We brought a lot.
Thank you.
There will be a lot of milk.
Here's a candle.
Do you want it?
that should help.
Thanks.
Be careful.
Thank you.
What's wrong?
It's okay.
Ponyo.
Sosuke!
Where is Lisa?
She went out.
I gotta go.
up past the flood.
Yeah.
let me ride in your boat too!
Kumiko.
See you later.
Good luck!
but we wish you all the best!
we need a new candle.
we've got another one.
Ouch.
It's still hot.
can you make this candle big too?
are you OK?
The water's shallow here.
I feel the ground.
There's the road.
It's shrinking!
Ponyo!
I thought you would never wake up.
over here!
water's coming out of your eyes.
We need to find Lisa.
Just look at this place!
It's like an underwater palace!
please come over here.
let's go!
It feels great to run again.
Bet I beat you there!
everyone.
We're at the critical moment.
Sosuke will be here soon.
What's going on?
Is this some kind of test?
My heart's pounding!
Mine too!
I've brought you here to be witnesses for a test.
are you?
Of course not!
If they pass this test.
Then ...
IF they pass this test" ... ?
What's Lisa doing?
over there.
She's talking to Ponyo's mother.
This must be hard for Lisa.
What are they doing there?
Let's call her.
Lisa!
Lisa!
Don't worry.
Sosuke is coming.
don't worry.
Sosuke will be fine.
everyone.
it's a cave.
It sounds like it goes downhill.
I don't like this.
Don't let go of my hand.
OK.
don't die!
Ponyo!
Sosuke.
So you finally made it.
Lisa and the grannies are all waiting for you.
Lisa's here?
Let me have Ponyo and I'll take you to them.
Give Ponyo to me.
I'll take care of her.
Sosuke!
boy!
He took everyone away and brought them here to test you!
Granny Toki!
Don't let him touch Ponyo!
YOU have to take her!
There's no time for this!
Don't you want to see Lisa again?
I can't let the moon get any closer!
Or something terrible will happen.
shaggy?
give her to me!
It's the only way you can save everybody!
I won't hurt you.
Ponyo!
How could you treat your father that way?

I said I won't hurt you!
Keep going!
Jump!
No!
Enough!
Enough!
(Yes.
Enough.)
Lisa!
Sosuke!
Ponyo!
Look!
You must be Sosuke.
Hello.
Are you Ponyo's mom?
I am.
We didn't make it easy for you to bring Ponyo here.
Thank you.
Ponyo disrupted the balance of nature to be with you.
she'll need a man willing to understand and accept her.
don't you?
Yes.
She turned into a mermaid when she licked your finger.
I know.
But she'd still be wonderful even if she was just a kid like me.
Can she stay?
are you sure you want her to stay?
or a human.
I still love her.
come here.
Sosuke has accepted you.
But you must give up your powers before you can stay human.
Are you sure?
Yes!
kiss this bubble.
Ponyo will then be just as human as you are.
Ponyo!
That's wonderful!
Ponyo's mom!
They have both chosen well.
They've passed their test!
thank you.
You too.
And thank you for everything!
Is everyone all right?
We'll bring your wheelchairs immediately.

And be a girl!
POP!

This is deep sea water to avoid dehydration.
Good, as long as it's not poisonous.
Excuse me.

Goldfishes at my home are more beautiful.
It's Kumiko fault.
Is her fault to say something bad about Ponyo.
I'll help you to change the water.
Oh.
Ponyo.
That's great.
Isn't that little Sosuke voice?
Sosuke should be in the kindergarten.
Hearing are getting worse.

That's why she must return to the sea.
That Mr. Pesticide is suspicious.
Give me a bite.
Come, let me try
Quite tasty.
Cheer up a bit.
Today is the day Koichi return.

If Sosuke not cheering up.
So does he.

Where did you learned such horrible thing?
Spill it, Polumisharudin.
I'm not Polumisharudin, I am Ponyo.
Po...po...ponyo?
Ponyo is good.
Ponyo want to be human.
Human?
What so good about that stupid and horrible creature?
Human took lives from sea.
I'm once a human.
I sacrifice a lot not to be one of them.
Ponyo want hand.
Don't want such leg.
Want leg like Sosuke.
That's enough...
Hand comes out.
Leg comes out too...

Definitely the child of 'that person'.
Such great power.
If hold it like this, should be fine...
My power can only hold her for a while.
Looks like only 'that person' can do it.
No.
It's too much for all of you.
(sho... sho...)
No way...
Danger danger...
Barrier to stop crabs is failing.
Almost disrupt the balance of nature.
Cool down, cool down.
I get a bad feeling everytime when going to meet 'that person'.
Oh no, oh no.
Yet to finish cleaning up.
It doesn't get weak here. (the barrier)
So hard to open it.
Need to come and fix it later.
Can't let even one sea creature enter here.
Else will be big trouble.
Well-done.
Power of sea spreading to every corner.
When this well filled up.
The time of the sea will arrive.
The end of those dangerous creatures.
The time of filthy human will end.
Close it, close it (spell)
Ha~
Haha~ Haha~

Thank you.
Thanks for your hard work.
Sosuke, wait here for a while ok?
Sensei will company you.

Be careful.
Sorry, Sosuke.
Door hard to open?
Power is out.
Is kindergarten ok?
Yes.
Miss Risa, it's ok.
You can go home first.
Granny Kaneko not here yet?
Ya, don't worry.
She just a bit late.
After all we will be here whole night.
You better get going while you still can.
Sosuke, wait for a while.
Ok.
Granny Megumi.
Little Sosuke.
It's too dark, can't see a thing.
Give you this.
Oh?
What is this?
Give one to granny Noriko too.
Thank you.
So dark, can't see a thing.
Such a heavy storm, further more with black out.
That's why I don't want to stay here.
The power is back.
Great.
So bright.
Goldfish!
The power came back because Sosuke is here?
There's a storm tonight.
A strong one.
Useless TV.
Can't see a thing.
Weather forecast not accurate at all.
Little Sosuke go home quickly.
We got the goldfish charm, won't be scared of anything.
Ya.

So rough.
What is this?
It's like this.
It's a bat, a bat.
No it's not.
Is 'Koganei Maru'.
The ship of Sosuke's father.
Ya.
Looks like a bat.
Sosuke, time to go, say goodbye to everyone.
Ok.
Goodbye everyone.
Goodbye.
Don't blown away by the wind.
Go from here.
Looks like the phone is down too.
Sea is rising.
Those ships won't sink?
Ship that set sail won't afraid of storm.
Same as Koichi.
Is fish.
Risa, is fish.
Put on you seat belt.
Miss Risa, you can't pass here.
Already order to take refuge.
Take refuge?
There're old folks at Sunflower's Home staying overnight.
That's inner land.
And at higher ground, will be fine.
Anyway, I must go home.
You can't stay here anymore.
Go through the mountain.
Sosuke, let's go.
Ok.
Please, don't.
Oh no, a big wave is coming.
Miss Risa.
Don't be silly.
It's coming.
Sosuke, sit tight.
Going to speed up.
What a nasty wave.
A girl fell into it.
What?
Coming from the back of fish.
Where?
Tide is getting higher.
Sosuke, where is the girl?
There, running at the back of fishes.
Fish?
Let's go, Sosuke.
Hold on, Sosuke.
We're almost home.

No matter how happy and surprise.
You must calm down now.

Ponyo didn't wear shoe right?
Hold it.
I'll go get something to dry up.

Great, let's have tea.
Ponyo, bring the lights here.

Ponyo's feet is like a hand.
Please.
Take.
I'm going ahead.
It's delicious.
What's next, what to do?
Ponyo think ham is good.
Ponyo likes to eat ham.
Then we have dinner.
But before that, have to start the power generator.
Connect power and talk to Koichi.
Koichi is my father.
Evil magician?
No, he is the captain of Koganei Maru.
What about Ponyo's father?
Fujimoto, he lock me up.
Ponyo ran away.

Mommy, my favorite.
But very scary.
Just like Risa...
Thank for helping Ponyo.

Stuck over there.

I want to go, just bring Ponyo along.
I am going with you.
Sosuke, this home now is a lighthouse in the storm bring lights and hope to those in dark.
Someone must be here.

But not sure why.
There must be a reason.
I'm worried about those at Sunflower's Home.
If Sosuke protecting this place.
Risa will have support.
I will be fine.
I will come home.
Sure?
Sure.
Make sure then.
I always love Sosuke.
The moon coming out.
We can see the lights from town.
Thank god.
We can navigate now.
Haven't been to town.

It's all boats.
Carried by wave.
Gathered as mountain here.

Dad is doing this for your sister.
'That person'
Is coming.
Fujimoto
So you came huh?
Beautiful ocean.
Full with magic.
As if I'm back to 'De Po Ji' big ocean.
Ponyo tasted human's blood.
The elixir of life that I collected are gone too.
Ponyo?
A very nice name.
It's my fault.
Ponyo misused her magical power.
Opened a big hole on earth.
She have no idea what she's doing.
Somemore have turn into a human.
And ranaway to a boy's home.
It this continue, the world will be destroyed.
This is bad.
The satelites are falling too.
The gravity of the planet...
Silent.
Sosuke.
It's a boy name Sosuke huh.
All of you love your big sister.
My dear, just let Ponyo become a true human.
Huh?
An old believes.
If the boy faithful.
Ponyo can turn into a real human, in exchange with her magical power.
But if that failed,
Ponyo will turn into bubbles.
We are, afterall made of bubbles.
But, she's only 5.
She can't possibly make it.
Just let them rest for now.
Our child.
Sosuke.

Wanted to become a human.
Require a man that understand Ponyo and willing to accept her.
You know she's a fish.
Yes.
She turn into a mermaid because she've tasted your blood.
Is that so?
Knowing that she's half fish half human.
Are you ok with that?
Yes.
No matter she's a fish, a mermaid or a human, I still like (love) her.
Come here Ponyo.
Ponyo.
Looks like Sosuke have accepted you.

Sousuke, come right back!
Okay.
A goldfish...
It's stuck.
That was weird.
Ow!
Is it dead?
It licked me...
It's alive.
Sousuke, we're leaving!
Lisa, I caught a goldfish!
This wind feels strange...
Sousuke, I'm starting the car!
Did you find her?
What?
Captured by a human?
This is bad...
Very bad.
Are you dead?
You're alive!
Sousuke!
I'm going to be late!
Lisa!
I caught a goldfish.
A goldfish?
Down by the rocks.
I'm sorry, but you can't use weed killer here.
Heavens, no!
This is pure sea water.
It keeps me humidified.
As long as it's not weed killer.
Good day!
This is very
What a creepy guy.
But don't you out strangers, Sousuke.
I won't.
Are you taking that to school?
Won't your teacher complain?
Don't worry, I'll take care of you.
She's cute!
They're using the dry dock.
Here, eat this before we get there.
Maybe she's hungry.
Want some?
Hey, my cut is gone!
Lisa, I'm going to call her Ponyo.
She's really special!
She can do magic.
She fixed my cut.
Want some ham?
Lisa, Ponyo likes ham!
That makes two of us.
Oh, no...
Disgusting!
Hurry, Lisa-san!
Such filth!
Intolerable!
Good morning!
Look, Ponyo.
There's our house.
Morning.
I'll drop you here.
Okay.
Have fun.
See you.
Morning.
Sorry I'm late.
Could you get Noriko-san's wheelchair?
Yes.
Good morning, Sou-chan.
I'm busy, Yoshie-san.
Talk to you later.
My!
Hello, Sousuke-chan.
Can't talk now, Toki-san.
Oh, my.
Maybe the teacher will get mad.
I know!
Wait here.
I'll be back soon.
What if a cat comes?
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
See you later.
Oh, hi, Toshi-chan.
It's all right.
She'll be just fine.
Okay, thanks.
Bye-bye.
Good morning, Sensei.
Hello, Sou-chan.
How are you?
Sousuke!
Kumiko-chan...
Like my dress?
Mommy got it for me.
Oh...
Let's play, Sousuke!
Not now.
I'm busy.
How come?
I told you, I'm busy.
You're no fun.
Yeah!
Ponyo!
Sousuke!
Kumiko-chan...
What's that?
You're not supposed to bring stuff.
But these trees aren't on school grounds, so that should be fine.
Show me.
Oh, a goldfish.
It's not a goldfish.
It's Ponyo.
Ponyo?
I want to see!
Promise not to tell?
I promise.
Isn't she cute?
It looks weird and fat.
My goldfish is much cuter.
It's Kumiko-chan's fault.
She was mean to you.
I'll give you some more water.
Ponyo!
You scared me.
Why, how odd.
That was Sousuke-chan's voice.
But he's supposed to be in school.
I must be hearing things.
I'm here, Yoshie-san.
I knew I heard your voice.
Do I have a secret?
Yes!
Bingo!
Okay, what color is my secret?
Red!
Good guess.
How'd you know?
Show us.
All right.
Oh, how pretty!
Very cute!
Her name is Ponyo.
She loves ham and she can do magic.
I cut my thumb, but she fixed it.
I wonder if she'd fix our legs.
We could run around just like you.
Well, I'd have to ask Ponyo first.
Can I take a look?
Sure, Toki-san.
Heavens, it has a face!
Put it back before it brings a tsunami!
You're so superstitious, Toki-san.
That's what the old stories say.
Fish like that are bad luck.
The tsunami!
It's here!
The tsunami is here!
Tsunami...
What's wrong, Toki-san?
Just look at my clothes!
Sousuke!
Sousuke!
Sousuke!
Sousuke!
Come back here and apologize to Toki-san!
Don't worry.
I'll protect you.
Sousuke.
Sousuke.
Ponyo!
Ponyo.
Sousuke.
Ponyo...
loves Sousuke!
I love you too.
Ponyo loves Sousuke!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Sousuke!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Listen, Sousuke.
Maybe it was fate.
It just can't be helped.
Ponyo was born in the sea.
She went back home.
That's all.
Anyway, let's hope that creepy guy is gone.
One lick?
Hurry, it's melting!
Not bad!
Cheer up.
Koichi will be home tonight.
He'll be disappointed if you're feeling down.
No more ocean today, okay?
Sousuke?
Time to come inside.
Do you think this bucket will help Ponyo find us?
There's only one way to find out.
Can you get that, Sousuke?
It must be Koichi.
Hello?
Yes, it's me.
Yes, I'm fine.
I can't get back tonight.
I'll signal when I'm offshore.
Okay.
Here's Lisa.
Koichi?
Yes...
What?
!
Can't you get out of it?
Fine...
Leave your wife and son up on the cliff!
I give up!
Why bother?
C'mon, Sousuke.
Let's eat out!
I want to eat here.
There he is!
Turn off the lights, Lisa.
It's Sousuke!
He's a genius.
Only five years old.
Your wife must be upset.
He says he's sorry.

LOVE AND KISSES
Don't cry, Lisa.
I won't cry.
I promised Ponyo, I'd take care of her.
I hope she isn't crying.
Okay, let's cheer up!
"I'm happy as can be..."
Ow!
Don't worry, Sousuke.
I'm sure Ponyo is fine too.
Now, let's eat.
We'll eat Koichi's dinner too!
This is all my fault.
Bringing you along to watch me was a mistake.
How often have I warned you about humans?
Their very breath is polluted.
Come, you must eat.
Can't you hear me, Brunhilde?
I want ham!
H-Ham?
!
What on earth have you been doing?
Answer me, Brunhilde!
My name's not Brunhilde.
It's Ponyo.
P
- Po
- Ponyo?
Ponyo loves Sousuke.
I want to be human!
Human?
How could you love such disgusting creatures?
They rob the sea of life.
I was human myself... once.
I finally escaped that awful heritage...
I want hands!
I don't like this!
I want legs like Sousuke!
Of all the nonsense!
Look at me!
Hands and feet!
Look at me!
No...
Don't tell me you tasted human blood?
!
Wanna see Sousuke!
No!
His blood has deranged your DNA!
Revert...
Revert...
Go back...
Go back!
It's not working.
I need more power.
Let me out!
Be still, you evil blood.
Revert, revert!
Just like her mother...
So strong.
She should remain innocent and pure forever.
I can't hold her for long.
I need her mother's help.
No!
My elixir is too strong for you!
Shoo!
Go away!
My crab shields were weakening.
I nearly upset Nature's balance.
I must stay calm.
When I think of meeting her again, I'm starting to get nervous.
This batch should be ready.
No leaks down here.
This door is loose.
I'll fix it later.
If even one creature got in here...
Superb!
I feel the ocean's power in my very DNA.
When this well is full, the Era of the Ocean will begin.
An explosion of life to match the Cambrian Era!
This revolting era of Man will be over.
Better fix this door.
Teeth!
I'm going back to Sousuke!
A waterspout?
Captain, look there!
Tsunami!
Turn her into the waves!
What's that?
Captain!
Radio's out, the radar too!
A little girl?
She must be Sousuke's age!
Bye-bye.
See you tomorrow.
Thanks.
Take care.
Sou-chan, do you want to wait here together?
It's okay.
I'll take the shortcut.
Goodbye, Sensei.
Goodbye.
Be careful out there.
Sorry, Sousuke.
The door wouldn't open, would it?
The power's out.
Was the school okay?
Lisa-san, we'll be fine.
Go home.
Are you sure?
Don't worry.
We'll be just fine.
We're spending the night anyway.
You should go while you can.
Wait for me, Sousuke.
Yoshie-san.
Why, Sou-chan...
It's so dark, I didn't see you.
This is for you.
My, what is it?
One for you, Noriko-san.
Thank you.
Can't see a thing.
This is such foolishness!
I don't want to spend the night.
The power's on.
Oh, good.
Certainly is.
It's a goldfish!
Maybe Sou-chan's magic made the lights go on?
Extremely powerful...
Micro typhoon...
Ships should exercise extreme caution...
This TV is useless.
Those idiots couldn't forecast their way out of a paper bag.
You should go home, Sou-chan.
Your goldfish will bring us luck.
We're not afraid now.
Here's yours, Toki-san.
It's all wrinkled.
What is it?
Like this.
I know!
It's a grasshopper.
No, the Koganei Maru.
That's your father's ship, right?
Still looks like a grasshopper.
We're leaving, Sousuke.
Say goodbye to everyone.
Goodbye, everybody.
Goodbye.
Don't let the wind blow you away!
Climb over.
The phones are out too.
The sea is puffed up!
Will the ships sink?
They're safe out at sea.
I'm sure that's where Koichi is.
- I see fish, Lisa.
- Your seatbelt!
You've got to turn back!
People are going to the shelters.
But there are people at the senior center!
They'll be all right.
They're on the leeward side.
I've just got to get home.
You'd better go around the mountain.
Here we go, Sousuke.
No!
Stop!
Look out for that wave!
Here it comes!
Run for it, Lisa-san!
The fish are following us.
Seatbelt, Sousuke!
Hold on tight!
That wave won't quit!
A little girl fell in.
She was riding a fish.
Where?
The sea keeps rising.
Where did you see her?
Running on top of a fish.
A fish?
!
Come on, Sousuke.
Hang on, Sousuke!
We're almost home.
A little girl!
It's dangerous out here.
You'd better come with us.
Stay there, Sousuke.
Sousuke, do you know her?
Ponyo?
Yes, it's me!
It's you!
Ponyo's a little girl now, Lisa!
I made it!
Now listen, children.
No matter how strange everything seems we have to stay calm, all right?
Now be good.
Take off your rain coat, Sousuke.
Here, Ponyo, you hold the light.
I'll bring you a towel.
C'mon, Ponyo!
It smells just like you!
Ouch!
Ponyo!
Gotcha!
Let's get you dried off.
Such pretty red hair!
But your clothes are dry...
Ponyo was a fish.
Water doesn't make her wet.
I like this!
All right!
Who wants a hot drink?
Help me with the light, Ponyo.
Coming!
Think we'll have water?
Sure!
Sure!
Water!
Water!
We have a tank outside.
What about the gas?
Presto!
All right!
All right!
It's propane.
Okay, take your seats.
Okay!
Over here, Ponyo.
Sit down, like this.
Put your stuff down.
You need your hands.
I have feet!
Wow!
What are you two doing?
Her feet are like hands.
There you go.
Here.
This is the best!
That hit the spot.
What shall we do now?
I want ham!
She's crazy about ham.
Then let's eat.
But first let's start the generator.
We need electricity to talk to Koichi.
Koichi is my father.
Is he a bad sorcerer?
No, silly.
He's a ship captain.
What about your father, Ponyo?
Fujimoto!
He keeps me prisoner.
I ran away.
What about your mother?
I love my mother!
She's really scary.
Sounds like Lisa.
Can you help me, Ponyo?
Maybe the fuel's too old?
Is it clogged?
Clogged.
It's clogged there.
Success!
All bright!
Wow, Ponyo!
Antenna!
Antenna!
Did all the ships sink, Lisa?
I can't see a single light.
So loud!
What's wrong?
Even the radio is out of whack.
This is JA4LL...
JA4LL.
Come in, Koichi.
It's Lisa, Sousuke and Ponyo.
We're all doing fine.
We're going to have dinner.
Ham!
Ready?
Careful, it's hot.
It's not ready yet.
It takes three minutes.
Close your eyes!
Not yet!
No peeking, Ponyo.
Okay, you can look now.
And... presto!
Ham!
Good for you, Ponyo.
Lisa, Ponyo fell asleep.
Is her home far away?
I think it must be.
Look, Sousuke.
The sea is calmer.
Because Ponyo's asleep?
Look over there!
It's moving.
Someone's up there.
People from the senior center?
It's gone.
That's the peak road.
Sousuke, stay there with Ponyo.
Maybe I could get through on the mountain road.
I'm going to the senior center.
I'll go too.
Stay here with Ponyo.
I'm going too.
Let's take Ponyo with us.
I'm going with you!
Sousuke, our house is a lighthouse in the storm.
Everyone out there is depending on us.
Someone has to stay here.
Lots of things are happening that I don't understand.
But right now I'm worried about the people at the senior center.
Just knowing you're here will help me.
Don't worry.
I promise to come back.
Promise?
I promise.
You promised!
I love you, Sousuke.
I see the lights of the town!
Finally...
Now we can navigate.
I've never seen that town before.
Did the storm blow us to America?
That's not a mountain.
And that's no harbor...
Those are ships!
The sea is piled up into a mountain!
It's a ship graveyard.
What's going on?
We lost power!
Heave to!
Drop the sea anchor!
Aye-aye!
Something is coming!
A sea goddess?
!
The engine!
We're saved!
The engine started again.
It was Her!
Protect us from harm...
Come on, come on.
A barrier spell!
Where did she learn this?
Good heavens... she's human!
Hey, watch out!
What are you doing?
Stop!
This is unsafe!
Stop that at once!
I'm simply trying to save your sister.
She's here.
She answered my call!
Fujimoto...
You came, my beloved.
Such a beautiful ocean.
So full of magic, like my ancient Devonian sea.
It's Ponyo!
She tasted human blood and plundered all of my elixir.
Ponyo...
What a lovely name.
It's all my fault.
She's totally beyond my control.
It's a complete chaos.
She doesn't understand what she's done.
Now she's human, and she's up there with her boyfriend!
If we don't stop her, the planet is doomed!
No!
The satellites are falling.
Earth's gravitational field...
Be still...
Sousuke... that is his name, yes?
You love your sister, don't you?
Listen, dear...
What if Ponyo really became human?
Use the old magic.
If Sousuke's love is real, she'll lose her powers forever.
But if it's not, she'll turn to sea foam!
That's where we all came from, dear.
But he's only five.
That's impossible!
Sleep well, little children.
Sousuke!
Sousuke!
Ow!
Good morning, Ponyo.
Morning, Sousuke.
We almost got flooded.
Where's Lisa?
She must be stuck someplace.
I wish we had a boat.
There's a boat!
We can't fit.
Can so.
Awesome!
The candle's bigger too.
We can fit.
This is cool.
Cool!
Grab that end.
Ready?
Ready!
She's seaworthy!
Awesome.
No leaks!
Now we fill the boiler.
The water goes in here.
It goes in the boiler.
It's like a rocket!
Everything's shipshape.
Shipshape...
Shipshape?
Shipshape!
Shipshape!
Shipshape!
Is it hot?
Hot!
Hot!
It's hot.
The candle's burning.
It's burning!
Hot!
Hot!
Hot!
It's hot.
Awesome!
We're shipshape, Sousuke!
This is great.
This is so much fun.
It's burning, Sousuke.
It's really hot.
Keep a lookout in front.
I'll steer the boat.
Okay, I'm the lookout.
There's a road.
That's the road Lisa took.
I don't see her.
You will.
She gave me her promise.
Ancient fish... from the Devonian age!
There's Bothriolepis.
That one is...
Dipnorhynchus.
Dipnorhynchus!
That one's really huge.
That's Devonynchus.
Devonynchus!
Ahoy!
A boat!
Ahoy!
They're calling us.
Ahoy!
Ow!
Pretty good, huh?
Now, Ponyo.
Hello.
Hello.
That's a wonderful boat you have.
Why, it's Lisa's little boy, Sou-chan.
It's Sousuke, not Sou-chan!
This is Ponyo.
I was a fish before.
A fish?
Ponyo... that's a nice name.
Mister, have you seen Lisa?
Lisa-san?
She's not with you?
She's at the center.
The senior center?
This is my baby.
Oh, my.
What happened?
Is that for us?
Give me the cup, dear.
Thank you.
Let's try it.
Delicious soup!
Lisa made it.
It's for the baby.
Oh, I'm sorry.
He can't handle soup yet.
But this will help me make milk for him.
Lisa gave me her milk too.
Ponyo, may I have this soup?
Sure.
Thank you.
People from the town.
It's like a festival.
You there!
Do you need assistance?
Thanks, we're okay right now!
Then please follow us.
We're going to the hotel on the peak.
Okay!
Will do.
The whole town's here.
I hope everyone's all right.
Let's go, Ponyo.
Hold on a second.
Milk!
Oh, my...
Milk!
She ate up all the ham.
Thank you.
This will help me make good milk.
Can you use another candle for your boat, Sousuke-kun?
Yeah.
Ponyo will make it bigger.
Thanks.
Be careful!
Thank you both!
What is it, dear?
Don't cry.
Ponyo!
Sou-chan!
It's Sou-chan!
Amazing!
Looks cool!
Where's Lisa-san?
Isn't she with you?
I'm going to pick her up.
So she survived that wave?
Sousuke, take me with you!
Later, Kumiko-chan.
I'm busy right now.
Everyone from the center evacuated to the park.
Take care!
You can do it!
We'll send a boat for them later.
Good luck, captain!
Time for a new candle, Ponyo.
We're okay.
I have another one.
Ow!
It's still pretty hot.
Bye-bye.
Can you make this candle bigger?
All right.
Are you sleepy, Ponyo?
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Good...
It's shallow enough to walk.
A road!
It's shrinking!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo, wake up!
Sousuke...
I'm relieved.
I thought you were turning into a fish.
Lisa's car!
Ponyo, that's her car!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Here's your boat.
Your eyes are wet.
Let's find Lisa.
You forgot your wrap!
Who needs it?
Hurry up!
Look, it's a whale!
My knees don't hurt anymore!
What were we so afraid of?
Is this the Other Side?
Who cares?
It's wonderful.
Attention, please!
Gather round.
Coming!
Shall we?
It's so nice to run.
Meet you there!
The winner!
You're so fast, Kayo-san.
Quiet, everyone!
The moment of truth is at hand.
Sousuke-kun and Ponyo are almost here.
It's so romantic.
Will love triumph?
I'm so excited!
Quiet!
Very soon, you will bear witness to a sacred trial of love.
I'm asking you to wait patiently.
Fujimoto-san, you're not up to something, are you?
I hope not!
Nonsense, he's her father.
They'll be fine if she doesn't wake up.
Now excuse me!
I'd like to believe him...
Where's Lisa-san gone to?
She's been talking with Ponyo's mother for ages.
I hope she's okay.
What are they talking about?
Let's find out.
Lisa-san!
Lisa-san!
We're all rooting for Sousuke and Ponyo!
Lisa-san!
You must be worried.
Sou-chan will be just fine.
He's a strong little boy.
Thanks, everyone.
He'll need your support.
Ponyo, it's a tunnel.
STOP
I've been here before.
Ponyo?
I don't like this place.
Don't let go of my hand.
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Please don't die!
Ponyo!
Wake up, Ponyo!
Let her sleep.
I've been waiting for you, Sousuke-kun.
Lisa-san and the old ladies are waiting too.
Lisa?
!
Won't you come with me?
You and Ponyo.
Let's not wake her up.
Sousuke!
Don't listen to him!
He tricked everyone into going with him.
Toki-san!
But he couldn't fool me!
There's no time, I tell you.
Don't you see what's happening?
If the Moon comes any closer, we're finished!
Liar!
Is that the best you can do?
Sousuke, come here!
Listen to me, Sousuke-kun.
You're the planet's last hope.
Don't make me use force.
Ponyo!
Is this how you treat your father?
Ponyo!
Run, Sousuke!
You don't understand!
You can make it!
Jump!
Now what?
Lisa!
Sousuke!
Ponyo!
Look over there.
Where are we?
So you are Sousuke-san.
Hello.
Are you Ponyo's mother?
Yes.
I want to thank you for bringing my daughter back to me.
Sousuke-san...
Ponyo wanted to be like you, but she unleashed a terrible power.
To become human, she must be loved for who she really is.
Do you know that Ponyo was a fish?
Yes.
Your blood made her almost human.
That's right!
Ponyo licked my cut and made it better.
So that's why she changed!
Can you accept her as she is?
I'll always love Ponyo whether she's a fish, a human or in between.
Come, Ponyo.
Ponyo, Sousuke-san has promised to accept you as you are.
But first, you must give up your powers.
Can you do that?
Kiss this bubble when you return to land and Ponyo will be a little girl.
Way to go, Ponyo!
Thank you, Ponyo's mother!
Now the planet is safe again.
Splendid, Sou-chan!
Sousuke!
Sousuke!
Sousuke!
I'm grateful, Lisa.
Thank you, Gran Mamare.
Is everyone all right?
Wait, I'll get the wheelchairs.
Don't bother.
We'll walk.
It's all so exciting.
I believe this is yours.
Thanks.
I hope you'll forgive me...
Um...
May I?
Take good care of her.
It's Koichi!
Koichi!
It's Lisa!
And there's Sousuke!
Look, Ponyo.
It's Koichi!

Sosuke, come home soon ok?
Ok.
It's a goldfish.
It's stuck.
Strange...
Ouch!
Is it dead?
It licked my finger.
Its Still alive!
Sosuke, we need to go now.
Risa, there's a goldfish.
Strange wind.
Sosuke, I'll start the engine first.
Find it?
What?
Captured by a human?
This is bad, really bad.
its Dead already?
It's alive!
Sosuke, we're getting late.
Risa, the goldfish is still alive.
Goldfish?
I found it by the seaside.
I see...
Although I don't know you,
But please don't spray pesticide here.
Oh, this is not pesticide.
This is deep sea water to avoid dehydration.
Good, as long as it's not poisonous.
Excuse me.
Oh no, it's getting worse.
What a strange guy.
Don't be mean, Sosuke.
Don't judge a book by it's cover.
I won't.
Are You Bringing it to the kindergarten?
Yes
Is it ok with your teacher?
No problem, I'll protect it.
So cute.
The ship is leaving.
Sosuke, eat this.
Do you eat this?
Eat?
Oh hey, my cut is gone.
Risa, her name is Ponyo ("Po-Nyo").
She looks like a little mermaid.
And she is magic.
After she licked my cut, it disapeared.
You like ham?
Risa, Ponyo likes to eat ham.
Just like you.
Faster.
This is filthy, really filthy.
Good morning.
Ponyo, we arrived.
see.
It will be fine here.
Yeah!
Take care.
I gotta go.
Morning, pardon me.
Please take Granny Noriko's chair.
Ok
Little Sosuke, morning.
Granny, I'm busy now.
Talk to you later.
Ara, ara!
Little Sosuke.
See you in a while.
Ara!
Teacher will agree?
Yea
Wait for me here.
I will be right back.
I wonder if any cat will come here?
You stay put ok.
I will be right back.
See you.
Ah, Sui-chan.
A little bit of a fever.
But she looks healthy, she should be fine.
Thank you.
Bye bye.
Good morning, sensei (teacher).
Good morning, Sosuke.
Sosuke, how are you?
Sosuke.
Oh, Kumiko.
Look at this.
Pretty?
My mom bought it for me.
Sosuke, let's play together.
I'm busy right now, maybe later.
Busy with?
I said I'm busy.
Strange Sosuke.
So strange.
Oh.
Ponyo!
Sosuke.
Kumiko.
What is this?
You can't bring this to kindergarten.
These trees does not belong to the kindergarten.
It belongs to the Sunflower's Home, so it's ok.
Let me see.
Oh, a goldfish.
Its not a goldfish, Ponyo.
Ponyo?
I want to see.
If I let you see, you can't tell anyone else.
Ok, I won't tell.
See, cute right?
So odd looking.
And fat.
Goldfishes at my home are more beautiful.
It's Kumiko fault.
Its her fault to say something bad about you.
Here lets get you some fresh water.
Oh.
Ponyo.
That's great.
Isn't that little Sosuke's voice?
Sosuke should be in kindergarten.
My Hearing must be getting worse.
Granny Megumi, I'm here.
It's little Sosuke.
Wanna guess what is this?
Must be some good stuff.
That's right.
Guess what colour?
Red?
Red.
Correct.
How do you know?
Let me take a look.
Oh.
It's pretty.
Cute.
Her name is Ponyo.
She likes ham, and she is magic.
The cut i had disappeared.
Because she licked it.
Can she lick my leg?
If you could run like little Sosuke that would be great.
I must ask Ponyo then.
Let me see as well.
Sure.
Oh, disgusting.
Isn't it a mermaid?
Quickly return it to the sea.
It will bring a tsunami.
What?
a tsunami, that's too much.
When a mermaid comes on land.
a Tsunami will follow.
It's been a myth since a long time ago.
Is a tsunami. a Tsunami is here
A Tsunami is here, tsunami...
What happened granny Shi?
My clothes...
Sosuke.
Sosuke.
Sosuke.
Sosuke, apologize to granny Shi.
Don't worry, I will protect you.
Sosuke.
Sosuke!
Ah!
Ponyo
Ponyo...
Sosuke...
Ponyo, Sosuke.
I Like You.
I like you too!
Ponyo, like Sosuke.
Ponyo!
Ponyo Ponyo
Ponyo?
Ponyo...
Sosuke.
Ponyo...
Sosuke, dont worry, have faith.
Even with more pain, it won't change her destiny.
Ponyo is destined to live in the sea.
That's why she must return to the sea.
That Mr. Pesticide guy was suspicious.
Give me a bite.
Come on, let me try its Quite tasty.
Cheer up a bit.
Today is the day Koichi returns.
(Koichi is Sosuke's father).
If you dont cheer up, He will be sad.
Don't go to the sea anymore today ok?
Ok.
Sosuke, come inside.
If I put the bucket here, Ponyo will know this is her home.
Right, if you want to put it there...
Then go ahead.
Yeah!
Sosuke, please answer the telephone.
It must be Koichi
Hello?
Its me.
I'm fine.
I cant home home today.
Crossing the border, as usual.
Will lose the signal.
Heres Risa.
Koichi?
Can't you just refuse such a request?
You can't just leave your wife and son on the cliff.
I don't know!
What is this!
?
Sosuke, let's eat outside.
I want to eat inside.
Its Koichi.
Risa, is Koichi's ship.
Quick, turn off the lights.
He's a genius, hes just 5 years old.
Your wife must be mad.
I-AM-SORRY
Risa, he said sorry.
B.A.K.A.
BAKA... (stupid)
Ka Ka Ka...
Risa, he said "I LOVE U".
Very very much.
(stupid stupid stupid...)
So beautiful.
(Smooth sailing)
(Thank you)
(Good night)
Risa, don't cry.
Im didnt cry.
I promised to protect Ponyo.
Ponyo... you are not crying right?
Ok, let's cheer up.
(Totoro theme song)
Ouch!
You gonna cheer up too?
Just like Me, Ponyo is cheerful too.
Ya.
Let's eat.
Let's eat Koichi's portion too.
It's all because of me.
I Shouldn't have brought all of you to visit the farm.
I've told all of you, The human's air water are so filthy.
Come eat this, come.
Hear me? "Polumisharudin" (Supposed Ponyo real name)
I want to eat ham.
Ham?
Where did you learn such horrible thing?
Spill it, Polumisharudin.
I'm not Polumisharudin, I am Ponyo.
Po...po...ponyo?
Ponyo is good.
I want to be a human.
A Human?
What is so good about that stupid and horrible creature?
Humans take lives from the sea.
I was once a human.
I sacrificed a lot not to be one of them.
I want hands.
And not these kinda legs.
I want legs like Sosuke.
That's enough...
Hey, i have hands.
I have legs too...
Let me out, Let me out.
You've tasted human blood havnt you?
I am going to go see Sosuke.
(spell)
Return... return...
(spell)
Ah, i dont have enough power.
Go out... go out...
Calm down, starry path (spell)
Return.
Return.
Return.
Definitely the child of 'that person'.
She has Such great power.
If i hold her like this, she should be fine...
My powers can only hold her for a while.
Looks like only 'that person' can do it.
No.
It's too much for all of you.
(sho... sho...)
No way...
Danger danger...
The barrier to stop crabs is failing.
it might disrupt the balance of nature.
Calm down, calm down.
I get a bad feeling everytime when i goto meet 'that person'.
Oh no, oh no.
I have yet to finish cleaning up.
It doesn't get weak here. (the barrier)
This is so hard to open.
I'll need to come and fix it later.
I can't let even one sea creature enter here.
Unless there will be big trouble.
Well-done.
The Powers of the sea are spreading to every corner.
When this well is filled up.
The time of the sea will arrive.
And the end of those dangerous creatures.
The time of filthy human will end.
Close it, close it (spell)
Ha~
Haha~ Haha~
I'm going to Sosuke.
Sosuke.
Ha~
Tsunami?
Captain, whats that, whats that...
Is A Tsunami!
Everyone get inside the ship.
What's that?
Captain, the radio and radar is out.
It's a girl.
About Sosuke's age.
Thank you.
Thanks for your hard work.
Sosuke, wait here for a while ok?
Sensei will company you.
I'm going home with Risa, I will be fine.
See you sensei.
See you.
Be careful.
Sorry, Sosuke.
was the door hard to open?
the power is out.
Is the kindergarten ok?
Yes.
Miss Risa, it's ok.
You can go home first.
is Granny Kaneko not here yet?
Ya, don't worry.
She's just a bit late.
After all we will be here the whole night.
You better get going while you still can.
Sosuke, wait for a while.
Ok.
Granny Megumi.
Little Sosuke.
It's too dark, i can't see a thing.
Here i'll give you this.
Oh?
What is this?
Give one to granny Noriko too.
Thank you.
Its so dark, i can't see a thing.
Such a heavy storm, further more with a black out.
That's why I don't want to stay here.
The power is back.
Great.
Its so bright.
Ahh, a Goldfish!
i wonder if the power came back because Sosuke is here?
There's a storm tonight.
A strong one.
Useless TV.
Can't see a thing.
The Weather forecast is not accurate at all.
Little Sosuke go home quickly.
We got the goldfish charm, We won't be scared of anything.
Ok.
I have one for you too.
So rough.
What is this?
It's like this.
It's a bat, a bat.
No it's not.
Is 'Koganei Maru'.
The ship of Sosuke's father.
Ya.
it looks like a bat.
Sosuke, its time to go, say goodbye to everyone.
Ok.
Goodbye everyone.
Goodbye.
Don't get blown away by the wind.
Lets get out of here.
It looks like the phone is down too.
The sea is rising.
Those ships won't sink will they?
Those ship's that set sail are not afraid of the storm.
Same as Koichi.
Its a fish.
Risa, its a fish.
Put on your seat belt.
Miss Risa, you can't pass here.
Theres Already an order to take refuge.
Take refuge?
There are old folks at Sunflower's Home staying overnight.
That's inner land.
And at higher ground, they will be fine.
Anyway, I must go home.
You can't stay here anymore.
Go through the mountain.
Sosuke, let's go.
Ok.
Please, don't.
Oh no, a big wave is coming.
Miss Risa.
Don't be silly.
It's coming.
Sosuke, sit tight.
Im going to speed up.
What a nasty wave.
A girl fell into it.
What?
Coming from the back of a fish.
Where?
The tide is getting higher.
Sosuke, where is the girl?
There, running at the back of those fishes.
Fishes?
Let's go, Sosuke.
Hold on, Sosuke.
We're almost home.
There is the girl.
Its dangerous, come over here.
Sosuke, don't move.
Sosuke, do you know her?
Ponyo?
Its Ponyo.
Yup!
I'm Ponyo.
Risa, Ponyo returned as a little girl.
I'm back.
Listen, Sosuke and Ponyo.
No matter how happy you are.
You must calm down now.
Understand?
Ok.
Take off your rain coat Sosuke.
Ponyo didn't wear shoes right?
Hold it.
I'll go get something to dry you up.
Ponyo, this way.
Its got the smell of Sosuke.
Ponyo
Gotcha.
Don't stay all wet.
Ponyo's hair looks good in red.
Your clothes are not even wet.
Ponyo used to be a fish.
It's ok to be wet.
Ya.
Ponyo like this.
Great, let's have tea.
Ponyo, bring the lights here.
Will water come out?
Yes it will!
It will!
Its coming out.
Because we have a tank on top.
Fire will come from here.
That's wonderful.
Wonderful.
Because it's single.
Sit down.
ok.
Ponyo sit here.
You should sit this way.
Put them down like this.
You can't use your hands that way.
I have my feet.
Wow, that's great.
Oh, what's that?
Ponyo's feet are like hands.
Please.
Take it.
I'm going ahead.
It's delicious.
What's next, what to do?
Ponyo thinks ham is good.
Ponyo likes to eat ham.
Then we will have dinner.
But before that, we will have to start the power generator.
We will Connect the power and then talk to Koichi.
Koichi is my father.
Evil magician?
No, he is the captain of Koganei Maru.
What about Ponyo's father?
Fujimoto, he locked me up.
Ponyo ran away.
Ponyo's mother?
Mommy, my favorite.
But very scary.
Just like Risa...
Thank for helping Ponyo.
Out of fuel?
Stuck?
It's stuck!
Stuck over there.
Great!
Its so bright.
Ponyo is so great.
Radio, radio.
Risa, did the ship sink?
Theres no lights.
Its very noisy.
Everything ok?
Looks like the radio is not working.
This is JA4 LL
JA4 LL
Can you hear me Koichi?
This is Risa and Sosuke and Ponyo.
Everyone is fine here.
Let's eat.
Ham!
lets put some water in there.
It's hot, careful.
Its not ready yet.
Wait for 3 minutes.
Close your eyes.
Not yet.
Ponyo don't peek.
Ok.
You can open your eyes now.
Enjoy your meal.
Wow.
Ham!
Wonderful, Ponyo.
Oh!
Hot, hot.
Risa, Ponyo fall asleep.
Ponyo must have came from far away?
Yeah, must be.
Sosuke, see.
The storm stopped.
Is it because Ponyo fall asleep?
Sosuke, there.
Something is moving.
Somebody is over there.
Granny Megumi?
It's gone.
hows the road to the mountain?
Sosuke wait here with Ponyo.
I'm going over.
I should be fine driving on the mountain's road.
Sosuke, I'm going to the Sunflower's Home.
I'm going too.
Sosuke and Ponyo please wait here.
I want to go, just bring Ponyo along.
I am going with you.
Sosuke, this home..
is a lighthouse and in a storm brings lights and hope to those in the dark.
Someone must be here.
lots of strange things have happened.
But I'm not sure why.
There must be a reason.
I'm worried about those at the Sunflower's Home.
If Sosuke protects this place.
Risa will have support.
I will be fine.
I will come home.
Are you Sure?
Yes I'm Sure.
Make sure then.
I will always love you Sosuke.
The moon is coming out.
We can see the lights from town.
Thank god.
We can navigate now.
We Haven't been to town.
Did we reach America?
That's not the mountain, or the land.
It's all boats.
Carried by the wave.
Gathered as a mountain here.
Must be a grave of boats.
A path to the other side has opened.
The engine stoped!
Fix it quickly.
Drop the anchor.
Aye.
What's at the back?
I saw a goddess!
It started!
We're saved!
It's a goddess.
All thanks to the goddess.
Amitaba (prayer).
Go higher, higher.
Oh, this is a barrier.
Where did she learn this.
What's going on?
She became a human.
Danger.
What are they doing?
All of you.
Danger.
No.
All of you.
Dad is doing this for your sister.
'That person'
Is coming.
Fujimoto
So you came huh?
Beautiful ocean.
Full of magic.
As if I'm back to 'De Po Ji' big ocean.
Ponyo tasted human's blood.
The elixir of life that I collected are gone too.
Ponyo?
What a very nice name.
It's my fault.
Ponyo misused her magical powers.
And opened a big hole on earth.
She has no idea what she's doing.
Some more have turn into a humans.
And ran away to a boy's home.
If this continues, the world will be destroyed.
Oh!
This is bad.
The satelites are falling too.
The gravity of the planet...
Silent.
Sosuke.
It's a boy named Sosuke huh.
All of you love your big sister.
My dear, just let Ponyo become a true human.
Huh?
An elder believes.
If the boy is faithful.
Ponyo can turn into a real human, in exchange for her magical power.
But if that failed,
Ponyo will turn into bubbles.
We are, after all made of bubbles.
But, she's only 5.
She can't possibly make it.
Just let them rest for now.
Our child.
Sosuke.
Sosuke.
Ouch.
Morning Ponyo.
Morning Sosuke.
The ocean has become calm.
Risa is not around.
The roads are flooded.
If only we had a boat right now.
We have one.
We can't use that.
Yes we can.
Wow, that's perfect.
There's even a candle.
You can sit here.
Wow, it's just like a real one.
Exactly like a real one.
You hold that side.
Ready?
Ready!
It's floating.
There's no leaking either.
Alright.
We have to fill it with water.
We need to fill water into the center part.
It's like a rocket.
Well done, Ponyo.
Well done?
Yes, well done.
Well done, well done...
Its Hot?
ohh Very hot.
Very hot very hot
Yay, it's lighted.
It's lighted.
Hot, hot, hot.

Proud of it?
Yup.
Wow...
Sosuke are you happy?
Yes.
Sosuke, it's burning.
Ya.
Sosuke, it's hot.
Ponyo sit in front.
I'll drive.
Ok.
There's the path.
Risa went over the mountain road.
Risa is not there.
Risa will be there, we made a promise.
It's Gogonasus It was said there is 10,000 of them in the river of 'De Pang Ke'.
Oh look, the shy 'Licosus'.
Beautiful.
Leaving already 'Licosus'?
Wow, it's huge, very huge 'Licosus'.
Huge 'Licosus'.
Hey!
Is a boat there.
They are calling for us.
Heeeeeeeeey!
Whoa!
They must have spotted us.
Let's go Ponyo.
Hi.
Hi.
That's a nice boat.
I never knew it was you little Sosuke.
Not little Sosuke.
It's Sosuke.
She is Ponyo.
Ponyo is a fish.
A Fish?
Ponyo is a nice name.
Yup.
Mister, do you know where Risa is?
Risa?
She is not with you?
She went out.
Went out?
This is my little baby.
What happened?
Give it to her.
Give it to me.
Thank you.
I'll go ahead.
What a delicious soup.
Risa made it.
It's for the baby. (not you)
I'm sorry, the baby can't have this yet.
If I drink this.
Then I'll have milk for the baby.
I use to drink Risa's milk too.
Ponyo, can I drink this soup?
Yes you can.
Thank you.
Theres people over there.
It's like a parade.
Anything we can help with?
Thanks, but we're fine for now.
Then please be careful on your way up to the hostel.
Ok will do.
There are many people.
Wonderful, everyone are fine.
Ponyo.
Let's move on.
Hold on.
Milk.
Milk.
It will get cold if you don't eat it.
Thank you.
There will be a lot of milk.
Sosuke, that's what left, you want it?
Ya, that should help.
Thank you.
Be careful.
Thank you.
What's wrong?
Ponyo.
Wow!
Sosuke.
Where is Risa?
She went out.
I gotta go.
Risa must have gone along the wave.
That's great.
Sosuke, let me sit on it too.
We're in a hurry, see you later.
(Sosuke, hurry to the school, kambateh)
"Alert, we're not in duty, we can only wish you all the best."
Ponyo, we need a new candle.
It's ok, we still have the one we just received.
Ouch. its still very hot.
Bye bye.
Ponyo, enlarge this too.
Can you?
Ponyo, wanna sleep?
Ponyo

Risa.
Risa's car is over there.
Risa, Risa
Sosuke, I got your ship.
water is coming out of your eyes.
We have to look for Risa.
Ok.
(Quick, look at this, so beautiful, Just like the underwater palace.)
Folks, please come over here.
Ok, let's go.
It feels great to run. lets go ahead first.
Please calm down everyone.
We're at the critical moment.
Sosuke is coming.
Oh, what's going on.
A love test?
My heart is pounding.
Me too.
Please calm down.
Everyone here is the witness.
Please hold on.
Mr. Fujimoto You're not going to do something bad to Sosuke and Ponyo right?
Of couse not.
If they past this test.
Then...
I think he's a gentleman What is Risa doing.
Look, over there.
She's been chatting with Ponyo's mother.
This must be hard for Risa.
What they are doing over there.
Let's call her.
Risa, Risa...
Don't worry.
Sosuke will come for you.
Risa must be worried.
Sosuke will be fine.
Thank you.
Everyone let's cheer for Sosuke.
Ponyo, it's a cave.
Don`t be afraid of the dark.
I hate this place.
Don't let go of my hand.
Ok.
Ah, Ponyo.
Ponyo Ponyo
Ponyo Don't die.
Ponyo Ponyo Wake up Ponyo
Shh... be quiet Sosuke You have finally got here.
Risa and Grannies are waiting for you.
Risa

Don't wake Ponyo.
We'll move quietly.
Sosuke.
Don't fooled by him.
All the sweet talk.
He took everyone away.
Its granny.
Don't get tricked.
There's no time.
Don't you want to meet them.
We can't let the moon get any closer...
Something terrible will happen.
You need a better excuse.
Ah
Sosuke, come with me.
Only you can save this world.
I won't hurt you.
Ponyo.
Ack!
How could you treat your father this way.
Ponyo.
Sosuke, come here quickly.
I said I won't hurt you.
Keep going.
How dare you.
Watch out!
Risa Sosuke Ponyo
You must be Sosuke.
Hello.
You're Ponyo's mother?
Yes I am.
You finally brought Ponyo here.
Shh...
Thank you.
Sosuke.
Ponyo has broken the seal in order to become a human.
She wanted to become a human.
She requires a man that will understand Ponyo and will accept her.
You know she's a fish.
Yes.
She turned into a mermaid because she tasted your blood.
Is that so?
Knowing that she's half fish half human.
Are you ok with that?
Yes.
It doesnt matter if she's a fish, a mermaid or a human, I still like (love) her.
Ha ha...
Come here Ponyo.
Ponyo.
Looks like Sosuke has accepted you.
You must abandon your magic power in order to become a human.
Can you do that?
Yes.
When you return to surface, kiss this bubble once.
Ponyo will then transform into a 5 year old girl like you.
Ponyo That's too wonderful.
Thank You.
Ponyo's mama.
Everyone, the curse is broken.
That's great!
Risa, thank you.
You too, thank you, for everything.
Everyone is fine.
We'll bring the wheelchairs immediately.
We can walk.
This is your ship.
Thank you.
Im really sorry, can i shake your hand?
I'll entrust Ponyo to you.
Its Koichi's ship
Koichi.
Risa, Sosuke is here too.
Risa, is Koichi's ship.
[ship horn blares]
[orchestral music plays]
[bubbling, crackling]
[squeaking]
[bubbling]
[rumbling]
[squeaking]
Shh!
[all squeaking]
[softly squeaking]
[kisses]
[all squeaking loudly]
[orchestral music plays]
[woman singing in foreign language]
Sosuke, come right back up, ok?
Ok!
[squeaking] [gasps]
[rumbling]
[gasps]
[grunts]
Huh?
A goldfish!
Can't get it out.
[growling, moaning]
That was weird.
[Sosuke grunts]
Ow!
It looks kind of dead.
It licked me!
It's alive!
[wave moaning]
Sosuke, we'll be late!
- [waves moaning] - mom, a goldfish!
[mother] Sosuke!
[moaning]
This wind is crazy.
Sosuke, I'm starting the car now!
- [bubbling] - [waves moaning]
Well?
Have you found my daughter?
[moaning]
What?
She was captured by a human?
A boy!
This is very bad.
Is it already dead?
You are alive!
[laughing]
Sosuke, I have a job, you know!
Look, mom, I found a goldfish!
- A goldfish?
- It was right down by the rocks.
- Yeah?
- [metal squeaking]
Hm?
- [squeaking] - [water sprinkling]
I don't know who you are,
But we don't use weed killer around here.
Hm?
What?
This is not weed killer.
This is the purest ocean water,
And it keeps me from drying out on land.
Whatever.
As long as it's not weed killer.
- Excuse us.
- [man] please wait.
Uh-oh.
This is bad.
This is very bad.
[engine revving]
Wow.
That Guy was a freak show.
But don't you call people "freak show."
We never judge others by their looks.
I know, mom.
I don't.
Oh.
Another experiment for school?
- Mm-hm.
- Your teacher doesn't really like show and tell.
I think it'll be fine.
Don't worry, I'll take good care of you.
Huh!
She sure is pretty.
There's a ship headed for dry dock.
Hurry up.
[woman] eat your breakfast.
I wonder if she would eat this.
[Sosuke] want some?
Hey!
My cut is all gone!
Mom, I think I'll call her Ponyo.
- Mmm?
- She came to me.
She might be magic.
[Sosuke] I saved her.
She's my responsibility now.
Want ham instead?
Mom, Ponyo really likes to eat ham.
So she thinks she's human?
Ouch!
[grunts]
Whoa!
Turn!
Humans are disgusting!
Come on, Lisa, hurry!
[man] all this waste, filth.
[Lisa] morning, shima-san!
Ponyo, look.
You can see our house.
- Ask about the fish.
- I will.
- Love you, Sosuke.
- [Sosuke] goodbye.
Morning!
Seems like I'm always late.
- Can you get me another wheelchair?
- [Lisa] sure.
- Good morning, Sosuke.
- Excuse me.
- I'm in a big hurry, Yoshie.
- Is that so?
- And me, Sosuke?
- Not now, Toki.
I'm concentrating.
Ah... [engine starts]
Maybe the teacher will get mad.
I got it.
You'll be safe here, Ponyo.
I'll be back soon.
Hm.
I wonder if there are any cats around here.
That should do it, Ponyo.
Stay put.
I'll be right back.
- See you later.
- Hello there, Toshi.
[woman] I'll call if her cough gets worse, but she looks fine.
- You good, little sweetie?
- Oh, thank you.
Good.
- Bye-bye.
- Good morning, sensei.
- [woman] good morning, Sosuke.
- [woman 2] hi, Sosuke.
- Sosuke!
- Kumiko!
Look at me!
My mother made me a new dress.
- Isn't it pretty?
- Hm...
Hey, Sosuke, let's go play.
Can't now.
I'm busy.
You're not busy.
You're five.
- I am too!
I have a job.
- You're so weird.
Yeah.
Hm!
Oh!
Ponyo?
Ponyo!
[sniffling]
- [girl] Sosuke!
- [gasps]
- Oh, Kumiko.
- What is that?
There are rules about bringing things to school for a reason.
I know.
This isn't school.
These bushes are on the senior center property.
Let me see!
- Oh, a goldfish?
- She's not just a goldfish.
She's Ponyo.
Ponyo?
Let's see!
- [Sosuke] ok, but don't tell she's here.
- [Kumiko] I won't.
The rules are:
Look but don't touch.
Look at her.
Isn't she pretty?
That's the most boring goldfish
I've ever seen in my entire life.
[screaming] [gasps]
[sobbing]
That one was Kumiko's fault.
You should never judge others by their looks.
Let's get you some more water.
[straining]
Ponyo!
Ah!
[laughs] that was my fault.
[giggling]
[Yoshie] there it comes again.
I hear old Sosuke's voice.
But I know our boy is in school right now.
[laughs] so it must be only in my head.
Look, Yoshie.
I'm right over here.
Oh, that's a relief.
[Yoshie] I haven't lost my mind quite yet.
Are you ready to see my big surprise?
- What is it?
- I'll show you.
But first, guess what color she is.
- Hm...
She...
She's red!
- Red!
That's right!
- How did you both guess that?
- [Noriko] come on, show us!
Ok.
- Well, look!
- Very pretty.
Her name is Ponyo.
She likes to eat ham.
- And she can do magic!
- [Yoshie gasps]
I got a cut on my thumb,
And it went away because she licked it.
[both] oh!
Maybe she could use some of her magic to fix my hips and back.
I'd let a fish lick me
If it'd get me out of this wheelchair.
Well, I don't know about all that licking.
- I'd have to ask Ponyo...
- Let me have a look in that green pail.
Yes, Toki-san.
[shrieking] it has a real face on it!
Hurry up!
Put it back in the ocean.
Don't you realize it'll cause a tsunami?
Oh, you.
It's always tsunami, day and night.
Fish with faces who come out of the sea cause tsunamis.
[Toki] that's what they always say.
[shrieking] tsunami!
Tsunami!
It's here!
Ah!
Oh!
Sosuke, put her back in the ocean where she belongs!
[gasps]
Toki, what's the matter?
I'm soaking wet.
Look at my clothes!
[Lisa shouting] Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Come back here and apologize!
[sighs]
Don't worry, Ponyo.
No matter what, I will protect you.
[Sosuke] I promise.
Sosuke!
[gasps]
Sosuke!
[gasping, laughing]
Ponyo!
Ponyo.
Sosuke.
Ponyo loves Sosuke!
I will love you, too.
- Ponyo loves Sosuke!
- [laughing]
[gasps] [waves moaning]
Ponyo?
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ah!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
- [Sosuke shouting] Ponyo!
- Sosuke!
[Sosuke] Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
[Sosuke sobbing]
[continues sobbing]
Listen, Sosuke, you know, this could be for the best.
I know you tried, but Ponyo is a fish.
[Lisa] she wasn't meant to live in a bucket.
The ocean is home to her.
Anyway, let's get home.
Hopefully, that spritzing weirdo is gone.
Whoo!
Can I have a lick?
Hurry, it's starting to melt.
Dad's favorite.
Me, too!
I'm really sorry, Sosuke.
But dad is finally coming home tonight.
[Lisa] you can tell him all about Ponyo.
- No more ocean today, ok?
- [Sosuke] mm-hm.
- [window opening] - [Lisa] Sosuke?
Sosuke?
Time to come in now.
Maybe if I leave the pail,
Ponyo will know where we live when she comes back.
Do that.
I think that's a lovely thing to do for Ponyo.
Mm-hm.
[phone rings]
Sosuke, can you get that?
- It must be your dad.
- [ringing continues]
Hello?
Yep.
She's fine.
- [Sosuke] are you at the dock?
- [man] I caught a second run,
So I have to take it.
I won'tbe hometonight.
I'll signal you when we pass.
Canyouhelpmeoutwithmom?
No, you should tell her.
[Lisa] hi, honey.
Uh-huh.
What?
!
Too many in a row, Koichi!
Let someone else take it!
Go ahead, abandon your wife and child
Up here on a cliff all alone.
Oh, jerk!
Uh!
Come on, Sosuke.
Let's get out of here.
What if Ponyo comes back?
Mm!
Ah!
There's dad.
Turn off the lights, mom.
- Don't you wanna signal him?
- Mm-mm.
Hey, my son is working the signal all by himself!
- Can you believe that?
- Your wife must be pretty mad.
[Sosuke] s...
O...
R R...
Y.
- Dad says he's very sorry.
- B-u-g...
- [Lisa] o-f-f.
- B...
[Lisa] b-u-g o-f-f.
B-u-g o-f-f.
Mom, dad says he loves you.
[Sosuke] he says, "lots and lots."
Wow!
Nice, dad!
[Sosuke] don't cry, mom.
I know dad breaks his promises sometimes.
But he does his best for us.
I promised Ponyo I'd take care of her.
Then I lost her.
I wonder if she's crying now.
- Ah!
- You are so good!
Mmm!
[both laughing]
%%happyas canbe% %
- Mm!
Ah!
- Don't you worry, Sosuke.
You did your best and Ponyo will be just fine.
- Ok.
- [chuckles]
[Lisa] I say we start with dessert and go backwards!
It's been a backwards kind of day.
[man] it's not your fault.
I exposed you to the magic and you're too young to understand.
I have to keep the sea in balance.
It's a great responsibility.
You must promise me something:
You will never go back to the surface.
Yes?
Come on, now.
Eat, Brunhilde.
I want ham!
Ham!
You ate their food.
What else did you do?
Did you taste blood, Brunhilde?
My name is not Brunhilde.
It's Ponyo.
- Ponyo?
- Ponyo!
Ponyo loves Sosuke!
I will be a human, too!
Human?
What do you know about humans, Brunhilde?
They spoil the sea.
[man] they treat your home like their empty, black souls.
I was once, long ago, a human myself.
I had to leave that all behind to serve the earth.
Hands!
I want hands!
I don't want these flippers anymore!
[Ponyo] I want feet, like Sosuke!
- That's enough!
- [straining] [squeaking] [straining] ah!
Oh!
[all squeaking] [straining]
I made hands!
I made feet, too!
Ha!
- Yes!
- What?
No, no!
Don't tell me.
You have tasted human blood!
I'm going to Sosuke!
Enough!
You're making a terrible mistake!
Don't do it!
Stop it.
Stop it!
Stop changing now.
Revert.
Revert.
Revert!
Revert!
- [moaning] - revert!
[straining] stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it!
- Don't change!
- [Ponyo straining]
- [Ponyo grunting]
- I need more power!
[Ponyo] let me out!
Let me out!
[grunting] let me out!
I want to see Sosuke!
Let me go!
- Let me out!
- You can't be human and magic at the same time, sweetheart.
Be still, be still, be still, be still, be still.
[all chattering]
[sighs] she's already so powerful.
Just like her mother.
[man] if you could only remain innocent and pure forever.
[all chattering, squeaking]
I don't have the power to hold her for very long.
I need to ask for her mother's help now.
I...
What?
Huh!
They're headed for my elixirs.
Shoo!
Shoo!
Get out of here!
Shoo!
That was too close.
I must be careful not to upset the balance of nature.
Calm.
I must remain calm.
When I think of leaving her again, my heart won't stop pounding.
Right, then.
Focus on work.
This batch should be ready.
At least there aren't leaks down here.
This door still doesn't fit right.
I'll fix that next.
If even one living creature got in here...
Ah, yes.
I can feel the power of the ocean
In the furthest reaches of my DNA.
When this well is full,
Then the age of the ocean will begin again.
An explosion of life to match the Cambrian age.
An end to the era of those abominable humans.
[man grunting] this cursed door!
[squeaking]
[all squeaking, chattering]
[all chattering]
[kissing]
Teeth!
[all chattering]
Let's find Sosuke!
[creaking]
[all shouting]
I'm free!
- Waterspout!
- Captain, look over there!
- [man] it must be a tsunami!
- [Koichi] turn the ship into the wave!
Look!
What is that?
[man] captain, all our instruments just went dead!
It's a little girl.
Looks like she's about Sosuke's age.
- Thanks again.
- Sure.
See you tomorrow.
It's raining so hard, Sosuke.
I'll call your mother and have her pick you up.
That's all right.
I'll take the shortcut.
Goodbye, sensei.
Bye, Sosuke.
Be careful out there.
Sosuke, I'm sorry.
The door didn't open, right?
The power just went out.
- Everything ok at school?
- Mm-hm.
Lisa, if your shift's over, you can go home.
Sure you don't need my help?
[woman] don't worry.
We'll be fine.
A little rain Storm keeps the seniors entertained.
If I were you, I'd get out of here while you still can.
Wait here, sweetie.
I'll be right back.
Ok.
Hi, Yoshie.
Oh, Sosuke.
Is that you?
It's so dark I can barely see.
Here, Yoshie.
I made this for you.
Oh!
What do we have here?
There's one for you, too, Noriko.
Thank you, Sosuke.
I can't see a thing.
I don't know why we're still here.
It's just a little rain.
I wanna go back to my own house.
There we go.
That's more like it.
Let's see.
Your goldfish!
I bet the lights came back on because Sosuke's here.
They're now calling the bizarre event a micro-typhoon.
Ship... [static]
Ah, this stupid TV.
Nobody understands weather anymore.
Might as well look at shadows and listen to crickets.
You should take your mother home now.
With our lucky goldfish to keep us company,
- We'll be just fine.
- Ok.
[man on TV] ...
Landslides, floodingandtidalsurges.
People trying toevacuate...
This is for you, Toki.
I can't tell.
What is it?
It's wrinkled.
It goes like this.
I got it.
It's a grasshopper.
No, it's the Koganei maru.
That's the name of your father's ship, isn't it Sosuke?
- Mm-hm.
- Now, it looks like a party hat.
Sosuke, we've gotta get on the road.
Let's hurry now and say goodbye.
Ok.
Ladies, good evening.
[both] good evening, Mr. Sosuke.
Be careful the wind doesn't blow you away.
Let's go.
Slide in.
They said the phones are out, too.
The ocean looks all puffed up.
You think the Storm could sink the ships?
No.
Ships can handle a Storm.
They go out to sea.
That's what your father's doing right now.
[yelping]
I saw a fish!
Did you see that, mom?
Put your seatbelt on!
Hold on, Lisa!
You can't cross here!
We've just gotten word.
They're gonna evacuate this side.
It's not mandatory.
There are some people up at the senior center.
You should get them out.
They're fine.
They're on the leeward side.
You need to go back and seek shelter there.
Ok.
But right now, I need to get home.
- Well, you can't cross here.
- Take the mountain road.
- Hold on, kiddo.
- Mm!
No!
Stop!
Don't do it!
Watch out!
Here it comes!
Lisa, you gotta get out of here!
- [Lisa] hold on.
- [engine revving]
The fish are following us now!
[Lisa] turn around.
Sit down.
Ah!
Ah!
Try to hang on to something!
[yelling]
That wave is just after us.
- Mom, the little girl just fell in!
- What?
She was running on a fish and she fell!
Where?
I've never seen the ocean like this.
Sosuke, where did you see a little girl?
She was out there, running on top of a huge fish!
[Lisa] that's impossible.
Sosuke, we have to go!
[screaming] [grunting]
It's ok.
There was no little girl out there.
We're almost home.
[gasps]
There is a little girl.
Come over here!
We'll help you!
Come here!
Stay there, Sosuke.
[gasping]
What?
Sosuke, do you know her?
- Ponyo?
- Mm-hm!
It's me, Ponyo!
- It is you!
- [laughs]
Mom!
Ponyo came back and she's a little girl now!
Who?
[all shouting, laughing]
I found Sosuke!
All right.
Sosuke, Ponyo, life is mysterious and amazing.
But we have work to do now.
And I need both of you to stay calm.
Me, too.
You can take off your rain coat now, Sosuke.
I've got a job for you, Ponyo.
Will you hold the light?
- Huh?
- Stay here, and I'll go get a towel.
- [turns on radio] - [flipping stations] [turns off radio]
- Here, this way!
- [laughs]
- [laughs] - smells like you in here!
- Ow!
- Ponyo!
- Oof!
- There, got ya.
Now, let's rub you down and dry you off.
[mumbling]
Look at that pretty red hair.
It's almost dry.
- Huh!
- Huh?
[Lisa] and your clothes are dry.
That's because Ponyo was a fish, mom.
- Water can't make her wet.
- Mm-hm.
I really like this thing.
So let's calm ourselves down with a hot drink.
Ponyo, will you hold the light for me?
- [Ponyo] coming!
- Ok.
- Who wants to bet the water is working?
- I do!
I do!
- Water!
- Water!
[laughs]
We have our own water tank outside in the yard.
And who thinks the stove will light?
And light!
All right.
- All right!
- We have our own propane tank.
- Ok.
Let's all sit at the table.
- [both] ok!
Ponyo, the table's over here.
Now, sit down like this.
Now, put your stuff down.
- You need to use your hands.
- No, I'll use feet!
Look at that!
Uh...
What are you guys doing?
Look at her feet.
They're just like hands.
[Lisa] here you go.
It's hot.
This is the best.
Mm!
[blowing]
[spitting] [chuckles]
[gulping]
[hiccups]
Hm... [sighs] that hit the spot.
So, what would the two of you like to do now?
Ponyo wants ham!
All she thinks about is ham, mom.
I better make some dinner then.
First, we should start the generator so we can call Koichi.
That's my dad.
We need power to talk to him on the radio.
He's out at sea right now, but he'll be fine.
- Is he a naval wizard?
- No, of course not.
[Sosuke] he's the captain of a ship.
So, Ponyo, what's your dad like?
He hates humans!
He keeps me in a bubble!
- Huh?
- So I swam away from home.
Huh?
So, what's your mother like then?
She's big and beautiful!
- But she can be very scary.
- Just like my mom.
[laughing]
Ponyo, over here, please.
[Lisa grunting]
Mm!
[sighs]
Looks like something must have gone wrong with the fuel line.
- Maybe it's clogged.
- It's clogged.
It's clogged over there.
[straining, bell chimes]
- [gasps] - [engine starts]
- It's on!
- It's light now!
Yeah!
Ponyo, you're amazing.
- Antenna, antenna!
- Hey, mom.
Did all the ships out there sink?
I don't see any lights out there.
All right.
[static on radio] [feedback]
- Too loud!
- What's wrong?
I can't get any reception.
That's really weird.
Transmitting from JA4LL.
JA4LL.
[Lisa on radio] comein ,Koichi.
This is Lisa, SosukeandPonyo.
We wanted you to know thatwe 'realldoingfine .
I'm taking care of everyone, dad!
Ham!
[laughs]
Got your noodles all ready?
Be careful.
It's really hot.
You have to wait a little bit.
It takes three minutes.
[Lisa] ok, close your eyes.
Keep 'em shut.
- Ponyo, uh!
No peeking!
- [gasps]
Get ready to look now.
- Abracadabra!
- [shouting]
[Ponyo] mm!
- It's ham!
- Careful, it's hot.
Oh!
[yelping] hot, hot, hot!
Mm... [moaning]
Mom, Ponyo fell asleep.
Do you think Ponyo came from far, far away?
Yeah, I do.
[Lisa] look outside.
It looks like the waves have calmed down.
Maybe because Ponyo fell asleep.
Do you see that light?
It's moving.
There must be somebody still over there.
That's the senior center.
- I don't see it now.
- Did they evacuate?
[Lisa] I'm worried about the seniors.
Sosuke, stay with Ponyo, ok?
I've gotta go help them.
I can get there if I take the mountain road.
Sosuke, I should go to the senior center.
I'm coming, too.
I'd feel better if you stay up here.
But why can't I come?
We'll wake up Ponyo and take her with us.
I wanna go with you!
Sosuke, right now, our house is a beacon in the Storm.
Our light can be seen by the town and by the ships,
And every place else is dark.
You know I need to help the old people.
So I'm going to leave you here in charge.
You'll do the right thing.
I know it.
[Lisa] you have to be the man of the house tonight.
Let Ponyo sleep, wait for me.
You're only five, but you're very smart.
Sometimes, we take a leap.
Be brave.
You can do it, and I'll be back.
Promise?
- I promise.
- You promised.
I love you, Sosuke.
[orchestral music plays]
[snoring]
Captain, I can see the lights of a city up ahead.
Finally, we can get our bearings again.
We're someplace I've never seen before.
[man] did the Storm blow us to china?
What mountains are those?
I have no idea where we are.
[Koichi] that is a huge wall of water.
Why is the Moon so close?
Hm...
That's no mountain we're looking at.
And that's no town, either.
Those lights are ships.
[Koichi] the Moon is so close,
Its gravity is forcing the ocean to rise.
- What's going on here?
- [rumbling] [gasping]
- The engine stopped!
- Try to hold her steady.
- Arai, drop the sea anchor.
- Yes, sir.
Something's coming this way.
[men shouting]
I just saw the goddess of mercy!
Ah!
- The engine's working.
- It was her.
So you saw her, too?
I thought maybe I was hallucinating.
Thank you for protecting us...
[prays indistinctly]
- Higher, higher.
- [moaning]
Huh?
!
[gasps] that has a powerful spell on it.
How has she learned to do something like that?
What?
I can't believe it!
No!
She's turned into a human!
Whoa!
Hold still!
- You...
What are you doing?
- [giggling sound]
- [man] hold still!
- [squeaking, giggling]
Girls!
Girls...
Whoa!
[man] stop, stop!
Please!
Stop now!
No!
Stop!
Ah!
[man] respect your father!
This was serious.
I'm trying to save your sister.
[squeaking]
At last, she has finally come.
- Fujimoto.
- It's been a long time, my love.
Look at my ocean.
Something has changed.
It's like my ancient Devonian sea, full of magic and power.
You're going to be very upset, my dear.
Ponyo got into my elixirs, and she has tasted human blood.
Ponyo?
What a lovely name.
Hm.
Of course, it's all my fault, really.
She's become so powerful
That she's opened a hole in the fabric of reality.
She's too young to understand, and she wouldn't listen to me.
She's now a little girl.
And she loves a little boy.
And the whole world is out of balance.
Please, please, remove the human in her, or the planet is doomed.
Huh?
[gasps]
Already the earth is pulling satellites from the Sky.
And the Moon pulls the sea closer...
Be calm, dear.
Sosuke.
The boy's name is Sosuke.
[squeaking]
We love your sister, and we all want her to be happy.
Listen, my darling, why don't we let Ponyo become human for good?
We must test the boy.
If Sosuke's love is true,
Ponyo will be permanently transformed
And the balance of nature will be restored.
But if his love isn't real, then Ponyo will turn into sea foam.
True.
That is where we all originated, my darling.
The boy is so young, so innocent.
- What does...?
- Shh.
[woman] let them sleep.
They'll need their rest.
Sosuke!
- Sosuke!
- [both grunting]
Ponyo, you ok?
Good morning, Sosuke.
Huh?
Look at that.
The ocean is at our door.
How come your mom's not here?
The water's so high.
She must be stuck.
Too bad we don't have a boat.
There's a boat, right there!
- It's a little small.
- No, it's not.
[blowing]
Ah!
Uh!
Huh?
Thank you!
Wow!
You even made the candle bigger.
- We can fit!
- This is fantastic.
- Fantastic!
- You take that end, please.
Ok!
- Ready?
- Let's go!
[grunts] whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Ah!
It actually floats!
[laughing]
Doesn't look like it has any leaks.
Now, we have to fill the boiler.
The water gets sucked in through this pipe.
Then it gets heated up here in this round thing.
[inhaling]
[panting, inhales]
[giggling] well, that worked.
[Ponyo laughing]
Looks like everything's shipshape.
- Shipshape!
- Yep.
- Shipshape!
[laughs] - shipshape.
Shipshape!
Shipshape!
Shipshape!
Shipshape!
Shipshape!
What's that?
[gasps]
- Ow!
- Ow!
- Look at that!
- It's burning.
It's hot!
It's hot!
It's hot!
It's hot!
- Is it working?
- Hm...
It's working!
Sosuke, we're shipshape, right?
- Yep.
- This is a good boat.
Mm-hm.
Ah!
- Hey, Sosuke!
Look at me!
- Mm-hm.
- Hey, this is even more fun!
- Mm-hm.
[laughs] that thing makes my nose hot.
Ponyo, you be the boat's lookout.
- And I'll do the steering, ok?
- Mm-hm.
I'm the lookout!
- There's the road.
- That's the road my mom took last night.
- I don't see her anywhere.
- We'll see her.
She promised me she'd come back.
Those are ancient fish.
They lived during the Devonian age.
I know that one.
It's Bothriocephalus.
- And that one is...
- Dipnorhynchus.
Dipnorhynchus!
Wow!
That one's really huge!
- That's Devonynchus!
- Devonynchus!
[man] ahoy!
[woman] ahoy!
- [man] ahoy...
- Whoa, there's a boat!
[woman] ahoy!
I'm gonna say that.
Ahoy!
Ow!
Whoa, that's fast!
- Hey!
- I'm getting the hang of this.
Get ready to stop, Ponyo.
- [spitting] - [coughing]
- Hello, you two.
- Hello.
Hey, that is quite a boat you got there.
I've seen you before.
You're Lisa's little boy, aren't you?
He's not a little boy.
He's Sosuke!
She's Ponyo.
And I used to be a fish.
Is that right?
[giggles]
I like your name, Ponyo.
It's cute.
Mm-hm.
By the way, have you seen my mom?
Your mother?
Why isn't your mother with you?
- She went to the senior center.
- Wow, way up there?
My baby likes you.
[cooing]
- [fussing] - oh, sweetheart.
[crying]
Oh, is that for us?
Can I have the cup?
Well, thank you.
It smells good.
- [crying] - wow, that's good soup.
Thanks.
- My mom made it from scratch.
- The soup's for him!
Oh, I'm sorry.
He's a little too young.
He can only drink milk at this age.
But I could eat the soup instead,
And it would help me to make milk for him.
Huh?
Yeah, my mom made milk for me, too.
Ponyo, what do you say?
Is it all right if I eat the soup?
- That's fine.
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- [Sosuke] huh?
- [chanting] [chanting]
People from the town!
It's just like a parade!
Ahoy!
Are any of you in need of assistance at this time?
We're all good here!
But thanks for checking on us, captain!
[man] we are taking everyone to the mountain peak hotel!
For your safety, we request that you follow us!
Aye, aye!
Will do!
- [Sosuke] looks like the whole town is here.
- I don't see your mom.
- I hope she's ok.
- Ponyo, time for us to cast off.
Hold on a second.
- Here, have some milk.
- Oh.
Uh...
It's for milk.
She already ate all the ham off those sandwiches.
Thank you.
That's very generous of you, Ponyo.
Sosuke, here.
I brought you the biggest candle I have.
Thanks.
Ponyo will make it bigger.
- See you later.
- Take care.
Be careful.
- [crying] - oh!
What's the matter?
[woman] shh, shh, shh.
You have a cold.
[gasps] [crying]
[cooing]
Ponyo!
[Ponyo laughing]
- [baby laughs] - [mother laughs]
[Sosuke] hey, are you guys ok?
[woman] hey, Sosuke.
- What are you doing out here?
- Sosuke, where's your mother?
[Sosuke] she went to the senior center last night!
We're on our way to find her!
You know, I still can't believe Lisa beat that wave.
- That's Lisa.
- Sosuke, can I ride with you?
I can't.
I'm busy.
I have a job to do now.
[man] check the park.
The seniors should be there by now.
- [man 2] good luck, kid!
- [woman] you'll find her!
We'll send a boat for the seniors
As soon as we drop this group off!
- Good luck, captain!
- [chanting]
[cawing]
Ponyo, our candle is just about out.
We'll be ok.
The fisherman gave me another one.
Ow!
It's still pretty hot.
Bye-bye.
Here, Ponyo.
Can you make this bigger?
All right.
Hey, are you ok?
Hm?
- [Sosuke] Ponyo.
- Hm?
[grunts]
Ponyo.
Ponyo!
[snoring]
Oh, good.
I can walk from here.
There's the road.
[Sosuke grunts] [gasps] it's shrinking!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo, wake up!
Sosuke.
[yawns]
You scared me.
Don't turn into a fish again.
I'd miss you.
[gasps]
My mom's car!
Ponyo, come on!
She might be there!
Hey, mom!
Mom!
Mommy!
Mommy!
Mom!
Mommy!
Mom!
Mom!
Here, I've got your boat.
There's water coming from your eyes.
- Let's go find your mom.
- Mm-hm.
[laughter]
- [Noriko] it's so beautiful!
- You forgot your cane!
Look, here comes a whale again!
I think he sees us.
The other side is nice, isn't it?
- And my knees don't hurt.
- This is the other side?
- Where do you think we are, Las Vegas?
- [laughter]
- It's like a dream.
- Ladies, can we gather around, please?
- [all] coming!
- Why don't we run?
Come on!
- It's so nice to run.
- Beat you there!
[women laughing]
Winner!
Everyone, quiet, please.
The time has come for you to bear witness
To a sacred test of love.
- Oh, how exciting!
- Are they too young for this?
- Are we too old?
- When are they coming?
Please, ladies, the children are coming now.
And remember, this is a very important moment.
[man] a crucial moment.
Fujimoto, you won't let any harm
Come to Sosuke or Ponyo, will you?
[woman] it's not in his nature.
Of course I wouldn't.
My hope is Ponyo will stay asleep.
Excuse me.
Do you think we can trust him?
I wonder what Lisa is thinking.
She's with that woman,
And they've been talking all night and day.
Poor Lisa.
Must be hard on her.
I wish we could hear what they're talking about.
Oh, why don't we just ask.
Lisa!
[all] Lisa!
[all] Lisa!
We wanna know what you're talking about!
Come tell us!
- My dear!
- Lisa!
What's going on?
Lisa, are you sure you can trust that man?
It's so exciting.
Tell us what's going to happen next.
Whatever happens, I'm just glad you're all here for this.
- It's going to be fine.
- [all chattering]
I think I've been here before.
Ponyo?
Don't like this place.
Don't let go of my hand.
Mm... [rattling]
[gasping]
Ponyo!
[snoring]
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
[gasping]
[grunting]
Ponyo!
Please don't die!
Ponyo!
- Ponyo, wake up!
- Shh.
Be careful not to wake her.
It's good to meet you, Sosuke.
We've all been waiting for you.
- The old ladies, your mother...
- My mother?
Won't you come with me and join them, Sosuke?
Ponyo, too.
[man] come with me.
I promise I'm not going to take Ponyo away from you.
- We have to go now.
- [Toki] Sosuke!
Sosuke, don't listen to that wacko!
He tricked all the others into going with him,
But he couldn't fool me!
Toki!
Did you hear me?
Nobody fools me!
There is so little time!
My choice has to be made!
If the Moon comes any closer...
Can't you see it?
The world is out of balance!
We will all be underwater!
That's the best excuse you can come up with?
A falling Moon?
- [moaning] humans!
- Sosuke, come to me!
Sosuke, please listen.
You have to trust me.
You're the only one who can save the planet.
Do it now.
Do it!
Ponyo!
Brunhilde, respect your father!
Ponyo!
Sosuke, come on!
Bring them to me!
Faster!
Jump for it!
[squeaking]
Now what?
[squeaking]
- Mama!
- Sosuke.
Ponyo!
You don't have to swim.
I don't know why we're here.
- So this is Sosuke.
- How do you do?
- Are you Ponyo's mother?
- Yes.
You brought my daughter safely here.
[all] shh!
[woman] thank you.
Sosuke, Ponyo opened a magic well
Because she wants very much to be human, to become a real girl.
She needs you to accept and love her as she truly is.
You know that Ponyo was a fish, don't you?
Mm-hm.
[woman] and you know her as a human.
- Your drop of blood did that.
- Oh, that's it!
I cut my thumb.
Then Ponyo licked it and made it better.
So that's how she changed into a human.
Could you love her if she moved between two worlds?
Mm-hm.
I love all the Ponyos.
It's a big responsibility, but I really love her.
[giggling] [chuckling]
- [all laughing] - ooh!
Ponyo, come here, please.
Ponyo, Sosuke has promised to accept you as you are.
To become human, you must choose to abandon magic.
- Can you do that?
- Mm-hm.
Kiss the bubble, child, when you return to land,
And Ponyo will become a girl, growing up just like you.
I accept, Ponyo.
Thank you very much, Ponyo's mother.
Everyone, the balance of nature is restored.
- Life begins again.
- [cheering]
I'm so proud!
[all chattering]
My Sosuke.
[squeaking]
[gasps]
- Good luck, Lisa.
- Thank you.
I'll take care of her.
There you are!
Are you all right?
Wait, let me get your wheelchairs!
Don't bother, shima-san.
We like to walk.
Life begins again.
This is yours, I believe.
- Thank you.
- Try to remember me kindly.
If you will.
May I?
Take care of Ponyo.
[gasps] it's your father!
Koichi!
Hi!
Over here!
Ah!
Lisa and Sosuke!
Ahoy!
Look, Ponyo, there's my dad's ship!

Ponyo on the Seaside Cliff
Seaweeds waving gently, in the big blue sea together with countless siblings bubbles are our language.
I remember, long ago cruising with you on the big blue sea.
Jellyfish and sea urchin, fish and crabs, we are a big family.
Sosuke, come home soon ok?
Ok.
It's a goldfish.
It's stuck.
Strange...
Ouch!
Is it dead?
It licked my finger.
It`s still alive!
Sosuke, we need to go now.
Risa, there's a goldfish.
What a strange wind.
Sosuke, I'll start the engine first.
Did you find her?
What?
She was captured by a human?
This is bad, really bad.
Did it die?
It's alive!
Sosuke, we're gonna be late.
Risa, I have a live goldfish.
Goldfish?
I found it at the seaside.
I see...
I don't know who you are, but please don't spray pesticide here.
Oh, this is not pesticide.
This is deep sea water to avoid dehydration.
Good, as long as it's not poisonous.
Excuse me.
Oh no, this is really bad.
What a strange guy.
Don't be mean, Sosuke.
Don't judge a book by it's cover.
I won't.
Are you bringing that to kindergarten?
Yeah.
Is it ok with your teacher?
No problem, I'll protect it.
It`s really cute.
The ship is leaving.
Sosuke, hurry up and eat this.
Can you eat this?
You want some?
Hey, my cut healed!
Risa, I`m calling her Ponyo
She licked my wound with a "Ponyo"
and used her magic on me.
After she licked it, the wound disapeared.
Do you like ham?
Risa, Ponyo likes to eat ham.
Just like you, huh?
Miss Risa, hurry up!
This is filthy, really filthy!
Good morning!
Ponyo, you can see our house!
Look!
Here is ok, right?
Yeah!
Take care.
I`m leaving!
Good morning, pardon me.
Please take Granny Noriko's chair.
Ok!
Little Sosuke, morning.
Granny Yoshie, I'm busy now.
Talk to you later.
Ara, ara!
Little Sosuke.
Granny Toki, see you in a while.
Ara!
I wonder if the teacher will tell me it`s not allowed?
Alright!
Wait for me here.
I`ll be right back.
I wonder if cats will come here?
You stay put ok.
I will be right back.
See you.
Ah, Sui-chan.
A bit fever.
But he looks healthy, so he should be fine.
Thank you.
Bye bye.
Good morning, sensei.
Good morning, Sosuke.
Sosuke, how are you?
Sosuke.
Oh, Kumiko.
Look at this.
Isn`t it pretty?
My mom bought it for me.
Sosuke, let's play together.
I'm busy now, maybe next time.
What are you up to?
I said I'm busy.
Strange Sosuke.
So strange.
Oh.
Ponyo!
Sosuke.
Kumiko.
What is this?
You can't bring this to kindergarten.
These trees aren`t part of the kindergarten.
They belong to Sunflower Home, so it's ok.
Let me see.
Oh, goldfish.
Not goldfish, Ponyo.
Ponyo?
I want to see.
If I let you see, you can't tell anyone else.
Ok, won't tell.
See, it`s cute right?
So odd looking.
And chubby.
The goldfishes at my house are cuter!
It's Kumiko fault.
Is her fault, saying something bad about Ponyo.
I'll change your water for you.
Oh.
Ponyo.
Thank goodness.
Isn't that strange, I can hear little Sosuke`s voice.
Sosuke should be in the kindergarten.
My hearing keeps getting worse.
Granny Yoshie, I'm here.
Ara, ara..
It's little Sosuke.
Am I holding something good in my hands?
You sure do!
That's right!
What color is it?
Red?
Red.
Correct.
How do you know?
Let me take a look.
Ok!
It's beautiful.
And cute!
Her name is Ponyo.
She likes ham, and she can use magic.
The cut on my finger disappeared because Ponyo licked it.
I wonder if she could lick our legs too...
If could run like little Sosuke again, that would be wonderful.
Hmm, I must ask Ponyo if she could do that.
Let me see as well.
Sure, Granny Toki.
Oh, gross!
Isn`t that a bad mermaid?
You must quickly return it to the sea.
It will call up a tsunami.
Again, Granny Toki, a tsunami?
What are you saying..?
When mermaids walk on land, tsunamis will follow.
It`s an ancient legend.
Aaah!
A tsunami!
The tsunami has come!
The tsunami has come, tsunami...
What happened, Granny Toki?
My clothes are all wet...
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Sosuke, please apologize to Granny Toki!
You don`t have to worry, I will protect you.
Sosuke.
Souske!
Ah!
Ponyo!
Ponyo...
Sosuke...
Ponyo, Sosuke.
Like!
I like you too.
Ponyo, like Sosuke!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo?
Ponyo...
Sosuke.
Ponyo...
Hey Sosuke, what happened was destiny.
Even though it`s painful, you can`t change destiny.
Ponyo was born to live in the sea, so that's why she must return to the sea.
That Mr. Pesticide is suspicious.
Give me a bite.
Come on, lemme try.
Wasn`t that tasty?
Come on, cheer up.
Today is the day Koichi returns.
If Souske doesn`t cheer up, he won`t be cheerful either.
Don't go to the sea anymore today, ok?
Ok.
Sosuke, please come inside.
If I put the bucket here, Ponyo will know this is her home, right?
Right, if Sosuke wants to put it there she`ll know this is her home.
Yeah!
Sosuke, please answer the phone.
It must be Koichi
Hello?
Yeah, it`s me.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Today, I can`t come home.
We`re crossing the border as usual.
I`m losing signal, pass it to Risa.
I`m giving this to Risa.
Koichi?
Yeah.
EH?
Can't you just tell them no?
You can't just leave your wife and son alone waiting on the cliff.
I don't know!
What is this!
?
Sosuke, tonight let's go out to eat.
I want to eat at home.
It`s Koichi!
Risa, it`s Koichi's ship!
Quick, turn out the lights!
It`s Sosuke!
He's a genius even though he`s just 5 years old.
Your wife must be mad.
I-AM-SORRY
Risa, he said sorry.
B-A-K-A
B-A-K-A... (stupid)
A-A-A-A-A...
Risa, he said "I LOVE YOU".
He said "VERY VERY MUCH!"
(stupid stupid stupid...)
Wow, it`s beautiful, huh?
(Smooth sailing)
(Thank you)
(Goodnight)
Risa, don't cry.
I didn't cry.
I promised to protect Ponyo.
Ponyo... you`re not crying, right?
Ok, let's cheer up.
I am ha-ppy!
Ouch!
Sosuke cheer up too.
Just like Risa, Ponyo`s cheerful too.
Yeah.
So, let's eat!
Let's eat Koichi's portion too.
It's all because of me.
I shouldn't have brought all of you to visit the farm.
As I've told all of you, the humans` air and water are so filthy.
Now, eat this, come on.
Are you listening "Polumisharudin"?
I want ham!
Ham!
?
Where did you learn of such a horrible thing?
Tell me, Polumisharudin.
I'm not Polumisharudin, I am Ponyo!
Po...po...ponyo?
Ponyo likes Sosuke!
Ponyo will become human!
Human!
?
What`s so good about those stupid and horrible creatures?
Human took lives from sea.
I was once called a human.
I sacrificed a lot to not become one of them.
Ponyo wants hands!
I don`t want legs like these!
I want legs like Sosuke!
That's enough...
Hands came out!
Legs came out!
They came out!
You've tasted human blood?
I am going to where Sosuke is!
Now I must undo what your eyes have seen!
Return!
Return!
Go back!
Go back!
Go back!
Ah, not enough power.
Comin` out... comin` out...
Calm thyself, on starry path...
Return.
Return.
Return.
She`s definitely HER child...
Such great power.
If contain her like this, things should be fine...
My power can only hold her for a while.
Looks like only 'that person' can do it.
No.
It's too much for all of you.
Shoo!
Shoo!
No way...
This is dangerous...
My barrier to stop crabs is failing.
It almost disrupted the balance of nature.
Gotta calm down, gotta calm down.
I get a bad feeling everytime when going to meet 'that person'.
Oh no, oh no.
I have to finish cleaning up.
The barrier isn`t weak here.
This is hard to open!
I have to come and fix it later.
I can't even let one sea creature enter here, or else there will be big trouble.
Well done.
The power of the sea is spreading to every corner.
When this well fills up, the time of the sea will begin.
Which will mean the end of those dangerous creatures.
The time of filthy humans will end.
Seal it, seal it...
Ha~
Haha~ Haha~
I'm going to where Sosuke is!
Sosuke...
Ha~
Tsunami?
Captain, that, that...
It`s a tsunami!
Everyone, get inside the ship!
What's that?
Captain, the radio and radar are out!
It's a girl.
About Sosuke's age.
Thank you.
Thanks for your hard work.
Sosuke, wait here for a while ok?
Sensei will accompany you.
I'm going home with Risa, will be fine.
Goodbye, sensei.
Goodbye.
Be careful.
Sorry, Sosuke.
Was the door hard to open?
The power is out.
Was the kindergarten ok?
Yes.
Miss Risa, it's ok.
You can go home first.
Granny Kaneko not here yet?
Yeah, don't worry.
She just a bit late.
After all we will be here whole night.
You better get going while you still can.
Sosuke, wait a minute, ok?
Ok.
Granny Yoshie.
Ara, ara, it`s little Sosuke.
It's too dark, I can't see a thing.
Hey, I wanted to give you this.
Oh?
What is this?
Give one to Granny Noriko too.
Thank you.
So dark, can't see a thing.
Such a heavy storm, and even a black out... that's why I don't want to stay here.
The power`s back.
Thank goodness!
So bright.
A goldfish!
I wonder if the power came back because Sosuke came here?
There will be a large typhoon headed for our area which will be very strong.
Useless TV.
Can't see a thing.
This weather forecast isn`t accurate at all.
Little Sosuke, go home quickly.
We got the goldfish charm, so we won't be scared of anything.
Ok.
Granny Toki, I want to give one to you too.
Isn`t this rough looking?
What is this?
It's like this.
It's a locust, a locust!
No, it's not.
It`s the 'Kogane Maru'.
That`s little Sosuke`s father`s ship, isn`t it?
Yeah.
Looks like a locust to me.
Sosuke, time to go, say goodbye to everyone.
Ok.
Everyone, farewell.
Farewell.
Don't get blown away by the wind!
Let`s go home.
Looks like the phones are down too.
The sea is rising, isn`t it?
Won`t those ships sink?
The ships in the sea aren`t afraid of storms.
Koichi`s ship is the same.
It`s a fish!
Risa, it`s a fish!
Put on you seat belt.
Miss Risa, you can't pass here.
There`s an evacuation order.
Evacuation?
There're old ladies at Sunflower Home that are staying overnight.
That's inland.
Since they`re on higher ground, they`ll be fine.
Anyway, I must go home.
You can't pass through here.
Go through the mountain.
Sosuke, let's go.
Ok.
Please, don't!
Oh no, a big wave is coming.
Miss Risa.
Don't be silly.
The fish are coming after us!
Sosuke, please put your seatbelt on!
We`re gonna speed up!
Why are the waves so huge?
A girl fell down there!
What?
She was on top of the fish!
Where?
The ocean`s getting higher.
Sosuke, where did you see the girl?
There, running on the backs of the fishes.
Fish?
Let's go, Sosuke!
Hang on, Sosuke.
We're almost home.
There is a girl over there.
It`s dangerous, come over here.
Sosuke, don't move.
Sosuke, you know her?
Ponyo?
Yeah!
I`m Ponyo!
It`s Ponyo!
Risa, Ponyo returned as a little girl.
Ponyo is over here!
Listen, Sosuke and Ponyo, no matter how happy and surprised you are to see each other, you must calm down now.
You understand?
Ok.
Take off the rain coat please Sosuke.
Ponyo didn't wear shoes right?
Hold this, ok?
I'll go get something to dry off.
Ponyo, this way.
This smells like Sosuke.
Ponyo
Gotcha.
You`ve gotta dry off now.
Ponyo's hair is a pretty shade of red, huh?
Your clothes aren`t wet, are they?
Ponyo used to be a fish, so she`s ok being wet.
Yup.
Ponyo like this!
Great, let's make some tea.
Ponyo, bring the lights here.
I wonder if the water will come out?
Yes it will!
It will!
It came out!
It`s because we have a water tank for our house.
I wonder if the gas will work?
All right!
All right!
Cause we have our own gas tank too!
Ok, please take your seats!
Ok!
Ponyo, sit here!
It will be just a little longer.
You have to set your stuff down.
Or you won`t be able to use your hands!
I have my feet!
Wow!
Oh, what`re you looking at?
Ponyo's feet are like hands!
Please, go ahead.
Here you go.
I`m gonna start!
That was delicious.
So, what should we do next?
Ponyo, thinks ham is good!
Ponyo likes to eat ham.
Then, let`s eat dinner!
But before that, we have to start the power generator.
If we connect the power, we can also talk to Koichi!
Koichi is my father.
Is he an evil magician?
No, he`s the captain of Kogane Maru!
What`s Ponyo`s father like?
He`s Fujimoto, he locked Ponyo up!
Ponyo, ran away!
What`s Ponyo`s mother like?
I LOOOVE mommy!
But she`s also very scary!
Just like Risa huh...
Ponyo, please bring the light.
Ara!
Are we out of gas?
Is it stuck?
It's stuck!
That thing over there is stuck!
All right!
It`s so bright!
Ponyo, you`re amazing!
Antenna, antenna!
Risa, did the ships sink?
There isn`t even one light out there, is there?
It`s NOISY!
Everything ok?
Looks like the radio is not working.
This is JA4 LL
JA4 LL
Can you hear me Koichi?
This is Risa and Sosuke and Ponyo.
Everyone is fine here.
We`re gonna eat dinner now!
Ham!
Did you put them in?
This is hot, so be careful.
Wait a little bit.
Gotta wait for 3 minutes!
Please close your eyes!
Not quite yet.
Ponyo, don't peek!
Ok!
You can open your eyes now!
En~joy your meal!
Wow.
Ham!
Ponyo, this is great, huh?
Oh!
Hot, hot, hot!
Risa, Ponyo fell asleep!
Ponyo came from far away, didn`t she?
Yeah, she must have.
Sosuke, look!
The storm has stopped.
Is it because Ponyo fall asleep?
Sosuke, look over there.
Something`s moving.
Somebody is over there.
I wonder if it`s Granny Yoshie and her friends?
It's gone.
It`s on the road to the mountain.
Sosuke, wait here with Ponyo.
I'm going over there.
I should be able to take the mountain road.
Sosuke, I'm going to Sunflower Home.
I'm going too.
Sosuke and Ponyo, please wait here.
I want to go, let`s just bring Ponyo along.
I am going with Risa!
Sosuke, right now, this house is a lighthouse in the storm bringing light and hope to those in dark.
So, someone must wait here.
Many strange things have happened, and I`m not sure why.
but there must be a reason.
I'm worried about those at Sunflower Home.
If Sosuke is protecting this place, then Risa will have support.
I`ll be fine.
I will definitely come home.
Absolutely?
Absolutely!
Make absolutely sure then.
I love you, Sosuke!
The moon is coming out!
We can see the lights from town!
Thank goodness!
We can navigate now.
That doesn`t look like a town we`ve been to before.
Did we reach America?
That's not a mountain or land either.
It's all boats!
They were gathered up in the ocean and turned into a mountain of boats!
This must be the ship graveyard!
The path to the other side has opened!
The engine`s stopped!
Fix it quickly!
Drop the anchor.
Aye.
What's coming up behind us?
I saw a goddess!
We`re moving!
We're saved!
It's a goddess.
Thanks be to the goddess!
Thanks be.
Go higher, higher.
Oh!
This is a proper barrier.
Where did she learn how to do this?
What's going on?
She became a human!
Hey, be careful!
What`re you doing?
It`s you guys!
Whoa, this is dangerous!
Please stop!
You guys!
Daddy is doing this for your sister.
It`s HER!
She`s coming!
Fujimoto
So you came huh?
What a beautiful ocean.
It`s so full with magic, as if I'm back to 'De Po Ji' big ocean.
Ponyo tasted human's blood.
ALL the elixir of life I collected is gone too!
Ponyo?
She was given a very nice name.
It's all my fault.
Ponyo misused her magical powers.
and opened a big hole on earth.
She doesn`t know what she`s doing!
Furthermore, she turned into a human and ran away to her human boyfriend`s home!
It this continues, the world will be destroyed!
Oh!
This is bad.
Meteors are starting to fall too!
The gravity of the planet...
Hush now.
Sosuke.
It's a boy named Sosuke huh.
All of you love your big sister.
My love, why don`t you just let Ponyo become a true human.
Huh?
There`s an old magic that says if there is a boy with a faithful heart, then Ponyo can turn into a real human, in exchange for her magical powers.
But if it fails,
Ponyo will turn into bubbles.
We are all born from bubbles, after all!
But, she's only 5.
She can't possibly make it.
Let`s be quiet and let the children rest.
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Ouch!
Ponyo!
Good morning!
Sosuke, good morning!
The ocean became calm.
Risa is gone, huh?
The roads are all flooded.
If only we had a boat now.
We have a boat!
We can't ride that.
We can ride it!
Wow, that's perfect!
Wow, the candle even got bigger!
We can ride it!
Yeah, just like the original one.
It`s just like the original one!
Hold that side, ok?
Ready?
Ready!
It's floating!
It`s dry!
No leaks at all!
Oh yeah!
We have to blow the water out of it.
If there`s water in the pipe, there will be water in that round thing.
It's like a rocket!
Good job, Ponyo!
Good job?
Yes, good job.
Good job!
Good job!
Good job...
It it hot?
It`s hot!
It`s hoooooot!
Wow, it`s lit!
It's lit!
It`s hot!
It`s hot!
It`s hot...! It`s hot, isn`t it?
It's moving!
Sosuke, good job!
Yeah!
Amazing, yeah?
Yeah.
Wow...
Sosuke is happy, yeah?
Yup.
Sosuke, it's burning, huh?
Yeah.
Sosuke, it's hot, right?
Ponyo, sit in front.
I`ll watch the fire.
Ok, you watch!
There's the road.
That`s the mountain road Risa took!
Risa isn`t there, is she?
Risa`ll be there, she promised she`ll definitely be there!
It's a Gogonasus.
There used to be over 10,000 of them in the sea.
Oh look, the shy 'Licosus'.
Beautiful.
Where are you going 'Licosus'?
Wow, it's huge!
It`s a 'Licosus'!
'Licosus'!
Hey!
There`s a boat!
They`re calling "Hey!" to us!
Heeeeeeeeey!
Whoa, are!
They must have spotted us.
Ponyo, you can blow it out now.
Hello.
Hello.
Hey, that`s a wonderful boat.
I was wondering who it was, and it turned out to be Risa`s little Sosuke.
It`s not little Sosuke.
It`s just Sosuke.
She`s Ponyo.
Ponyo, used to be a fish.
A fish?
Ponyo is a nice name, isn`t it?
Yup.
Mister, do you know where is Risa is?
Miss Risa?
Is she not with you?
She went out to Sunflower Home.
To Sunflower Home?
This is a baby.
Oh!
What is it?
Are you going to pour some?
Here, let me see it.
Thank you.
I`m going to have some!
What a delicious soup!
Risa made it.
It's for THE BABY!
I'm sorry, the baby can't drink soup yet!
But, if I drink this, then I'll make milk for the baby.
I used to drink Risa's milk too.
Ponyo, may I drink this soup?
Yes, please have some.
Thank you.
There are people over there!
It's like a parade!
Hey!
Is there anything we can help you with?
Thanks, but we're fine for now.
Then please be careful on your way up to the hotel.
Ok, will do.
There's so many people.
Thank goodness everyone is safe.
Ponyo, be careful with that!
Hold on.
Turn these into milk!
Wow!
For milk!
Ponyo ate everyone`s ham, though.
Thank you.
I`m sure there will be a lot of milk.
Sosuke, this isn`t much, but do you want it?
Yeah, Ponyo will make it bigger.
Thank you.
Be careful, ok?
Thanks again.
What is it?
Now, now, now!
Ponyo!
Wow!
Little Sosuke!
Where is Miss Risa?
She went to Sunflower Home!
I`m going after her.
Risa must have gotten past that wave!
Amazing!
Sosuke, give me a ride too!
Kumiko, we're in a hurry, so I`ll let you ride later.
Sosuke!
Hurry to the school!
Do your best!
"Attention, we're on duty so, we can only wish you all the best!"
Ponyo, we need a new candle.
It's ok, we still have the one we just received.
Ouch!
It`s still very hot.
Bye bye.
Ponyo, can you make this bigger too?
Yeah sure.
Ponyo, are you sleepy?
Ponyo?
Ponyo?
Ponyo!
It`s shallow!
My feet can touch the ground!
The road is coming out of the water.
Ah!
My boat...
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Wake up!
Sosuke.
Thank goodness.
I thought you were in danger!
Is Risa's car!
Ponyo!
Risa's car is over there!
Risa, Risa~
Sosuke, your boat.
There`s water coming out of your eyes.
Let`s look for Risa.
Ok.
Quick, look at this!
It`s so beautiful, just like an underwater palace!
Ladies, please gather round over here!
Ok, let's go.
It feels great to run!
I`m going first!
Please calm down everyone.
This is the moment of destiny.
Sosuke is coming here.
Oh, what's going on?
A love test!
?
My heart is pounding!
Me too!
Please calm down.
Everyone here is a witness.
Please wait a while longer.
Mr. Fujimoto, you're not going to do something bad to Sosuke and Ponyo right?
Of course not.
This is a harsh test for Ponyo, and then...
I think he's a gentleman.
What is Miss Risa doing?
Look, over there.
She's been chatting with Ponyo's mother for a loooooong time.
This must be hard for Miss Risa.
What they talking about, I wonder?
Let's call her.
Miss Risa, Risa...
Don't worry!
Sosuke and Ponyo will come for you!
Miss Risa must be worried!
Little Sosuke will be fine, he`s a good boy!
Thank you.
Everyone, let's cheer for them!
Ponyo, it's a tunnel.
Don`t be afraid of the dark.
I hate this place.
You can`t let go of my hand, ok?
Ok.
Ah!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo, you can`t die!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Wake up, Ponyo!
Shh... don`t wake her.
Sosuke, you did good getting this far!
Risa and the Grannies, everyone is waiting for you!
Risa is?
Come with me, bring Ponyo as well.
Ponyo needs to sleep, let`s go quietly.
Sosuke!
Don`t let that guy fool you!
He uses sweet talk but he takes everyone away.
Granny Toki!
Don't be fooled by him!
That`s why I said there isn`t any time!
Can`t you see that?
If the moon gets any closer something terrible will happen!
You can make a better excuse than that!
Ah~~~
Sosuke, come with me!
Only you can save this world!
I won't hurt you.
Ponyo.
Ack!
How could you treat your father this way?
Ponyo!
Sosuke, come on!
I said I won't hurt you!
You can do it!
Granny Toki`s got ya!
You guys!
Risa!
Sosuke.
Ponyo!
You must be Sosuke.
Hello.
Are you Ponyo's mother?
Yes I am.
You did a good job bringing Ponyo here.
Shh...
Thank you.
Sosuke, Ponyo broke a magic seal in order to become human.
In order to become human, she needs a man that understand Ponyo and is willing to accept her.
Do you know that she is a fish?
Yes.
She turned into a mermaid because she's tasted your blood.
Is that so?
She licked my wound and it turned her into a mermaid?
Knowing that she's half fish half human.
Are you ok with that?
Yes.
No matter if she's a fish Ponyo, a mermaid Ponyo or a human Ponyo, everyone loves her!
Ha ha...
Ponyo, please come here.
Ponyo, it seems that Sosuke has accepted you just as you are.
In order to become a human, you can`t use magic anymore.
Can you do that?
Yes.
When you return to surface, kiss this bubble once.
Ponyo will then transform into a 5 year old girl like you.
Ponyo, that`s wonderful, isn`t it?
Thank you, Ponyo's mama!
Everyone, the curse on the Earth is broken.
YAY!
That's great!
Risa, thank you.
You too, thank you, always.
Everyone, are you alright?
We'll bring the wheelchairs immediately!
That`s ok, we can walk.
This is your ship.
Thank you!
I`m sorry for everything.
May I shake your hand?
I am entrusting Ponyo to you.
It`s Koichi's ship!
Koichi!
Hey!
Over here!
Ah!
It`s Risa!
Sosuke`s there too!
Ponyo, that`s Koichi`s ship!
Ah!
Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo, the fish child she came from the big blue sea!
Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo, got bigger and turned into a little girl!
Tip tap Tip tap, Stomp, Stomp said legs would be great, and set out on a journey
Niigi niigi, Boom, Boo-oom said hands would be great, but perhaps not!
She set out with a boy and risked her heart
Paku Paku Chyugyu!
Paaku Paaku Chyuugyu!
I love that child more and more!
Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo, the fish child she came from the big blue sea!

Ponyo on the Seaside Cliff
Seaweeds waving gently, in the big blue sea together with countless siblings bubbles are our language.
I remember, long ago cruising with you on the big blue sea.
Jellyfish and sea urchin, fish and crabs, we are a big family.
Sosuke, come home soon ok?
Ok.
It's a goldfish.
It's stuck.
Strange...
Ouch!
Is it dead?
It licked my finger.
It`s still alive!
Sosuke, we need to go now.
Risa, there's a goldfish.
What a strange wind.
Sosuke, I'll start the engine first.
Did you find her?
What?
She was captured by a human?
This is bad, really bad.
Did it die?
It's alive!
Sosuke, we're gonna be late.
Risa, I have a live goldfish.
Goldfish?
I found it at the seaside.
I see...
I don't know who you are, but please don't spray pesticide here.
Oh, this is not pesticide.
This is deep sea water to avoid dehydration.
Good, as long as it's not poisonous.
Excuse me.
Oh no, this is really bad.
What a strange guy.
Don't be mean, Sosuke.
Don't judge a book by it's cover.
I won't.
Are you bringing that to kindergarten?
Yeah.
Is it ok with your teacher?
No problem, I'll protect it.
It`s really cute.
The ship is leaving.
Sosuke, hurry up and eat this.
Can you eat this?
You want some?
Hey, my cut healed!
Risa, I`m calling her Ponyo
She licked my wound with a "Ponyo"
and used her magic on me.
After she licked it, the wound disapeared.
Do you like ham?
Risa, Ponyo likes to eat ham.
Just like you, huh?
Miss Risa, hurry up!
This is filthy, really filthy!
Good morning!
Ponyo, you can see our house!
Look!
Here is ok, right?
Yeah!
Take care.
I`m leaving!
Good morning, pardon me.
Please take Granny Noriko's chair.
Ok!
Little Sosuke, morning.
Granny Yoshie, I'm busy now.
Talk to you later.
Ara, ara!
Little Sosuke.
Granny Toki, see you in a while.
Ara!
I wonder if the teacher will tell me it`s not allowed?
Alright!
Wait for me here.
I`ll be right back.
I wonder if cats will come here?
You stay put ok.
I will be right back.
See you.
Ah, Sui-chan.
A bit fever.
But he looks healthy, so he should be fine.
Thank you.
Bye bye.
Good morning, sensei.
Good morning, Sosuke.
Sosuke, how are you?
Sosuke.
Oh, Kumiko.
Look at this.
Isn`t it pretty?
My mom bought it for me.
Sosuke, let's play together.
I'm busy now, maybe next time.
What are you up to?
I said I'm busy.
Strange Sosuke.
So strange.
Oh.
Ponyo!
Sosuke.
Kumiko.
What is this?
You can't bring this to kindergarten.
These trees aren`t part of the kindergarten.
They belong to Sunflower Home, so it's ok.
Let me see.
Oh, goldfish.
Not goldfish, Ponyo.
Ponyo?
I want to see.
If I let you see, you can't tell anyone else.
Ok, won't tell.
See, it`s cute right?
So odd looking.
And chubby.
The goldfishes at my house are cuter!
It's Kumiko fault.
Is her fault, saying something bad about Ponyo.
I'll change your water for you.
Oh.
Ponyo.
Thank goodness.
Isn't that strange, I can hear little Sosuke`s voice.
Sosuke should be in the kindergarten.
My hearing keeps getting worse.
Granny Yoshie, I'm here.
Ara, ara..
It's little Sosuke.
Am I holding something good in my hands?
You sure do!
That's right!
What color is it?
Red?
Red.
Correct.
How do you know?
Let me take a look.
Ok!
It's beautiful.
And cute!
Her name is Ponyo.
She likes ham, and she can use magic.
The cut on my finger disappeared because Ponyo licked it.
I wonder if she could lick our legs too...
If could run like little Sosuke again, that would be wonderful.
Hmm, I must ask Ponyo if she could do that.
Let me see as well.
Sure, Granny Toki.
Oh, gross!
Isn`t that a bad mermaid?
You must quickly return it to the sea.
It will call up a tsunami.
Again, Granny Toki, a tsunami?
What are you saying..?
When mermaids walk on land, tsunamis will follow.
It`s an ancient legend.
Aaah!
A tsunami!
The tsunami has come!
The tsunami has come, tsunami...
What happened, Granny Toki?
My clothes are all wet...
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Sosuke, please apologize to Granny Toki!
You don`t have to worry, I will protect you.
Sosuke.
Souske!
Ah!
Ponyo!
Ponyo...
Sosuke...
Ponyo, Sosuke.
Like!
I like you too.
Ponyo, like Sosuke!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo?
Ponyo...
Sosuke.
Ponyo...
Hey Sosuke, what happened was destiny.
Even though it`s painful, you can`t change destiny.
Ponyo was born to live in the sea, so that's why she must return to the sea.
That Mr. Pesticide is suspicious.
Give me a bite.
Come on, lemme try.
Wasn`t that tasty?
Come on, cheer up.
Today is the day Koichi returns.
If Souske doesn`t cheer up, he won`t be cheerful either.
Don't go to the sea anymore today, ok?
Ok.
Sosuke, please come inside.
If I put the bucket here, Ponyo will know this is her home, right?
Right, if Sosuke wants to put it there she`ll know this is her home.
Yeah!
Sosuke, please answer the phone.
It must be Koichi
Hello?
Yeah, it`s me.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Today, I can`t come home.
We`re crossing the border as usual.
I`m losing signal, pass it to Risa.
I`m giving this to Risa.
Koichi?
Yeah.
EH?
Can't you just tell them no?
You can't just leave your wife and son alone waiting on the cliff.
I don't know!
What is this!
?
Sosuke, tonight let's go out to eat.
I want to eat at home.
It`s Koichi!
Risa, it`s Koichi's ship!
Quick, turn out the lights!
It`s Sosuke!
He's a genius even though he`s just 5 years old.
Your wife must be mad.
I-AM-SORRY
Risa, he said sorry.
B-A-K-A
B-A-K-A... (stupid)
A-A-A-A-A...
Risa, he said "I LOVE YOU".
He said "VERY VERY MUCH!"
(stupid stupid stupid...)
Wow, it`s beautiful, huh?
(Smooth sailing)
(Thank you)
(Goodnight)
Risa, don't cry.
I didn't cry.
I promised to protect Ponyo.
Ponyo... you`re not crying, right?
Ok, let's cheer up.
I am ha-ppy!
Ouch!
Sosuke cheer up too.
Just like Risa, Ponyo`s cheerful too.
Yeah.
So, let's eat!
Let's eat Koichi's portion too.
It's all because of me.
I shouldn't have brought all of you to visit the farm.
As I've told all of you, the humans` air and water are so filthy.
Now, eat this, come on.
Are you listening "Polumisharudin"?
I want ham!
Ham!
?
Where did you learn of such a horrible thing?
Tell me, Polumisharudin.
I'm not Polumisharudin, I am Ponyo!
Po...po...ponyo?
Ponyo likes Sosuke!
Ponyo will become human!
Human!
?
What`s so good about those stupid and horrible creatures?
Human took lives from sea.
I was once called a human.
I sacrificed a lot to not become one of them.
Ponyo wants hands!
I don`t want legs like these!
I want legs like Sosuke!
That's enough...
Hands came out!
Legs came out!
They came out!
You've tasted human blood?
I am going to where Sosuke is!
Now I must undo what your eyes have seen!
Return!
Return!
Go back!
Go back!
Go back!
Ah, not enough power.
Comin` out... comin` out...
Calm thyself, on starry path...
Return.
Return.
Return.
She`s definitely HER child...
Such great power.
If contain her like this, things should be fine...
My power can only hold her for a while.
Looks like only 'that person' can do it.
No.
It's too much for all of you.
Shoo!
Shoo!
No way...
This is dangerous...
My barrier to stop crabs is failing.
It almost disrupted the balance of nature.
Gotta calm down, gotta calm down.
I get a bad feeling everytime when going to meet 'that person'.
Oh no, oh no.
I have to finish cleaning up.
The barrier isn`t weak here.
This is hard to open!
I have to come and fix it later.
I can't even let one sea creature enter here, or else there will be big trouble.
Well done.
The power of the sea is spreading to every corner.
When this well fills up, the time of the sea will begin.
Which will mean the end of those dangerous creatures.
The time of filthy humans will end.
Seal it, seal it...
Ha~
Haha~ Haha~
I'm going to where Sosuke is!
Sosuke...
Ha~
Tsunami?
Captain, that, that...
It`s a tsunami!
Everyone, get inside the ship!
What's that?
Captain, the radio and radar are out!
It's a girl.
About Sosuke's age.
Thank you.
Thanks for your hard work.
Sosuke, wait here for a while ok?
Sensei will accompany you.
I'm going home with Risa, will be fine.
Goodbye, sensei.
Goodbye.
Be careful.
Sorry, Sosuke.
Was the door hard to open?
The power is out.
Was the kindergarten ok?
Yes.
Miss Risa, it's ok.
You can go home first.
Granny Kaneko not here yet?
Yeah, don't worry.
She just a bit late.
After all we will be here whole night.
You better get going while you still can.
Sosuke, wait a minute, ok?
Ok.
Granny Yoshie.
Ara, ara, it`s little Sosuke.
It's too dark, I can't see a thing.
Hey, I wanted to give you this.
Oh?
What is this?
Give one to Granny Noriko too.
Thank you.
So dark, can't see a thing.
Such a heavy storm, and even a black out... that's why I don't want to stay here.
The power`s back.
Thank goodness!
So bright.
A goldfish!
I wonder if the power came back because Sosuke came here?
There will be a large typhoon headed for our area which will be very strong.
Useless TV.
Can't see a thing.
This weather forecast isn`t accurate at all.
Little Sosuke, go home quickly.
We got the goldfish charm, so we won't be scared of anything.
Ok.
Granny Toki, I want to give one to you too.
Isn`t this rough looking?
What is this?
It's like this.
It's a locust, a locust!
No, it's not.
It`s the 'Kogane Maru'.
That`s little Sosuke`s father`s ship, isn`t it?
Yeah.
Looks like a locust to me.
Sosuke, time to go, say goodbye to everyone.
Ok.
Everyone, farewell.
Farewell.
Don't get blown away by the wind!
Let`s go home.
Looks like the phones are down too.
The sea is rising, isn`t it?
Won`t those ships sink?
The ships in the sea aren`t afraid of storms.
Koichi`s ship is the same.
It`s a fish!
Risa, it`s a fish!
Put on you seat belt.
Miss Risa, you can't pass here.
There`s an evacuation order.
Evacuation?
There're old ladies at Sunflower Home that are staying overnight.
That's inland.
Since they`re on higher ground, they`ll be fine.
Anyway, I must go home.
You can't pass through here.
Go through the mountain.
Sosuke, let's go.
Ok.
Please, don't!
Oh no, a big wave is coming.
Miss Risa.
Don't be silly.
The fish are coming after us!
Sosuke, please put your seatbelt on!
We`re gonna speed up!
Why are the waves so huge?
A girl fell down there!
What?
She was on top of the fish!
Where?
The ocean`s getting higher.
Sosuke, where did you see the girl?
There, running on the backs of the fishes.
Fish?
Let's go, Sosuke!
Hang on, Sosuke.
We're almost home.
There is a girl over there.
It`s dangerous, come over here.
Sosuke, don't move.
Sosuke, you know her?
Ponyo?
Yeah!
I`m Ponyo!
It`s Ponyo!
Risa, Ponyo returned as a little girl.
Ponyo is over here!
Listen, Sosuke and Ponyo, no matter how happy and surprised you are to see each other, you must calm down now.
You understand?
Ok.
Take off the rain coat please Sosuke.
Ponyo didn't wear shoes right?
Hold this, ok?
I'll go get something to dry off.
Ponyo, this way.
This smells like Sosuke.
Ponyo
Gotcha.
You`ve gotta dry off now.
Ponyo's hair is a pretty shade of red, huh?
Your clothes aren`t wet, are they?
Ponyo used to be a fish, so she`s ok being wet.
Yup.
Ponyo like this!
Great, let's make some tea.
Ponyo, bring the lights here.
I wonder if the water will come out?
Yes it will!
It will!
It came out!
It`s because we have a water tank for our house.
I wonder if the gas will work?
All right!
All right!
Cause we have our own gas tank too!
Ok, please take your seats!
Ok!
Ponyo, sit here!
It will be just a little longer.
You have to set your stuff down.
Or you won`t be able to use your hands!
I have my feet!
Wow!
Oh, what`re you looking at?
Ponyo's feet are like hands!
Please, go ahead.
Here you go.
I`m gonna start!
That was delicious.
So, what should we do next?
Ponyo, thinks ham is good!
Ponyo likes to eat ham.
Then, let`s eat dinner!
But before that, we have to start the power generator.
If we connect the power, we can also talk to Koichi!
Koichi is my father.
Is he an evil magician?
No, he`s the captain of Kogane Maru!
What`s Ponyo`s father like?
He`s Fujimoto, he locked Ponyo up!
Ponyo, ran away!
What`s Ponyo`s mother like?
I LOOOVE mommy!
But she`s also very scary!
Just like Risa huh...
Ponyo, please bring the light.
Ara!
Are we out of gas?
Is it stuck?
It's stuck!
That thing over there is stuck!
All right!
It`s so bright!
Ponyo, you`re amazing!
Antenna, antenna!
Risa, did the ships sink?
There isn`t even one light out there, is there?
It`s NOISY!
Everything ok?
Looks like the radio is not working.
This is JA4 LL
JA4 LL
Can you hear me Koichi?
This is Risa and Sosuke and Ponyo.
Everyone is fine here.
We`re gonna eat dinner now!
Ham!
Did you put them in?
This is hot, so be careful.
Wait a little bit.
Gotta wait for 3 minutes!
Please close your eyes!
Not quite yet.
Ponyo, don't peek!
Ok!
You can open your eyes now!
En~joy your meal!
Wow.
Ham!
Ponyo, this is great, huh?
Oh!
Hot, hot, hot!
Risa, Ponyo fell asleep!
Ponyo came from far away, didn`t she?
Yeah, she must have.
Sosuke, look!
The storm has stopped.
Is it because Ponyo fall asleep?
Sosuke, look over there.
Something`s moving.
Somebody is over there.
I wonder if it`s Granny Yoshie and her friends?
It's gone.
It`s on the road to the mountain.
Sosuke, wait here with Ponyo.
I'm going over there.
I should be able to take the mountain road.
Sosuke, I'm going to Sunflower Home.
I'm going too.
Sosuke and Ponyo, please wait here.
I want to go, let`s just bring Ponyo along.
I am going with Risa!
Sosuke, right now, this house is a lighthouse in the storm bringing light and hope to those in dark.
So, someone must wait here.
Many strange things have happened, and I`m not sure why.
but there must be a reason.
I'm worried about those at Sunflower Home.
If Sosuke is protecting this place, then Risa will have support.
I`ll be fine.
I will definitely come home.
Absolutely?
Absolutely!
Make absolutely sure then.
I love you, Sosuke!
The moon is coming out!
We can see the lights from town!
Thank goodness!
We can navigate now.
That doesn`t look like a town we`ve been to before.
Did we reach America?
That's not a mountain or land either.
It's all boats!
They were gathered up in the ocean and turned into a mountain of boats!
This must be the ship graveyard!
The path to the other side has opened!
The engine`s stopped!
Fix it quickly!
Drop the anchor.
Aye.
What's coming up behind us?
I saw a goddess!
We`re moving!
We're saved!
It's a goddess.
Thanks be to the goddess!
Thanks be.
Go higher, higher.
Oh!
This is a proper barrier.
Where did she learn how to do this?
What's going on?
She became a human!
Hey, be careful!
What`re you doing?
It`s you guys!
Whoa, this is dangerous!
Please stop!
You guys!
Daddy is doing this for your sister.
It`s HER!
She`s coming!
Fujimoto
So you came huh?
What a beautiful ocean.
It`s so full with magic, as if I'm back to 'De Po Ji' big ocean.
Ponyo tasted human's blood.
ALL the elixir of life I collected is gone too!
Ponyo?
She was given a very nice name.
It's all my fault.
Ponyo misused her magical powers.
and opened a big hole on earth.
She doesn`t know what she`s doing!
Furthermore, she turned into a human and ran away to her human boyfriend`s home!
It this continues, the world will be destroyed!
Oh!
This is bad.
Meteors are starting to fall too!
The gravity of the planet...
Hush now.
Sosuke.
It's a boy named Sosuke huh.
All of you love your big sister.
My love, why don`t you just let Ponyo become a true human.
Huh?
There`s an old magic that says if there is a boy with a faithful heart, then Ponyo can turn into a real human, in exchange for her magical powers.
But if it fails,
Ponyo will turn into bubbles.
We are all born from bubbles, after all!
But, she's only 5.
She can't possibly make it.
Let`s be quiet and let the children rest.
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Ouch!
Ponyo!
Good morning!
Sosuke, good morning!
The ocean became calm.
Risa is gone, huh?
The roads are all flooded.
If only we had a boat now.
We have a boat!
We can't ride that.
We can ride it!
Wow, that's perfect!
Wow, the candle even got bigger!
We can ride it!
Yeah, just like the original one.
It`s just like the original one!
Hold that side, ok?
Ready?
Ready!
It's floating!
It`s dry!
No leaks at all!
Oh yeah!
We have to blow the water out of it.
If there`s water in the pipe, there will be water in that round thing.
It's like a rocket!
Good job, Ponyo!
Good job?
Yes, good job.
Good job!
Good job!
Good job...
It it hot?
It`s hot!
It`s hoooooot!
Wow, it`s lit!
It's lit!
It`s hot!
It`s hot!
It`s hot...! It`s hot, isn`t it?
It's moving!
Sosuke, good job!
Yeah!
Amazing, yeah?
Yeah.
Wow...
Sosuke is happy, yeah?
Yup.
Sosuke, it's burning, huh?
Yeah.
Sosuke, it's hot, right?
Ponyo, sit in front.
I`ll watch the fire.
Ok, you watch!
There's the road.
That`s the mountain road Risa took!
Risa isn`t there, is she?
Risa`ll be there, she promised she`ll definitely be there!
It's a Gogonasus.
There used to be over 10,000 of them in the sea.
Oh look, the shy 'Licosus'.
Beautiful.
Where are you going 'Licosus'?
Wow, it's huge!
It`s a 'Licosus'!
'Licosus'!
Hey!
There`s a boat!
They`re calling "Hey!" to us!
Heeeeeeeeey!
Whoa, are!
They must have spotted us.
Ponyo, you can blow it out now.
Hello.
Hello.
Hey, that`s a wonderful boat.
I was wondering who it was, and it turned out to be Risa`s little Sosuke.
It`s not little Sosuke.
It`s just Sosuke.
She`s Ponyo.
Ponyo, used to be a fish.
A fish?
Ponyo is a nice name, isn`t it?
Yup.
Mister, do you know where is Risa is?
Miss Risa?
Is she not with you?
She went out to Sunflower Home.
To Sunflower Home?
This is a baby.
Oh!
What is it?
Are you going to pour some?
Here, let me see it.
Thank you.
I`m going to have some!
What a delicious soup!
Risa made it.
It's for THE BABY!
I'm sorry, the baby can't drink soup yet!
But, if I drink this, then I'll make milk for the baby.
I used to drink Risa's milk too.
Ponyo, may I drink this soup?
Yes, please have some.
Thank you.
There are people over there!
It's like a parade!
Hey!
Is there anything we can help you with?
Thanks, but we're fine for now.
Then please be careful on your way up to the hotel.
Ok, will do.
There's so many people.
Thank goodness everyone is safe.
Ponyo, be careful with that!
Hold on.
Turn these into milk!
Wow!
For milk!
Ponyo ate everyone`s ham, though.
Thank you.
I`m sure there will be a lot of milk.
Sosuke, this isn`t much, but do you want it?
Yeah, Ponyo will make it bigger.
Thank you.
Be careful, ok?
Thanks again.
What is it?
Now, now, now!
Ponyo!
Wow!
Little Sosuke!
Where is Miss Risa?
She went to Sunflower Home!
I`m going after her.
Risa must have gotten past that wave!
Amazing!
Sosuke, give me a ride too!
Kumiko, we're in a hurry, so I`ll let you ride later.
Sosuke!
Hurry to the school!
Do your best!
"Attention, we're on duty so, we can only wish you all the best!"
Ponyo, we need a new candle.
It's ok, we still have the one we just received.
Ouch!
It`s still very hot.
Bye bye.
Ponyo, can you make this bigger too?
Yeah sure.
Ponyo, are you sleepy?
Ponyo?
Ponyo?
Ponyo!
It`s shallow!
My feet can touch the ground!
The road is coming out of the water.
Ah!
My boat...
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Wake up!
Sosuke.
Thank goodness.
I thought you were in danger!
Is Risa's car!
Ponyo!
Risa's car is over there!
Risa, Risa~
Sosuke, your boat.
There`s water coming out of your eyes.
Let`s look for Risa.
Ok.
Quick, look at this!
It`s so beautiful, just like an underwater palace!
Ladies, please gather round over here!
Ok, let's go.
It feels great to run!
I`m going first!
Please calm down everyone.
This is the moment of destiny.
Sosuke is coming here.
Oh, what's going on?
A love test!
?
My heart is pounding!
Me too!
Please calm down.
Everyone here is a witness.
Please wait a while longer.
Mr. Fujimoto, you're not going to do something bad to Sosuke and Ponyo right?
Of course not.
This is a harsh test for Ponyo, and then...
I think he's a gentleman.
What is Miss Risa doing?
Look, over there.
She's been chatting with Ponyo's mother for a loooooong time.
This must be hard for Miss Risa.
What they talking about, I wonder?
Let's call her.
Miss Risa, Risa...
Don't worry!
Sosuke and Ponyo will come for you!
Miss Risa must be worried!
Little Sosuke will be fine, he`s a good boy!
Thank you.
Everyone, let's cheer for them!
Ponyo, it's a tunnel.
Don`t be afraid of the dark.
I hate this place.
You can`t let go of my hand, ok?
Ok.
Ah!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo, you can`t die!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Wake up, Ponyo!
Shh... don`t wake her.
Sosuke, you did good getting this far!
Risa and the Grannies, everyone is waiting for you!
Risa is?
Come with me, bring Ponyo as well.
Ponyo needs to sleep, let`s go quietly.
Sosuke!
Don`t let that guy fool you!
He uses sweet talk but he takes everyone away.
Granny Toki!
Don't be fooled by him!
That`s why I said there isn`t any time!
Can`t you see that?
If the moon gets any closer something terrible will happen!
You can make a better excuse than that!
Ah~~~
Sosuke, come with me!
Only you can save this world!
I won't hurt you.
Ponyo.
Ack!
How could you treat your father this way?
Ponyo!
Sosuke, come on!
I said I won't hurt you!
You can do it!
Granny Toki`s got ya!
You guys!
Risa!
Sosuke.
Ponyo!
You must be Sosuke.
Hello.
Are you Ponyo's mother?
Yes I am.
You did a good job bringing Ponyo here.
Shh...
Thank you.
Sosuke, Ponyo broke a magic seal in order to become human.
In order to become human, she needs a man that understand Ponyo and is willing to accept her.
Do you know that she is a fish?
Yes.
She turned into a mermaid because she's tasted your blood.
Is that so?
She licked my wound and it turned her into a mermaid?
Knowing that she's half fish half human.
Are you ok with that?
Yes.
No matter if she's a fish Ponyo, a mermaid Ponyo or a human Ponyo, everyone loves her!
Ha ha...
Ponyo, please come here.
Ponyo, it seems that Sosuke has accepted you just as you are.
In order to become a human, you can`t use magic anymore.
Can you do that?
Yes.
When you return to surface, kiss this bubble once.
Ponyo will then transform into a 5 year old girl like you.
Ponyo, that`s wonderful, isn`t it?
Thank you, Ponyo's mama!
Everyone, the curse on the Earth is broken.
YAY!
That's great!
Risa, thank you.
You too, thank you, always.
Everyone, are you alright?
We'll bring the wheelchairs immediately!
That`s ok, we can walk.
This is your ship.
Thank you!
I`m sorry for everything.
May I shake your hand?
I am entrusting Ponyo to you.
It`s Koichi's ship!
Koichi!
Hey!
Over here!
Ah!
It`s Risa!
Sosuke`s there too!
Ponyo, that`s Koichi`s ship!
Ah!
Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo, the fish child she came from the big blue sea!
Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo, got bigger and turned into a little girl!
Tip tap Tip tap, Stomp, Stomp said legs would be great, and set out on a journey
Niigi niigi, Boom, Boo-oom said hands would be great, but perhaps not!
She set out with a boy and risked her heart
Paku Paku Chyugyu!
Paaku Paaku Chyuugyu!
I love that child more and more!
Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo, the fish child she came from the big blue sea!
Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo got bigger and turned into a little girl!

Sosuke, come right back!
Okay.
A goldfish...
It's stuck.
That was weird.
Ow!
Is it dead?
It licked me... it's alive.
Sosuke, we're leaving!
Lisa, I caught a goldfish!
This wind feels strange...
Sosuke, I'm starting the car!
Did you find her?
What, captured by a human?
This is bad... very bad.
Are you dead?
You're alive!
Sosuke!
I'm going to be late!
Lisa!
I caught a goldfish.
A goldfish?
Down by the rocks.
I'm sorry, but you can't use weed killer here.
Heavens no!
This is pure sea water.
It keeps me humidified.
As long as it's not weed killer.
Good day!
This is very bad.
What a creepy guy.
But don't you say that about strangers, Sosuke.
I won't.
Are you taking that to school?
Won't the teacher complain?
Don't worry, I'll take care of you.
She's cute!
They're using the dry dock.
Here, eat this before we get there.
Maybe she's hungry.
Want some?
Hey, my cut is gone!
I'm going to call her Ponyo.
She's really special!
She can do magic.
She fixed my cut.
Want some ham?
- Ponyo likes ham, Lisa!
- That makes two of us.
Oh no...
Disgusting!
Hurry, Lisa!
Such filth!
Intolerable!
Good morning!
Look, Ponyo.
There's our house.
- I'll drop you here.
- Okay.
Have fun.
See you.
Morning.
Sorry I'm late.
Could you get Noriko's wheelchair?
Good morning, Sosuke.
I'm busy, Yoshie.
Talk to you later.
My!
Hello, Sosuke.
Can't talk now, Toki.
Maybe the teacher will get mad.
I know!
Wait here.
I'll be back soon.
What if a cat comes?
Stay here, I'll be right back.
See you later.
It's all right.
She'll be just fine.
Okay, thanks.
Bye-bye.
Good morning, teacher.
Hello Sosuke.
How are you?
- Sosuke!
- Kumiko...
Like my dress?
Mommy got it for me.
Oh...
Let's play, Sosuke!
Not now.
I'm busy.
How come?
- I told you, I'm busy.
- You're no fun.
Yeah!
Ponyo!
Sosuke!
Kumiko...
What's that?
You're not supposed to bring stuff.
But these trees aren't on school grounds.
Show me.
Oh, a goldfish.
It's not a goldfish.
It's Ponyo.
Ponyo?
I want to see!
Promise not to tell?
I promise.
Isn't she cute?
It looks fat.
My goldfish is lots cuter.
It's Kumiko's fault.
She was mean to you.
I'll give you some more water.
Ponyo!
You scared me.
Why, how odd.
That was Sosuke's voice.
But he's supposed to be in school.
I must be hearing things.
Here I am, Yoshie.
I knew I heard your voice.
Do I have a secret?
Yes!
Bingo!
Okay, what color is my secret?
- Red!
- Red!
Good guess.
How'd you know?
Show us.
All right.
Oh, how pretty!
Very cute!
Her name is Ponyo.
She loves ham and she can do magic.
I cut my thumb, but she fixed it.
I wonder if she'd fix our legs.
We could run around just like you.
Well, I'd have to ask Ponyo first.
Can I take a look?
Sure, Toki.
Heavens, it has a face!
Put it back before it brings a tsunami!
You're so superstitious, Toki.
That's what the old stories say.
Fish like that are bad luck.
The tsunami!
It's here!
The tsunami is here!
What's wrong, Toki?
Just look at my clothes!
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Come back here and apologize!
Don't worry, I'll protect you.
Sosuke.
Sosuke.
Ponyo!
Ponyo.
Sosuke.
Ponyo...
loves Sosuke!
I love you too.
Ponyo loves Sosuke!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Sosuke!
Ponyo!
Listen, Sosuke.
Maybe it was fate.
It just can't be helped.
Ponyo was born in the sea.
She went back home, that's all.
Anyway, let's hope that creepy guy is gone.
One lick?
Hurry, it's melting!
Not bad!
Cheer up.
Koichi will be home tonight.
He'll be disappointed if you're feeling down.
No more ocean today, okay?
Sosuke?
Time to come inside.
Do you think this bucket will help Ponyo find us?
There's only one way to find out.
Can you get that, Sosuke?
It must be Koichi.
Hello?
Yes, it's me.
Yes, I'm fine.
I can't get back tonight.
I'll signal when I'm offshore.
Okay.
Here's Lisa.
Koichi?
Yes...
What?
!
Can't you get out of it?
Fine...
leave your wife and son up on the cliff!
I give up!
Why bother?
C'mon Sosuke, let's eat out!
I want to eat here.
There he is!
Turn off the lights, Lisa.
It's Sosuke!
He's a genius.
Only five years old.
Your wife must be upset.
He says he's sorry.
J...
JE...
JER...
JERK

He says he loves you!
Lots and lots!

LOVE AND KISSES
Don't cry, Lisa.
I won't cry.
I promised Ponyo I'd take care of her.
I hope she isn't crying.
Okay, let's cheer up!
"I'm happy as can be... "
Ow!
Don't worry, Sosuke.
I'm sure Ponyo is fine too.
Now let's eat.
We'll eat Koichi's dinner too!
This is all my fault.
Bringing you along to watch me was a mistake.
How often have I warned you about humans?
Their very breath is polluted.
Come, you must eat.
Can't you hear me, Brunhilde?
I want ham!
Ham?
!
What on earth have you been doing?
Answer me, Brunhilde!
My name's not Brunhilde.
It's Ponyo.
Ponyo?
Ponyo loves Sosuke.
I want to be human!
Human?
How could you love such disgusting creatures?
They rob the sea of life.
I was human myself... once.
I finally escaped that awful heritage.
I want hands!
I don't like this!
I want legs like Sosuke!
Of all the nonsense!
Look at me!
Hands and feet!
No... don't tell me you tasted human blood!
Wanna see Sosuke!
No!
His blood has deranged your DNA!
Revert... revert...
Go back... go back!
It's not working.
I need more power.
Let me out!
Be still, you evil blood.
Revert, revert!
Just like her mother... so strong.
She should remain innocent and pure forever.
I can't hold her for long.
I need her mother's help.
No!
My elixir is too strong for you!
Shoo!
Go away!
My crab shields were weakening.
I nearly upset Nature's balance.
I must stay calm.
When I think of meeting HER again!
This batch should be ready.
No leaks down here.
This door is loose.
I'll fix it later.
If even one creature got in here!
Superb!
I feel the ocean's power in my very DNA.
When this well is full, the Era of the Ocean will begin.
An explosion of life to match the Cambrian Era!
This revolting era of Man will be over.
Better fix this door.
Teeth!
I'm going back to Sosuke!
A waterspout?
Captain, look there!
- Tsunami!
- Turn her into the waves!
What's that?
Captain!
Radio's out, the radar too!
A little girl?
She must be Sosuke's age!
- Bye-bye.
- See you tomorrow.
- Thanks.
- Take care.
Do you want to wait here for Lisa?
It's okay, I'll take the shortcut.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Be careful out there.
Sorry, Sosuke.
The power's out.
The door wouldn't open, would it?
Was the school okay?
Go home, Lisa.
We'll be fine.
Are you sure?
Don't worry, we'll be just fine.
We're spending the night anyway.
You should go while you can.
Wait for me, Sosuke.
Yoshie.
Why, Sosuke.
It's so dark, I didn't see you.
This is for you.
My, what is it?
One for you, Noriko.
Thank you.
Can't see a thing.
This is such foolishness!
I don't want to spend the night.
- Oh good, the power's on.
- It's a goldfish!
Maybe Sosuke's magic made the lights go on?
Extremely powerful...
Micro-typhoon...
Ships should exercise extreme caution...
This TV is useless.
Those idiots couldn't forecast their way out of a paper bag.
You should go home, Sosuke.
Your goldfish will bring us luck.
We're not afraid now.
Here's yours, Toki.
It's all wrinkled.
What is it?
Like this.
I know!
It's a grasshopper.
No, the Koganei Maru.
That's your father's ship.
Still looks like a grasshopper.
We're leaving, Sosuke.
Say goodbye to everyone.
Goodbye, everybody.
Goodbye.
Don't let the wind blow you away!
Climb over.
The phones are out too.
The sea is puffed up!
Will the ships sink?
They're safe out at sea.
I'm sure that's where Koichi is.
- I see fish, Lisa.
- Seat belt!
You've got to turn back!
People are going to the shelters.
But there are people at the senior center!
They'll be alright.
They're on the leeward side.
I've just got to get home.
You'd better go around the mountain.
Here we go, Sosuke.
No!
Stop!
Look out for that wave!
Here it comes!
Run for it, Lisa!
- The fish are following us.
- Seat belt, Sosuke!
Hold on tight!
That wave won't quit!
A little girl fell in.
She was riding a fish.
Where?
The sea keeps rising.
Where did you see her?
Running on top of a fish.
A fish!
?
Come on, Sosuke.
Hang on, Sosuke!
We're almost home.
A little girl!
Here, you'd better come with us.
Stay there, Sosuke.
Sosuke, do you know her?
Ponyo?
Yes, it's me!
It's you!
Ponyo's a little girl now, Lisa!
I made it!
Now listen, children.
No matter how strange everything seems we have to stay calm.
Now be good.
Take off your rain coat, Sosuke.
Here Ponyo, you hold the light.
I'll bring you a towel.
C'mon, Ponyo!
It smells just like you!
Ouch!
Ponyo!
Gotcha!
Let's get you dried off.
Such pretty red hair!
But your clothes are dry...
Ponyo was a fish.
Water doesn't make her wet.
I like this!
All right!
Who wants a hot drink?
Help me with the light, Ponyo.
Coming!
Think we'll have water?
Sure!
Sure!
Water!
Water!
We have a tank outside.
What about the gas?
Presto!
All right!
All right!
It's propane.
Okay, take your seats.
Okay!
Over here, Ponyo.
Sit down, like this.
Put your stuff down.
You need your hands.
I have feet!
Wow!
What are you two doing?
Her feet are like hands.
There you go.
This is the best!
That hit the spot.
What shall we do now?
I want ham!
She's crazy about ham.
Then let's eat.
But first let's start the generator.
We need electricity to talk to Koichi.
Koichi is my father.
Is he a bad sorcerer?
No, silly.
He's a ship captain.
What about your father, Ponyo?
Fujimoto!
He keeps me prisoner.
I ran away.
What about your mother?
I love my mother!
She's really scary.
Sounds like Lisa.
Can you help me, Ponyo?
Maybe the fuel's too old?
Is it clogged?
Clogged.
It's clogged there.
Success!
All bright!
Wow, Ponyo!
Antenna!
Antenna!
Did all the ships sink, Lisa?
I can't see a single light.
So loud!
What's wrong?
Even the radio is out of whack.
This is JA4LL...
JA4LL.
Come in, Kolchl.
It's Lisa, Sosuke and Ponyo.
We're all doing fine.
We're going to have dinner.
Ham!
Ready?
Careful, it's hot.
It's not ready yet.
It takes three minutes.
Close your eyes!
Not yet!
No peeking, Ponyo.
Okay, you can look now.
And... presto!
Ham!
Good for you, Ponyo.
Ponyo went to sleep.
Is her home far away?
I think it must be.
Look Sosuke.
The sea is calmer.
Because Ponyo's asleep?
Look over there!
It's moving.
Someone's up there.
People from the senior center?
It's gone.
That's the peak road.
Sosuke, stay there with Ponyo.
Maybe I could get through on the mountain road.
I'm going to the senior center.
I'll go too.
Stay here with Ponyo.
I'm going too.
Let's take Ponyo with us.
I'm going with you!
Sosuke, our house is a lighthouse in the storm.
Everyone out there is depending on us.
Someone has to stay here.
Lots of things are happening that I don't understand.
But right now I'm worried about the people at the senior center.
Just knowing you're here will help me.
Don't worry.
I promise to come back.
Promise?
I promise.
You promised!
I love you, Sosuke.
I see the lights of the town!
Finally...
Now we can navigate.
I've never seen that town before.
Did the storm blow us to America?
That's not a mountain.
And that's no harbor...
Those are ships!
The sea is piled up into a mountain!
It's a ship graveyard.
What's going on?
We lost power!
Heave to!
Drop the sea anchor!
Aye-aye!
Something is coming!
A sea goddess!
?
The engine!
We're saved!
The engine started again.
It was Her!
Protect us from harm...
Come on, come on.
A barrier spell!
Where did she learn this?
Good heavens... she's human!
Hey, watch out!
What are you doing?
Stop!
This is unsafe!
Stop that at once!
I'm simply trying to save your sister.
She's here.
She answered my call!
- Fujimoto...
- You came, my beloved.
Such a beautiful ocean.
So full of magic, like my ancient Devonian sea.
It's Ponyo!
She tasted human blood and plundered all of my elixir.
Ponyo... what a lovely name.
It's all my fault.
She's totally beyond my control.
It's complete chaos.
She doesn't understand what she's done.
Now she's human, and she's up there with her boyfriend!
If we don't stop her, the planet is doomed!
No!
The satellites are falling.
Earth's gravitational field...
Be still...
Sosuke... that is his name, yes?
You love your sister, don't you?
Listen, dear... what if Ponyo really became human?
Use the old magic.
If Sosuke's love is real, she'll lose her powers forever.
But if it's not, she'll turn to sea foam!
That's where we all came from, dear.
But he's only five!
Sleep well, little children.
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Ow!
Good morning, Ponyo.
Morning, Sosuke.
We almost got flooded.
- Where's Lisa?
- She must be stuck someplace.
I wish we had a boat.
There's a boat!
We can't fit.
Can so.
Awesome!
The candle's bigger too.
We can fit.
This is cool.
Cool!
Grab that end.
Ready?
Ready!
She's seaworthy!
Awesome.
No leaks!
Now we fill the boiler.
The water goes in here.
It goes in the boiler.
It's like a rocket!
Everything's shipshape.
Shipshape...
Shipshape?
Shipshape!
Shipshape!
Shipshape!
Is it hot?
Hot!
It's hot.
- The candle's burning.
- It's burning!
Hot hot hot!
It's hot.
Awesome!
We're shipshape, Sosuke!
This is great.
This is so much fun.
It's burning, Sosuke.
It's really hot.
Keep a lookout in front.
I'll steer the boat.
Okay, I'm the lookout.
There's a road.
That's the road Lisa took.
I don't see her.
You will.
She gave me her promise.
Ancient fish...
from the Devonian age!
There's Bothriolepis.
That one is...
Dipnorhynchus.
Dipnorhynchus!
That one's really huge.
That's Devonynchus.
Devonynchus!
Ahoy!
A boat!
Ahoy!
They're calling us.
Ahoy!
Ow!
Pretty good, huh?
Now, Ponyo.
Hello.
That's a wonderful boat you have.
Why, you're Lisa's little boy.
He's not little, he's Sosuke.
This is Ponyo.
I was a fish before.
A fish?
Ponyo... that's a nice name.
Have you seen Lisa?
Lisa?
She's not with you?
She's at the center.
The senior center?
This is my baby.
Oh my, what happened?
Is that for us?
Give me the cup, dear.
Thank you.
Let's try it.
It's delicious!
Lisa made it.
It's for the baby.
Oh, I'm sorry.
He can't handle soup yet.
But this will help me make milk for him.
Lisa gave me her milk too.
Ponyo, may I have this soup?
Sure.
Thank you.
People from the town.
It's like a festival.
You there!
Do you need assistance?
Thanks, we're okay right now!
Then please follow us.
We're going to the hotel on the peak.
Okay!
Will do.
The whole town's here.
I hope everyone's all right.
- Let's go, Ponyo.
- Hold on a second.
Milk!
Oh my...
Milk!
She ate up all the ham.
This will help me make good milk.
Can you use another candle for your boat, Sosuke?
Thanks.
Ponyo will make it bigger.
Be careful!
Thank you both!
What is it, dear?
Don't cry.
Ponyo!
Sosuke!
Where's Lisa?
Isn't she with you?
I'm going to pick her up.
So she survived that wave?
Sosuke, take me with you!
Later, Kumiko.
I'm busy now.
Everyone from the center evacuated to the park.
- Keep safe!
- You can do it!
We'll send a boat for them later.
Good luck, captain!
Time for a new candle, Ponyo.
We're okay.
I have another one.
Ow!
It's still pretty hot.
Bye-bye.
Can you make this candle bigger?
All right.
Are you sleepy, Ponyo?
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Good... it's shallow enough to walk.
A road!
It's shrinking!
Ponyo!
Ponyo, wake up!
Sosuke...
Don't scare me.
I thought you were turning into a fish.
Lisa's car!
Ponyo, that's her car!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Here's your boat.
Your eyes are wet.
Let's find Lisa.
- You forgot your wrap!
- Who needs it?
Look, it's a whale!
- My knees don't hurt anymore!
- What were we so afraid of?
- Is this the Other Side?
- Who cares?
It's wonderful.
Attention, please!
Gather round.
Coming!
Shall we?
It's so nice to run.
Meet you there!
The winner!
You're so fast, Kayo.
Quiet, everyone!
The moment of truth is at hand.
Sosuke and Ponyo are almost here.
It's so romantic.
- Will love triumph?
- I'm so excited!
Quiet!
Very soon, you will bear witness to a sacred trial of love.
Mr. Fujimoto, you're not up to something, are you?
Nonsense, he's her father.
They'll be fine...
if she doesn't wake up.
Now excuse me!
I'd like to believe him...
Where's Lisa gone to?
She's been talking with Ponyo's mother for ages.
I hope she's okay.
What are they talking about?
Let's find out.
Lisa!
Lisa!
We're all rooting for Sosuke and Ponyo!
Lisa!
- You must be worried.
- Sosuke will be just fine.
He's a strong little boy.
Thanks, everyone.
He'll need your support.
Ponyo, it's a tunnel.
"STOP"
I've been here before.
Ponyo?
I don't like this place.
Don't let go of my hand.
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Please don't die!
Ponyo!
Wake up, Ponyo!
Let her sleep.
I've been waiting for you, Sosuke.
Lisa and the old ladies are waiting too.
Lisa?
!
Won't you come with me?
You and Ponyo.
Let's not wake her.
Sosuke!
Don't listen to him!
He tricked everyone into going with him.
Toki!
But he couldn't fool me!
There's no time, I tell you.
Don't you see what's happening?
If the Moon comes any closer, we're finished!
Is that the best you can do?
Sosuke, come here!
Listen to me, Sosuke.
You're the planet's last hope.
Don't make me use force.
Ponyo!
Is this how you treat your father?
Ponyo!
Run, Sosuke!
You don't understand!
You can make it!
Jump!
Now what?
Lisa!
Sosuke!
Ponyo!
- Look over there.
- Where are we?
So, you are Sosuke.
Hello.
Are you Ponyo's mother?
Yes.
I want to thank you for bringing my daughter back to me.
Ponyo wanted to be like you, but she unleashed a terrible power.
To become human, she must be loved for who she really is.
Do you know that Ponyo was a fish?
Yes.
Your blood made her human... almost.
That's right!
Ponyo licked my cut and made it better.
So that's why she changed!
Can you accept her as she is?
I'll always love Ponyo whether she's a fish, a human or in between.
Come, Ponyo.
Sosuke has promised to accept you as you are.
But first, you must give up your powers.
Can you do that?
Kiss this bubble when you return to land and Ponyo will be a little girl.
Way to go, Ponyo!
Thank you, Ponyo's mother!
Now the planet is safe again.
Splendid, Sosuke!
Sosuke!
I'm grateful, Lisa.
Thank you, Gran Mamare.
There you are!
Are you all right?
Wait, I'll get the wheelchairs.
Don't bother, we'll walk.
It's all so exciting.
I believe this is yours.
Thanks.
I hope you'll forgive me... may I?
Take good care of her.
It's Koichi!
Koichi!
It's Lisa!
And there's Sosuke!
Look, Ponyo.
It's Koichi!
We made this movie
We made this movie Ponyo Ponyo Ponyo, tiny little fish
She's a little fish from the deep blue sea
Ponyo Ponyo Ponyo, she's a little girl
She's a little girl with a round tummy
Pitter-patter, hop-hop and jump
Look, I have legs!
I'm gonna run
Squishy-squeeze, wave them around
Look, I have hands!
Let's hold them now!
When I'm skipping with him
My heart does this dance
Munch, munch!
Kiss, hug!
Oh he 's my favorite little boy
Rosy-rosy red-red
Ponyo Ponyo Ponyo, tiny little fish
She's a little fish from the deep blue sea

Sosuke, come right back!
Okay.
A goldfish...
That was weird.
Ow!
Sosuke, we're leaving!
Lisa, I caught a goldfish!
This wind feels strange...
Sosuke, I'm starting the car!
Did you find her?
What, captured by a human?
This is bad... very bad.
Are you dead?
You're alive!
Sosuke!
I'm going to be late!
Lisa!
I caught a goldfish.
A goldfish?
Down by the rocks.
I'm sorry, but you can't use weed killer here.
Heavens no!
This is pure sea water.
It keeps me humidified.
As long as it's not weed killer.
Good day!
This is very bad.
What a creepy guy.
But don't you say that about strangers, Sosuke.
Are you taking that to school?
Won't the teacher complain?
She's cute!
They're using the dry dock.
Here, eat this before we get there.
Maybe she's hungry.
Want some?
Hey, my cut is gone!
I'm going to call her Ponyo.
She's really special!
She can do magic.
She fixed my cut.
Want some ham?
Ponyo likes ham, Lisa!
That makes two of us.
Oh no...
Disgusting!
Hurry, Lisa!
Such filth!
Intolerable!
Good morning!
Look, Ponyo.
There's our house.
I'll drop you here.
Okay.
Have fun.
See you.
Morning.
Sorry I'm late.
Could you get Noriko's wheelchair?
Good morning, Sosuke.
I'm busy, Yoshie.
Talk to you later.
My!
Hello, Sosuke.
Can't talk now, Toki.
Maybe the teacher will get mad.
I know!
Wait here.
I'll be back soon.
What if a cat comes?
Stay here, I'll be right back.
See you later.
It's all right.
She'll be just fine.
Okay, thanks.
Bye bye.
Good morning, teacher.
Hello Sosuke.
How are you?
Sosuke!
Kumiko...
Like my dress?
Mommy got it for me.
Oh...
Let's play, Sosuke!
Not now.
I'm busy.
How come?
I told you, I'm busy.
You're no fun.
Yeah!
Ponyo!
Sosuke!
Kumiko...
What's that?
You're not supposed to bring stuff.
But these trees aren't on school grounds.
Show me.
Oh, a goldfish.
It's not a goldfish.
It's Ponyo.
Ponyo?
I want to see!
Promise not to tell?
I promise.
It looks fat.
My goldfish is lots cuter.
It's Kumiko's fault.
She was mean to you.
I'll give you some more water.
Ponyo!
You scared me.
Why, how odd.
That was Sosuke's voice.
But he's supposed to be in school.
I must be hearing things.
Here I am, Yoshie.
I knew I heard your voice.
Do I have a secret?
Yes!
Bingo!
Okay, what color is my secret?
Red!
Red!
Good guess.
How'd you know?
Show us.
All right.
Oh, how pretty!
Very cute!
Her name is Ponyo.
She loves ham and she can do magic.
I cut my thumb, but she fixed it.
I wonder if she'd fix our legs.
We could run around just like you.
Well, I'd have to ask Ponyo first.
Can I take a look?
Sure, Toki.
Heavens, it has a face!
You're so superstitious, Toki.
Fish like that are bad luck.
The tsunami!
It's here!
The tsunami is here!
What's wrong, Toki?
Just look at my clothes!
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Come back here and apologize!
Don't worry, I'll protect you.
Sosuke.
Sosuke.
Ponyo!
Ponyo.
Sosuke.
Ponyo...
loves Sosuke!
I love you too.
Ponyo loves Sosuke!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Sosuke!
Ponyo!
Listen, Sosuke.
Maybe it was fate.
Ponyo was born in the sea.
She went back home, that's all.
Anyway, let's hope that creepy guy is gone.
One lick?
Hurry, it's melting!
Not bad!
Cheer up.
Koichi will be home tonight.
He'll be disappointed if you're feeling down.
No more ocean today, okay?
Sosuke?
Time to come inside.
Do you think this bucket will help Ponyo find us?
There's only one way to find out.
Can you get that, Sosuke?
It must be Koichi.
Hello?
Yes, it's me.
I can't get back tonight.
I'll signal when I'm offshore.
Okay.
Here's Lisa.
Koichi?
Yes...
What?
!
Can't you get out of it?
Fine...
leave your wife and son up on the cliff!
I give up!
Why bother?
There he is!
Turn off the lights, Lisa.
It's Sosuke!
He's a genius.
Only five years old.
Your wife must be upset.
He says he's sorry.
J...
JE...
JER...
JERK

JERK!
JERK!
JERK!

He says he loves you!
Lots and lots!

THANKS
LOVE AND KISSES
Don't cry, Lisa.
I won't cry.
I promised Ponyo I'd take care of her.
I hope she isn't crying.
Okay, let's cheer up!
"I'm happy as can be...
Ow!
Don't worry, Sosuke.
I'm sure Ponyo is fine too.
Now let's eat.
We'll eat Koichi's dinner too!
This is all my fault.
Bringing you along to watch me was a mistake.
How often have I warned you about humans?
Their very breath is polluted.
Come, you must eat.
Can't you hear me, Brunilde?
I want ham.
Ham?
!
What on earth have you been doing?
Answer me, Brunilde!
My name's not Brunilde.
It's Ponyo.
Ponyo?
Ponyo loves Sosuke.
Human?
How could you love such disgusting creatures?
They rob the sea of life.
I was human myself... once.
I finally escaped that awful heritage.
Of all the nonsense!
Look at me!
Hands and feet!
Wanna see Sosuke!
No!
His blood has deranged your DNA!
Revert... revert...
Go back... go back!
It's not working.
I need more power.
Let me out!
Be still, you evil blood.
Revert, revert!
Just like her mother... so strong.
No!
My elixir is too strong for you!
Shoo!
Go away!
My crab shields were weakening.
I nearly upset Nature's balance.
When I think of meeting HER again...!
This batch should be ready.
No leaks down here.
This door is loose.
Superb!
I feel the ocears power in my very DNA.
When this well is full, the Era of the Ocean will begin.
An explosion of life to match the Cambrian Era!
This revolting era of Man will be over.
Better fix this door.
Teeth!
I'm going back to Sosuke!
A waterspout?
Captain, look there!
Tsunami!
Turn her into the waves!
What's that?
Captain!
Radio's out, the radar too!
A little girl?
She must be Sosuke's age!
Bye bye.
See you tomorrow.
Thanks.
Take care.
Do you want to wait here for Lisa?
It's okay, I'll take the shortcut.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Be careful out there.
Sorry, Sosuke.
The power's out.
The door wouldn't open, would it?
Was the school okay?
Go home, Lisa.
We'll be fine.
Are you sure?
We're spending the night anyway.
You should go while you can.
Wait for me, Sosuke.
Yoshie.
This is for you.
My, what is it?
One for you, Noriko.
Thank you.
Can't see a thing.
This is such foolishness!
I don't want to spend the night.
Oh good, the power's on.
It's a goldfish!
Maybe Sosuke's magic made the lights go on?
Extremely powerful...
Ships should exercise
This TV is useless.
Those idiots couldn't forecast their way out of a paper bag.
You should go home, Sosuke.
Your goldfish will bring us luck.
We're not afraid now.
Here's yours, Toki.
It's all wrinkled.
What is it?
Like this.
I know!
It's a grasshopper.
That's your father's ship.
Still looks like a grasshopper.
We're leaving, Sosuke.
Say goodbye to everyone.
Goodbye, everybody.
Goodbye.
Don't let the wind blow you away!
Climb over.
The phones are out too.
The sea is puffed up!
Will the ships sink?
They're safe out at sea.
I'm sure that's where Koichi is.
I see fish, Lisa.
Seat belt!
You've got to turn back!
People are going to the shelters.
But there are people at the senior center!
They'll be alright.
They're on the leeward side.
I've just got to get home.
You'd better go around the mountain.
Here we go, Sosuke.
No!
Stop!
Look out for that wave!
Here it comes!
Run for it, Lisa!
The fish are following us.
Seat belt, Sosuke!
Hold on tight!
That wave won't quit!
A little girl fell in.
She was riding a fish.
Where?
The sea keeps rising.
Where did you see her?
Running on top of a fish.
A fish!
?
Come on, Sosuke.
Hang on, Sosuke!
We're almost home.
A little girl!
Here, you'd better come with us.
Stay there, Sosuke.
Sosuke, do you know her?
Ponyo?
Yes, it's me!
It's you!
Ponyo's a little girl now, Lisa!
Now listen, children.
No matter how strange everything seems we have to stay calm.
Now be good.
Take off your rain coat, Sosuke.
Here Ponyo, you hold the light.
C'mon, Ponyo!
It smells just like you!
Ouch!
Ponyo!
Gotcha!
Let's get you dried off.
Such pretty red hair!
But your clothes are dry...
Ponyo was a fish.
Water doesn't make her wet.
All right!
Who wants a hot drink?
Help me with the light, Ponyo.
Coming!
Think we'll have water?
Sure!
Sure!
Water!
Water!
We have a tank outside.
What about the gas?
Presto!
All right!
All right!
It's propane.
Okay, take your seats.
Okay!
Over here, Ponyo.
Sit down, like this.
Put your stuff down.
You need your hands.
Wow!
What are you two doing?
Her feet are like hands.
There you go.
This is the best!
That hit the spot.
What shall we do now?
I want ham.
She's crazy about ham.
Then let's eat.
But first let's start the generator.
We need electricity to talk to Koichi.
Koichi is my father.
No, silly.
He's a ship captain.
What about your father, Ponyo?
Fujimoto!
He keeps me prisoner.
I ran away.
What about your mother?
I love my mother!
She's really scary.
Sounds like Lisa.
Can you help me, Ponyo?
Maybe the fuel's too old?
Is it clogged?
Clogged.
It's clogged there.
Success!
All bright!
Wow, Ponyo!
Antenna!
Antenna!
Did all the ships sink, Lisa?
I can't see a single light.
So loud!
What's wrong?
Even the radio is out of whack.
We're going to have dinner.
Ham!
Ready?
Careful, it's hot.
It's not ready yet.
Close your eyes!
Not yet!
No peeking, Ponyo.
Okay, you can look now.
And... presto!
Ham!
Good for you, Ponyo.
Ponyo went to sleep.
Look Sosuke.
The sea is calmer.
Because Ponyo's asleep?
Look over there!
It's moving.
Someone's up there.
People from the senior center?
It's gone.
That's the peak road.
Sosuke, stay there with Ponyo.
Maybe I could get through on the mountain road.
I'm going to the senior center.
I'll go too.
Stay here with Ponyo.
I'm going too.
Let's take Ponyo with us.
I'm going with you!
Sosuke, our house is a lighthouse in the storm.
Someone has to stay here.
Lots of things are happening that I don't understand.
But right now I'm worried about the people at the senior center.
Just knowing you're here will help me.
Don't worry.
I promise to come back.
Promise?
I promise.
You promised!
I love you, Sosuke.
I see the lights of the town!
Finally...
Now we can navigate.
I've never seen that town before.
Did the storm blow us to America?
That's not a mountain.
And that's no harbor...
Those are ships!
It's a ship graveyard.
What's going on?
We lost power!
Heave to!
Drop the sea anchor!
Aye aye!
Something is coming!
A sea goddess!
?
The engine!
We're saved!
The engine started again.
It was Her!
Protect us from harm...
Come on, come on.
A barrier spell!
Where did she learn this?
Good heavens... she's human!
Hey, watch out!
What are you doing?
Stop!
This is unsafe!
Stop that at once!
I'm simply trying to save your sister.
She's here.
She answered my call!
Fujimoto...
You came, my beloved.
Such a beautiful ocean.
It's Ponyo!
She tasted human blood and plundered all of my elixir.
Ponyo... what a lovely name.
It's all my fault.
She's totally beyond my control.
It's complete chaos.
She doesn't understand what she's done.
Now she's human, and she's...
If we don't stop her, the planet is doomed!
No!
The satellites are falling.
Earth's gravitational field...
Be still...
Sosuke... that is his name, yes?
You love your sister, don't you?
Listen, dear... what if Ponyo really became human?
Use the old magic.
If Sosuke's love is real, she'll lose her powers forever.
But if it's not, she'll turn to sea foam!
That's where we all came from, dear.
But he's only five!
Sleep well, little children.
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Ow!
Good morning, Ponyo.
Morning, Sosuke.
We almost got flooded.
Where's Lisa?
She must be stuck someplace.
There's a boat!
We can't fit.
Can so.
Awesome!
The candle's bigger too.
We can fit.
This is cool.
Cool!
Grab that end.
Ready?
Ready!
She's seaworthy!
Awesome.
No leaks!
Now we fill the boiler.
The water goes in here.
It goes in the boiler.
Everything's shipshape.
Shipshape...
Shipshape?
Shipshape!
Shipshape!
Shipshape!
Hot!
It's hot.
The candle's burning.
It's burning!
Hot hot hot!
It's hot.
Awesome!
This is great.
This is so much fun.
It's really hot.
Keep a lookout in front.
I'll steer the boat.
Okay, I'm the lookout.
There's a road.
That's the road Lisa took.
You will.
She gave me her promise.
Ancient fish...
from the Devonian age!
There's Bothriolepis.
That one is...
Dipnorhynchus.
Dipnorhynchus!
That one's really huge.
That's Devonynchus.
Devonynchus!
Ahoy!
A boat!
Ahoy!
They're calling us.
Ahoy!
Ow!
Pretty good, huh?
Now, Ponyo.
Hello.
Why, you're Lisa's little boy.
He's not little, he's Sosuke.
This is Ponyo.
A fish?
Ponyo... that's a nice name.
Have you seen Lisa?
Lisa?
She's not with you?
She's at the center.
The senior center...?
This is my baby.
Oh my, what happened?
Give me the cup, dear.
Thank you.
Let's try it.
Lisa made it.
It's for the baby.
Oh, I'm sorry.
He can't handle soup yet.
But this will help me make milk for him.
Lisa gave me her milk too.
Ponyo, may I have this soup?
Sure.
Thank you.
People from the town.
It's like a festival.
You there!
Do you need assistance?
Thanks, we're okay right now!
Then please follow us.
We're going to the hotel on the peak.
Okay!
Will do.
The whole towrs here.
Let's go, Ponyo.
Hold on a second.
Milk!
Oh my...
Milk!
She ate up all the ham.
This will help me make good milk.
Can you use another candle for your boat, Sosuke?
Thanks.
Ponyo will make it bigger.
Be careful!
Thank you both!
What is it, dear?
Don't cry.
Ponyo!
Sosuke!
Where's Lisa?
Isn't she with you?
I'm going to pick her up.
So she survived that wave?
Sosuke, take me with you!
Later, Kumiko.
I'm busy now.
Everyone from the center evacuated to the park.
Keep safe!
You can do it!
We'll send a boat for them later.
Good luck, captain!
Time for a new candle, Ponyo.
Ow!
It's still pretty hot.
Bye bye.
Can you make this candle bigger?
All right.
Are you sleepy, Ponyo?
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Good... it's shallow enough to walk.
A road!
Ponyo!
Ponyo, wake up!
Sosuke...
Don't scare me.
I thought you were turning into a fish.
Lisa's car!
Ponyo, that's her car!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Here's your boat.
Your eyes are wet.
Let's find Lisa.
You forgot your wrap!
Who needs it?
Look, it's a whale!
My knees don't hurt anymore!
What were we so afraid of?
Is this the Other Side?
Who cares?
It's wonderful.
Attention, please!
Gather round.
Coming!
Shall we?
Meet you there!
The winner!
You're so fast, Kayo.
Quiet, everyone!
The moment of truth is at hand.
Sosuke and Ponyo are almost here.
Will love triumph?
I'm so excited!
Quiet!
Mr. Fujimoto, you're not up to something, are you?
Nonsense, he's her father.
Now excuse me!
Where's Lisa gone to?
She's been talking with Ponyo's mother for ages.
What are they talking about?
Let's find out.
Lisa!
Lisa!
We're all rooting for Sosuke and Ponyo!
Lisa!
You must be worried.
Sosuke will be just fine.
He's a strong little boy.
Thanks, everyone.
He'll need your support.
Ponyo, it's a tunnel.
"STOP"
Ponyo?
Don't let go of my hand.
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Please don't die!
Ponyo!
Wake up, Ponyo!
Let her sleep.
I've been waiting for you, Sosuke.
Lisa and the old ladies are waiting too.
Lisa?
!
Won't you come with me?
You and Ponyo.
Let's not wake her.
Sosuke!
Don't listen to him!
He tricked everyone into going with him.
Toki!
But he couldn't fool me!
There's no time, I tell you.
Don't you see what's happening?
If the Moon comes any closer, we're finished!
Is that the best you can do?
Sosuke, come here!
Listen to me, Sosuke.
You're the planet's last hope.
Don't make me use force.
Ponyo!
Is this how you treat your father?
Ponyo!
Run, Sosuke!
You don't understand!
You can make it!
Jump!
Now what?
Lisa!
Sosuke!
Ponyo!
Look over there.
Where are we?
So, you are Sosuke.
Hello.
Are you Ponyo's mother?
Yes.
I want to thank you for bringing my daughter back to me.
Ponyo wanted to be like you, but she unleashed a terrible power.
To become human, she must be loved...
Do you know that Ponyo was a fish?
Yes.
Your blood made her human... almost.
That's right!
Ponyo licked my cut and made it better.
So that's why she changed!
Can you accept her as she is?
I'll always love Ponyo whether she's a fish, a human or in between.
Come, Ponyo.
Sosuke has promised to accept you as you are.
But first, you must give up your powers.
Can you do that?
Kiss this bubble when you return to land and Ponyo will be a little girl.
Way to go, Ponyo!
Thank you, Ponyo's mother!
Now the planet is safe again.
Splendid, Sosuke!
Sosuke!
I'm grateful, Lisa.
Thank you, Gran Mamare.
There you are!
Are you all right?
Wait, I'll get the wheelchairs.
Don't bother, we'll walk.
It's all so exciting.
I believe this is yours.
Thanks.
I hope you'll forgive me... may I?
Take good care of her.
Koichi!
It's Lisa!
And there's Sosuke!
Look, Ponyo.
It's Koichi!
We made this movie
We made this movie Ponyo Ponyo Ponyo, tiny little fish
Look, I have legs.
I'm gonna run
Squishy squeeze, wave them around
Look, I have hands!
Let's hold them now!

-beginning-
Ponyo on the Seaside Cliff
Seaweeds waving gently, in the big blue sea together with countless siblings bubbles are our language.
I remember, long ago cruising with you on the big blue sea.
Jellyfish and sea urchin, fish and crabs, we are a big family.
Sosuke, come home soon ok?
Ok.
It's a goldfish.
It's stuck.
Strange...
Ouch!
Is it dead?
It licked my finger.
It`s still alive!
Sosuke, we need to go now.
Risa, there's a goldfish.
What a strange wind.
Sosuke, I'll start the engine first.
Did you find her?
What?
She was captured by a human?
This is bad, really bad.
Did it die?
It's alive!
Sosuke, we're gonna be late.
Risa, I have a live goldfish.
Goldfish?
I found it at the seaside.
I see...
I don't know who you are, but please don't spray pesticide here.
Oh, this is not pesticide.
This is deep sea water to avoid dehydration.
Good, as long as it's not poisonous.
Excuse me.
Oh no, this is really bad.
What a strange guy.
Don't be mean, Sosuke.
Don't judge a book by it's cover.
I won't.
Are you bringing that to kindergarten?
Yeah.
Is it ok with your teacher?
No problem, I'll protect it.
It`s really cute.
The ship is leaving.
Sosuke, hurry up and eat this.
Can you eat this?
You want some?
Hey, my cut healed!
Risa, I`m calling her Ponyo
She licked my wound with a "Ponyo"
and used her magic on me.
After she licked it, the wound disapeared.
Do you like ham?
Risa, Ponyo likes to eat ham.
Just like you, huh?
Miss Risa, hurry up!
This is filthy, really filthy!
Good morning!
Ponyo, you can see our house!
Look!
Here is ok, right?
Yeah!
Take care.
I`m leaving!
Good morning, pardon me.
Please take Granny Noriko's chair.
Ok!
Little Sosuke, morning.
Granny Yoshie, I'm busy now.
Talk to you later.
Ara, ara!
Little Sosuke.
Granny Toki, see you in a while.
Ara!
I wonder if the teacher will tell me it`s not allowed?
Alright!
Wait for me here.
I`ll be right back.
I wonder if cats will come here?
You stay put ok.
I will be right back.
See you.
Ah, Sui-chan.
A bit fever.
But he looks healthy, so he should be fine.
Thank you.
Bye bye.
Good morning, sensei.
Good morning, Sosuke.
Sosuke, how are you?
Sosuke.
Oh, Kumiko.
Look at this.
Isn`t it pretty?
My mom bought it for me.
Sosuke, let's play together.
I'm busy now, maybe next time.
What are you up to?
I said I'm busy.
Strange Sosuke.
So strange.
Oh.
Ponyo!
Sosuke.
Kumiko.
What is this?
You can't bring this to kindergarten.
These trees aren`t part of the kindergarten.
They belong to Sunflower Home, so it's ok.
Let me see.
Oh, goldfish.
Not goldfish, Ponyo.
Ponyo?
I want to see.
If I let you see, you can't tell anyone else.
Ok, won't tell.
See, it`s cute right?
So odd looking.
And chubby.
The goldfishes at my house are cuter!
It's Kumiko fault.
Is her fault, saying something bad about Ponyo.
I'll change your water for you.
Oh.
Ponyo.
Thank goodness.
Isn't that strange, I can hear little Sosuke`s voice.
Sosuke should be in the kindergarten.
My hearing keeps getting worse.
Granny Yoshie, I'm here.
Ara, ara..
It's little Sosuke.
Am I holding something good in my hands?
You sure do!
That's right!
What color is it?
Red?
Red.
Correct.
How do you know?
Let me take a look.
Ok!
It's beautiful.
And cute!
Her name is Ponyo.
She likes ham, and she can use magic.
The cut on my finger disappeared because Ponyo licked it.
I wonder if she could lick our legs too...
If could run like little Sosuke again, that would be wonderful.
Hmm, I must ask Ponyo if she could do that.
Let me see as well.
Sure, Granny Toki.
Oh, gross!
Isn`t that a bad mermaid?
You must quickly return it to the sea.
It will call up a tsunami.
Again, Granny Toki, a tsunami?
What are you saying..?
When mermaids walk on land, tsunamis will follow.
It`s an ancient legend.
Aaah!
A tsunami!
The tsunami has come!
The tsunami has come, tsunami...
What happened, Granny Toki?
My clothes are all wet...
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Sosuke, please apologize to Granny Toki!
You don`t have to worry, I will protect you.
Sosuke.
Souske!
Ah!
Ponyo!
Ponyo...
Sosuke...
Ponyo, Sosuke.
Like!
I like you too.
Ponyo, like Sosuke!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo?
Ponyo...
Sosuke.
Ponyo...
Hey Sosuke, what happened was destiny.
Even though it`s painful, you can`t change destiny.
Ponyo was born to live in the sea, so that's why she must return to the sea.
That Mr. Pesticide is suspicious.
Give me a bite.
Come on, lemme try.
Wasn`t that tasty?
Come on, cheer up.
Today is the day Koichi returns.
If Souske doesn`t cheer up, he won`t be cheerful either.
Don't go to the sea anymore today, ok?
Ok.
Sosuke, please come inside.
If I put the bucket here, Ponyo will know this is her home, right?
Right, if Sosuke wants to put it there she`ll know this is her home.
Yeah!
Sosuke, please answer the phone.
It must be Koichi
Hello?
Yeah, it`s me.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Today, I can`t come home.
We`re crossing the border as usual.
I`m losing signal, pass it to Risa.
I`m giving this to Risa.
Koichi?
Yeah.
EH?
Can't you just tell them no?
You can't just leave your wife and son alone waiting on the cliff.
I don't know!
What is this!
?
Sosuke, tonight let's go out to eat.
I want to eat at home.
It`s Koichi!
Risa, it`s Koichi's ship!
Quick, turn out the lights!
It`s Sosuke!
He's a genius even though he`s just 5 years old.
Your wife must be mad.
I-AM-SORRY
Risa, he said sorry.
B-A-K-A
B-A-K-A... (stupid)
A-A-A-A-A...
Risa, he said "I LOVE YOU".
He said "VERY VERY MUCH!"
(stupid stupid stupid...)
Wow, it`s beautiful, huh?
(Smooth sailing)
(Thank you)
(Goodnight)
Risa, don't cry.
I didn't cry.
I promised to protect Ponyo.
Ponyo... you`re not crying, right?
Ok, let's cheer up.
I am ha-ppy!
Ouch!
Sosuke cheer up too.
Just like Risa, Ponyo`s cheerful too.
Yeah.
So, let's eat!
Let's eat Koichi's portion too.
It's all because of me.
I shouldn't have brought all of you to visit the farm.
As I've told all of you, the humans` air and water are so filthy.
Now, eat this, come on.
Are you listening "Polumisharudin"?
I want ham!
Ham!
?
Where did you learn of such a horrible thing?
Tell me, Polumisharudin.
I'm not Polumisharudin, I am Ponyo!
Po...po...ponyo?
Ponyo likes Sosuke!
Ponyo will become human!
Human!
?
What`s so good about those stupid and horrible creatures?
Human took lives from sea.
I was once called a human.
I sacrificed a lot to not become one of them.
Ponyo wants hands!
I don`t want legs like these!
I want legs like Sosuke!
That's enough...
Hands came out!
Legs came out!
They came out!
You've tasted human blood?
I am going to where Sosuke is!
Now I must undo what your eyes have seen!
Return!
Return!
Go back!
Go back!
Go back!
Ah, not enough power.
Comin` out... comin` out...
Calm thyself, on starry path...
Return.
Return.
Return.
She`s definitely HER child...
Such great power.
If contain her like this, things should be fine...
My power can only hold her for a while.
Looks like only 'that person' can do it.
No.
It's too much for all of you.
Shoo!
Shoo!
No way...
This is dangerous...
My barrier to stop crabs is failing.
It almost disrupted the balance of nature.
Gotta calm down, gotta calm down.
I get a bad feeling everytime when going to meet 'that person'.
Oh no, oh no.
I have to finish cleaning up.
The barrier isn`t weak here.
This is hard to open!
I have to come and fix it later.
I can't even let one sea creature enter here, or else there will be big trouble.
Well done.
The power of the sea is spreading to every corner.
When this well fills up, the time of the sea will begin.
Which will mean the end of those dangerous creatures.
The time of filthy humans will end.
Seal it, seal it...
Ha~
Haha~ Haha~
I'm going to where Sosuke is!
Sosuke...
Ha~
Tsunami?
Captain, that, that...
It`s a tsunami!
Everyone, get inside the ship!
What's that?
Captain, the radio and radar are out!
It's a girl.
About Sosuke's age.
Thank you.
Thanks for your hard work.
Sosuke, wait here for a while ok?
Sensei will accompany you.
I'm going home with Risa, will be fine.
Goodbye, sensei.
Goodbye.
Be careful.
Sorry, Sosuke.
Was the door hard to open?
The power is out.
Was the kindergarten ok?
Yes.
Miss Risa, it's ok.
You can go home first.
Granny Kaneko not here yet?
Yeah, don't worry.
She just a bit late.
After all we will be here whole night.
You better get going while you still can.
Sosuke, wait a minute, ok?
Ok.
Granny Yoshie.
Ara, ara, it`s little Sosuke.
It's too dark, I can't see a thing.
Hey, I wanted to give you this.
Oh?
What is this?
Give one to Granny Noriko too.
Thank you.
So dark, can't see a thing.
Such a heavy storm, and even a black out... that's why I don't want to stay here.
The power`s back.
Thank goodness!
So bright.
A goldfish!
I wonder if the power came back because Sosuke came here?
There will be a large typhoon headed for our area which will be very strong.
Useless TV.
Can't see a thing.
This weather forecast isn`t accurate at all.
Little Sosuke, go home quickly.
We got the goldfish charm, so we won't be scared of anything.
Ok.
Granny Toki, I want to give one to you too.
Isn`t this rough looking?
What is this?
It's like this.
It's a locust, a locust!
No, it's not.
It`s the 'Kogane Maru'.
That`s little Sosuke`s father`s ship, isn`t it?
Yeah.
Looks like a locust to me.
Sosuke, time to go, say goodbye to everyone.
Ok.
Everyone, farewell.
Farewell.
Don't get blown away by the wind!
Let`s go home.
Looks like the phones are down too.
The sea is rising, isn`t it?
Won`t those ships sink?
The ships in the sea aren`t afraid of storms.
Koichi`s ship is the same.
It`s a fish!
Risa, it`s a fish!
Put on you seat belt.
Miss Risa, you can't pass here.
There`s an evacuation order.
Evacuation?
There're old ladies at Sunflower Home that are staying overnight.
That's inland.
Since they`re on higher ground, they`ll be fine.
Anyway, I must go home.
You can't pass through here.
Go through the mountain.
Sosuke, let's go.
Ok.
Please, don't!
Oh no, a big wave is coming.
Miss Risa.
Don't be silly.
The fish are coming after us!
Sosuke, please put your seatbelt on!
We`re gonna speed up!
Why are the waves so huge?
A girl fell down there!
What?
She was on top of the fish!
Where?
The ocean`s getting higher.
Sosuke, where did you see the girl?
There, running on the backs of the fishes.
Fish?
Let's go, Sosuke!
Hang on, Sosuke.
We're almost home.
There is a girl over there.
It`s dangerous, come over here.
Sosuke, don't move.
Sosuke, you know her?
Ponyo?
Yeah!
I`m Ponyo!
It`s Ponyo!
Risa, Ponyo returned as a little girl.
Ponyo is over here!
Listen, Sosuke and Ponyo, no matter how happy and surprised you are to see each other, you must calm down now.
You understand?
Ok.
Take off the rain coat please Sosuke.
Ponyo didn't wear shoes right?
Hold this, ok?
I'll go get something to dry off.
Ponyo, this way.
This smells like Sosuke.
Ponyo
Gotcha.
You`ve gotta dry off now.
Ponyo's hair is a pretty shade of red, huh?
Your clothes aren`t wet, are they?
Ponyo used to be a fish, so she`s ok being wet.
Yup.
Ponyo like this!
Great, let's make some tea.
Ponyo, bring the lights here.
I wonder if the water will come out?
Yes it will!
It will!
It came out!
It`s because we have a water tank for our house.
I wonder if the gas will work?
All right!
All right!
Cause we have our own gas tank too!
Ok, please take your seats!
Ok!
Ponyo, sit here!
It will be just a little longer.
You have to set your stuff down.
Or you won`t be able to use your hands!
I have my feet!
Wow!
Oh, what`re you looking at?
Ponyo's feet are like hands!
Please, go ahead.
Here you go.
I`m gonna start!
That was delicious.
So, what should we do next?
Ponyo, thinks ham is good!
Ponyo likes to eat ham.
Then, let`s eat dinner!
But before that, we have to start the power generator.
If we connect the power, we can also talk to Koichi!
Koichi is my father.
Is he an evil magician?
No, he`s the captain of Kogane Maru!
What`s Ponyo`s father like?
He`s Fujimoto, he locked Ponyo up!
Ponyo, ran away!
What`s Ponyo`s mother like?
I LOOOVE mommy!
But she`s also very scary!
Just like Risa huh...
Ponyo, please bring the light.
Ara!
Are we out of gas?
Is it stuck?
It's stuck!
That thing over there is stuck!
All right!
It`s so bright!
Ponyo, you`re amazing!
Antenna, antenna!
Risa, did the ships sink?
There isn`t even one light out there, is there?
It`s NOISY!
Everything ok?
Looks like the radio is not working.
This is JA4 LL
JA4 LL
Can you hear me Koichi?
This is Risa and Sosuke and Ponyo.
Everyone is fine here.
We`re gonna eat dinner now!
Ham!
Did you put them in?
This is hot, so be careful.
Wait a little bit.
Gotta wait for 3 minutes!
Please close your eyes!
Not quite yet.
Ponyo, don't peek!
Ok!
You can open your eyes now!
En~joy your meal!
Wow.
Ham!
Ponyo, this is great, huh?
Oh!
Hot, hot, hot!
Risa, Ponyo fell asleep!
Ponyo came from far away, didn`t she?
Yeah, she must have.
Sosuke, look!
The storm has stopped.
Is it because Ponyo fall asleep?
Sosuke, look over there.
Something`s moving.
Somebody is over there.
I wonder if it`s Granny Yoshie and her friends?
It's gone.
It`s on the road to the mountain.
Sosuke, wait here with Ponyo.
I'm going over there.
I should be able to take the mountain road.
Sosuke, I'm going to Sunflower Home.
I'm going too.
Sosuke and Ponyo, please wait here.
I want to go, let`s just bring Ponyo along.
I am going with Risa!
Sosuke, right now, this house is a lighthouse in the storm bringing light and hope to those in dark.
So, someone must wait here.
Many strange things have happened, and I`m not sure why.
but there must be a reason.
I'm worried about those at Sunflower Home.
If Sosuke is protecting this place, then Risa will have support.
I`ll be fine.
I will definitely come home.
Absolutely?
Absolutely!
Make absolutely sure then.
I love you, Sosuke!
The moon is coming out!
We can see the lights from town!
Thank goodness!
We can navigate now.
That doesn`t look like a town we`ve been to before.
Did we reach America?
That's not a mountain or land either.
It's all boats!
They were gathered up in the ocean and turned into a mountain of boats!
This must be the ship graveyard!
The path to the other side has opened!
The engine`s stopped!
Fix it quickly!
Drop the anchor.
Aye.
What's coming up behind us?
I saw a goddess!
We`re moving!
We're saved!
It's a goddess.
Thanks be to the goddess!
Thanks be.
Go higher, higher.
Oh!
This is a proper barrier.
Where did she learn how to do this?
What's going on?
She became a human!
Hey, be careful!
What`re you doing?
It`s you guys!
Whoa, this is dangerous!
Please stop!
You guys!
Daddy is doing this for your sister.
It`s HER!
She`s coming!
Fujimoto
So you came huh?
What a beautiful ocean.
It`s so full with magic, as if I'm back to 'De Po Ji' big ocean.
Ponyo tasted human's blood.
ALL the elixir of life I collected is gone too!
Ponyo?
She was given a very nice name.
It's all my fault.
Ponyo misused her magical powers.
and opened a big hole on earth.
She doesn`t know what she`s doing!
Furthermore, she turned into a human and ran away to her human boyfriend`s home!
It this continues, the world will be destroyed!
Oh!
This is bad.
Meteors are starting to fall too!
The gravity of the planet...
Hush now.
Sosuke.
It's a boy named Sosuke huh.
All of you love your big sister.
My love, why don`t you just let Ponyo become a true human.
Huh?
There`s an old magic that says if there is a boy with a faithful heart, then Ponyo can turn into a real human, in exchange for her magical powers.
But if it fails,
Ponyo will turn into bubbles.
We are all born from bubbles, after all!
But, she's only 5.
She can't possibly make it.
Let`s be quiet and let the children rest.
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Ouch!
Ponyo!
Good morning!
Sosuke, good morning!
The ocean became calm.
Risa is gone, huh?
The roads are all flooded.
If only we had a boat now.
We have a boat!
We can't ride that.
We can ride it!
Wow, that's perfect!
Wow, the candle even got bigger!
We can ride it!
Yeah, just like the original one.
It`s just like the original one!
Hold that side, ok?
Ready?
Ready!
It's floating!
It`s dry!
No leaks at all!
Oh yeah!
We have to blow the water out of it.
If there`s water in the pipe, there will be water in that round thing.
It's like a rocket!
Good job, Ponyo!
Good job?
Yes, good job.
Good job!
Good job!
Good job...
It it hot?
It`s hot!
It`s hoooooot!
Wow, it`s lit!
It's lit!
It`s hot!
It`s hot!
It`s hot...! It`s hot, isn`t it?
It's moving!
Sosuke, good job!
Yeah!
Amazing, yeah?
Yeah.
Wow...
Sosuke is happy, yeah?
Yup.
Sosuke, it's burning, huh?
Yeah.
Sosuke, it's hot, right?
Ponyo, sit in front.
I`ll watch the fire.
Ok, you watch!
There's the road.
That`s the mountain road Risa took!
Risa isn`t there, is she?
Risa`ll be there, she promised she`ll definitely be there!
It's a Gogonasus.
There used to be over 10,000 of them in the sea.
Oh look, the shy 'Licosus'.
Beautiful.
Where are you going 'Licosus'?
Wow, it's huge!
It`s a 'Licosus'!
'Licosus'!
Hey!
There`s a boat!
They`re calling "Hey!" to us!
Heeeeeeeeey!
Whoa, are!
They must have spotted us.
Ponyo, you can blow it out now.
Hello.
Hello.
Hey, that`s a wonderful boat.
I was wondering who it was, and it turned out to be Risa`s little Sosuke.
It`s not little Sosuke.
It`s just Sosuke.
She`s Ponyo.
Ponyo, used to be a fish.
A fish?
Ponyo is a nice name, isn`t it?
Yup.
Mister, do you know where is Risa is?
Miss Risa?
Is she not with you?
She went out to Sunflower Home.
To Sunflower Home?
This is a baby.
Oh!
What is it?
Are you going to pour some?
Here, let me see it.
Thank you.
I`m going to have some!
What a delicious soup!
Risa made it.
It's for THE BABY!
I'm sorry, the baby can't drink soup yet!
But, if I drink this, then I'll make milk for the baby.
I used to drink Risa's milk too.
Ponyo, may I drink this soup?
Yes, please have some.
Thank you.
There are people over there!
It's like a parade!
Hey!
Is there anything we can help you with?
Thanks, but we're fine for now.
Then please be careful on your way up to the hotel.
Ok, will do.
There's so many people.
Thank goodness everyone is safe.
Ponyo, be careful with that!
Hold on.
Turn these into milk!
Wow!
For milk!
Ponyo ate everyone`s ham, though.
Thank you.
I`m sure there will be a lot of milk.
Sosuke, this isn`t much, but do you want it?
Yeah, Ponyo will make it bigger.
Thank you.
Be careful, ok?
Thanks again.
What is it?
Now, now, now!
Ponyo!
Wow!
Little Sosuke!
Where is Miss Risa?
She went to Sunflower Home!
I`m going after her.
Risa must have gotten past that wave!
Amazing!
Sosuke, give me a ride too!
Kumiko, we're in a hurry, so I`ll let you ride later.
Sosuke!
Hurry to the school!
Do your best!
"Attention, we're on duty so, we can only wish you all the best!"
Ponyo, we need a new candle.
It's ok, we still have the one we just received.
Ouch!
It`s still very hot.
Bye bye.
Ponyo, can you make this bigger too?
Yeah sure.
Ponyo, are you sleepy?
Ponyo?
Ponyo?
Ponyo!
It`s shallow!
My feet can touch the ground!
The road is coming out of the water.
Ah!
My boat...
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Wake up!
Sosuke.
Thank goodness.
I thought you were in danger!
Is Risa's car!
Ponyo!
Risa's car is over there!
Risa, Risa~
Sosuke, your boat.
There`s water coming out of your eyes.
Let`s look for Risa.
Ok.
Quick, look at this!
It`s so beautiful, just like an underwater palace!
Ladies, please gather round over here!
Ok, let's go.
It feels great to run!
I`m going first!
Please calm down everyone.
This is the moment of destiny.
Sosuke is coming here.
Oh, what's going on?
A love test!
?
My heart is pounding!
Me too!
Please calm down.
Everyone here is a witness.
Please wait a while longer.
Mr. Fujimoto, you're not going to do something bad to Sosuke and Ponyo right?
Of course not.
This is a harsh test for Ponyo, and then...
I think he's a gentleman.
What is Miss Risa doing?
Look, over there.
She's been chatting with Ponyo's mother for a loooooong time.
This must be hard for Miss Risa.
What they talking about, I wonder?
Let's call her.
Miss Risa, Risa...
Don't worry!
Sosuke and Ponyo will come for you!
Miss Risa must be worried!
Little Sosuke will be fine, he`s a good boy!
Thank you.
Everyone, let's cheer for them!
Ponyo, it's a tunnel.
Don`t be afraid of the dark.
I hate this place.
You can`t let go of my hand, ok?
Ok.
Ah!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo, you can`t die!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Wake up, Ponyo!
Shh... don`t wake her.
Sosuke, you did good getting this far!
Risa and the Grannies, everyone is waiting for you!
Risa is?
Come with me, bring Ponyo as well.
Ponyo needs to sleep, let`s go quietly.
Sosuke!
Don`t let that guy fool you!
He uses sweet talk but he takes everyone away.
Granny Toki!
Don't be fooled by him!
That`s why I said there isn`t any time!
Can`t you see that?
If the moon gets any closer something terrible will happen!
You can make a better excuse than that!
Ah~~~
Sosuke, come with me!
Only you can save this world!
I won't hurt you.
Ponyo.
Ack!
How could you treat your father this way?
Ponyo!
Sosuke, come on!
I said I won't hurt you!
You can do it!
Granny Toki`s got ya!
You guys!
Risa!
Sosuke.
Ponyo!
You must be Sosuke.
Hello.
Are you Ponyo's mother?
Yes I am.
You did a good job bringing Ponyo here.
Shh...
Thank you.
Sosuke, Ponyo broke a magic seal in order to become human.
In order to become human, she needs a man that understand Ponyo and is willing to accept her.
Do you know that she is a fish?
Yes.
She turned into a mermaid because she's tasted your blood.
Is that so?
She licked my wound and it turned her into a mermaid?
Knowing that she's half fish half human.
Are you ok with that?
Yes.
No matter if she's a fish Ponyo, a mermaid Ponyo or a human Ponyo, everyone loves her!
Ha ha...
Ponyo, please come here.
Ponyo, it seems that Sosuke has accepted you just as you are.
In order to become a human, you can`t use magic anymore.
Can you do that?
Yes.
When you return to surface, kiss this bubble once.
Ponyo will then transform into a 5 year old girl like you.
Ponyo, that`s wonderful, isn`t it?
Thank you, Ponyo's mama!
Everyone, the curse on the Earth is broken.
YAY!
That's great!
Risa, thank you.
You too, thank you, always.
Everyone, are you alright?
We'll bring the wheelchairs immediately!
That`s ok, we can walk.
This is your ship.
Thank you!
I`m sorry for everything.
May I shake your hand?
I am entrusting Ponyo to you.
It`s Koichi's ship!
Koichi!
Hey!
Over here!
Ah!
It`s Risa!
Sosuke`s there too!
Ponyo, that`s Koichi`s ship!
Ah!
Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo, the fish child she came from the big blue sea!
Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo, got bigger and turned into a little girl!
Tip tap Tip tap, Stomp, Stomp said legs would be great, and set out on a journey
Niigi niigi, Boom, Boo-oom said hands would be great, but perhaps not!
She set out with a boy and risked her heart
Paku Paku Chyugyu!
Paaku Paaku Chyuugyu!
I love that child more and more!
Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo, the fish child she came from the big blue sea!
Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo got bigger and turned into a little girl!
-The End-
Shh!
Sosuke, come right back up, ok?
Ok!
Huh?
A goldfish!
Can't get it out.
That was weird.
Ow!
It looks kind of dead.
It licked me!
It's alive!
Sosuke, we'll be late!
- mom, a goldfish!
Sosuke!
This wind is crazy.
Sosuke, I'm starting the car now!
Well?
Have you found my daughter?
What?
She was captured by a human?
A boy!
This is very bad.
Is it already dead?
You are alive!
Sosuke, I have a job, you know!
Look, mom, I found a goldfish!
- A goldfish?
- It was right down by the rocks.
- Yeah?
Hm?
I don't know who you are,
But we don't use weed killer around here.
Hm?
What?
This is not weed killer.
This is the purest ocean water,
And it keeps me from drying out on land.
Whatever.
As long as it's not weed killer.
- Excuse us.
- please wait.
Uh-oh.
This is bad.
This is very bad.
Wow.
That Guy was a freak show.
But don't you call people "freak show."
We never judge others by their looks.
I know, mom.
I don't.
Oh.
Another experiment for school?
- Mm-hm.
- Your teacher doesn't really like show and tell.
I think it'll be fine.
Don't worry, I'll take good care of you.
Huh!
She sure is pretty.
There's a ship headed for dry dock.
Hurry up.
eat your breakfast.
I wonder if she would eat this.
want some?
Hey!
My cut is all gone!
Mom, I think I'll call her Ponyo.
- Mmm?
- She came to me.
She might be magic.
I saved her.
She's my responsibility now.
Want ham instead?
Mom, Ponyo really likes to eat ham.
So she thinks she's human?
Ouch!
Whoa!
Turn!
Humans are disgusting!
Come on, Lisa, hurry!
all this waste, filth.
morning, shima-san!
Ponyo, look.
You can see our house.
- Ask about the fish.
- I will.
- Love you, Sosuke.
- goodbye.
Morning!
Seems like I'm always late.
- Can you get me another wheelchair?
- sure.
- Good morning, Sosuke.
- Excuse me.
- I'm in a big hurry, Yoshie.
- Is that so?
- And me, Sosuke?
- Not now, Toki.
I'm concentrating.
Ah...
Maybe the teacher will get mad.
I got it.
You'll be safe here, Ponyo.
I'll be back soon.
Hm.
I wonder if there are any cats around here.
That should do it, Ponyo.
Stay put.
I'll be right back.
- See you later.
- Hello there, Toshi.
I'll call if her cough gets worse, but she looks fine.
- You good, little sweetie?
- Oh, thank you.
Good.
- Bye-bye.
- Good morning, sensei.
- good morning, Sosuke.
- hi, Sosuke.
- Sosuke!
- Kumiko!
Look at me!
My mother made me a new dress.
- Isn't it pretty?
- Hm...
Hey, Sosuke, let's go play.
Can't now.
I'm busy.
You're not busy.
You're five.
- I am too!
I have a job.
- You're so weird.
Yeah.
Hm!
Oh!
Ponyo?
Ponyo!
- Sosuke!
- Oh, Kumiko.
- What is that?
There are rules about bringing things to school for a reason.
I know.
This isn't school.
These bushes are on the senior center property.
Let me see!
- Oh, a goldfish?
- She's not just a goldfish.
She's Ponyo.
Ponyo?
Let's see!
- ok, but don't tell she's here.
- I won't.
The rules are:
Look but don't touch.
Look at her.
Isn't she pretty?
That's the most boring goldfish
I've ever seen in my entire life.
That one was Kumiko's fault.
You should never judge others by their looks.
Let's get you some more water.
Ponyo!
Ah!
that was my fault.
there it comes again.
I hear old Sosuke's voice.
But I know our boy is in school right now.
so it must be only in my head.
Look, Yoshie.
I'm right over here.
Oh, that's a relief.
I haven't lost my mind quite yet.
Are you ready to see my big surprise?
- What is it?
- I'll show you.
But first, guess what color she is.
- Hm...
She...
She's red!
- Red!
That's right!
- How did you both guess that?
- come on, show us!
Ok.
- Well, look!
- Very pretty.
Her name is Ponyo.
She likes to eat ham.
- And she can do magic!
I got a cut on my thumb,
And it went away because she licked it.
oh!
Maybe she could use some of her magic to fix my hips and back.
I'd let a fish lick me
If it'd get me out of this wheelchair.
Well, I don't know about all that licking.
- I'd have to ask Ponyo...
- Let me have a look in that green pail.
Yes, Toki-san.
it has a real face on it!
Hurry up!
Put it back in the ocean.
Don't you realize it'll cause a tsunami?
Oh, you.
It's always tsunami, day and night.
Fish with faces who come out of the sea cause tsunamis.
that's what they always say.
tsunami!
Tsunami!
It's here!
Ah!
Oh!
Sosuke, put her back in the ocean where she belongs!
Toki, what's the matter?
I'm soaking wet.
Look at my clothes!
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Come back here and apologize!
Don't worry, Ponyo.
No matter what, I will protect you.
I promise.
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Ponyo!
Ponyo.
Sosuke.
Ponyo loves Sosuke!
I will love you, too.
- Ponyo loves Sosuke!
Ponyo?
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ah!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
- Ponyo!
- Sosuke!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Listen, Sosuke, you know, this could be for the best.
I know you tried, but Ponyo is a fish.
she wasn't meant to live in a bucket.
The ocean is home to her.
Anyway, let's get home.
Hopefully, that spritzing weirdo is gone.
Whoo!
Can I have a lick?
Hurry, it's starting to melt.
Dad's favorite.
Me, too!
I'm really sorry, Sosuke.
But dad is finally coming home tonight.
you can tell him all about Ponyo.
- No more ocean today, ok?
- mm-hm.
- Sosuke?
Sosuke?
Time to come in now.
Maybe if I leave the pail,
Ponyo will know where we live when she comes back.
Do that.
I think that's a lovely thing to do for Ponyo.
Mm-hm.
Sosuke, can you get that?
- It must be your dad.
Hello?
Yep.
She's fine.
- are you at the dock?
- I caught a second run,
So I have to take it.
I won't be home tonight.
I'll signal you when we pass.
Can you help me out with mom?
No, you should tell her.
hi, honey.
Uh-huh.
What?
!
Too many in a row, Koichi!
Let someone else take it!
Go ahead, abandon your wife and child
Up here on a cliff all alone.
Oh, jerk!
Uh!
Come on, Sosuke.
Let's get out of here.
What if Ponyo comes back?
Mm!
Ah!
There's dad.
Turn off the lights, mom.
- Don't you wanna signal him?
- Mm-mm.
Hey, my son is working the signal all by himself!
- Can you believe that?
- Your wife must be pretty mad.
s...
O...
R R...
Y.
- Dad says he's very sorry.
- B-u-g...
- o-f-f.
- B... b-u-g o-f-f.
B-u-g o-f-f.
Mom, dad says he loves you.
he says, "lots and lots."
Wow!
Nice, dad!
don't cry, mom.
I know dad breaks his promises sometimes.
But he does his best for us.
I promised Ponyo I'd take care of her.
Then I lost her.
I wonder if she's crying now.
- Ah!
- You are so good!
Mmm!
%%happyas canbe% %
- Mm!
Ah!
- Don't you worry, Sosuke.
You did your best and Ponyo will be just fine.
- Ok.
I say we start with dessert and go backwards!
It's been a backwards kind of day.
it's not your fault.
I exposed you to the magic and you're too young to understand.
I have to keep the sea in balance.
It's a great responsibility.
You must promise me something:
You will never go back to the surface.
Yes?
Come on, now.
Eat, Brunhilde.
I want ham!
Ham!
You ate their food.
What else did you do?
Did you taste blood, Brunhilde?
My name is not Brunhilde.
It's Ponyo.
- Ponyo?
- Ponyo!
Ponyo loves Sosuke!
I will be a human, too!
Human?
What do you know about humans, Brunhilde?
They spoil the sea.
they treat your home like their empty, black souls.
I was once, long ago, a human myself.
I had to leave that all behind to serve the earth.
Hands!
I want hands!
I don't want these flippers anymore!
I want feet, like Sosuke!
- That's enough!
-
ah!
Oh!
I made hands!
I made feet, too!
Ha!
- Yes!
- What?
No, no!
Don't tell me.
You have tasted human blood!
I'm going to Sosuke!
Enough!
You're making a terrible mistake!
Don't do it!
Stop it.
Stop it!
Stop changing now.
Revert.
Revert.
Revert!
Revert!
- revert!
stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it!
- I need more power!
let me out!
Let me out!
let me out!
I want to see Sosuke!
Let me go!
- Let me out!
- You can't be human and magic at the same time, sweetheart.
Be still, be still, be still, be still, be still.
she's already so powerful.
Just like her mother.
if you could only remain innocent and pure forever.
I don't have the power to hold her for very long.
I need to ask for her mother's help now.
I...
What?
Huh!
They're headed for my elixirs.
Shoo!
Shoo!
Get out of here!
Shoo!
That was too close.
I must be careful not to upset the balance of nature.
Calm.
I must remain calm.
When I think of leaving her again, my heart won't stop pounding.
Right, then.
Focus on work.
This batch should be ready.
At least there aren't leaks down here.
This door still doesn't fit right.
I'll fix that next.
If even one living creature got in here...
Ah, yes.
I can feel the power of the ocean
In the furthest reaches of my DNA.
When this well is full,
Then the age of the ocean will begin again.
An explosion of life to match the Cambrian age.
An end to the era of those abominable humans.
this cursed door!
Teeth!
Let's find Sosuke!
I'm free!
- Waterspout!
- Captain, look over there!
- it must be a tsunami!
- turn the ship into the wave!
Look!
What is that?
captain, all our instruments just went dead!
It's a little girl.
Looks like she's about Sosuke's age.
- Thanks again.
- Sure.
See you tomorrow.
It's raining so hard, Sosuke.
I'll call your mother and have her pick you up.
That's all right.
I'll take the shortcut.
Goodbye, sensei.
Bye, Sosuke.
Be careful out there.
Sosuke, I'm sorry.
The door didn't open, right?
The power just went out.
- Everything ok at school?
- Mm-hm.
Lisa, if your shift's over, you can go home.
Sure you don't need my help?
don't worry.
We'll be fine.
A little rain Storm keeps the seniors entertained.
If I were you, I'd get out of here while you still can.
Wait here, sweetie.
I'll be right back.
Ok.
Hi, Yoshie.
Oh, Sosuke.
Is that you?
It's so dark I can barely see.
Here, Yoshie.
I made this for you.
Oh!
What do we have here?
There's one for you, too, Noriko.
Thank you, Sosuke.
I can't see a thing.
I don't know why we're still here.
It's just a little rain.
I wanna go back to my own house.
There we go.
That's more like it.
Let's see.
Your goldfish!
I bet the lights came back on because Sosuke's here.
They're now calling the bizarre event a micro-typhoon.
Ship...
Ah, this stupid TV.
Nobody understands weather anymore.
Might as well look at shadows and listen to crickets.
You should take your mother home now.
With our lucky goldfish to keep us company,
- We'll be just fine.
- Ok.
...Landslides, flooding and tidal surges.
People trying to evacuate...
This is for you, Toki.
I can't tell.
What is it?
It's wrinkled.
It goes like this.
I got it.
It's a grasshopper.
No, it's the Koganei maru.
That's the name of your father's ship, isn't it Sosuke?
- Mm-hm.
- Now, it looks like a party hat.
Sosuke, we've gotta get on the road.
Let's hurry now and say goodbye.
Ok.
Ladies, good evening.
good evening, Mr. Sosuke.
Be careful the wind doesn't blow you away.
Let's go.
Slide in.
They said the phones are out, too.
The ocean looks all puffed up.
You think the Storm could sink the ships?
No.
Ships can handle a Storm.
They go out to sea.
That's what your father's doing right now.
I saw a fish!
Did you see that, mom?
Put your seatbelt on!
Hold on, Lisa!
You can't cross here!
We've just gotten word.
They're gonna evacuate this side.
It's not mandatory.
There are some people up at the senior center.
You should get them out.
They're fine.
They're on the leeward side.
You need to go back and seek shelter there.
Ok.
But right now, I need to get home.
- Well, you can't cross here.
- Take the mountain road.
- Hold on, kiddo.
- Mm!
No!
Stop!
Don't do it!
Watch out!
Here it comes!
Lisa, you gotta get out of here!
- hold on.
The fish are following us now!
turn around.
Sit down.
Ah!
Ah!
Try to hang on to something!
That wave is just after us.
- Mom, the little girl just fell in!
- What?
She was running on a fish and she fell!
Where?
I've never seen the ocean like this.
Sosuke, where did you see a little girl?
She was out there, running on top of a huge fish!
that's impossible.
Sosuke, we have to go!
It's ok.
There was no little girl out there.
We're almost home.
There is a little girl.
Come over here!
We'll help you!
Come here!
Stay there, Sosuke.
What?
Sosuke, do you know her?
- Ponyo?
- Mm-hm!
It's me, Ponyo!
- It is you!
Mom!
Ponyo came back and she's a little girl now!
Who?
I found Sosuke!
All right.
Sosuke, Ponyo, life is mysterious and amazing.
But we have work to do now.
And I need both of you to stay calm.
Me, too.
You can take off your rain coat now, Sosuke.
I've got a job for you, Ponyo.
Will you hold the light?
- Huh?
- Stay here, and I'll go get a towel.
- Here, this way!
- smells like you in here!
- Ow!
- Ponyo!
- Oof!
- There, got ya.
Now, let's rub you down and dry you off.
Look at that pretty red hair.
It's almost dry.
- Huh!
- Huh?
and your clothes are dry.
That's because Ponyo was a fish, mom.
- Water can't make her wet.
- Mm-hm.
I really like this thing.
So let's calm ourselves down with a hot drink.
Ponyo, will you hold the light for me?
- coming!
- Ok.
- Who wants to bet the water is working?
- I do!
I do!
- Water!
- Water!
We have our own water tank outside in the yard.
And who thinks the stove will light?
And light!
All right.
- All right!
- We have our own propane tank.
- Ok.
Let's all sit at the table.
- ok!
Ponyo, the table's over here.
Now, sit down like this.
Now, put your stuff down.
- You need to use your hands.
- No, I'll use feet!
Look at that!
Uh...
What are you guys doing?
Look at her feet.
They're just like hands.
here you go.
It's hot.
This is the best.
Mm!
Hm... that hit the spot.
So, what would the two of you like to do now?
Ponyo wants ham!
All she thinks about is ham, mom.
I better make some dinner then.
First, we should start the generator so we can call Koichi.
That's my dad.
We need power to talk to him on the radio.
He's out at sea right now, but he'll be fine.
- Is he a naval wizard?
- No, of course not.
he's the captain of a ship.
So, Ponyo, what's your dad like?
He hates humans!
He keeps me in a bubble!
- Huh?
- So I swam away from home.
Huh?
So, what's your mother like then?
She's big and beautiful!
- But she can be very scary.
- Just like my mom.
Ponyo, over here, please.
Mm!
Looks like something must have gone wrong with the fuel line.
- Maybe it's clogged.
- It's clogged.
It's clogged over there.
- It's on!
- It's light now!
Yeah!
Ponyo, you're amazing.
- Antenna, antenna!
- Hey, mom.
Did all the ships out there sink?
I don't see any lights out there.
All right.
- Too loud!
- What's wrong?
I can't get any reception.
That's really weird.
Transmitting from JA4LL.
JA4LL.
come in, Koichi.
This is Lisa, Sosuke and Ponyo.
We wanted you to know that we're all doing fine.
I'm taking care of everyone, dad!
Ham!
Got your noodles all ready?
Be careful.
It's really hot.
You have to wait a little bit.
It takes three minutes.
ok, close your eyes.
Keep 'em shut.
- Ponyo, uh!
No peeking!
Get ready to look now.
- Abracadabra!
mm!
- It's ham!
- Careful, it's hot.
Oh!
hot, hot, hot!
Mm...
Mom, Ponyo fell asleep.
Do you think Ponyo came from far, far away?
Yeah, I do.
look outside.
It looks like the waves have calmed down.
Maybe because Ponyo fell asleep.
Do you see that light?
It's moving.
There must be somebody still over there.
That's the senior center.
- I don't see it now.
- Did they evacuate?
I'm worried about the seniors.
Sosuke, stay with Ponyo, ok?
I've gotta go help them.
I can get there if I take the mountain road.
Sosuke, I should go to the senior center.
I'm coming, too.
I'd feel better if you stay up here.
But why can't I come?
We'll wake up Ponyo and take her with us.
I wanna go with you!
Sosuke, right now, our house is a beacon in the Storm.
Our light can be seen by the town and by the ships,
And every place else is dark.
You know I need to help the old people.
So I'm going to leave you here in charge.
You'll do the right thing.
I know it.
you have to be the man of the house tonight.
Let Ponyo sleep, wait for me.
You're only five, but you're very smart.
Sometimes, we take a leap.
Be brave.
You can do it, and I'll be back.
Promise?
- I promise.
- You promised.
I love you, Sosuke.
Captain, I can see the lights of a city up ahead.
Finally, we can get our bearings again.
We're someplace I've never seen before.
did the Storm blow us to china?
What mountains are those?
I have no idea where we are.
that is a huge wall of water.
Why is the Moon so close?
Hm...
That's no mountain we're looking at.
And that's no town, either.
Those lights are ships.
the Moon is so close,
Its gravity is forcing the ocean to rise.
- What's going on here?
- The engine stopped!
- Try to hold her steady.
- Arai, drop the sea anchor.
- Yes, sir.
Something's coming this way.
I just saw the goddess of mercy!
Ah!
- The engine's working.
- It was her.
So you saw her, too?
I thought maybe I was hallucinating.
Thank you for protecting us...
- Higher, higher.
Huh?
!
that has a powerful spell on it.
How has she learned to do something like that?
What?
I can't believe it!
No!
She's turned into a human!
Whoa!
Hold still!
- You...
What are you doing?
- hold still!
Girls!
Girls...
Whoa!
stop, stop!
Please!
Stop now!
No!
Stop!
Ah!
respect your father!
This was serious.
I'm trying to save your sister.
At last, she has finally come.
- Fujimoto.
- It's been a long time, my love.
Look at my ocean.
Something has changed.
It's like my ancient Devonian sea, full of magic and power.
You're going to be very upset, my dear.
Ponyo got into my elixirs, and she has tasted human blood.
Ponyo?
What a lovely name.
Hm.
Of course, it's all my fault, really.
She's become so powerful
That she's opened a hole in the fabric of reality.
She's too young to understand, and she wouldn't listen to me.
She's now a little girl.
And she loves a little boy.
And the whole world is out of balance.
Please, please, remove the human in her, or the planet is doomed.
Huh?
Already the earth is pulling satellites from the Sky.
And the Moon pulls the sea closer...
Be calm, dear.
Sosuke.
The boy's name is Sosuke.
We love your sister, and we all want her to be happy.
Listen, my darling, why don't we let Ponyo become human for good?
We must test the boy.
If Sosuke's love is true,
Ponyo will be permanently transformed
And the balance of nature will be restored.
But if his love isn't real, then Ponyo will turn into sea foam.
True.
That is where we all originated, my darling.
The boy is so young, so innocent.
- What does...?
- Shh.
let them sleep.
They'll need their rest.
Sosuke!
- Sosuke!
Ponyo, you ok?
Good morning, Sosuke.
Huh?
Look at that.
The ocean is at our door.
How come your mom's not here?
The water's so high.
She must be stuck.
Too bad we don't have a boat.
There's a boat, right there!
- It's a little small.
- No, it's not.
Ah!
Uh!
Huh?
Thank you!
Wow!
You even made the candle bigger.
- We can fit!
- This is fantastic.
- Fantastic!
- You take that end, please.
Ok!
- Ready?
- Let's go!
whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Ah!
It actually floats!
Doesn't look like it has any leaks.
Now, we have to fill the boiler.
The water gets sucked in through this pipe.
Then it gets heated up here in this round thing.
well, that worked.
Looks like everything's shipshape.
- Shipshape!
- Yep.
- Shipshape!
- shipshape.
Shipshape!
Shipshape!
Shipshape!
Shipshape!
Shipshape!
What's that?
- Ow!
- Ow!
- Look at that!
- It's burning.
It's hot!
It's hot!
It's hot!
It's hot!
- Is it working?
- Hm...
It's working!
Sosuke, we're shipshape, right?
- Yep.
- This is a good boat.
Mm-hm.
Ah!
- Hey, Sosuke!
Look at me!
- Mm-hm.
- Hey, this is even more fun!
- Mm-hm.
that thing makes my nose hot.
Ponyo, you be the boat's lookout.
- And I'll do the steering, ok?
- Mm-hm.
I'm the lookout!
- There's the road.
- That's the road my mom took last night.
- I don't see her anywhere.
- We'll see her.
She promised me she'd come back.
Those are ancient fish.
They lived during the Devonian age.
I know that one.
It's Bothriocephalus.
- And that one is...
- Dipnorhynchus.
Dipnorhynchus!
Wow!
That one's really huge!
- That's Devonynchus!
- Devonynchus!
ahoy!
ahoy!
- ahoy...
- Whoa, there's a boat!
ahoy!
I'm gonna say that.
Ahoy!
Ow!
Whoa, that's fast!
- Hey!
- I'm getting the hang of this.
Get ready to stop, Ponyo.
- Hello, you two.
- Hello.
Hey, that is quite a boat you got there.
I've seen you before.
You're Lisa's little boy, aren't you?
He's not a little boy.
He's Sosuke!
She's Ponyo.
And I used to be a fish.
Is that right?
I like your name, Ponyo.
It's cute.
Mm-hm.
By the way, have you seen my mom?
Your mother?
Why isn't your mother with you?
- She went to the senior center.
- Wow, way up there?
My baby likes you.
- oh, sweetheart.
Oh, is that for us?
Can I have the cup?
Well, thank you.
It smells good.
- wow, that's good soup.
Thanks.
- My mom made it from scratch.
- The soup's for him!
Oh, I'm sorry.
He's a little too young.
He can only drink milk at this age.
But I could eat the soup instead,
And it would help me to make milk for him.
Huh?
Yeah, my mom made milk for me, too.
Ponyo, what do you say?
Is it all right if I eat the soup?
- That's fine.
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- huh?
People from the town!
It's just like a parade!
Ahoy!
Are any of you in need of assistance at this time?
We're all good here!
But thanks for checking on us, captain!
we are taking everyone to the mountain peak hotel!
For your safety, we request that you follow us!
Aye, aye!
Will do!
- looks like the whole town is here.
- I don't see your mom.
- I hope she's ok.
- Ponyo, time for us to cast off.
Hold on a second.
- Here, have some milk.
- Oh.
Uh...
It's for milk.
She already ate all the ham off those sandwiches.
Thank you.
That's very generous of you, Ponyo.
Sosuke, here.
I brought you the biggest candle I have.
Thanks.
Ponyo will make it bigger.
- See you later.
- Take care.
Be careful.
- oh!
What's the matter?
shh, shh, shh.
You have a cold.
Ponyo!
hey, are you guys ok?
hey, Sosuke.
- What are you doing out here?
- Sosuke, where's your mother?
she went to the senior center last night!
We're on our way to find her!
You know, I still can't believe Lisa beat that wave.
- That's Lisa.
- Sosuke, can I ride with you?
I can't.
I'm busy.
I have a job to do now.
check the park.
The seniors should be there by now.
- good luck, kid!
- you'll find her!
We'll send a boat for the seniors
As soon as we drop this group off!
- Good luck, captain!
Ponyo, our candle is just about out.
We'll be ok.
The fisherman gave me another one.
Ow!
It's still pretty hot.
Bye-bye.
Here, Ponyo.
Can you make this bigger?
All right.
Hey, are you ok?
Hm?
- Ponyo.
- Hm?
Ponyo.
Ponyo!
Oh, good.
I can walk from here.
There's the road.
it's shrinking!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo, wake up!
Sosuke.
You scared me.
Don't turn into a fish again.
I'd miss you.
My mom's car!
Ponyo, come on!
She might be there!
Hey, mom!
Mom!
Mommy!
Mommy!
Mom!
Mommy!
Mom!
Mom!
Here, I've got your boat.
There's water coming from your eyes.
- Let's go find your mom.
- Mm-hm.
- it's so beautiful!
- You forgot your cane!
Look, here comes a whale again!
I think he sees us.
The other side is nice, isn't it?
- And my knees don't hurt.
- This is the other side?
- Where do you think we are, Las Vegas?
- It's like a dream.
- Ladies, can we gather around, please?
- coming!
- Why don't we run?
Come on!
- It's so nice to run.
- Beat you there!
Winner!
Everyone, quiet, please.
The time has come for you to bear witness
To a sacred test of love.
- Oh, how exciting!
- Are they too young for this?
- Are we too old?
- When are they coming?
Please, ladies, the children are coming now.
And remember, this is a very important moment.
a crucial moment.
Fujimoto, you won't let any harm
Come to Sosuke or Ponyo, will you?
it's not in his nature.
Of course I wouldn't.
My hope is Ponyo will stay asleep.
Excuse me.
Do you think we can trust him?
I wonder what Lisa is thinking.
She's with that woman,
And they've been talking all night and day.
Poor Lisa.
Must be hard on her.
I wish we could hear what they're talking about.
Oh, why don't we just ask.
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
We wanna know what you're talking about!
Come tell us!
- My dear!
- Lisa!
What's going on?
Lisa, are you sure you can trust that man?
It's so exciting.
Tell us what's going to happen next.
Whatever happens, I'm just glad you're all here for this.
- It's going to be fine.
I think I've been here before.
Ponyo?
Don't like this place.
Don't let go of my hand.
Mm...
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Please don't die!
Ponyo!
- Ponyo, wake up!
- Shh.
Be careful not to wake her.
It's good to meet you, Sosuke.
We've all been waiting for you.

Won't you come with me and join them, Sosuke?
Ponyo, too.

I promise I'm not going to take Ponyo away from you.
- We have to go now.

Sosuke, don't listen to that wacko!
He tricked all the others into going with him,
But he couldn't fool me!
Toki!
Did you hear me?
Nobody fools me!
There is so little time!
My choice has to be made!
If the Moon comes any closer...
Can't you see it?
The world is out of balance!
We will all be underwater!
That's the best excuse you can come up with?
A falling Moon?
- humans!
- Sosuke, come to me!
Sosuke, please listen.
You have to trust me.
You're the only one who can save the planet.
Do it now.
Do it!
Ponyo!

Ponyo!
Sosuke, come on!
Bring them to me!
Faster!
Jump for it!
Now what?
- Mama!
- Sosuke.
Ponyo!
You don't have to swim.
I don't know why we're here.
- So this is Sosuke.
- How do you do?
- Are you Ponyo's mother?
- Yes.
You brought my daughter safely here.
shh!
thank you.
Sosuke, Ponyo opened a magic well
Because she wants very much to be human, to become a real girl.
She needs you to accept and love her as she truly is.
You know that Ponyo was a fish, don't you?
Mm-hm.
and you know her as a human.
- Your drop of blood did that.
- Oh, that's it!
I cut my thumb.
Then Ponyo licked it and made it better.
So that's how she changed into a human.
Could you love her if she moved between two worlds?
Mm-hm.
I love all the Ponyos.
It's a big responsibility, but I really love her.
- ooh!
Ponyo, come here, please.
Ponyo, Sosuke has promised to accept you as you are.
To become human, you must choose to abandon magic.
- Can you do that?
- Mm-hm.
Kiss the bubble, child, when you return to land,
And Ponyo will become a girl, growing up just like you.
I accept, Ponyo.
Thank you very much, Ponyo's mother.
Everyone, the balance of nature is restored.
- Life begins again.
I'm so proud!
My Sosuke.
- Good luck, Lisa.
- Thank you.
I'll take care of her.
There you are!
Are you all right?
Wait, let me get your wheelchairs!
Don't bother, shima-san.
We like to walk.
Life begins again.
This is yours, I believe.
- Thank you.
- Try to remember me kindly.
If you will.
May I?
Take care of Ponyo.

Although I don't know you,
But please don't spray pesticide here.
Oh, this is not pesticide.
This is deep sea water to avoid dehydration.
Good, as long as it's not poisonous.
Excuse me.
Oh no, it's getting worse.
What a strange guy.
Don't be mean, Sosuke.
Don't judge a book by it's cover.
I won't.
Bringing it to the kindergarten?

No problem, I'll protect it.
So cute.
Ship is leaving.
Sosuke, eat this.

Risa, Ponyo likes to eat ham.
Just like you.

That's great.
Isn't that little Sosuke voice?
Sosuke should be in the kindergarten.

That's why she must return to the sea.
That Mr. Pesticide is suspicious.
Give me a bite.
Come, let me try
Quite tasty.
Cheer up a bit.
Today is the day Koichi return.

Human took lives from sea.

It's too much for all of you.
(sho... sho...)
No way...
Danger danger...
Barrier to stop crabs is failing.
Almost disrupt the balance of nature.
Cool down, cool down.
I get a bad feeling everytime when going to meet 'that person'.
Oh no, oh no.
Yet to finish cleaning up.
It doesn't get weak here. (the barrier)
So hard to open it.
Need to come and fix it later.
Can't let even one sea creature enter here.
Else will be big trouble.
Well-done.
Power of sea spreading to every corner.
When this well filled up.
The time of the sea will arrive.

All the sweet talk.
He took everyone away.
Is granny.
Don't get tricked.
There's no time.
Don't you want to meet them.
Can't let the moon get any closer...
Something terrible will happen.
You need a better excuse.
Ah~~~
Sosuke, come with me.
Only you can save this world.
I won't hurt you.
Ponyo.
How could you treat your father this way.
Ponyo.
Sosuke, come here quickly.
I said I won't hurt you.
Keep going.
How dare you.
Watch out!
Risa Sosuke Ponyo
You must be Sosuke.
Hello.
You're Ponyo's mother?
Yes I am.
You finally brought Ponyo here.
Shh...
Thank you.
Sosuke.
Ponyo have broken the seal in order to become a human.
Wanted to become a human.
Require a man that understand Ponyo and willing to accept her.
You know she's a fish.
Yes.
She turn into a mermaid because she've tasted your blood.
Is that so?
Knowing that she's half fish half human.
Are you ok with that?
Yes.
No matter she's a fish, a mermaid or a human, I still like (love) her.
Come here Ponyo.
Ponyo.
Looks like Sosuke have accepted you.
You must abandon your magic power in order to become a human.
Can you do that?
Yes.
When you return to surface, kiss this bubble once.
Ponyo will then transform into a 5 year old girl like you.
Ponyo That's too wonderful.
Thank You.
Ponyo's mama.
Everyone, the curse is broken.
That's great!
Risa, thank you.
You too, thank you, all the while.
Everyone are fine.
We'll bring the wheelchair immediately.
We can walk.
This is your ship.
Thank you.
Really sorry, can you shake our hand.
I'll entrust Ponyo to you.
Is Koichi's ship
Koichi.
Risa, Sosuke is here too.
Risa, is Koichi's ship.
-FIN-
PONYO ON THE CLIFF
Sosuke, come right back up, OK?
OK!
It's a goldfish!
I can't get it out.
That was weird.
It looks kind of dead.
It licked me!
It's alive!
Sosuke, we have to go!
- Lisa, a goldfish!
- Sosuke!
This wind is crazy.
Sosuke, I'm starting the car now!
Have you found her?
What?
She was captured by a human?
This is bad.
This is very bad.
Is it already dead?
It's alive!
Sosuke.
- We're gonna be late!
- Lisa, the goldfish is alive!
- A goldfish?
- It was right down by the rocks.
Yeah?
I don't know who you are, but please don't spray pesticide around here!
Oh, no.
This is not pesticide.
I brought this water from deep sea to prevent extreme dry skin...
Whatever.
As long as it's not pesticide.
Excuse us.
This is bad.
This is very bad.
That guy was a freak show.
Just kidding.
Never say such a thing, Sosuke.
- We never judge others by their looks.
- I don't say such things.
- Are you taking that to pre-school?
- Yeah.
- Your teachers don't tell you not to?
- Don't worry, I'll take care of you.
She's cute.
A ship must be coming in today.
Sosuke, eat your breakfast.
I wonder if she would eat this.
Want some?
Hey!
My cut is all gone!
Lisa, I think I'll call her Ponyo.
She came to me.
Besides, she might be magic.
Ponyo licked my cut and it healed right away.
Do you wanna eat ham?
Lisa, Ponyo really likes to eat ham.
Just like me.
- Oh, dear...
Oh, dear...
- Come on, Lisa, hurry!
Filthy.
It's so filthy!
Good morning!
Ponyo, look.
You can see our house.
- We'll park here.
OK?
- Yeah.
- Have a nice day.
- See you later.
Morning!
Sorry for being late!
- Get Noriko's wheelchair?
- Sure.
Good morning, Sosuke.
I'm busy right now, Yoshie.
I'll talk to you later.
- Oh, my...
- Sosuke, dear.
- Toki, I'll catch you later.
- My goodness...
I wonder if my teacher will say no.
I got it.
You'll wait here.
I'll be back soon.
I hope cats won't come around here.
Stay put.
I'll be right back.
See you later.
Hello there, Toshi.
She has a little fever, but she's active.
She should be OK.
- Right, sweetie?
- Oh, thank you.
Bye-bye.
- Good morning, Teacher.
- Good morning, Sosuke.
How are you, Sosuke?
- Sosuke!
- Kumiko!
Look!
Isn't this dress pretty?
My mom bought it for me.
Is that so?
- Hey, Sosuke, wanna go play?
- I can't.
I'm busy right now.
- What are you doing here?
- Like I said, I'm busy.
- You're acting weird, Sosuke.
- Yeah, weird.
Ponyo!
Sosuke!
- Oh, Kumiko.
- What is that?
You're not supposed to bring stuff to school.
These brushes are not school's.
They're on the senior center property, so it's OK.
Let me see!
Oh, a goldfish!
She's not just a goldfish.
She's Ponyo.
Ponyo?
I wanna see!
If I show her, you won't tell anyone?
No, I won't.
Look.
Isn't she cute?
She's weird.
She's fat, too.
My goldfish is cuter.
That one was Kumiko's fault.
You should Never judge others by their looks.
Let's get you some more water.
Ponyo!
I'm relieved.
That's strange...
I hear Sosuke's voice.
But he's supposed to be in school right now.
- So it must be only in my head.
- Look, Yoshie.
I'm right over here.
Oh, my...
Sosuke is here.
Do I have something nice?
- Yes, you do.
- Bingo!
All right then, what color is it?
- Red!
- Red!
That's right!
- How did you both guess that?
- Come on, show us!
OK.
- Pretty!
- Cute.
Her name is Ponyo.
She likes to eat ham.
And she can do magic!
A cut on my thumb disappeared because Ponyo licked it.
Maybe she could lick our legs.
I wish I could run fast, once again, like you, Sosuke.
Well, I'd have to ask Ponyo.
I can't speak for her.
- Let me take a look, too.
- Sure, Toki.
Oh, no!
It's a fish with a human face!
Hurry up!
Put it back in the ocean.
Don't you realize it'll cause a tsunami?
Here you go again, Toki, worrying about a tsunami.
When fish with faces come out to the beach, tsunamis will come.
That's what they always say.
Tsunami!
Tsunami is here!
Tsunami is here!
Tsunami...
- Toki, what's the matter?
- My clothes are all ruined!
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Come back here and apologize to Toki!
Don't worry, Ponyo.
No matter what, I will protect you.
Sosuke!
Ponyo!
Ponyo.
Sosuke.
Ponyo loves Sosuke!
- I will love you, too.
- Ponyo loves Sosuke!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Sosuke!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Listen, Sosuke, there's such a thing as destiny.
You can't change one's destiny no matter how tough it is.
I think Ponyo went back to the ocean because she was meant to live there.
Anyway, hopefully that pesticide guy is gone.
Can I have a lick?
Hurry, it's starting to melt.
It's yummy!
Come on.
Cheer up!
Koichi is finally coming home today.
He'll be disappointed if you are all bummed out.
Don't go down to the water anymore today.
OK.
Sosuke.
Time to come in now.
If I leave the pail here, Ponyo will know where we live when she comes back.
That's true.
Do that if you want to, Sosuke.
Yeah.
Sosuke, can you get that?
It must be Koichi.
Hello?
Yep.
It's me.
Yeah.
I'm doing fine.
I can't come home tonight.
Help me with the signal when I pass offshore.
OK.
I'll let you talk to Lisa.
Koichi?
Yeah.
What?
!
That's not fair...
Just say no!
Go ahead, abandon your wife and child up here on a cliff all alone.
I give up!
Whatever!
Come on, Sosuke.
Let's eat out tonight.
I wanna eat at home.
That's Koichi.
Lisa, it's Koichi's ship!
Turn off the lights!
That's Sosuke, what a genius!
He's only five years old!
Your wife must be pretty mad.
S...
O...
R...
R...
Y. Lisa, he's saying he's sorry.
B...
U...
G...
O...
F...
F...
B-U-G O-F-F.
B-U-G O-F-F.
Lisa, he says he loves you.
He says, "Lots and lots."
BUG OFF BUG OFF BUG OFF BUG OFF
Wow!
Isn't that pretty?
PRAYING FOR SAFE SAILING
THANKS
GOOD NIGHT
Don't cry, Lisa.
I won't cry, either.
So...
I promised Ponyo I'd protect her.
I wonder if she's crying now.
All right.
I'm gonna cheer up!
Happy as can be
Don't you worry, Sosuke.
You did your best and Ponyo will be just fine.
OK.
Now, let's eat dinner!
We'll finish Koichi's portion, too!
What have I done?
It was my fault that I had brought you to show you the work at the farm.
Have I not taught you over and over how the humans dirty up water and air?
Come on, now.
Eat.
Can't you hear me, Brunhilde?
I want ham!
Ham?
Where did you learn of such a horrifying thing!
Tell me, Brunhilde.
My name is not Brunhilde.
It's Ponyo.
P...
P...
Ponyo?
Ponyo!
Ponyo loves Sosuke!
I will be a human, too!
Human?
What's good about such a foolish, horrid species?
All they do is to take life out of the ocean.
I was once, long ago, a human myself.
You have no idea what it took to give up being human...
I want hands!
I don't want these flippers anymore!
- I want feet, like Sosuke!
- That's enough!
I made hands!
I made feet, too!
Yes!
Hooray!
Don't tell me you have licked human blood!
- I'm going to Sosuke!
- No!
The DNA contamination activated a congenital inferior factor!
Revert.
Revert.
Revert!
Revert!
Revert!
Revert!
There.
There.
There.
There.
Here we go!
Oh, no.
I don't have enough power!
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out!
Evil blood, calm down.
Be still, be still, be still, be still, be still.
She's already so powerful.
Just like her mother.
If you could only remain innocent and pure forever.
I don't have the power to hold her for very long.
I need to ask for her mother's help now.
I...
What?
Oh, no!
They're headed for my elixirs.
Shoo!
Shoo!
Get out of here!
That was too close.
The anti-crab barrier was loose.
I must be careful not to upset the balance of nature.
Calm.
I must remain calm.
When I think of meeting her again, my heart won't stop pounding.
Focus on work.
This batch is already ready.
The barrier is not loose in here, is it?
PANGEA 1907
This door still doesn't fit right.
I'll fix that next.
If even one living creature got in here...
Yes.
I can feel the power of the ocean in the furthest reaches of my DNA.
When this well is full, then the age of the ocean will begin again.
An explosion of life to match the Cambrian Age.
An end to the era of those abominable humans.
This cursed door!
Teeth!
Let's find Sosuke!
I'm free!
- Waterspout!
- Captain, look over there!
- It's a tsunami!
- Turn the ship into the wave!
Look!
What is that?
Captain, the radio and radar are both dead!
It's a little girl.
Looks like she's about Sosuke's age.
- Thanks again.
- Sure.
Take care.
Why don't you wait here, Sosuke?
I'll stay with you.
I'll take the shortcut, so I'll be OK.
Goodbye, Teacher.
Goodbye.
Be careful!
Sosuke, I'm sorry.
The door didn't open, right?
The power just went out.
- Everything OK at school?
- Yeah.
Lisa, we'll be fine.
So why don't you go home?
But Ms. Kaneko is not here yet.
It'll be fine.
She must be running a little late.
We'll have to spend the night anyway.
If I were you, I'd get out of here while you still can.
- Sosuke, wait here for a while.
- OK.
Hi, Yoshie.
Oh, Sosuke.
Is that you?
- It's so dark I could barely see.
- Here.
This is for you.
- Let's see...
What is it?
- There's one for you, too, Noriko.
Thank you.
It's pitch dark.
I can't see a thing.
I can't believe the power is down from such little rain.
That's why I didn't want a sleepover.
The power's back on!
Good!
Nice and bright.
It's a goldfish!
I bet the lights came back on because Sosuke's here.
The very powerful, micro-typhoon is still maintaining the power, and...
This stupid TV.
Nobody understands weather anymore.
Their forecasts are never right.
You should take your mother home now.
With our lucky goldfish to keep us company, we won't be scared.
OK.
This is for you, Toki.
- It's wrinkled.
What is it?
- It goes like this.
- I got it.
It's a grasshopper.
- No, it's the Koganei Maru.
That's the name of your father's ship, isn't it, Sosuke?
- Right.
- It does look like a grasshopper.
Sosuke, we've gotta get on the road.
Let's hurry now and say goodbye.
- OK.
Ladies, good evening.
- Good evening.
Be careful the wind doesn't blow you away.
Get in from this side.
They said the phones are out, too.
The ocean looks all puffed up.
You think the storm could sink the ships?
No.
Ships can handle a storm.
I'm sure that's what Koichi is doing right now.
I saw a fish!
Did you see that, Lisa?
Put your seatbelt on!
Lisa!
You can't cross here!
We just got word.
They're gonna evacuate this side.
Evacuate?
There are some people up at the senior center.
They're on the leeward side, and the levees are high.
They should be fine.
OK.
But right now, I need to get home.
- You can't cross here.
- Take the mountain road.
- Here we go, Sosuke.
- Sure.
- No!
Don't do it!
- A big wave is coming!
- Lisa, you gotta get out of here!
- Back up!
- The fish are following us now!
- Buckle up!
I'm gonna go real fast!
What a persistent wave!
- Lisa, the little girl just fell in!
- What?
She was on a fish!
Where?
The sea level is raised!
Sosuke, where did you see a little girl?
She was out there, running on top of a huge fish!
A fish?
Sosuke, we have to go!
Hang in there, Sosuke.
We're almost home.
There is a little girl.
It's dangerous out here!
Come over here!
Stay there, Sosuke.
Sosuke, do you know her?
Ponyo?
- Right!
It's me, Ponyo!
- It is you!
Lisa!
Ponyo came back, and she's a little girl now!
I found Sosuke!
Listen, Sosuke, Ponyo.
All right.
Life is mysterious and amazing.
But we need to be calm right now.
- All right?
- Yes.
Very good.
You can take off your raincoat now, Sosuke.
You are... barefoot, Ponyo.
Hold this for a sec.
Stay here, and I'll go get a towel.
Here, this way!
It smells like you in here!
Ponyo!
There, got ya.
Now, let's rub you down and dry you off.
Ponyo, you have beautiful red hair.
- And your clothes are dry.
- That's because Ponyo was a fish.
- Being wet doesn't bother her, right?
- Right.
I really like this thing.
All right then.
Why don't we have some tea?
Ponyo, will you hold the light for me?
- Coming!
- Let's see if the water is working.
- It's working!
- It's working!
- It worked!
- It worked!
It's because we have our own water tank up on the hill.
And who thinks the stove will light?
And light!
All right.
- All right!
- We have our own propane tank.
- Please have a seat at the table.
- OK!
Ponyo, over here.
This is what you do.
Now, put your stuff down.
- You need to use your hands.
- No, I'll use feet!
Look at that!
What is it?
Look at her feet.
They're just like hands.
Here you go.
Here.
Thank you for the tea!
Ah, that was delicious.
So, what shall we do next?
- Ponyo wants ham!
- All she thinks about is ham, Lisa.
I better make some dinner then.
But, first, we should start the generator.
We generate power to talk to Koichi on the radio.
Koichi is my dad.
- Is he an evil wizard?
- No, of course not.
He's the captain of the ship called Koganei Maru.
What about your dad, Ponyo?
His name is Fujimoto.
He keeps me in a bubble!
- What?
- So I ran away.
What about your mom, then?
I love my mom very much!
- But she can be very scary.
- Just like my mom.
Ponyo, over here, please.
I wonder if the fuel has gone bad.
- Maybe it's clogged.
- It's clogged.
It's clogged over there.
- It's on!
- It's light now!
Ponyo, you're amazing.
- Antenna, antenna!
- Hey, Lisa.
Did all the ships out there sink?
I don't see any lights out there.
- Too loud!
- We can't get through?
I can't get any reception.
Transmitting from JA4LL.
JA4LL.
Come in, Koichi.
This is Lisa, Sosuke and Ponyo.
We're all doing fine.
- We're about to have dinner.
- Ham!
Put the noodles in your bowl?
Be careful.
It's really hot.
- You have to wait a little bit.
- It takes three minutes.
OK, close your eyes.
Not yet...
Ponyo...
No peeking!
OK.
You can look now.
Abracadabra!
- It's ham!
- Careful, it's hot.
Hot, hot, hot!
Lisa, Ponyo fell asleep.
Do you think Ponyo came from far, far away?
Yeah, I do.
Look outside.
It looks like the waves have calmed down.
- Maybe because Ponyo fell asleep.
- Do you see that light?
It's moving.
There must be somebody still over there.
I wonder if that's Yoshie and the others.
- The lights are out.
- It's the mountain road.
Sosuke, stay with Ponyo, OK?
I've gotta go help them.
I can get there if I take the mountain road.
Sosuke, I should go to the senior center.
I'm coming, too.
I'd feel better if you'd stay up here with Ponyo.
I'm coming with you!
We just need to bring Ponyo with us.
I wanna go with you, Lisa!
Sosuke, right now, our house is a beacon in the storm.
The people in the dark feel hopeful when they see our lights.
That's why someone has to be here.
Many mysterious things have been happening.
We don't know why right now, but we'll find out before long.
For now, I'm worried about the people at the senior center.
If you stay and guard the house, that would be very helpful.
Don't worry.
I promise I'll be back.
Promise?
- I promise.
- You promised.
I love you, Sosuke.
The moon is out!
I can see the lights of a city up ahead.
Thank goodness!
We can get our bearings again.
We're someplace I've never seen before.
Have we arrived in America or what?
That's not a mountain.
And that's no harbor, either.
Those lights are ships.
The water of the ocean has come together to create a mountain.
That's probably a graveyard for ships.
The gate to the world beyond must have opened!
- The engine stopped!
- Try to hold her steady.
- Drop the sea anchor.
- Yes, sir.
Something's coming from behind us.
I just saw the Goddess of Mercy!
- The engine's working.
- We're saved!
She saved us!
She must've appeared for us!
Thank you for protecting us...
Higher, higher.
There is a powerful holy barrier around the house.
How has she learned to do something like that?
I don't believe this!
She's turned into a human!
Hold still!
You...
What are you doing?
Girls!
Oh, no!
Stop, now!
Listen, girls.
I'm concerned about your sister.
At last, she has finally come.
- Fujimoto.
- You've come for me, my love.
What a wonderful ocean.
It's full of magic and power.
It's like my ancient Devonian Sea.
Ponyo has tasted human blood.
She also drank all of my elixirs that I've collected.
Ponyo?
What a lovely name.
Of course, it's all my fault, really.
She can use magic freely, and she's opened a hole in the fabric of reality.
She has no idea what she's doing.
She's now a little girl.
And she loves a little boy.
If we don't do anything about this, the planet is doomed.
Already the Earth is pulling satellites from the sky.
And the moon pulls the sea closer...
Be calm, dear.
Sosuke.
The boy's name is Sosuke.
You all love your older sister, don't you?
Listen, my darling, why don't we let Ponyo become human for good?
- What?
- It's the old magic, you know.
If Sosuke's love remains unchanged,
Ponyo'll become human and lose her magical power.
But, if anything goes wrong, Ponyo will turn into sea foam.
Well, we all originated in sea foam.
But he is only five years old.
That's impossible...
Children, sleep peacefully for now.
Sosuke!
Ponyo, you OK?
- Ponyo, good morning.
- Good morning, Sosuke.
Look at that.
The ocean is at our door.
- How come your Lisa's not here?
- Because the road is under the water.
Too bad we don't have a boat.
There's a boat, right there!
- You can't ride it.
- Yes, you can.
Thank you!
Wow!
You even made the candle bigger.
- We can ride it!
- Yeah!
This is fantastic.
- Fantastic!
- You take that end, please.
OK!
- Ready?
- I'm ready!
It actually floats!
Doesn't look like it has any leaks.
Now we have to fill the boiler.
The water goes in through this pipe then it gets heated up here, in this round thing.
It's like a rocket.
Ponyo, everything's shipshape.
- Shipshape!
- Yep.
- Shipshape!
- Shipshape.
Shipshape!
Shipshape!
Shipshape!
Shipshape!
Shipshape!
Is it hot?
It's hot!
Hot!
- Look at that!
- It's burning.
It's hot!
It's hot!
It's hot!
It's hot!
It's hot, right?
It's working!
Sosuke, we're shipshape, right?
- Yep.
- This is fantastic.
- Sosuke!
We're happy, right?
- Yep.
- Sosuke, it's burning, right?
- Yep.
Sosuke, that thing is hot, right?
Ponyo, you be the boat's lookout.
And I'll do the steering, OK?
OK!
I'm the lookout!
There's the road.
That's the mountain road Lisa took last night.
- I don't see her anywhere.
- We'll see her.
She promised me she'd come back.
Those are ancient fish.
They lived during the Devonian Age.
I know that one.
It's Bothriocephalus.
- And that one is...
- Dipnorhynchus.
- Dipnorhynchus!
- Wow!
That one's really huge!
- That's Devonynchus!
- Devonynchus!
Ahoy!
- Ahoy...
- Whoa, there's a boat!
Ahoy!
They said, "Ahoy."
Ahoy!
That's fast!
I'm getting the hang of this.
Get ready to stop, Ponyo.
- Hello, you two.
- Hello.
Hey, that is quite a boat you got there.
I've seen you before.
You're Lisa's little boy, aren't you?
- He's not a little boy.
He's Sosuke!
- She's Ponyo.
And I used to be a fish.
A fish?
Your name is lovely, Ponyo.
By the way, have you seen my mother?
Your mother?
Why isn't your mother with you?
- She went to the senior center.
- Wow, way up there?
This is our baby.
Oh, dear.
I wonder what's wrong.
Oh, is that for us?
Let me have it.
Thank you.
I'm looking forward to tasting it.
Wow, that's good soup.
- My mom made it.
- The soup's for the baby!
Oh, I'm sorry.
He's too young to have soup.
But I could eat the soup instead, and it would help me make milk for him.
Yeah, my mom made milk for me, too.
Ponyo, is it all right if I eat the soup?
- That's fine.
- Thank you.
Heave-ho!
Heave-ho!
Heave-ho!
Heave-ho!
People from the town!
It's just like a parade!
Ahoy!
Are any of you in need of assistance at this time?
Thank you!
We're fine for now!
We are taking everyone to the Mountain Peak Hotel!
For your safety, we request that you follow us!
Aye, aye!
Will do!
- Looks like the whole town is here.
- I'm glad.
- I hope everyone's OK.
- Ponyo, time to light the candle.
Hold on a second.
Let's see...
Here, have some milk.
Wow.
It's for milk.
She already ate all the ham off those sandwiches.
Thank you.
It'll help me make good milk.
Sosuke.
- I have a used candle.
Do you want it?
- Thanks.
Ponyo will make it bigger.
Thank you!
- Be careful.
- Thank you.
What's the matter?
There.
There.
Ponyo!
- Sosuke!
- Hey, that's Sosuke.
- Where is Lisa?
- What's going on with Lisa?
She went to the senior center last night!
We're on our way to find her!
That means Lisa beat that wave!
- That's Lisa.
- Sosuke, can I ride with you?
Kumiko, I'm busy right now.
Maybe later.
Check the park.
The seniors should be there by now.
- Good luck, kid!
- You'll find her!
We'll send a boat for the seniors as soon as we drop this group off!
Good luck, captain!
Ponyo, we need to replace the candle.
We'll be OK.
The fisherman gave me another one.
Hot!
It's still pretty hot.
Bye-bye.
Here, Ponyo.
Can you make this bigger?
All right.
Ponyo, are you sleepy?
Ponyo.
Ponyo.
Ponyo!
Oh, good.
I can walk from here.
There's the road.
Oh, no!
The boat!
Ponyo!
Ponyo, wake up!
Sosuke.
You scared me.
I thought you might turn back into a goldfish.
Lisa's car!
Ponyo, I found Lisa's car!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa...
Lisa.
Lisa!
Sosuke, I've got your boat.
There's water coming from your eyes.
- Let's go find your mom.
- Yeah.
HIMAWARI HOUSE
- My lap blanket!
- Forget about it!
Look, here comes a whale again!
I think he sees us.
The other side is nice, isn't it?
- And my knees don't hurt.
- We didn't have to be afraid.
This is the other side?
I thought it was the undersea palace!
Ladies, can we gather around, please?
- Coming!
- Let's go!
- It's so nice to run.
- Beat you there!
Winner!
Everyone, quiet, please.
The time has come for you to bear witness to a sacred test of love.
- Oh, how exciting!
- Test of love!
My heart is beating fast!
Please, ladies!
You're the witnesses to this sacred test.
We ask everyone to be patient for a little while longer.
Fujimoto, you won't let any harm come to Sosuke or Ponyo, will you?
- Right.
- Of course not!
He's the father...
Of course I wouldn't.
My hope is Ponyo will stay asleep.
Excuse me.
- I'm sure he's nice at heart.
- I wonder how Lisa's doing?
She's with Ponyo's mother, and they've been talking all night and day.
Poor Lisa.
Must be hard on her.
I wish we could hear what they're talking about.
Oh, why don't we just ask.
Lisa!
Lisa!
Please know that we are all cheering for Sosuke and Ponyo!
- Lisa!
- You must be anxious.
Sosuke'll do just fine.
He's a determined, young boy.
Absolutely!
He's such an upstanding boy.
Thank you.
Please be there for him.
It's going to be fine.
Ponyo, there's a tunnel.
MOUNTAIN PEAK PARK AHEAD
STOP
I think I've been here before.
- Ponyo?
- Don't like this place.
- Don't let go of my hand.
- OK.
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Please don't die!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Wake up, Ponyo!
Be careful not to wake her.
It's good to meet you, Sosuke.
We've all been waiting for you.
- The old ladies, your mother...
- My mother?
Won't you come with me and join them, Sosuke?
Ponyo, too.
Let Ponyo keep sleeping and we'll just sneak away.
Sosuke!
Sosuke, don't listen to that wacko!
He tricked all the others into going with him!
- Toki!
- Nobody fools me!
Like I said, there is so little time!
Can't you see that?
If the moon comes any closer, there will be no going back!
If you're gonna lie, come up with a better one!
- Sosuke, come to me!
- Humans!
Listen, Sosuke, please come with me!
You're the only one who can save the planet.
I don't want to use force.
Ponyo!
What a horrible thing to do to your father!
- Ponyo!
- Sosuke, come on!
Bring them to me!
You can do it!
Jump for it!
Girls!
- Lisa!
- Sosuke.
Ponyo!
Where am I?
- So this is Sosuke.
- How do you do?
- Are you Ponyo's mother?
- Yes.
You brought my daughter safely here.
Thank you.
Sosuke.
Ponyo opened a magic well because she wants very much to be human.
For her to become human, she needs you to accept and love her as she truly is.
You know that Ponyo was a fish, don't you?
She became half human when she licked your blood.
Oh, I see...
I cut my thumb, then Ponyo licked it and made it better.
So that's how she changed into a human.
Do you care if Ponyo is half fish and half human?
I love Ponyo as a fish, half-fish and fully human.
I love her in all forms.
Ponyo, come here, please.
Ponyo, Sosuke will be your guardian.
To become human, you must choose to abandon magic.
Can you do that?
Yes!
Kiss the bubble, when you return to land, and Ponyo will become a girl.
Five years old, just like you.
I'm happy for you, Ponyo.
Thank you very much, Ponyo's mother.
Everyone, the balance of nature is restored.
Way to go!
My Sosuke.
Thank you, Lisa.
Thank you.
I'll take care of her.
Everyone!
Are you all right?
- Wait, let me get your wheelchairs!
- Don't bother.
We like to walk.
Life begins again.
This is your ship, I believe.
- Thank you.
- Sorry for everything.
If you will.
May I?
Take care of Ponyo.
It's Koichi's ship!
Koichi!
Hi!
Over here!
It's Lisa!
And Sosuke's there, too!
Ahoy!
Look, Ponyo, there's Koichi's ship!

Ponyo on the Seaside Cliff
Seaweeds waving gently, in the big blue sea together with countless siblings bubbles are our language.
I remember, long ago cruising with you on the big blue sea.
Jellyfish and sea urchin, fish and crabs, we are a big family.
Sosuke, come home soon ok?
Ok.
It's a goldfish.
It's stuck.
Strange...
Ouch!
Is it dead?
It licked my finger.
It's still alive!
Sosuke, we need to go now.
Risa, there's a goldfish.
What a strange wind.
Sosuke, I'll start the engine first.
Did you find her?
What?
She was captured by a human?
This is bad, really bad.
Did it die?
It's alive!
Sosuke, we're gonna be late.
Risa, I have a live goldfish.
Goldfish?
I found it at the seaside.
I see...
I don't know who you are, but please don't spray pesticide here.
Oh, this is not pesticide.
This is deep sea water to avoid dehydration.
Good, as long as it's not poisonous.
Excuse me.
Oh no, this is really bad.
What a strange guy.
Don't be mean, Sosuke.
Don't judge a book by it's cover.
I won't.
Are you bringing that to kindergarten?
Yeah.
Is it ok with your teacher?
No problem, I'll protect it.
It's really cute.
The ship is leaving.
Sosuke, hurry up and eat this.
Can you eat this?
You want some?
Hey, my cut healed!
Risa, I'm calling her Ponyo. ("Po-Nyo").
She licked my wound with a "Ponyo"
and used her magic on me.
After she licked it, the wound disapeared.
Do you like ham?
Risa, Ponyo likes to eat ham.
Just like you, huh?
Miss Risa, hurry up!
This is filthy, really filthy!
Good morning!
Ponyo, you can see our house!
Look!
Here is ok, right?
Yeah!
Take care.
I'm leaving!
Good morning, pardon me.
Please take Granny Noriko's chair.
Ok!
Little Sosuke, morning.
Granny Yoshie, I'm busy now.
Talk to you later.
Ara, ara!
Little Sosuke.
Granny Toki, see you in a while.
Ara!
I wonder if the teacher will tell me it's not allowed?
Alright!
Wait for me here.
I'll be right back.
I wonder if cats will come here?
You stay put ok.
I will be right back.
See you.
Ah, Sui-chan.
A bit fever.
But he looks healthy, so he should be fine.
Thank you.
Bye bye.
Good morning, sensei (teacher).
Good morning, Sosuke.
Sosuke, how are you?
Sosuke.
Oh, Kumiko.
Look at this.
Isn't it pretty?
My mom bought it for me.
Sosuke, let's play together.
I'm busy now, maybe next time.
What are you up to?
I said I'm busy.
Strange Sosuke.
So strange.
Oh.
Ponyo!
Sosuke.
Kumiko.
What is this?
You can't bring this to kindergarten.
These trees aren't part of the kindergarten.
They belong to Sunflower Home, so it's ok.
Let me see.
Oh, goldfish.
Not goldfish, Ponyo.
Ponyo?
I want to see.
If I let you see, you can't tell anyone else.
Ok, won't tell.
See, it's cute right?
So odd looking.
And chubby.
The goldfishes at my house are cuter!
It's Kumiko fault.
Is her fault, saying something bad about Ponyo.
I'll change your water for you.
Oh.
Ponyo.
Thank goodness.
Isn't that strange, I can hear little Sosuke's voice.
Sosuke should be in the kindergarten.
My hearing keeps getting worse.
Granny Yoshie, I'm here.
Ara, ara..
It's little Sosuke.
Am I holding something good in my hands?
You sure do!
That's right!
What color is it?
Red?
Red.
Correct.
How do you know?
Let me take a look.
Ok!
It's beautiful.
And cute!
Her name is Ponyo.
She likes ham, and she can use magic.
The cut on my finger disappeared because Ponyo licked it.
I wonder if she could lick our legs too...
If could run like little Sosuke again, that would be wonderful.
Hmm, I must ask Ponyo if she could do that.
Let me see as well.
Sure, Granny Toki.
Oh, gross!
Isn't that a bad mermaid?
You must quickly return it to the sea.
It will call up a tsunami.
Again, Granny Toki, a tsunami?
What are you saying..?
When mermaids walk on land, tsunamis will follow.
It's an ancient legend.
Aaah!
A tsunami!
The tsunami has come!
The tsunami has come, tsunami...
What happened, Granny Toki?
My clothes are all wet...
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Sosuke, please apologize to Granny Toki!
You don't have to worry, I will protect you.
Sosuke.
Sosuke!
Ah!
Ponyo!
Ponyo...
Sosuke...
Ponyo, Sosuke.
Like!
I like you too.
Ponyo, like Sosuke!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo?
Ponyo...
Sosuke.
Ponyo...
Hey Sosuke, what happened was destiny.
Even though it's painful, you can't change destiny.
Ponyo was born to live in the sea, so that's why she must return to the sea.
That Mr. Pesticide is suspicious.
Give me a bite.
Come on, lemme try.
Wasn't that tasty?
Come on, cheer up.
Today is the day Koichi returns.
(Koichi is Sosuke's father).
If Sosuke doesn't cheer up, he won't be cheerful either.
Don't go to the sea anymore today, ok?
Ok.
Sosuke, please come inside.
If I put the bucket here, Ponyo will know this is her home, right?
Right, if Sosuke wants to put it there she'll know this is her home.
Yeah!
Sosuke, please answer the phone.
It must be Koichi.
Hello?
Yeah, it's me.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Today, I can't come home.
We're crossing the border as usual.
I'm losing signal, pass it to Risa.
I'm giving this to Risa.
Koichi?
Yeah.
EH?
Can't you just tell them no?
You can't just leave your wife and son alone waiting on the cliff.
I don't know!
What is this!
?
Sosuke, tonight let's go out to eat.
I want to eat at home.
It's Koichi!
Risa, it's Koichi's ship!
Quick, turn out the lights!
It's Sosuke!
He's a genius even though he's just 5 years old.
Your wife must be mad.
I-AM-SORRY
Risa, he said sorry.
B-A-K-A
B-A-K-A... (stupid)
A-A-A-A-A...
Risa, he said "I LOVE YOU".
He said "VERY VERY MUCH!"
(stupid stupid stupid...)
Wow, it's beautiful, huh?
(Smooth sailing)
(Thank you)
(Goodnight)
Risa, don't cry.
I didn't cry.
I promised to protect Ponyo.
Ponyo... you're not crying, right?
Ok, let's cheer up.
I am ha-ppy!
(Totoro theme song)
Ouch!
Sosuke cheer up too.
Just like Risa, Ponyo's cheerful too.
Yeah.
So, let's eat!
Let's eat Koichi's portion too.
It's all because of me.
I shouldn't have brought all of you to visit the farm.
As I've told all of you, the humans' air and water are so filthy.
Now, eat this, come on.
Are you listening "Polumisharudin"?
(Supposed Ponyo real name)
I want ham!
Ham!
?
Where did you learn of such a horrible thing?
Tell me, Polumisharudin.
I'm not Polumisharudin, I am Ponyo!
Po...
Po...
Ponyo?
Ponyo likes Sosuke!
Ponyo will become human!
Human!
?
What's so good about those stupid and horrible creatures?
Human took lives from sea.
I was once called a human.
I sacrificed a lot to not become one of them.
Ponyo wants hands!
I don't want legs like these!
I want legs like Sosuke!
That's enough...
Hands came out!
Legs came out!
They came out!
You've tasted human blood?
I am going to where Sosuke is!
Now I must undo what your eyes have seen!
(spell)
Return!
Return!
(spell)
Go back!
Go back!
Go back!
(spell)
Ah, not enough power.
Comin' out... comin' out... (spell)
Calm thyself, on starry path... (spell)
Return.
Return.
Return. (spell)
She's definitely HER child...
Such great power.
If contain her like this, things should be fine...
My power can only hold her for a while.
Looks like only 'that person' can do it.
No.
It's too much for all of you.
Shoo!
Shoo!
No way...
This is dangerous...
My barrier to stop crabs is failing.
It almost disrupted the balance of nature.
Gotta calm down, gotta calm down.
I get a bad feeling everytime when going to meet 'that person'.
Oh no, oh no.
I have to finish cleaning up.
The barrier isn't weak here.
This is hard to open!
I have to come and fix it later.
I can't even let one sea creature enter here, or else there will be big trouble.
Well done.
The power of the sea is spreading to every corner.
When this well fills up, the time of the sea will begin.
Which will mean the end of those dangerous creatures.
The time of filthy humans will end.
Seal it, seal it... (spell)
Ha...
Haha...
Haha...
I'm going to where Sosuke is!
Sosuke...
Ha...
Tsunami?
Captain, that, that...
It's a tsunami!
Everyone, get inside the ship!
What's that?
Captain, the radio and radar are out!
It's a girl.
About Sosuke's age.
Thank you.
Thanks for your hard work.
Sosuke, wait here for a while ok?
Sensei will accompany you.
I'm going home with Risa, will be fine.
Goodbye, sensei.
Goodbye.
Be careful.
Sorry, Sosuke.
Was the door hard to open?
The power is out.
Was the kindergarten ok?
Yes.
Miss Risa, it's ok.
You can go home first.
Granny Kaneko not here yet?
Yeah, don't worry.
She just a bit late.
After all we will be here whole night.
You better get going while you still can.
Sosuke, wait a minute, ok?
Ok.
Granny Yoshie.
Ara, ara, it's little Sosuke.
It's too dark, I can't see a thing.
Hey, I wanted to give you this.
Oh?
What is this?
Give one to Granny Noriko too.
Thank you.
So dark, can't see a thing.
Such a heavy storm, and even a black out... that's why I don't want to stay here.
The power's back.
Thank goodness!
So bright.
A goldfish!
I wonder if the power came back because Sosuke came here?
There will be a large typhoon headed for our area which will be very strong.
Useless TV.
Can't see a thing.
This weather forecast isn't accurate at all.
Little Sosuke, go home quickly.
We got the goldfish charm, so we won't be scared of anything.
Ok.
Granny Toki, I want to give one to you too.
Isn't this rough looking?
What is this?
It's like this.
It's a locust, a locust!
No, it's not.
It's the 'Kogane Maru'.
That's little Sosuke's father's ship, isn't it?
Yeah.
Looks like a locust to me.
Sosuke, time to go, say goodbye to everyone.
Ok.
Everyone, farewell.
Farewell.
Don't get blown away by the wind!
Let's go home.
Looks like the phones are down too.
The sea is rising, isn't it?
Won't those ships sink?
The ships in the sea aren't afraid of storms.
Koichi's ship is the same.
It's a fish!
Risa, it's a fish!
Put on you seat belt.
Miss Risa, you can't pass here.
There's an evacuation order.
Evacuation?
There're old ladies at Sunflower Home that are staying overnight.
That's inland.
Since they're on higher ground, they'll be fine.
Anyway, I must go home.
You can't pass through here.
Go through the mountain.
Sosuke, let's go.
Ok.
Please, don't!
Oh no, a big wave is coming.
Miss Risa.
Don't be silly.
The fish are coming after us!
Sosuke, please put your seatbelt on!
We're gonna speed up!
Why are the waves so huge?
A girl fell down there!
What?
She was on top of the fish!
Where?
The ocean's getting higher.
Sosuke, where did you see the girl?
There, running on the backs of the fishes.
Fish?
Let's go, Sosuke!
Hang on, Sosuke.
We're almost home.
There is a girl over there.
It's dangerous, come over here.
Sosuke, don't move.
Sosuke, you know her?
Ponyo?
Yeah!
I'm Ponyo!
It's Ponyo!
Risa, Ponyo returned as a little girl.
Ponyo is over here!
Listen, Sosuke and Ponyo, no matter how happy and surprised you are to see each other, you must calm down now.
You understand?
Ok.
Take off the rain coat please Sosuke.
Ponyo didn't wear shoes right?
Hold this, ok?
I'll go get something to dry off.
Ponyo, this way.
This smells like Sosuke.
Ponyo
Gotcha.
You've gotta dry off now.
Ponyo's hair is a pretty shade of red, huh?
Your clothes aren't wet, are they?
Ponyo used to be a fish, so she's ok being wet.
Yup.
Ponyo like this!
Great, let's make some tea.
Ponyo, bring the lights here.
I wonder if the water will come out?
Yes it will!
It will!
It came out!
It's because we have a water tank for our house.
I wonder if the gas will work?
All right!
All right!
Cause we have our own gas tank too!
Ok, please take your seats!
Ok!
Ponyo, sit here!
It will be just a little longer.
You have to set your stuff down.
Or you won't be able to use your hands!
I have my feet!
Wow!
Oh, what're you looking at?
Ponyo's feet are like hands!
Please, go ahead.
Here you go.
I'm gonna start!
That was delicious.
So, what should we do next?
Ponyo, thinks ham is good!
Ponyo likes to eat ham.
Then, let's eat dinner!
But before that, we have to start the power generator.
If we connect the power, we can also talk to Koichi!
Koichi is my father.
Is he an evil magician?
No, he's the captain of Kogane Maru!
What's Ponyo's father like?
He's Fujimoto, he locked Ponyo up!
Ponyo, ran away!
What's Ponyo's mother like?
I LOOOVE mommy!
But she's also very scary!
Just like Risa huh...
Ponyo, please bring the light.
Ara!
Are we out of gas?
Is it stuck?
It's stuck!
That thing over there is stuck!
All right!
It's so bright!
Ponyo, you're amazing!
Antenna, antenna!
Risa, did the ships sink?
There isn't even one light out there, is there?
It's NOISY!
Everything ok?
Looks like the radio is not working.
This is JA4 LL
JA4 LL
Can you hear me Koichi?
This is Risa and Sosuke and Ponyo.
Everyone is fine here.
We're gonna eat dinner now!
Ham!
Did you put them in?
This is hot, so be careful.
Wait a little bit.
Gotta wait for 3 minutes!
Please close your eyes!
Not quite yet.
Ponyo, don't peek!
Ok!
You can open your eyes now!
Enjoy your meal!
Wow.
Ham!
Ponyo, this is great, huh?
Oh!
Hot, hot, hot!
Risa, Ponyo fell asleep!
Ponyo came from far away, didn't she?
Yeah, she must have.
Sosuke, look!
The storm has stopped.
Is it because Ponyo fall asleep?
Sosuke, look over there.
Something's moving.
Somebody is over there.
I wonder if it's Granny Yoshie and her friends?
It's gone.
It's on the road to the mountain.
Sosuke, wait here with Ponyo.
I'm going over there.
I should be able to take the mountain road.
Sosuke, I'm going to Sunflower Home.
I'm going too.
Sosuke and Ponyo, please wait here.
I want to go, let's just bring Ponyo along.
I am going with Risa!
Sosuke, right now, this house is a lighthouse in the storm bringing light and hope to those in dark.
So, someone must wait here.
Many strange things have happened, and I'm not sure why.
but there must be a reason.
I'm worried about those at Sunflower Home.
If Sosuke is protecting this place, then Risa will have support.
I'll be fine.
I will definitely come home.
Absolutely?
Absolutely!
Make absolutely sure then.
I love you, Sosuke!
The moon is coming out!
We can see the lights from town!
Thank goodness!
We can navigate now.
That doesn't look like a town we've been to before.
Did we reach America?
That's not a mountain or land either.
It's all boats!
They were gathered up in the ocean and turned into a mountain of boats!
This must be the ship graveyard!
The path to the other side has opened!
The engine's stopped!
Fix it quickly!
Drop the anchor.
Aye.
What's coming up behind us?
I saw a goddess!
We're moving!
We're saved!
It's a goddess.
Thanks be to the goddess!
Thanks be.
Go higher, higher.
Oh!
This is a proper barrier.
Where did she learn how to do this?
What's going on?
She became a human!
Hey, be careful!
What're you doing?
It's you guys!
Whoa, this is dangerous!
Please stop!
You guys!
Daddy is doing this for your sister.
It's HER!
She's coming!
Fujimoto.
So you came huh?
What a beautiful ocean.
It's so full with magic, as if I'm back to 'De Po Ji' big ocean.
Ponyo tasted human's blood.
ALL the elixir of life I collected is gone too!
Ponyo?
She was given a very nice name.
It's all my fault.
Ponyo misused her magical powers.
and opened a big hole on earth.
She doesn't know what she's doing!
Furthermore, she turned into a human and ran away to her human boyfriend's home!
It this continues, the world will be destroyed!
Oh!
This is bad.
Meteors are starting to fall too!
The gravity of the planet...
Hush now.
Sosuke.
It's a boy named Sosuke huh.
All of you love your big sister.
My love, why don't you just let Ponyo become a true human.
Huh?
There's an old magic that says if there is a boy with a faithful heart, then Ponyo can turn into a real human, in exchange for her magical powers.
But if it fails,
Ponyo will turn into bubbles.
We are all born from bubbles, after all!
But, she's only 5.
She can't possibly make it.
Let's be quiet and let the children rest.
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Ouch!
Ponyo!
Good morning!
Sosuke, good morning!
The ocean became calm.
Risa is gone, huh?
The roads are all flooded.
If only we had a boat now.
We have a boat!
We can't ride that.
We can ride it!
Wow, that's perfect!
Wow, the candle even got bigger!
We can ride it!
Yeah, just like the original one.
It's just like the original one!
Hold that side, ok?
Ready?
Ready!
It's floating!
It's dry!
No leaks at all!
Oh yeah!
We have to blow the water out of it.
If there's water in the pipe, there will be water in that round thing.
It's like a rocket!
Good job, Ponyo!
Good job?
Yes, good job.
Good job!
Good job!
Good job...
It it hot?
It's hot!
It's hoooooot!
Wow, it's lit!
It's lit!
It's hot!
It's hot!
It's hot...!
Very hot.
It's hot, isn't it?
It's moving!
Sosuke, good job!
Yeah!
Amazing, yeah?
Yeah.
Wow...
Sosuke is happy, yeah?
Yup.
Sosuke, it's burning, huh?
Yeah.
Sosuke, it's hot, right?
Ponyo, sit in front.
I'll watch the fire.
Ok, you watch!
There's the road.
That's the mountain road Risa took!
Risa isn't there, is she?
Risa'll be there, she promised she'll definitely be there!
It's a Gogonasus.
There used to be over 10,000 of them in the sea.
Oh look, the shy 'Licosus'.
Beautiful.
Where are you going 'Licosus'?
Wow, it's huge!
It's a 'Licosus'!
'Licosus'!
Hey!
There's a boat!
They're calling "Hey!" to us!
Heeeeeeeeey!
Whoa, are!
They must have spotted us.
Ponyo, you can blow it out now.
Hello.
Hello.
Hey, that's a wonderful boat.
I was wondering who it was, and it turned out to be Risa's little Sosuke.
It's not little Sosuke.
It's just Sosuke.
She's Ponyo.
Ponyo, used to be a fish.
A fish?
Ponyo is a nice name, isn't it?
Yup.
Mister, do you know where is Risa is?
Miss Risa?
Is she not with you?
She went out to Sunflower Home.
To Sunflower Home?
This is a baby.
Oh!
What is it?
Are you going to pour some?
Here, let me see it.
Thank you.
I'm going to have some!
What a delicious soup!
Risa made it.
It's for THE BABY!
I'm sorry, the baby can't drink soup yet!
But, if I drink this, then I'll make milk for the baby.
I used to drink Risa's milk too.
Ponyo, may I drink this soup?
Yes, please have some.
Thank you.
There are people over there!
It's like a parade!
Hey!
Is there anything we can help you with?
Thanks, but we're fine for now.
Then please be careful on your way up to the hotel.
Ok, will do.
There's so many people.
Thank goodness everyone is safe.
Ponyo, be careful with that!
Hold on.
Turn these into milk!
Wow!
For milk!
Ponyo ate everyone's ham, though.
Thank you.
I'm sure there will be a lot of milk.
Sosuke, this isn't much, but do you want it?
Yeah, Ponyo will make it bigger.
Thank you.
Be careful, ok?
Thanks again.
What is it?
Now, now, now!
Ponyo!
Wow!
Little Sosuke!
Where is Miss Risa?
She went to Sunflower Home!
I'm going after her.
Risa must have gotten past that wave!
Amazing!
Sosuke, give me a ride too!
Kumiko, we're in a hurry, so I'll let you ride later.
Sosuke!
Hurry to the school!
Do your best!
"Attention, we're on duty so, we can only wish you all the best!"
Ponyo, we need a new candle.
It's ok, we still have the one we just received.
Ouch!
It's still very hot.
Bye bye.
Ponyo, can you make this bigger too?
Yeah sure.
Ponyo, are you sleepy?
Ponyo?
Ponyo?
Ponyo!
It's shallow!
My feet can touch the ground!
The road is coming out of the water.
Ah!
My boat...
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Wake up!
Sosuke.
Thank goodness.
I thought you were in danger!
Is Risa's car!
Ponyo!
Risa's car is over there!
Risa, Risa...
Sosuke, your boat.
There's water coming out of your eyes.
Let's look for Risa.
Ok.
Quick, look at this!
It's so beautiful, just like an underwater palace!
Ladies, please gather round over here!
Ok, let's go.
It feels great to run!
I'm going first!
Please calm down everyone.
This is the moment of destiny.
Sosuke is coming here.
Oh, what's going on?
A love test!
?
My heart is pounding!
Me too!
Please calm down.
Everyone here is a witness.
Please wait a while longer.
Mr. Fujimoto, you're not going to do something bad to Sosuke and Ponyo right?
Of course not.
This is a harsh test for Ponyo, and then...
I think he's a gentleman.
What is Miss Risa doing?
Look, over there.
She's been chatting with Ponyo's mother for a loooooong time.
This must be hard for Miss Risa.
What they talking about, I wonder?
Let's call her.
Miss Risa, Risa...
Don't worry!
Sosuke and Ponyo will come for you!
Miss Risa must be worried!
Little Sosuke will be fine, he's a good boy!
Thank you.
Everyone, let's cheer for them!
Ponyo, it's a tunnel.
Don't be afraid of the dark.
I hate this place.
You can't let go of my hand, ok?
Ok.
Ah!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo, you can't die!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Wake up, Ponyo!
Shh... don't wake her.
Sosuke, you did good getting this far!
Risa and the Grannies, everyone is waiting for you!
Risa is?
Come with me, bring Ponyo as well.
Ponyo needs to sleep, let's go quietly.
Sosuke!
Don't let that guy fool you!
He uses sweet talk but he takes everyone away.
Granny Toki!
Don't be fooled by him!
That's why I said there isn't any time!
Can't you see that?
If the moon gets any closer something terrible will happen!
You can make a better excuse than that!
Ah...
Sosuke, come with me!
Only you can save this world!
I won't hurt you.
Ponyo.
Ack!
How could you treat your father this way?
Ponyo!
Sosuke, come on!
I said I won't hurt you!
You can do it!
Granny Toki's got ya!
You guys!
Risa!
Sosuke.
Ponyo!
You must be Sosuke.
Hello.
Are you Ponyo's mother?
Yes I am.
You did a good job bringing Ponyo here.
Shh...
Thank you.
Sosuke, Ponyo broke a magic seal in order to become human.
In order to become human, she needs a man that understand Ponyo and is willing to accept her.
Do you know that she is a fish?
Yes.
She turned into a mermaid because she's tasted your blood.
Is that so?
She licked my wound and it turned her into a mermaid?
Knowing that she's half fish half human.
Are you ok with that?
Yes.
No matter if she's a fish Ponyo, a mermaid Ponyo or a human Ponyo, everyone loves her!
Ha ha...
Ponyo, please come here.
Ponyo, it seems that Sosuke has accepted you just as you are.
In order to become a human, you can't use magic anymore.
Can you do that?
Yes.
When you return to surface, kiss this bubble once.
Ponyo will then transform into a 5 year old girl like you.
Ponyo, that's wonderful, isn't it?
Thank you, Ponyo's mama!
Everyone, the curse on the Earth is broken.
YAY!
That's great!
Risa, thank you.
You too, thank you, always.
Everyone, are you alright?
We'll bring the wheelchairs immediately!
That's ok, we can walk.
This is your ship.
Thank you!
I'm sorry for everything.
May I shake your hand?
I am entrusting Ponyo to you.
It's Koichi's ship!
Koichi!
Hey!
Over here!
Ah!
It's Risa!
Sosuke's there too!
Ponyo, that's Koichi's ship!
Ah!
Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo, the fish child she came from the big blue sea!
Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo, got bigger and turned into a little girl!
Tip tap Tip tap, Stomp, Stomp said legs would be great, and set out on a journey
Niigi niigi, Boom, Boo-oom said hands would be great, but perhaps not!
She set out with a boy and risked her heart
Paku Paku Chyugyu!
Paaku Paaku Chyuugyu!
I love that child more and more!
Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo, the fish child she came from the big blue sea!
Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo got bigger and turned into a little girl!
-The End-
After our fight,
I gave her my last cigarette.
And so?
She just sat there and started smoking...
Why were you best friends back then?
I don't know...
Maybe we were the only girls who smoked in school.
So, was it the last time you smoked together?
For some reason, I'm getting this sudden urge to smoke.
Toss it, Xiao-Bu...
Heads-I'll buy a pack.
Tails-you go.
Heads-stay together.
Tails... separate.
Dad, I'm back.
Dad, I'm leaving.
Is that all you have?
Punch harder...
So what should I call you?
Brother
Brother?
You're much older than my brother.
Where are you going?
Where do you want to take me?
One night, he run into a group of riders and they told him if he got on their bike he could travel between the past and the future.
Eating breakfast on Pluto.
If you met one of those riders, would you go with him?
I bet I would.
One day...
Should I bring you to hospital?
Feeling better?
Actually, I've never competed.
Angel asked me for a cigarette but I wouldn't give her one.
Why didn't you?
I don't know.
I just didn't want to.
She tried to snatch a cigarette from my pocket, but I still didn't give her one.
She just stood there staring at me.
She said...
"You're not gonna give me a cigarette?"
I said, "No, I don't want to."
Then... all of a sudden, she began to hit me...
I put down my cigarette.
I slapped her once.
Then, I slapped her again...
After our fight
I gave her my last cigarette.
And so, she just sat there and started smoking.
Why were you best friends back then?
I don't know.
Maybe we were the only girls who smoked in school.
So, was it the last time you smoked together?
I know where you are taking me.
When I was in high school, I was really, really shy.
When I spoke I couldn't even look people in the eyes.
Also, I could eat quite a lot.
Even though I was tall and skinny,
I had a huge appetite.
I could eat at least two big rice balls for lunch.
I couldn't get full off the school lunches.
So during my lunch break,
I would sneak out to eat more...
Look... your nail polish.
Look... your black nail polish.
One afternoon, that boy showed up...
Back then, I was really shy and was afraid to look at him.
After the whole incident,
I can't even remember what he looked like.
I honestly...
like you...
From the first time I saw you...
Sorry...
It's okay.
It's okay.
Sorry.
What I meant by sorry, isn't...
I was talking about us...
Sorry.
It's okay.
Where did you find that?
I saw it when I went through the closet...
I think it's really special...
I didn't mean to...
It's nothing...
What's up?
Nothing!
...
What...
What are you doing?
Let's take a photo!
Two...
Three!
I'm leaving.
"Will you give me roses?"
"Will you give me candy?"
Patrick the Cat has curly hair like you.
His eyes are bigger than yours, and they are very, very blue.
His curly hair like you.
His eyes are bigger than yours, and they are very blue.
One day, he was wearing a rabbit fur coat with the collar up.
He was carrying a green umbrella...
If you met one of those riders, would you go with him?
I bet I would.
...traveling between the past and future.
Eating breakfast on Pluto.
If you met one of those riders, would you go with him?
I bet I would.
And then, Patrick carried... my most favorite luggage to find his Phantom Lady.
When he met the Magician that night, his neck still had a trace of blood...
Patrick is a kid who likes to laugh...
He's always been a kid who likes to laugh
A kid who likes to laugh...
A kid who likes to laugh...
A kid who likes to laugh...
My bracelets!
-Give it back.
-No.
I don't want to...
And there's more...
My ring!
Give it to me...
Give it back...
And there's even more...wait...
And more...
Where are you going?
Where do you want to take me?
I know where you are taking me.
Hold on, I want to play that...
I want to play that.
Brother
Dad, I didn't know you like ice cream.
Actually, I don't like it.
Then why did you bring me here?
I thought you like it.
I don't like it.
I've been here once.
Not with mom...
But with another woman.
I must be a lousy father.
Yes, you're right.
You are!
"My name is J. H. Huang (Yellow Star)"
"I pass by your classroom window often,"
"and I notice you."
Hey, is it that guy with the big head who looks like an alien?
"Maybe you don't know me, but that's ok."
"Didn't Romeo and Juliet fall in love at first sight?"
Oh please, Romeo and Juliet!
That's lame, even the word "sight" is spelled wrong.
"I will patiently wait until that day comes."
"In the meantime,"
"if you look up at the stars,"
"you won't forget me,"
"'cause I'm the brightest star you can see."
"My nickname is "North Star"..."
Can you please stop reading?
Why?
It's such a stupid letter.
Then burn it!
Amy, what do we do?
Do you want to come down?
Why not?
There's no water.
We can still swim without water!
Come down.
-No.
-Come down!
...
Forget it!
Backstroke.
Stupid.
Let me in!
Dad!
I'm home!
I forgot to bring my keys, let me in!
Dad!
I was just doing laundry, look at all these bubbles.
Happy Birthday!
This must be from Xiao-Bu, right?
Do you want to come in and wait for her?
She's not back yet.
No, Xiao-Bu doesn't know I was coming.
So...this cake...
Is from me.
Happy birthday!
Dad!
I'm back.
I forgot my keys, open the door!
Dad!
I'm back!
Happy Birthday!
Dad!
Why didn't you open the door?
I'm leaving.
I'm back.
I'm leaving.
I'm back.
I'm leaving.
I'm back.
I'm leaving.
I'm back.
I'm leaving.
I'm back.
I'm leaving.
I'm back.
I'm leaving.
Xiao-Bu?
Xiao-Bu?
Hello, who is it?
It's me...
Angel
Angel ?
Can you take me out for ice cream?
Didn't you have something to tell me?
Are you going to tell me now?
How could you do that?
He was just going to buy a drink, what's taking him so long?
If you're hungry, just eat don't wait for him.
It's okay, he'll be back soon.
Hello?
What?
What happened?
Okay, I'm sorry...
I'll be right down!
Okay, thanks.
Bye bye.
The manager is asking for the rental.
I'll be right back.
It's me...
Angel
Can you take me out for ice cream?
Ice cream?
...
Now?
Didn't you say I could call you whenever I felt like eating ice cream?
That was... about two years ago.
How about now?
It's the middle of the night.
So?
Are you drunk?
Why haven't you started eating?
Aren't you hungry?
Did you see Amy?
I...
I saw her go downstairs.
She said she was going to pay the rental.
I suppose.
I saw her give the money to the manager.
I already paid it this morning.
Can you come out?
You can't, right?
Because your girlfriend...
or wife is there!
Why me?
Why are you calling me now?
Today... is my birthday and I feel like eating ice cream.
Happy Birthday to you...
Do you want to come out to eat ice cream?
Do you want to come out to eat ice cream?
Who's that?
My daughter.
You're a lousy father.
Come out to eat cream?
...
Happy birthday.
This store's ice cream is great...
I've had it once.
Yeah, me too.
Its really good.
Fuck, it closes too early!
Fuck its ice cream!
Fuck its dance machine!
Fuck its windows!
Fuck the sweater!
Fuck the bandana!
Fuck the nail polish!
Fuck the boots, belts and vitamin B!
Fuck "Happy birthday to you..."
"Happy birthday to you..."
Did I say you could draw me?
Did I say you could borrow my sweater?
No...
How about the striped bandana?
The black nail polish?
The umbrella?
sunglasses?
l-pod?
wine masks, boots, belt, hair clips, lip-gloss, vitamin B...
What exactly are you missing?
!
My boyfriend.
Did I ever say you could borrow him?
Did I?
Did I?
What do you want to know?
Did you two do it?
!
Tell me!
He held my hands, and I didn't refuse...
Then he started to touch my hair...
He said that...
I should get more sun because I'm so pale.
Then... he got closer to me.
He began to kiss my ears...
And you?
What did you do?
I...
I...
laid down on the carpet with my back towards him.
His hands caressed my back.
Then he reached under my shirt.
He tried to undo my bra but I tried to stop him.
I grabbed his hands so he couldn't...
Why?
I don't know why.
I just didn't want him to touch my breasts
But then I lifted up my skirt.
I asked him... if my butt looks big.
He said, "No."
Then I guided his hands...
towards my butt...
His hands... were trembling.
Maybe it was me who was trembling.
Then I laid facedown.
I couldn't see his face...
In the beginning, he used his fingers to caress my clit.
I wanted him to reach further inside.
But he withdrew, not saying a word.
Then...
I heard him loosening his belt.
I told him he couldn't come inside me.
But he didn't answer me.
He pulled down my panties and got on top of me...
He tried to grab my breasts from behind.
I didn't want him to.
I pushed his hands away.
So he grabbed my hands.
Then he came inside me...
Then... he was inside me...
He tried to grab my breast from behind.
I wouldn't let him.
I pushed him away.
He came inside me again...
I wanted him to talk dirty...
But he didn't say anything.
So I pushed him away.
"Talk dirty!" I said.
I commanded again.
He said, "Bitch."
And then he thrust inside me again...
"Whore." And then inside again.
His movements got bigger and bigger.
Bitch!
Slut!
Whore!
Bitch!
Slut!
Filthy cunt!
Whore!
Bitch!
Slut!
Filthy cunt!
Whore!
Bitch!
Slut!
Filthy cunt!
Whore!
Why we went to the empty pool that day?
I don't remember.
Maybe we planned to go for a swim.
But after we went to the pool, we found it was empty.
There was not water, except for some dried leaves.
I sat by the pool.
She...
She walked into the empty pool alone.
She pulled my legs to get me to go in.
But I didn't want to.
I kept on saying no.
She said... "We can still swim."
She looked up at me and said,
"We can still swim..."
"still swim..."
"still swim..."
I sat by the pool.
I just laughed...
laughed... and laughed.
And then... it was her alone in the pool, swimming.
Swimming in the air.
And I just kept laughing and laughing...
She started dancing... in the pool.
I just kept on laughing and laughing.
Laughing...
I don't know why.
It was the way she danced...
She was so lovely.
So lovely...
I wish you could see how gorgeous she was.
Give me a smile.
Give me a smile.
Keep laughing...and laughing... and laughing...
Let's break it down.
Hydrogen.
What does that give us?
By mole, we're looking at 63 percent.
Sixty-three?
That is a big bite.
- My next step's gotta be oxygen.
- Oxygen, 26 percent.
Twenty-six.
There you have your water.
- Carbon, 9 percent.
- Carbon, 9.
- For a total of 98 percent.
- Right.
- Nitrogen, 1.25 percent.
- One-point-two-five.
That brings you to 99 and a quarter.
Which only leaves you with the trace elements down where the magic happens.
Oh, wait a minute.
What about calcium?
Calcium's not a trace.
Got a whole skeleton to account for.
- You would think, right?
- Right.
Calcium.
Calcium's only 0.25 percent.
What?
That low?
Seriously?
Damn, I never would've thought that.
- Okay, so where does iron fit in?
- Iron.
Well, okay, 0.00004 percent.
What?
You can't have haemoglobin without iron.
- Apparently, it don't take much.
- No doubt.
Go figure.
- Sodium.
- Sodium, 0.04.
- Phosphorus, 0.19.
- Point-one-nine.
There we go.
So the whole thing adds up to 99.888042 percent.
We are 0.111958 percent shy.
- Supposedly, that's everything.
- Yeah?
I don't know, I just...
It seems like something's missing, doesn't it?
There's got to be more to a human being than that.
I hate these shoes.
Shoes make me look like I should be changing bedpans like I should be squeaking around bringing soup to some disgusting old person then take the bus home to my 16 cats.
Then why are you wearing them?
I like the support.
My arches happen to be extremely archy.
Yo, what's up?
Hey, can you call me, like, in two minutes?
Thanks, bye.
I gotta go take this.
Female?
Louis.
Not like it's any of your business, though.
- Just be quick about it.
- No.
Oh, and please don't say, "Yo. "
You can't know how much I hate that.
You missed a spot, right there.
Should you be on that ladder?
You're more than welcome to take over for me in here.
I don't see why you don't get Walt to do it.
Yeah, there's an idea.
So I'm working on this new short story and there's this stoner character in it and I'm trying to...
Well, you know, actually, let me back up.
You smoked your fair share of pot in college, didn't you?
I mean, you at least tried it.
Come on.
I perhaps tried it.
Why?
Do you remember it having an effect on your mood?
Like, changing it in any major way?
It made me more serious.
Really?
Because I mostly remember it made me light-headed, that's about it.
I was just wondering if it maybe could...
You know, it's just a character thing I'm stuck on.
Never mind.
- Walter Jr. 's on pot?
- What?
No.
No.
No.
- What would make you even...?
- Where's he getting it?
- Marie.
- Seriously.
Is it this Louis person?
- What are you gonna do about this?
- Marie, you need to look me in the eye.
I am strictly asking about a story that I'm writing, that's all.
Right hand to God, Walter Jr.
Is not on pot certainly not as far as I know.
Not as far as you know?
Marie.
Hey, look at me.
Hey, turn around and look at me.
This here.
I wouldn't do this to my worst enemy.
This is degrading.
I'm sorry.
You hope I'll make it easy and just drop dead, don't you?
But I won't.
So either kill me, or let me go.
You don't have it in you, Walter.
How do you know my name?
Jesse.
He told Emilio and me.
I came by to sell your meth.
So what?
You threaten him, huh?
Did you beat it out of him?
Not even close.
What else did he tell you?
Pretty much everything he could think of.
You were his high school teacher.
One time you taught about carbon dioxide by making grape soda in class.
You have a son who's retarded, or in a wheelchair or something.
It shouldn't come across as some news flash.
That partner of yours he's got a big mouth.
Walter I don't know what you think you're doing here but trust me this line of work doesn't suit you.
So I should just let you go, then.
Just unlock you and... adiós, huh?
I don't see what other choice you have.
It's between that and cold-blooded murder.
Besides your real problem's sitting upstairs.
Occupied.
Hey, yo, I'm trying to pinch one off in here.
Just give me some privacy, would you?
- Okay.
- What the hell, man?
What are you doing, man?
- You asshole.
What...?
- You told him my name.
- Says who, him?
- My name, where I work.
- You told him about my son.
- Hey, don't touch me.
- You damn junkie.
- No, give me that.
That's mine.
This is going down the toilet.
Watch it go.
No, that's worth 40 grand, you...
It's worth nothing when you smoke it all.
Get off the toilet.
- Get off the toilet!
- No.
Get off the toilet.
Stop it.
No.
No way.
No.
No, no, no.
Jesse, where the hell do you think you're going?
Back off, man, Jesus.
- We've got work to do.
- No, no.
You got work to do.
I did my part.
You mean that obscenity I spent hours cleaning up?
- That is your contribution?
- Kiss my pink ass, man.
I didn't ask for any of this.
How am I supposed to live here now, huh?
My whole house smells like toe cheese and dry cleaning.
Because you didn't follow my instructions.
Oh, well, Heil Hitler, bitch.
And let me tell you something else.
We flipped a coin, okay?
You and me.
You and me.
Coin flip is sacred.
Your job is waiting for you in that basement as per the coin.
Fucking do it, already.
That's what she said.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I think we have some of those.
- Yeah, you'll have to try them on.
- Hello?
- Seven and a half, maybe.
I don't know.
- Excuse me.
Do you have these in black?
Anyways, so like I was saying I went to the party the other night.
Yeah, Tony was there.
Whatever.
Hey, where have you been?
I called you two hours ago.
Sorry, baby, I'm kind of busy here.
What's up?
Well, kind of a lot, actually, and it's a delicate subject.
- So I need you to focus, and...
- Hey, sit down!
Sit down!
Damn it, Hank.
I'm sorry, babe, I'm just in the middle of something here.
Get down.
Get down.
Sit down!
Sit your ass down, comprende?
You too, sit down!
I'm back, babe.
What's up?
- Walter Jr.
- Yeah, what about him?
Marijuana.
He's smoking it.
Excuse me, his own mother seems to think so.
- Skyler told you that?
- She inferred it.
She inferred it, huh?
She strongly inferred it.
Like, " Doctor, my friend suffers from erectile dysfunction. "
- Please, come on.
- All right.
- Talk to him.
- Walt should talk to him.
Skyler, better yet.
She'll kick his butt.
I think it ought to be you.
You know, tell him some horror stories.
Maybe show him some autopsy pictures.
An autopsy of a pot overdose?
Come on.
I don't know, baby, it's just that, you know I figure his dad should be the one doing this, don't you think?
Hank, he respects you.
Yeah, all right.
Well, listen, yeah, I'll swing by their place after work.
- Good.
Scare him straight.
- Yeah, yeah.
Hey, where's my sugar?
Excuse me, ma'am.
Ma'am, you need to be wearing footies before you try those on.
I'm extremely clean.
Yeah, well, I'd really appreciate it.
Hey, sorry about that.
Yeah, I'll check.
You know, I hid a pair for you last week, grey ones.
- What do you think?
- About what?
This look like a nice place?
No, not really.
Think you'd like to live here?
No.
- Sure about that?
- Yeah, pretty sure.
I thought we were going to Cold Stone Creamery.
Yeah, yeah, well, we took a little detour.
Figure we'll come over and check out how the other half lives.
This here is what we call the Crystal Palace.
You know who lives in the palace?
Meth-heads.
Nasty, skeevy meth-heads who'd sell their grandma's coochie for a hit.
Oh, you think that's funny?
That's funny, huh?
Yeah.
Let me tell you something.
Every one of these miserable wastes of skin got started how?
- How do you think they started?
- I don't know.
What do you think they were doing before they graduated to shooting meth in their dicks?
A gateway drug.
That's what we call it.
Dollars to doughnuts, and I shit you not that gateway drug was marijuana, every time.
- You understand?
- Yeah.
So why are you telling me this?
Because I love you, you little bastard.
And, hey, I was young once, you know.
The world's a messed up place, you know.
You know, just this one time, you know...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, you!
Yeah, you, princess.
Get over here.
Hey, don't make me get out of the car.
Check this out.
What I'm talking about.
- I ain't holding, okay?
- Did I say open your mouth?
And hands off the car.
Other side.
Go around the other side, talk to my friend here.
What's your name, sweetheart?
- Wendy.
- Wendy, huh?
How much you charge for a windy, Wendy?
- I ain't doing him, he's a kid.
- Jesus, was that my question?
Don't think so hard, it's gonna hurt your brain.
- Are you on the pipe or on the needle?
- Nothing.
Neither.
Yeah, yeah.
Show us your teeth, huh?
Come on, Wendy, let's see those pearly whites.
Oh, God.
See that?
Pipe, definitely.
Big time, big time on the pipe.
You got something you wanna ask Wendy?
No, not really.
You ever smoke anything else, Wendy?
Sausages don't count.
Seriously, tell my friend here how you got started.
Probably used to be, what?
Like a Girl Scout, or sang in the church choir.
- What are you, like, handicapped?
- He broke his leg playing football.
He's a qb.
Got an arm like a howitzer.
So tell me, Wendy, you smoke pot?
Why, you got some?
No.
Right, hoof it, get lost.
Get out of here.
Hey, fair warning, next time I'm gonna bust you.
So, what do you think?
Cool.
Shut the door.
Shut the door.
Lock it.
Lock it, lock it.
Who the hell was that?
Cop and some football player messing with me.
They ask about me, huh?
No, I think they just wanted pot.
Right there.
Shit, I left my root beer.
- Hello?
- Hey, sweetie, it's me.
Listen, I'm so sorry.
Time, it just completely got away from me.
I'm just...
My fault, my fault.
Bogdan just kept me here late you know, doing some inventory and I should've just...
You know, you're right.
I gotta learn to say, you know, "No. "
But...
Sky?
You there?
You're at the car wash?
Yeah.
I seriously doubt that, since you quit two weeks ago.
I called Bogdan, looking for you.
Quite an earful he gave me.
Listen...
Listen, I'll come home and we'll talk about it.
- I don't think so, Walt.
- Honey...
Wherever you are why don't you just stay there tonight?
Skyler?
Walter?
Hello?
Hey, there's a hungry guy here.
Come on.
Damn.
I didn't think you were coming back.
How long was I out?
Ten, 15 minutes?
I've never seen someone knock themselves out just by coughing.
Were you on the same shit you used on me?
I've got lung cancer.
I'll make you another sandwich.
It's safe.
There's no poison.
Because that would be the way to do it if you're gonna do it.
I suppose it would.
You being a chemist and all.
So that name Krazy-8.
Do I really have to call you that?
I mean, no offence, but don't you have a real name?
Domingo.
Domingo.
That's "Sunday," right?
I'd rather call you that, if you don't mind.
I can't say I ever liked it much.
So, Domingo you from around town here or someplace else?
Hey, Walter?
You getting to know me is not gonna make it easier for you to kill me.
Not that I mind, you understand?
You know, you keep telling me that I don't have it in me.
Well, maybe.
But maybe not.
I sure as hell am looking for any reason not to.
I mean, any good reason at all.
Sell me.
Tell me what it is.
I'd start off by promising that if you let me go I won't come after you, that you'd be safe.
I guess I'd say what happened between us never happened.
And what's best for both parties is we forget all about it.
But you know anybody in my situation would make promises like that.
And, in my case, they happen to be true.
You'll never know for sure.
So, what else can I tell you?
I don't know.
But you've gotta convince me.
And you're going nowhere until you do.
- Hey, yeah.
- Yeah.
I'm from here in town, man.
ABQ, born and bred.
Never left.
Studied Business Administration over at UNM got my degree.
Really?
Does that come in handy in the drug trade?
Doesn't hurt.
I was gonna study music originally.
Maybe even try out for Oberlin and Berklee.
My pops talked me out of it.
Said there was no money in it unless I wind up some bullshit rock star and I hadn't a snowball chance at that one.
What does your dad do?
He owns Tampico Furniture over on Menaul.
Wait a minute, I know that place.
Wait a minute.
That's...
That's that...
They used to have those late-night...
- The stupid commercials.
- That they had, yeah.
Yeah, that's him.
Been doing them for over 30 years.
Wait a minute.
How did it go?
It was...
Wait, wait, wait.
It was...
Don't let shopping Strain your brain-o
Just sing this short refrain-o
- Our furniture is bueno
- Our furniture is bueno
- Tampico is the name- o
- Tampico is the name- o
Pretty moronic.
But what can you do?
Well, it did tend to stick in your head.
Did you write that?
Being the musician in the family.
Oh, no, man.
It was my crazy uncle Alex.
He sings it at bars, trying to pick up on women.
His mind, it's like saying, "Hey, I wrote 'Stairway to Heaven. "'
Yeah, but at Tampico Furniture, I...
I think when my son was born that we bought his bassinet there.
We don't sell bassinets there.
It's more of a speciality item.
We did use to sell cribs.
A crib, then, okay.
A crib.
Yeah.
No, I remember that.
In fact, I remember recognising your dad from those commercials.
Although, he wasn't anywhere near as friendly in real life.
Yeah.
No shit.
Did he try selling you that extended warranty?
Yeah, he probably did.
And I was probably dumb enough to buy it.
Yeah, that was his big thing.
You ask him for a glass of water he'd tell you you need an extended warranty on the ice.
- Did you work there too?
- Only my whole life.
Up until the day I said, "Fuck you," and quit.
So 16 years ago, how old would you have been?
If it was after school, trust me, I was there.
Might have even helped ring you up.
You and your extended warranty on the crib.
Small world.
It is.
The paths we take, huh?
Jesse know you've got cancer?
No one but you.
- Not your family?
- No.
Why not?
Not a conversation that I'm even remotely ready to have.
That's why you're cooking meth?
You wanna leave money for your family.
Hell.
I'll write you a cheque right now if you let me go.
Like I said, Walter if this line of work doesn't suit you get out before it's too late.
I don't know what to do.
You do.
I'll get the key.
No.
No.
Oh, no, no, no.
No.
No, don't do this.
Don't do this.
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?
You're doing the right thing, Walter.
Do you wanna?
So you're not angry?
Angry at you?
Live and let live, man.
That's very understanding.
Whatever, man.
I just wanna go home.
Me too.
Unlock me, Walter.
The moment I do are you gonna stick me with that broken piece of plate?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Hello?
Anybody down here?
Everybody I need you all to take your seats.
Settle down, please.
Thank you.
I understand that Mr. White is feeling a little under the weather this morning.
So you folks are going to have to be making do with me today.
And we are going to be watching a very interesting video on carbon.
Very important stuff.
- So, what do you think?
- It's a cook site.
Gotta be.
Nobody came way the hell out here just to buy.
Fire there could have started by accident.
I don't think that was meant to destroy evidence.
Got a couple of Dooley tracks headed away, towards the road.
So, what, they're in some sort of camper-slash-lab?
They accidentally start a fire and everybody FOs?
Yeah.
Why not?
So why did that little hair-gelled shit leave his car?
- Gomey, it's a culture in decline.
- It's a rich and vibrant culture.
It's a car that jumps up and down.
What the hell?
You people used to be conquistadors, for chrissake.
Smells like a Drakkar Noir factory in here.
I already searched it.
Yeah.
You're wasting your time.
Give it up.
If this here's a trap car, it's gonna take more than your dumb white ass to find it.
- Oh, yeah?
You are talking to the trap-car master, my friend.
I'm Rain Man counting his toothpicks.
Yeah, you're like Rain Man.
Retarded.
Yeah, baby.
- Hello, zippy.
- Asshole.
Sort of looks like meth but it's too damn white.
You know what I'm thinking, Gomey?
Yep.
Somebody croaked our snitch.
Hey, agent.
You got something?
I don't know.
It just...
Doesn't it seem like something's missing?
What about the soul?
The soul.
There's nothing but chemistry here.
Skyler?
There's something I have to tell you.
Let's break it down.
Hydrogen.
What does that give us?
By mole, we're looking at 63 percent.
Sixty-three?
Wow.
Mm-hm.
That is a big bite.
My next step's gotta be oxygen.
Oxygen, 26 percent.
Twenty-six.
There you have your water.
Carbon, 9 percent.
Carbon, 9.
For a total of 98 percent.
Right.
Nitrogen, 1.25 percent.
One-point-two-five.
That brings you to 99 and a quarter.
Which only leaves you with the trace elements down where the magic happens.
Oh, wait a minute.
What about calcium?
Calcium's not a trace.
Got a whole skeleton to account for.
You would think, right?
Right.
Calcium.
Calcium's only 0.25 percent.
What?
That low?
Uh-huh.
Mm-hm.
Seriously?
Damn, I never would've thought that.
Okay, so where does iron fit in?
Iron.
Wow, okay, 0.00004 percent.
What?
You can't have hemoglobin without iron.
Apparently, it don't take much.
No doubt.
Go figure.
Ah, sodium.
Sodium, 0.04.
Phosphorus, 0.19.
Point-one-nine.
There we go.
So the whole thing adds up to... 99.888042 percent.
We are 0.111958 percent shy.
Supposedly that's everything.
Yeah?
Mm-hm.
I don't know, it just...
It just...
It seems like something's missing, doesn't it?
There's got to be more to a human being than that.
I hate these shoes.
Shoes make me look like I should be changing bedpans, like I should be squeaking around bringing soup to some disgusting old person, then take the bus home to my 16 cats.
Then why are you wearing them?
I like the support.
My arches happen to be extremely archy.
Yo, what's up?
Hey, can you call me, like, in two minutes?
Thanks, bye.
I gotta go take this.
Ooh.
Female?
Louis.
Not like it's any of your business, though.
Just be quick about it.
No.
Oh, and, um, please don't say, "Yo. "
You can't know how much I hate that.
You missed a spot, right there.
Should you be up on that ladder?
You're more than welcome to take over for me up here.
I don't see why you don't get Walt to do it.
Yeah, there's an idea.
So um, I'm, uh, I'm working on this new short story and there's this stoner character in it and I'm trying to... um...
Well, you know, actually, let me back up.
Um, you, uh, you smoked your fair share of pot in college, didn't you?
I mean, you at least tried it.
Come on.
I perhaps tried it.
Why?
Do you remember it having an effect on your mood?
Like, changing it in any major way?
It made me more serious.
Really?
Because I mostly remember it made me lightheaded, that's about it.
I was just wondering if-
If it maybe could, um...
Um, you know, it's just a character thing I'm stuck on.
Never mind.
Walter Jr. 's on pot?
What?
No.
No.
No.
What would make you even-?
Where's he getting it?
Marie.
Seriously.
Is it this Louis person?
What are you gonna do about this?
Marie, you need to look me in the eye.
I am strictly asking about a story that I'm writing, that's all.
Right hand to God, Walter Jr. is not on pot, certainly not as far as I know.
Not as far as you know?
Marie.
Hey, look at me.
Hey, turn around and look at me.
This...
This here.
I wouldn't do this to my worst enemy.
This is degrading.
I'm sorry.
You hope I'll make it easy and just drop dead, don't you?
But I won't.
So either kill me, or let me go.
You don't have it in you, Walter.
How do you know my name?
Jesse.
He told Emilio and me.
I came by to sell your meth.
So, what, did you threaten him, huh?
Did you beat it out of him?
Not even close.
What else did he tell you?
Pretty much everything he could think of.
You were his high-school teacher.
One time you taught about carbon dioxide by making grape soda in class.
You have a son who's retarded, or in a wheelchair or something.
It shouldn't come across as some news flash.
That partner of yours, he's got a big mouth.
Walter,
I don't know what you think you're doing here, but trust me this line of work doesn't suit you.
So I should just let you go, then?
Just unlock you and adiós, huh?
I don't see what real choice you have.
If it's between that and cold-blooded murder.
Besides... your real problem's sitting upstairs.
Occupied.
Hey, yo, I'm trying to pinch one off in here.
Just give me some privacy, would you?
Okay.
What the hell, man?
What are you doing, man?
You asshole.
What-?
You told him my name.
Says who, him?
My name, where I work.
You told him about my son.
Hey, don't touch me.
Damn junkie.
No, give me that.
That's mine.
This is going down the toilet.
Watch it go.
No, that's worth 40 grand, you-
It's worth nothing when you smoke it all.
Get off the toilet.
Get off the toilet!
No.
Get off the toilet.
Stop it.
No.
No way.
No.
No, no, no.
Jesse, where the hell do you think you're going?
Back off, man.
Jesus.
We've got work to do.
No, no.
You
- You got work to do.
I did my part.
You mean that obscenity I spent the last two hours cleaning up?
That is your contribution?
Kiss my pink ass, man.
I didn't ask for any of this.
How am I supposed to live here now, huh?
My whole house smells like toe cheese and dry cleaning.
Because you didn't follow my instructions.
Oh, well, Heil Hitler, bitch.
And let me tell you something else.
We flipped a coin, okay?
You and me.
You and me.
Coin flip is sacred.
Your job is waiting for you in that basement as per the coin.
Fucking do it, already.
That's what she said.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I think we have some of those.
Yeah, you'll have to try 'em on.
Hello?
Seven and a half, maybe.
I don't know.
Excuse me.
Do you have these in black?
Mm-mm.
Anyways, so like I was saying
I went to the party the other night.
Yeah, Tony was there.
Whatever.
Hey, where have you been?
I called you two hours ago.
Sorry, baby, I'm, uh, kind of busy here.
What's up?
Well, kind of a lot, actually, and it's a delicate subject.
So I need you to focus, and-
Hey, sit down!
Sit down!
Damn it, Hank.
I'm sorry, babe, I'm just in the middle of something here.
Get down.
Get down.
Sit down!
Sit your ass down, comprende?
You too, sit down!
Shit.
I'm back, babe.
What's up?
Walter Jr.
Yeah, what about him?
Marijuana.
He's smoking it.
Bullshit.
Excuse me, his own mother seems to think so.
Skyler told you that?
She inferred it.
She inferred it, huh?
She strongly inferred it.
Like, "Doctor, my friend suffers from erectile dysfunction. "
Please, come on.
All right.
I want you to talk to him.
Walt should talk to him.
Hell, Skyler, better yet.
She'll kick his butt.
I think it ought to be you.
You know, tell him some horror stories.
Maybe show him some autopsy pictures.
An autopsy of a pot overdose?
Come on.
I don't know, baby, it's just that, you know,
I figure his dad should be the one doing this, don't you think?
Hank, he respects you.
Yeah, all right.
Well, listen, I mean,
I'll swing by their place after work.
Good.
Scare him straight.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, where's my sugar?
Hm.
Muah.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Ma'am, you need to be wearing footies before you try those on.
I'm extremely clean.
Yeah, well, I'd really appreciate it.
Hey, sorry about that.
Yeah, I'll check.
You know, I hid a pair for you last week, gray ones.
My manager found them and we put them back on the floor.
I know.
Hey.
I'm going.
What do you think?
About what?
This look like a nice place?
No, not really.
Think you'd like to live here?
No.
Sure about that?
Yeah, pretty sure.
I thought we were going to Cold Stone Creamery.
Yeah, yeah, well, we took a little detour.
Figure we'll come over and check out how the other half lives.
This here is what we call the Crystal Palace.
You know who lives in the palace?

You understand?
Um, yeah.
So why are you telling me this?

And, hey, I was young once, you know.
The world's a messed-up place, you know.
You know, just this, uh, one time, you know...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, you!
Yeah, you, princess.
Get over here.
Hey, don't make me get out of the car.
Check this out.
See what I'm talking about.
Hey, I ain't holding, okay?
Did I say open your mouth?
And hands off the car.
Other side.
Go around the other side, talk to my friend here.
What's your name, sweetheart?
Wendy.
Wendy, huh?

He broke his leg playing football.
He's a qb.
Got an arm like a howitzer.

All right, hoof it, get lost.
Get out of here.
Hey, fair warning, next time I'm gonna bust you.

Skyler?
Skyler?
Skyler?
Walter?
Hello?
Hey, I'm kind of hungry down here.
Oh.
Come on.
Damn.
I didn't think you were coming back.
How long was I out?
Ten, 15 minutes?
I've never seen someone knock themselves out just by coughing.
You breathe in the same shit you used on me?
I've got lung cancer.

Yeah.
You do.
I'll get the key.
No.
Oh, no, no, no.
No.
No.
No, don't do this.
Don't do this.
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?
You're doing the right thing, Walter.
Yeah?
Do you wanna?
So you're not angry?
What do you mean?
Angry at you?
No.
Live and let live, man.
That's very understanding.
Whatever, man.
I just wanna go home.
Yeah.
Me too.
Unlock me, Walter.
The moment I do... are you gonna stick me with that broken piece of plate?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Hello?
Anybody down here?
Everybody,
I need you all to take your seats.
Settle down, please.
Thank you.
I understand that Mr. White is feeling a little under the weather this morning.
So you folks are going to have to be making do with me today.
And we are going to be watching a very interesting video on carbon
Very important stuff.
So, what do you think?
Ah, it's a cook site.
Gotta be.
Nobody came way the hell out here just to buy.
Fire there could have started by accident.
I don't think that was meant to destroy evidence.
Got a couple of Dooley tracks headed away, towards the road.
So, what, they're in some sort of camper-slash-lab?
They accidentally start a fire and everybody FOs?
Yeah.
Why not?
So why did that little hair-gelled shit leave his car?
Ay-yi-yi.
Gomey, it's a culture in decline.
It's a rich and vibrant culture.
It's a car that jumps up and down.
What the hell?
You people used to be conquistadors, for chrissake.
Smells like a Drakkar Noir factory in here.
I already searched it.
Yeah.
You're wasting your time.
Give it up.
If this here's a trap car, it's gonna take more than your dumb white ass to find it.
Oh, yeah?
You are talking to the trap-car master, my friend.
I'm Rain Man counting his toothpicks.
Yeah, you're like Rain Man.
Retarded.
Yeah, baby.
Hello, zippy.
Asshole.
Sort of looks like meth but it's, uh, it's too damn white.
You know what I'm thinking, Gomey?
Yep.
Somebody croaked our snitch.
Hey, agents.
You got something?
I don't know.
It just...
It just...
Doesn't it seem like something's missing?
What about the soul?
The soul.
There's nothing but chemistry here.
Skyler?
There's something I have to tell you.
Subs collected, corrected and if necessary adapted by TRONAR for "Breaking Bad Season 1, 2, 3, 4 5 + Extras BDRip DVDRip HDTV TSV"
Let's break it down.
Hydrogen.
What does that give us?
By mole, we're looking at 63 percent.
Sixty-three?
That is a big bite.
- My next step's gotta be oxygen.
- Oxygen, 26 percent.
Twenty-six.
There you have your water.
- Carbon, 9 percent.
- Carbon, 9.
- For a total of 98 percent.
- Right.
- Nitrogen, 1.25 percent.
- One-point-two-five.
That brings you to 99 and a quarter.
Which only leaves you with the trace elements down where the magic happens.
Oh, wait a minute.
What about calcium?
Calcium's not a trace.
Got a whole skeleton to account for.
- You would think, right?
- Right.
Calcium.
Calcium's only 0.25 percent.
What?
That low?
Seriously?
Damn, I never would've thought that.
- Okay, so where does iron fit in?
- Iron.
Well, okay, 0.00004 percent.
What?
You can't have haemoglobin without iron.
- Apparently, it don't take much.
- No doubt.
Go figure.
- Sodium.
- Sodium, 0.04.
- Phosphorus, 0.19.
- Point-one-nine.
There we go.
So the whole thing adds up to 99.888042 percent.
We are 0.111958 percent shy.
- Supposedly, that's everything.
- Yeah?
I don't know, I just...
It seems like something's missing, doesn't it?
There's got to be more to a human being than that.
I hate these shoes.
Shoes make me look like I should be changing bedpans like I should be squeaking around bringing soup to some disgusting old person then take the bus home to my 16 cats.
Then why are you wearing them?
I like the support.
My arches happen to be extremely archy.
Yo, what's up?
Hey, can you call me, like, in two minutes?
Thanks, bye.
I gotta go take this.
Female?
Louis.
Not like it's any of your business, though.
- Just be quick about it.
- No.
Oh, and please don't say, "Yo."
You can't know how much I hate that.
You missed a spot, right there.
Should you be on that ladder?
You're more than welcome to take over for me in here.
I don't see why you don't get Walt to do it.
Yeah, there's an idea.
So I'm working on this new short story and there's this stoner character in it and I'm trying to...
Well, you know, actually, let me back up.
You smoked your fair share of pot in college, didn't you?
I mean, you at least tried it.
Come on.
I perhaps tried it.
Why?
Do you remember it having an effect on your mood?
Like, changing it in any major way?
It made me more serious.
Really?
Because I mostly remember it made me light-headed, that's about it.
I was just wondering if it maybe could...
You know, it's just a character thing I'm stuck on.
Never mind.
- Walter Jr.'s on pot?
- What?
No.
No.
No.
- What would make you even...?
- Where's he getting it?
- Marie.
- Seriously.
Is it this Louis person?
- What are you gonna do about this?
- Marie, you need to look me in the eye.
I am strictly asking about a story that I'm writing, that's all.
Right hand to God, Walter Jr.
Is not on pot certainly not as far as I know.
Not as far as you know?
Marie.
Hey, look at me.
Hey, turn around and look at me.
This here.
I wouldn't do this to my worst enemy.
This is degrading.
I'm sorry.
You hope I'll make it easy and just drop dead, don't you?
But I won't.
So either kill me, or let me go.
You don't have it in you, Walter.
How do you know my name?
Jesse.
He told Emilio and me.
I came by to sell your meth.
So what?
You threaten him, huh?
Did you beat it out of him?
Not even close.
What else did he tell you?
Pretty much everything he could think of.
You were his high school teacher.
One time you taught about carbon dioxide by making grape soda in class.
You have a son who's retarded, or in a wheelchair or something.
It shouldn't come across as some news flash.
That partner of yours he's got a big mouth.
Walter I don't know what you think you're doing here but trust me this line of work doesn't suit you.
So I should just let you go, then.
Just unlock you and... adiós, huh?
I don't see what other choice you have.
It's between that and cold-blooded murder.
Besides your real problem's sitting upstairs.
Occupied.
Hey, yo, I'm trying to pinch one off in here.
Just give me some privacy, would you?
- Okay.
- What the hell, man?
What are you doing, man?
- You asshole.
What...?
- You told him my name.
- Says who, him?
- My name, where I work.
- You told him about my son.
- Hey, don't touch me.
- You damn junkie.
- No, give me that.
That's mine.
This is going down the toilet.
Watch it go.
No, that's worth 40 grand, you...
It's worth nothing when you smoke it all.
Get off the toilet.
- Get off the toilet!
- No.
Get off the toilet.
Stop it.
No.
No way.
No.
No, no, no.
Jesse, where the hell do you think you're going?
Back off, man, Jesus.
- We've got work to do.
- No, no.
You got work to do.
I did my part.
You mean that obscenity I spent hours cleaning up?
- That is your contribution?
- Kiss my pink ass, man.
I didn't ask for any of this.
How am I supposed to live here now, huh?
My whole house smells like toe cheese and dry cleaning.
Because you didn't follow my instructions.
Oh, well, Heil Hitler, bitch.
And let me tell you something else.
We flipped a coin, okay?
You and me.
You and me.
Coin flip is sacred.
Your job is waiting for you in that basement as per the coin.
Fucking do it, already.
That's what she said.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I think we have some of those.
- Yeah, you'll have to try them on.
- Hello?
- Seven and a half, maybe.
I don't know.
- Excuse me.
Do you have these in black?
Anyways, so like I was saying I went to the party the other night.
Yeah, Tony was there.
Whatever.
Hey, where have you been?
I called you two hours ago.
Sorry, baby, I'm kind of busy here.
What's up?
Well, kind of a lot, actually, and it's a delicate subject.
- So I need you to focus, and...
- Hey, sit down!
Sit down!
Damn it, Hank.
I'm sorry, babe, I'm just in the middle of something here.
Get down.
Get down.
Sit down!
Sit your ass down, comprende?
You too, sit down!
I'm back, babe.
What's up?
- Walter Jr.
- Yeah, what about him?
Marijuana.
He's smoking it.
Excuse me, his own mother seems to think so.
- Skyler told you that?
- She inferred it.
She inferred it, huh?
She strongly inferred it.
Like, " Doctor, my friend suffers from erectile dysfunction."
- Please, come on.
- All right.
- Talk to him.
- Walt should talk to him.
Skyler, better yet.
She'll kick his butt.
I think it ought to be you.
You know, tell him some horror stories.
Maybe show him some autopsy pictures.
An autopsy of a pot overdose?
Come on.
I don't know, baby, it's just that, you know I figure his dad should be the one doing this, don't you think?
Hank, he respects you.
Yeah, all right.
Well, listen, yeah, I'll swing by their place after work.
- Good.
Scare him straight.
- Yeah, yeah.
Hey, where's my sugar?
Excuse me, ma'am.
Ma'am, you need to be wearing footies before you try those on.
I'm extremely clean.
Yeah, well, I'd really appreciate it.
Hey, sorry about that.
Yeah, I'll check.
You know, I hid a pair for you last week, grey ones.
- What do you think?
- About what?
This look like a nice place?
No, not really.
Think you'd like to live here?
No.
- Sure about that?
- Yeah, pretty sure.
I thought we were going to Cold Stone Creamery.
Yeah, yeah, well, we took a little detour.
Figure we'll come over and check out how the other half lives.
This here is what we call the Crystal Palace.
You know who lives in the palace?
Meth-heads.
Nasty, skeevy meth-heads who'd sell their grandma's coochie for a hit.
Oh, you think that's funny?
That's funny, huh?
Yeah.
Let me tell you something.
Every one of these miserable wastes of skin got started how?
- How do you think they started?
- I don't know.
What do you think they were doing before they graduated to shooting meth in their dicks?
A gateway drug.
That's what we call it.
Dollars to doughnuts, and I shit you not that gateway drug was marijuana, every time.
- You understand?
- Yeah.
So why are you telling me this?
Because I love you, you little bastard.
And, hey, I was young once, you know.
The world's a messed up place, you know.
You know, just this one time, you know...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, you!
Yeah, you, princess.
Get over here.
Hey, don't make me get out of the car.
Check this out.
What I'm talking about.
- I ain't holding, okay?
- Did I say open your mouth?
And hands off the car.
Other side.
Go around the other side, talk to my friend here.
What's your name, sweetheart?
- Wendy.
- Wendy, huh?
How much you charge for a windy, Wendy?
- I ain't doing him, he's a kid.
- Jesus, was that my question?
Don't think so hard, it's gonna hurt your brain.
- Are you on the pipe or on the needle?
- Nothing.
Neither.
Yeah, yeah.
Show us your teeth, huh?
Come on, Wendy, let's see those pearly whites.
Oh, God.
See that?
Pipe, definitely.
Big time, big time on the pipe.
You got something you wanna ask Wendy?
No, not really.
You ever smoke anything else, Wendy?
Sausages don't count.
Seriously, tell my friend here how you got started.
Probably used to be, what?
Like a Girl Scout, or sang in the church choir.
- What are you, like, handicapped?
- He broke his leg playing football.
He's a qb.
Got an arm like a howitzer.
So tell me, Wendy, you smoke pot?
Why, you got some?
No.
Right, hoof it, get lost.
Get out of here.
Hey, fair warning, next time I'm gonna bust you.
So, what do you think?
Cool.
Shut the door.
Shut the door.
Lock it.
Lock it, lock it.
Who the hell was that?
Cop and some football player messing with me.
They ask about me, huh?
No, I think they just wanted pot.
Right there.
Shit, I left my root beer.
- Hello?
- Hey, sweetie, it's me.
Listen, I'm so sorry.
Time, it just completely got away from me.
I'm just...
My fault, my fault.
Bogdan just kept me here late you know, doing some inventory and I should've just...
You know, you're right.
I gotta learn to say, you know, "No."
But...
Sky?
You there?
You're at the car wash?
Yeah.
I seriously doubt that, since you quit two weeks ago.
I called Bogdan, looking for you.
Quite an earful he gave me.
Listen...
Listen, I'll come home and we'll talk about it.
- I don't think so, Walt.
- Honey...
Wherever you are why don't you just stay there tonight?
Skyler?
Walter?
Hello?
Hey, there's a hungry guy here.
Come on.
Damn.
I didn't think you were coming back.
How long was I out?
Ten, 15 minutes?
I've never seen someone knock themselves out just by coughing.
Were you on the same shit you used on me?
I've got lung cancer.
I'll make you another sandwich.
It's safe.
There's no poison.
Because that would be the way to do it if you're gonna do it.
I suppose it would.
You being a chemist and all.
So that name Krazy-8.
Do I really have to call you that?
I mean, no offence, but don't you have a real name?
Domingo.
Domingo.
That's "Sunday," right?
I'd rather call you that, if you don't mind.
I can't say I ever liked it much.
So, Domingo you from around town here or someplace else?
Hey, Walter?
You getting to know me is not gonna make it easier for you to kill me.
Not that I mind, you understand?
You know, you keep telling me that I don't have it in me.
Well, maybe.
But maybe not.
I sure as hell am looking for any reason not to.
I mean, any good reason at all.
Sell me.
Tell me what it is.
I'd start off by promising that if you let me go I won't come after you, that you'd be safe.
I guess I'd say what happened between us never happened.
And what's best for both parties is we forget all about it.
But you know anybody in my situation would make promises like that.
And, in my case, they happen to be true.
You'll never know for sure.
So, what else can I tell you?
I don't know.
But you've gotta convince me.
And you're going nowhere until you do.
- Hey, yeah.
- Yeah.
I'm from here in town, man.
ABQ, born and bred.
Never left.
Studied Business Administration over at UNM got my degree.
Really?
Does that come in handy in the drug trade?
Doesn't hurt.
I was gonna study music originally.
Maybe even try out for Oberlin and Berklee.
My pops talked me out of it.
Said there was no money in it unless I wind up some bullshit rock star and I hadn't a snowball chance at that one.
What does your dad do?
He owns Tampico Furniture over on Menaul.
Wait a minute, I know that place.
Wait a minute.
That's...
That's that...
They used to have those late-night...
- The stupid commercials.
- That they had, yeah.
Yeah, that's him.
Been doing them for over 30 years.
Wait a minute.
How did it go?
It was...
Wait, wait, wait.
It was...
Don't let shopping Strain your brain-o
Just sing this short refrain-o
- Our furniture is bueno
- Our furniture is bueno
- Tampico is the name-o
- Tampico is the name-o
Pretty moronic.
But what can you do?
Well, it did tend to stick in your head.
Did you write that?
Being the musician in the family.
Oh, no, man.
It was my crazy uncle Alex.
He sings it at bars, trying to pick up on women.
His mind, it's like saying, "Hey, I wrote 'Stairway to Heaven. "'
Yeah, but at Tampico Furniture, I...
I think when my son was born that we bought his bassinet there.
We don't sell bassinets there.
It's more of a speciality item.
We did use to sell cribs.
A crib, then, okay.
A crib.
Yeah.
No, I remember that.
In fact, I remember recognising your dad from those commercials.
Although, he wasn't anywhere near as friendly in real life.
Yeah.
No shit.
Did he try selling you that extended warranty?
Yeah, he probably did.
And I was probably dumb enough to buy it.
Yeah, that was his big thing.
You ask him for a glass of water he'd tell you you need an extended warranty on the ice.
- Did you work there too?
- Only my whole life.
Up until the day I said, "Fuck you," and quit.
So 16 years ago, how old would you have been?
If it was after school, trust me, I was there.
Might have even helped ring you up.
You and your extended warranty on the crib.
Small world.
It is.
The paths we take, huh?
Jesse know you've got cancer?
No one but you.
- Not your family?
- No.
Why not?
Not a conversation that I'm even remotely ready to have.
That's why you're cooking meth?
You wanna leave money for your family.
Hell.
I'll write you a cheque right now if you let me go.
Like I said, Walter if this line of work doesn't suit you get out before it's too late.
I don't know what to do.
You do.
I'll get the key.
No.
No.
Oh, no, no, no.
No.
No, don't do this.
Don't do this.
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?
You're doing the right thing, Walter.
Do you wanna?
So you're not angry?
Angry at you?
Live and let live, man.
That's very understanding.
Whatever, man.
I just wanna go home.
Me too.
Unlock me, Walter.
The moment I do are you gonna stick me with that broken piece of plate?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

No, you got work to do.
I did my part.
You mean that obscenity that I spent the last two hours cleaning up?
- That is your contribution?
- Yo!
Kiss my pink ass, man!
I didn't ask for any of this!
How am I supposed to live here now, huh?
My whole house smells like toe cheese and dry cleaning.
Because you didn't follow my instructions!
Oh, well, hell Hitler, bitch.
And let me tell you something else.
We flipped a coin, okay?
You and me.
You and me!
Coin flip is sacred.
Damn it.
Your job is waiting for you in that basement, as per the coin.
Fucking do it already.
That's what she said.
Yeah, I think we have some of those.
Yeah, you'll have to try them on.
- Hello.
- 7½, maybe.
I don't know.
Excuse me.
Do you have these in black?
Anyway, so like I was saying, I went to the party the other night.
Yeah, Tony was there.
Hey, where have you been?
I called you two hours ago.
Sorry, baby.
I'm kinda busy here.
What's up?
Kind of a lot, actually, and it's a delicate subject, so I need you to focus and...
Hey, sit down!
Sit down!
Damn it, Hank.
Well, sorry, babe.
I'm just...
I'm kind of in the middle of something here.
Sit down!
Sit your ass down!
Comprende?
You, too!
Sit down!
Siéntete!
I'm back, baby.
What's up?
Walter Jr.
Yeah, what about him?
Marijuana.
- He's smoking it.
- Bullshit.
Excuse me.
His own mother seems to think so.
- Skyler told you that?
- She inferred it.
She inferred it, huh?
She strongly inferred it, like...
"Doctor, my friend suffers from erectile dysfunction."
Please, come on already.
I want you to talk to him.
Walt should.
Skyler, better yet.
She'll kick his butt up and down the block.
I think it ought to be you.
You know, tell him some horror stories.
Maybe show him some autopsy pictures.
What, autopsy for a pot overdose?
Come on.
I don't know, baby.
It's just that, you know...
I figure his dad should be the one doing this thing, don't you think?
Hank, he respects you.
Yeah, all right.
Well, listen, I'll swing by their place after work.
Good.
Scare him straight.
Where's my sugar?
Excuse me, ma'am.
Ma'am.
You need to be wearing footies before you try those on.
I'm extremely clean.
Yeah, well, I'd really appreciate it.
Hey, sorry about that.
Yeah, I'll check.
You know, I hid a pair for you last week, gray ones, but my manager found them, and we had to put them back on the floor.
What do you think?
About what?
This look like a nice place?
No, not really.
Think you'd like to live here?
No.
- You sure about that?
- Yeah, pretty sure.
I thought we were going to Cold Stone Creamery.
Well, a little detour.
Figured we'd come over here and check out how the other half lives.
This here's what we call the Crystal Palace.
Now you know who lives in the palace?
Meth-heads.
Nasty, skeevy, meth-heads who'd sell their grandma's coochie for a hit.
Oh, you think that's funny?
That's funny, huh?
Yeah.
Well, let me tell you something.
Every last one of these miserable wastes of skin got started how?
- How do you think they got started?
- I don't know.
What do you think it was they were all doing before they graduated to shooting meth in their...?
A gateway drug.
That's what we call it.
Dollars to doughnuts, and I shit you not, that gateway drug was marijuana.
Every time.
- You understand?
- Um, yeah.
So why are you telling me this?
'Cause I love you, you little bastard.
Hey, I was young once, you know?
The world's a messed up place, you know?
You know, there was this... this one time when...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, you!
Yeah, you, princess!
Get over here!
Don't make me get out of the car!
Check this out.
See what I'm talking about.
- I ain't holding', okay?
- Did I say you could open your mouth?
And hands of the car.
Other side.
Go around the other side.
Talk to my friend here.
What's your name, sweetheart?
- Wendy.
- Wendy, huh?
How much you charge for a windy, Wendy?
- I ain't doing him.
He's a kid.
- Jesus, was that my question?
Don't think so hard.
It's gonna hurt your brain.
Are you on the pipe or the needle?
Nothing.
Neither.
Show us your teeth, huh?
Come on, Wendy, let's see those pearly whites.
Oh, God.
See that?
Pipe.
Definitely.
Big time.
Big time on the pipe.
- You got something you wanna ask Wendy?
- No, not really.
You ever smoke anything else, Wendy?
Sausages don't count.
Seriously.
Tell my friend here how you got started.
You probably used to be, what, like, a Girl Scout
- or probably sang in a church choir?
- What are you, like, handicapped?
He broke his leg playing football.
He's a QB.
Got an arm like a howitzer.
So tell me, Wendy, do you smoke pot?
- Why, you got some?
- All right.
Hoof it.
Get lost.
Get out of here.
Hey, fair warning!
Next time I'm gonna bust you!
So what do you think?
Cool.
Shut the door.
Lock it.
Lock it.
Who the hell was that?
A cop and some football player messing with me.
They ask about me?
Huh?
No.
I think they just wanted pot.
Oh, shit.
I left my root beer.
LET HIM LIVE
IT'S THE MORAL THING TO DO
WON'T BE ABLE TO LIVE WITH YOURSELF
MURDER IS WRONG!
KILL HIM, HE'LL KILL YOU ENTIRE FAMILY IF YOU LET HIM GO
Hello.
Hey, sweetie, it's me.
Listen, I'm so sorry.
The time, it just completely got away from me there.
My fault.
My fault.
Bogdan just kept me here late, you know, doing some inventory, and...
I've...
I should have just...
You know, you're right.
I gotta learn to say, you know, no!
But, um...
Sky?
You there?
You're at the car wash?
Yeah.
I seriously doubt that, since you quit two weeks ago.
I called Bogdan, looking for you.
Quite an earful he gave me.
Listen...
Listen, I'll come home, and we'll talk about it.
I don't think so, Walt.
Honey.
Wherever you are... why don't you just stay there tonight?
Skyler?
Skyler?
Skyler?
Walter!
Kind of hungry down here!
Damn.
I didn't think you were coming back.
How long was I out?
10, 15 minutes.
I've never seen someone knock themselves out just by coughing.
You breathe in the same thing you used on me?
I've got lung cancer.
I'll go make you another sandwich.
It's safe.
There's no poison.
Yeah?
Because that'd be the way to do it... if you're gonna do it.
I suppose it would.
I mean, you being a chemist and all.
So... that name...
Krazy-8...
Do I really have to call you that?
I mean, no offense, but... don't you have a real name?
Domingo.
Domingo.
That's "Sunday," right?
I'd rather call you that, if you don't mind.
Yeah, whatever.
I can't say I ever liked it much.
So, Domingo... are you from around town here or someplace else?
Walter, you getting to know me is not gonna make it easier for you to kill me.
Not that I mind, you understand.
You know, you keep telling me that I don't have it in me.
Well, maybe.
But maybe not.
I sure as hell am looking for any reason not to.
I mean, any good reason at all.
Sell me.
Tell me what it is.
I guess I'd start off by promising that, if you let me go, I won't come after you.
That you'd be safe.
I guess I'd say what happened between us... never happened.
And what's best for both parties is we forget all about it.
But you know that anybody in my situation would make promises like that.
And though in my case they happen to be true, you'd never know for sure.
So what else can I tell you?
I don't know.
But you gotta convince me.
And you're going nowhere until you do.
Hey, yeah.
Yeah.
I'm from here in town, man.
ABQ.
Born and bred.
Never left.
Studied business administration over at UNM, got my degree.
Really?
Does that come in handy in the drug trade?
It doesn't hurt.
I was gonna study music originally.
Maybe even try out for Oberlin or Berklee.
My pops talked me out of it.
Said there was no money in it unless I wind up some bullshit rock star, and I didn't have a snowball chance of that, man.
What does your dad do?
He owns Tampico Furniture over on Menaul.
Wait a minute.
I know that place.
Wait a minute.
That's...
That's that...
They used to have those late-night...
Those stupid commercials.
Yeah, that's him.
- He's been doing 'em for over 30 years.
- Wait a minute.
How did it go?
It was, uh...
Wait, wait, wait.
It was...
Don't let shopping Strain your brain-o
Just sing this short refrain-o
Our forniture is bueno
Tampico is the name-o.
Pretty moronic.
But what can you do?
It did tend to stick in your head.
Did you write that, being the musician of the family?
Hell, no, man.
It was my crazy Uncle Alex.
He sings it at bars, trying to pick up on women.
In his mind, it's like saying,
"I wrote Stairway to Heaven."
Wait a minute.
Tampico Furniture.
I think when my son was born that we bought his bassinet there.
We don't sell bassinets there.
It's more of a specialty item.
We did use to sell cribs.
Oh.
Well, a crib, then, okay?
Crib.
Yeah.
No, I remember that.
In fact,
I remember recognizing your dad from those commercials.
Although he wasn't... anywhere near as friendly in real life.
Yeah, no shit.
Did he try selling you that extended warranty?
Yeah, he probably did.
And I was probably dumb enough to buy it.
Yeah, that was his big thing.
You ask him for a glass of water, he'll tell you you need an extended warranty on the ice.
- So did you work there, too?
- Only my whole life, up until the day I said "fuck you" and quit.
So, uh... 16 years ago, how old would you have been?
It was after school.
Trust me, I was there.
Might have even helped ring you up.
You and your extended warranty on the crib.
Small world.
That it is.
The paths we take, huh?
You...
Jesse know you got cancer?
No one but you.
Not your family?
No.
Why not?
Not a conversation I'm even remotely ready to have.
That's why you're cooking meth?
You want to leave money for your family.
Hell, I'll write you a check right now if you let me go.
Like I said, Walter, this line of work doesn't suit you, man.
Get out before it's too late.
I don't know what to do.
Yeah.
You do.
I'll get the key.
No, don't do this.
Don't do this.
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?
You're doing the right thing, Walter.
Do you want to...
So... you're not angry?
How do you mean?
Angry?
No.
Live and let live, man.
That's very understanding.
Whatever, man.
I just want to go home.
Me, too.
Unlock me, Walter.
The moment I do... are you gonna stick me with that broken piece of plate?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Hello?
Anybody down here?
Everybody!
I need you all to take your seats.
Settle down, please.
Thank you.
I understand that Mr. White is feeling a little under the weather this morning, so you folks are going to have to be making do with me today.
And we are going to be watching a very interesting video on... carbon.
Very important stuff.
- So what do you think?
- It's a cook site.
Gotta be.
Nobody came way the hell out here just to buy.
Fire there could have started by accident.
Don't look like it was meant to destroy evidence.
Got a couple of Dually tracks headed away towards the road.
So, what, they're in some kind of camper/lab.
They accidentally start a fire, and everybody F.O.'s?
Yeah, why not?
Except why would that little hair-gelled shit leave his car?
I-yi-yi, Gomie!
It's a culture in decline.
It's a rich and vibrant culture.
It's a car that jumps up and down.
What the hell?
You people used to be conquistadors, for Christ's sake.
Smells like a Drakkar Noir factory in here.
I already searched it.
You're wasting your time.
Give it up.
If this here's a trap car, it's gonna take more than your dumb white ass to find it.
You are talking to the trap car master, my friend.
I'm Rain Man counting his toothpicks.
Yeah, you're like Rain Man.
Retarded.
Yeah, baby.
- Hello, Zippy.
- Asshole!
I'd say that looks like meth, but it's... it's too damn white.
You know what I'm thinking, Gomie.
Somebody croaked our snitch.
Hey, agents!
You got something?
I don't know.
Just...
Doesn't it seem like... something's missing?
What about the soul?
The soul.
There's nothing but chemistry here.
Skyler.
There's something I have to tell you.
Let's break it down.
Hydrogen.
What does that give us?
By mole?
We're looking at 63%.
63?
That is a big bite.
My next step's gotta be oxygen.
Oxygen: 26%.
26.
There you have your water.
Carbon: 9%.
Carbon: 9.
- For a total of 98%?
- Right.
- Nitrogen: 1.25%.
- 1.25.
That brings it to 99 and a quarter.
Which only leaves you with the trace elements down where the magic happens.
Oh, wait a minute.
What about calcium?
Calcium's not a trace.
Got a whole skeleton to account for.
- You would think, right?
- Right.
Calcium.
Calcium is only .25%.
What?
That low?
Seriously?
Damn, I never would have thought that.
Okay, so where does iron fit in?
Iron.
Wow, okay.
.00004%.
What?
You can't have hemoglobin without iron.
- Apparently, it don't take much.
- No, it don't.
Go figure.
- Sodium.
- Sodium:.04.
Phosphorus:.19.
.19.
There we go.
So, the whole thing... adds up to... 99.888042%.
We are .111958%... shy.
Supposedly that's everything.
I don't know.
I just...
I just...
Just seems like something's missing, doesn't it?
There got to be more to a human being than that.

SwSub
I hate these shoes.
These shoes make me look like I should be changing bedpans, like I should be squeaking around bringing soup to some disgusting old person, then take the bus home to my 16 cats.
Then why are you wearing them?
I like the support.
My arches happen to be extremely archy.
Yo.
What's up?
Hey, can you call me, like, in two minutes?
Thanks.
Bye.
Gotta go take this.
Female?
Louis.
Not like it's any of your business, though.
Just be quick about it.
Oh, and, um, please don't say yo.
You can't know how much I hate that.
You missed a... spot right there.
Should you be up on that ladder?
You're more than welcome to take over for me up here.
I don't see why you don't just get Walt to do it.
Yeah.
There's an idea.
So, I'm working on this new short story, and there's this stoner character in it, and I'm trying to...
Well, know you, actually, let me back up.
You've smoked your fair share of pot in college, didn't you?
I mean, you at least tried it.
Come on.
I perhaps tried it.
Why?
Do you rember it having an effect on your mood, like changing it in any major way, or...
It made me more serious.
Really?
Because I mostly rember it made me light-headed.
That's about it.
I was just wondering if it maybe could...
You know, it's just a character thing I'm stuck on.
Never mind.
- Walter Jr.'s on pot?
- What?
No!
No.
- What would make you even...
- Where's he getting it from?
- Marie.
- Seriously.
Is it this Louis person?
What are you going to do about this?
You need to look me in the eye.
I am strictly asking about a story that I am writing, that's all.
Right hand to God, Walter Jr. is not on pot.
Certainly not as far as I know.
Not as far as you know?
Marie.
Look at me.
Hey, turn around and look at me.
This...
This here...
I wouldn't do this to my worst enemy.
This is degrading.
I'm sorry.
You hope I'll make it easy on you and just drop dead, don't you?
Well, I won't.
So either kill me or let me go.
You don't have it in you, Walter.
How do you know my name?
Jesse.
He told Emilio and me.
When he came by to sell your meth?
So what?
You threaten him, huh?
- Did you beat it out of him?
- Not even close.
What else did he tell you?
Pretty much everything you can think of.
How you were his high school teacher.
How one time you taught about carbon dioxide by making grape soda in class.
How you have a son who's retarded, or in a wheelchair or something.
This shouldn't come across as some news flash.
That partner of yours... he's got a big mouth.
Walter, I don't know what you think you're doing here, but trust me, this line of work doesn't suit you.
So I should just let you go, then?
Just unlock you and adios, huh?
I don't see what real choice you have if it's between that and cold-blooded murder.
Besides... your real problem is sitting upstairs.
Occupied!
Hey, yo, I'm trying to pinch one off in here!
Just give me some privacy, would ya?
What the hell, man?
What are you doing, man?
- You asshole!
- You told him my name.
- Says who?
Him?
- My name, where I work.
- You told him about my son!
- Don't touch me!
- Damn junkie!
- No, give me that!
Too late!
This is going down the toilet.
Watch it go!
No, that's worth 40 grand, you stupid shit.
It's worth nothing when you smoke it all.
Get off the toilet.
Get off the toilet!
Get off the toilet!
Stop it!
No!
No way!
What the hell do you think you're going?
- Back off, man!
Jesus!
- We've got work to do!
No, you got work to do.
I did my part.
You mean that obscenity that I spent the last two hours cleaning up?
- That is your contribution?
- Yo!
Kiss my pink ass, man!
I didn't ask for any of this!
How am I supposed to live here now, huh?
My whole house smells like toe cheese and dry cleaning.

Yeah.
I'm from here in town, man.
ABQ.
Born and bred.
Never left.
Studied business administration over at UNM, got my degree.
Really?
Does that come in handy in the drug trade?
It doesn't hurt.
I was gonna study music originally.
Maybe even try out for Oberlin or Berklee.
My pops talked me out of it.
Said there was no money in it unless I wind up some bullshit rock star, and I didn't have a snowball chance of that, man.
What does your dad do?
He owns Tampico Furniture over on Menaul.
Wait a minute.
I know that place.
Wait a minute.
That's...
That's that...
They used to have those late-night...
Those stupid commercials.
Yeah, that's him.
- He's been doing 'em for over 30 years.
- Wait a minute.
How did it go?
It was, uh...
Wait, wait, wait.
It was...
Don't let shopping Strain your brain-o
Just sing this short refrain-o
Our forniture is bueno
Tampico is the name-o.
Pretty moronic.
But what can you do?
It did tend to stick in your head.
Did you write that, being the musician of the family?
Hell, no, man.
It was my crazy Uncle Alex.
He sings it at bars, trying to pick up on women.
In his mind, it's like saying,
"I wrote Stairway to Heaven."
Wait a minute.
Tampico Furniture.
I think when my son was born that we bought his bassinet there.
We don't sell bassinets there.
It's more of a specialty item.
We did use to sell cribs.
Oh.
Well, a crib, then, okay?
Crib.
Yeah.
No, I remember that.
In fact,
I remember recognizing your dad from those commercials.
Although he wasn't... anywhere near as friendly in real life.
Yeah, no shit.
Did he try selling you that extended warranty?
Yeah, he probably did.
And I was probably dumb enough to buy it.
Yeah, that was his big thing.
You ask him for a glass of water, he'll tell you you need an extended warranty on the ice.
- So did you work there, too?
- Only my whole life, up until the day I said "fuck you" and quit.
So, uh... 16 years ago, how old would you have been?
It was after school.
Trust me, I was there.
Might have even helped ring you up.
You and your extended warranty on the crib.
Small world.
That it is.
The paths we take, huh?
You...
Jesse know you got cancer?
No one but you.
Not your family?
No.
Why not?
Not a conversation I'm even remotely ready to have.
That's why you're cooking meth?
You want to leave money for your family.
Hell, I'll write you a check right now if you let me go.
Like I said, Walter, this line of work doesn't suit you, man.
Get out before it's too late.
I don't know what to do.
Yeah.
You do.
I'll get the key.
No, don't do this.
Don't do this.
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?
You're doing the right thing, Walter.
Do you want to...
So... you're not angry?
How do you mean?
Angry?
No.
Live and let live, man.
That's very understanding.
Whatever, man.
I just want to go home.
Me, too.
Unlock me, Walter.
The moment I do... are you gonna stick me with that broken piece of plate?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Hello?
Anybody down here?
Everybody!
I need you all to take your seats.
Settle down, please.
Thank you.
I understand that Mr. White is feeling a little under the weather this morning, so you folks are going to have to be making do with me today.
And we are going to be watching a very interesting video on... carbon.
Very important stuff.
- So what do you think?
- It's a cook site.
Gotta be.
Nobody came way the hell out here just to buy.
Fire there could have started by accident.
Don't look like it was meant to destroy evidence.
Got a couple of Dually tracks headed away towards the road.
So, what, they're in some kind of camper/lab.
They accidentally start a fire, and everybody F.O.'s?
Yeah, why not?
Except why would that little hair-gelled shit leave his car?
I-yi-yi, Gomie!
It's a culture in decline.
It's a rich and vibrant culture.
It's a car that jumps up and down.
What the hell?
You people used to be conquistadors, for Christ's sake.
Smells like a Drakkar Noir factory in here.
I already searched it.
You're wasting your time.
Give it up.
If this here's a trap car, it's gonna take more than your dumb white ass to find it.
You are talking to the trap car master, my friend.
I'm Rain Man counting his toothpicks.
Yeah, you're like Rain Man.
Retarded.
Yeah, baby.
- Hello, Zippy.
- Asshole!
I'd say that looks like meth, but it's... it's too damn white.
You know what I'm thinking, Gomie.
Somebody croaked our snitch.
Hey, agents!
You got something?
I don't know.
Just...
Doesn't it seem like... something's missing?
What about the soul?
The soul.
There's nothing but chemistry here.
Skyler.
There's something I have to tell you.
[GRUNTS]
[COUGHS]
WALT:
Let's break it down.
Hydrogen.
What does that give us?
By mole, we're looking at 63 percent.
Sixty-three?
Wow.
Mm-hm.
That is a big bite.
My next step's gotta be oxygen.
Oxygen, 26 percent.
Twenty-six.
There you have your water.
Carbon, 9 percent.
Carbon, 9.
For a total of 98 percent.
Right.
WOMAN:
Nitrogen, 1 .25 percent.
WALTER:
One-point-two-five.
WOMAN:
That brings you to 99 and a quarter.
Which only leaves you with the trace elements down where the magic happens.
Oh, wait a minute.
What about calcium?
Calcium's not a trace.
WALTER:
Got a whole skeleton to account for.
WOMAN:
You would think, right?
WALTER:
Right.
WOMAN:
Calcium.
Calcium's only 0.25 percent.
What?
That low?
Uh-huh.
Mm-hm.
Seriously?
Damn, I never would've thought that.
Okay, so where does iron fit in?
Iron.
WOMAN:
Wow, okay, 0.00004 percent.
What?
You can't have hemoglobin without iron.
Apparently, it don't take much.
No doubt.
Go figure.
WALTER:
Ah, sodium.
WOMAN:
Sodium, 0.04.
[coughing]
WOMAN:
Phosphorus, 0.1 9.
WALTER:
Point-one-nine.
There we go.
So the whole thing adds up to... 99.888042 percent.
We are 0.1 1 1 958 percent shy.
Supposedly that's everything.
Yeah?
Mm-hm.
I don't know, it just...
It just...
It seems like something's missing, doesn't it?
WALTER:
There's got to be more to a human being than that.
[coughing]
[FLUSHES]
I hate these shoes.
Shoes make me look like I should be changing bedpans, like I should be squeaking around bringing soup to some disgusting old person, then take the bus home to my 1 6 cats.
Then why are you wearing them?
I like the support.
My arches happen to be extremely arch-y.
[PHONE RINGING]
Yo, what's up?
Hey, can you call me, like, in two minutes?
Thanks, bye.
I gotta go take this.
Ooh.
Female?
Louis.
Not like it's any of your business, though.
Just be quick about it.
No.
Oh, and, um, please don't say, "Yo."
You can't know how much I hate that.
You missed a spot, right there.
Should you be up on that ladder?
You're more than welcome to take over for me up here.
I don't see why you don't get Walt to do it.
Yeah, there's an idea.
So um, I'm, uh, I'm working on this new short story and there's this stoner character in it and I'm trying to...um...
Well, you know, actually, let me back up.
Um, you, uh, you smoked your fair share of pot in college, didn't you?
I mean, you at least tried it.
Come on.
I perhaps tried it.
Why?
Do you remember it having an effect on your mood?
Like, changing it in any major way?
It made me more serious.
Really?
Because I mostly remember it made me lightheaded, that's about it.
I was just wondering if--
If it maybe could, um...
Um, you know, it's just a character thing I'm stuck on.
Never mind.
Walter, Jr.'s on pot?
What?
No.
No.
No.
What would make you even--?
Where's he getting it from?
Marie.
Seriously.
Is it this Louis person?
What are you gonna do about this?
Marie, you need to look me in the eye.
I am strictly asking about a story that I'm writing, that's all.
Right hand to God, Walter Jr. is not on pot, certainly not as far as I know.
Not as far as you know?
Marie.
[toilet FLUSHES]
Hey, look at me.
Hey, turn around and look at me.
This...
This here.
I wouldn't do this to my worst enemy.
[coughing]
This is degrading.
I'm sorry.
You hope I'll make it easy and just drop dead, don't you?
But I won't.
So either kill me, or let me go.
[coughing]
You don't have it in you, Walter.
[coughing]
How do you know my name?
Jesse.
He told Emilio and me.
I came by to sell your meth.
So, what, did you threaten him, huh?
Did you beat it out of him?
Not even close.
What else did he tell you?
Pretty much everything he could think of.
You were his high-school teacher.
One time you taught about carbon dioxide by making grape soda in class.
You have a son who's retarded, or in a wheelchair or something.
It shouldn't come across as some news flash.
That partner of yours, he's got a big mouth.
Walter,
I don't know what you think you're doing here, but trust me, this line of work doesn't suit you.
So I should just let you go, then?
Just unlock you and adiós, huh?
I don't see what real choice you have.
If it's between that and cold-blooded murder.
Besides... your real problem's sitting upstairs.
[knocking ON DOOR]
Occupied.
Hey, yo, I'm trying to pinch one off in here.
Just give me some privacy, would you?
Okay.
What the hell, man?
What are you doing, man?
You asshole.
What--?
You told him my name.
Says who, him?
My name, where I work.
You told him about my son.
Hey, don't touch me.
Damn junkie.
No, give me that.
That's mine.
This is going down the toilet.
Watch it go.
No, that's worth 40 grand, you stupid shit.
It's worth nothing when you smoke it all.
Get off the toilet.
Get off the toilet!
No.
Get off the toilet.
Stop it.
[toilet FLUSHING]
No.
No way.
[coughing]
No.
No, no, no.
Jesse, where the hell do you think you're going?
Back off, man.
Jesus.
We've got work to do.
No, no.
You-
- You got work to do.
I did my part.
You mean that obscenity I spent the last two hours cleaning up?
That is your contribution?
Kiss my pink ass, man.
I didn't ask for any of this.
How am I supposed to live here now, huh?
My whole house smells like toe cheese and dry cleaning.
Because you didn't follow my instructions.
Oh, well, hell Hitler, bitch.
And let me tell you something else.
We flipped a coin, okay?
You and me.
You and me.
Coin flip is sacred.
Your job is waiting for you in that basement, as per the coin.
Fucking do it, already.
That's what she said.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I think we have some of those.
Yeah, you'll have to try them on.
Hello?
Seven and a half, maybe.
I don't know.
Excuse me.
Do you have these in black?
Uh-uh.
Anyways, so like I was saying,
I went to the party the other night.
Yeah, Tony was there.
[PHONE RINGING]
Whatever.
Hey, where have you been?
I called you two hours ago.
HANK:
Sorry, baby, I'm, uh, kind of busy here.
What's up?
Well, kind of a lot, actually, and it's a delicate subject.
So I need you to focus, and--
Hey, sit down!
Sit down!
Damn it, Hank.
I'm sorry, babe, I'm just in the middle of something here.
Get--
Sit down!
Sit your ass down, comprende?
You too, sit down!
[SPEAKING spanish]
Shit.
I'm back, babe.
What's up?
Walter Jr.
Yeah, what about him?
Marijuana.
He's smoking it.
Bullshit.
Excuse me, his own mother seems to think so.
Skyler told you that?
She inferred it.
She inferred it, huh?
She strongly inferred it.
Like, "Doctor, my friend suffers from erectile dysfunction."
Please, come on.
All right.
I want you to talk to him.
Walt should talk to him.
Hell, Skyler, better yet.
She'll kick his butt up and down the block.
I think it ought to be you.
You know, tell him some horror stories.
Maybe show him some autopsy pictures.
An autopsy of a pot overdose?
Come on.
I don't know, baby, it's just that, you know,
I figure his dad should be the one doing this thing, don't you think?
Hank, he respects you.
Yeah, all right.
Well, listen, I mean,
I'll swing by their place after work.
Good.
Scare him straight.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, where's my sugar?
Hm.
Muah.
SALESWOMAN:
Excuse me, ma'am.
Ma'am, you need to be wearing footies before you try those on.
I'm extremely clean.
Yeah, well, I'd really appreciate it.
Hey, sorry about that.
Yeah, I'll check.
SALESWOMAN:
You know, I hid a pair for you last week, gray ones.
My manager found them and we put them back on the floor.
I know.
[SASHA DOBSON'S "without YOU" PLAYING]
[AMBULANCE SIREN WAILING]
[CAR HORN HONKING]
Hey.
I'm going.
HANK:
What do you think?
WALT JR.:
About what?
This look like a nice place?
No, not really.
Think you'd like to live here?
No.
Sure about that?
Yeah, pretty sure.
I thought we were going to Cold Stone Creamery.
Yeah, yeah, well, we took a little detour.
Figure we'll come over here and check out how the other half lives.
This here is what we call the Crystal Palace.
You know who lives in the palace?
Meth-heads.
Nasty, skeevy meth-heads who'd sell their grandma's coochie for a hit.
[CHUCKLES]
Oh, you think that's funny?
That's funny, huh?
Yeah.
Let me tell you something.
Every one of these miserable wastes of skin got started how?
Hm?
How do you think they started?
I don't know.
What do you think it was they were all doing before they graduated to shooting meth in their dicks?
A gateway drug.
That's what we call it.
Dollars to doughnuts, and I shit you not, that gateway drug was marijuana, every time.
You understand?
Um, yeah.
So why are you telling me this?
Because I love you, you little bastard.
And, hey, I was young once, you know.
The world's a messed-up place, you know.
You know, just this, uh, one time, you know...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, you!
Yeah, you, princess.
Get over here.
[CAR HORN HONKING]
Hey, don't make me get out of the car.
Check this out.
HANK:
See what I'm talking about.
Hey, I ain't holding, okay?
Did I say you could open your mouth?
And hands off the car.
Other side.
Go around the other side, talk to my friend here.
What's your name, sweetheart?
Wendy.
HANK:
Wendy, huh?
How much you charge for a windy, Wendy?
I ain't doing him, he's a kid.
Jesus, was that my question?
Don't think so hard, it's gonna hurt your brain.
Are you on the pipe or on the needle?
Nothing.
Neither.
Yeah, yeah.
Show us your teeth, huh?
Come on, Wendy, let's see those pearly whites.
Oh, God.
See that?
Pipe, definitely.
Bigtime, bigtime on the pipe.
You got something you wanna ask Wendy?
Um, no, not really.
You ever smoke anything else, Wendy?
Sausages don't count.
[LAUGHS]
Ahem.
Seriously, tell my friend here how you got started.
Probably used to be, what, like a Girl Scout or probably sang in the church choir?
What are you, like, handicapped?
He broke his leg playing football.
He's a QB.
Got an arm like a howitzer.
So tell me, Wendy, you smoke pot?
Why, you got some?
All right, hoof it, get lost.
Get out of here.
Hey, fair warning, next time I'm gonna bust you.
So, what do you think?
Cool.
JESSE:
Shut the door.
Shut the door.
Lock it.
Lock it, lock it.
Who the hell was that?
Cop and some football player messing with me.
JESSE:
They ask about me, huh?
No, I think they just wanted pot.
JESSE:
Right there.
HOOKER:
Shit, left my root beer.
[BEEPlNG]
SKYLER:
Hello?
Hey, sweetie, it's me.
Listen, I'm so sorry.
The time, it just, ha--
It just-- lt completely got away from me.
I'm just, ha...uh...
My fault, my fault.
Bogdan just kept me here late, you know, doing some inventory, and I, um, I-- l should've just--
You know, you're right.
I-I gotta learn to say, you know, "No."
But, um...
Sky?
You there?
You're at the car wash?
Yeah.
I seriously doubt that, since you quit two weeks ago.
I called Bogdan, looking for you.
Quite an earful he gave me.
Listen...
Listen, I'll come home and we'll talk about it.
I don't think so, Walt.
Honey...
Wherever you are, why don't you just stay there tonight?
Skyler?
Skyler?
Skyler?
KRAZY-8:
Walter?
Hello?
Hey, I'm kind of hungry down here.
[coughing]
[WALTER coughing]
[coughing]
Oh.
Come on.
[coughing]
Damn.
I didn't think you were coming back.
[GROANS]
[coughing]
How long was I out?
Ten, 1 5 minutes?
I've never seen someone knock themselves out just by coughing.
You breathe in the same shit you used on me?
I've got lung cancer.
[coughing]
I'll go make you another sandwich.
WALTER:
It's safe.
There's no poison.
Because that would be the way to do it, if you're gonna do it.
I suppose it would.
I mean, you being a chemist and all.
So that name...
Krazy-8.
Do I really have to call you that?
I mean, no offense, but don't you have a real name?
Domingo.
That's "Sunday," right?
I'd rather call you that, if you don't mind.
Whatever.
I can't say I ever liked it much.
[COUGHS]
So, Domingo, you from around town here or someplace else?
Hey, Walter?
You getting to know me is not gonna make it easier for you to kill me.
Not that I mind, you understand?
You know, you keep telling me that I don't have it in me.
Well, maybe.
But maybe not.
I sure as hell am looking for any reason not to.
I mean, any good reason at all.
Sell me.
Tell me what it is.
I guess I'd start off by promising that if you let me go
I won't come after you, that you'd be safe.
I guess I'd say what happened between us never happened.
And what's best for both parties is we forget all about it.
But you know that anybody in my situation would make promises like that.
And, in my case, they happen to be true.
You'll never know for sure.
So, what else can I tell you?
I don't know.
But you've gotta convince me.
And you're going nowhere until you do.
Hey, yeah.
Yeah.
I'm from here in town, man.
ABQ, born and bred.
Never left.
Studied Business Administration over at UNM, got my degree.
Really?
Does that, uh, come in handy in the drug trade?
It doesn't hurt.
I was gonna study music originally.

Yeah, that's him.
Been doing them for over 30 years.
Wait a minute.
How did it go?
It was, uh...
Wait, wait, wait. lt was...

Just sing this short refrain-o
Our furniture is bueno Our furniture is bueno
Tampico is the name-o Tampico is the name-o
[BOTH LAUGHING]
[coughing]
Pretty moronic.
But what can you do?
Well, it did tend to stick in your head.
Did you write that?
Being the musician in the family.
Hell, no, man.
It was my crazy uncle Alex.
He sings it at bars, trying to pick up on women.

You and your extended warranty on the crib.

The paths we take, huh?
[MUTTERS lNDISTINCTLY]
Jesse know you've got cancer?
No one but you.
Not your family?
No.
Why not?
Not a conversation that I'm even remotely ready to have.
That's why you're cooking meth?
You wanna leave money for your family.
Hell, I mean,
I'll write you a check right now if you let me go.
Like I said, Walter, this line of work doesn't suit you.

You're doing the right thing, Walter.
Yeah?
Do you wanna?
[coughing]
So you're not angry?
What do you mean?
Angry at you?
No.
Live and let live, man.
That's very understanding.
Whatever, man.
I just wanna go home.
Yeah.

So, what, they're in some kind of camper/lab?
They accidentally start a fire and everybody FOs?
Yeah.
Why not?
So why did that little hair-gelled shit leave his car?
Ay-yi-yi.
Gomey, it's a culture in decline.
It's a rich and vibrant culture.
It's a car that jumps up and down.
What the hell?
You people used to be conquistadors, for chrissake.
Smells like a Drakkar Noir factory in here.
I already searched it.
HANK:
Yeah.
You're wasting your time.
Give it up.
If this here's a trap car, it's gonna take more than your dumb white ass to find it.
Oh, yeah?
You are talking to the trap-car master, my friend.
I'm Rain Man counting his toothpicks.
Yeah, you're like Rain Man.

Hello, zippy.

WALTER:
Right.
WOMAN:
Calcium.
Calcium's only 0.25 percent.
What?
That low?
Uh-huh.
Mm-hm.
Seriously?
Damn, I never would've thought that.
Okay, so where does iron fit in?
Iron.
WOMAN:
Wow, okay, 0.00004 percent.
What?
You can't have hemoglobin without iron.
Apparently, it don't take much.
No doubt.
Go figure.
WALTER:
Ah, sodium.
WOMAN:
Sodium, 0.04.
[COUGHING]
WOMAN:
Phosphorus, 0.19.
WALTER:
Point-one-nine.
There we go.
So the whole thing adds up to... 99.888042 percent.
We are 0.111958 percent shy.
Supposedly that's everything.
Yeah?
Mm-hm.
I don't know, it just...
It just...
It seems like something's missing, doesn't it?
WALTER:
There's got to be more to a human being than that.
[COUGHING]
[FLUSHES]
[♪♪♪]
I hate these shoes.
Shoes make me look like I should be changing bedpans, like I should be squeaking around bringing soup to some disgusting old person, then take the bus home to my 16 cats.
Then why are you wearing them?
I like the support.
My arches happen to be extremely arch-y.
[PHONE RINGING]
Yo, what's up?
Hey, can you call me, like, in two minutes?
Thanks, bye.
I gotta go take this.
Ooh.
Female?
Louis.
Not like it's any of your business, though.
Just be quick about it.
No.
Oh, and, um, please don't say, "Yo."
You can't know how much I hate that.
You missed a spot, right there.
Should you be up on that ladder?
You're more than welcome to take over for me up here.
I don't see why you don't get Walt to do it.
Yeah, there's an idea.
So um, I'm, uh, I'm working on this new short story and there's this stoner character in it and I'm trying to... um...
Well, you know, actually, let me back up.
Um, you, uh, you smoked your fair share of pot in college, didn't you?
I mean, you at least tried it.
Come on.
I perhaps tried it.
Why?
Do you remember it having an effect on your mood?
Like, changing it in any major way?
It made me more serious.
Really?
Because I mostly remember it made me lightheaded, that's about it.
I was just wondering if...
If it maybe could, um...
Um, you know, it's just a character thing I'm stuck on.
Never mind.
Walter, Jr.'s on pot?
What?
No.
No.
No.
What would make you even...?
Where's he getting it from?
Marie.
Seriously.
Is it this Louis person?
What are you gonna do about this?
Marie, you need to look me in the eye.
I am strictly asking about a story that I'm writing, that's all.
Right hand to God, Walter Jr.
Is not on pot, certainly not as far as I know.
Not as far as you know?
Marie.
[♪♪♪]
[TOILET FLUSHES]
Hey, look at me.
Hey, turn around and look at me.
This...
This here.
I wouldn't do this to my worst enemy.
[COUGHING]
This is degrading.
I'm sorry.
You hope I'll make it easy and just drop dead, don't you?
But I won't.
So either kill me, or let me go.
[COUGHING]
You don't have it in you, Walter.
[COUGHING]
How do you know my name?
Jesse.
He told Emilio and me.
I came by to sell your meth.
So, what, did you threaten him, huh?
Did you beat it out of him?
Not even close.
What else did he tell you?
Pretty much everything he could think of.
You were his high-school teacher.
One time you taught about carbon dioxide by making grape soda in class.
You have a son who's retarded, or in a wheelchair or something.
It shouldn't come across as some news flash.
That partner of yours, he's got a big mouth.
Walter,
I don't know what you think you're doing here, but trust me, this line of work doesn't suit you.
So I should just let you go, then?
Just unlock you and adiós, huh?
I don't see what real choice you have.
If it's between that and cold-blooded murder.
Besides... your real problem's sitting upstairs.
[♪♪♪]
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Occupied.
Hey, yo, I'm trying to pinch one off in here.
Just give me some privacy, would you?
Okay.
What the hell, man?
What are you doing, man?
You asshole.
What...?
You told him my name.
Says who, him?
My name, where I work.
You told him about my son.
Hey, don't touch me.
Damn junkie.
No, give me that.
That's mine.
This is going down the toilet.
Watch it go.
No, that's worth 40 grand, you stupid shit.
It's worth nothing when you smoke it all.
Get off the toilet.
Get off the toilet!
No.
Get off the toilet.
Stop it.
[TOILET FLUSHING]
No.
No way.
[COUGHING]
No.
No, no, no.
Jesse, where the hell do you think you're going?
Back off, man.
Jesus.
We've got work to do.
No, no.
You...
You got work to do.
I did my part.
You mean that obscenity I spent the last two hours cleaning up?
That is your contribution?
Kiss my pink ass, man.
I didn't ask for any of this.
How am I supposed to live here now, huh?
My whole house smells like toe cheese and dry cleaning.
Because you didn't follow my instructions.
Oh, well, hell Hitler, bitch.
And let me tell you something else.
We flipped a coin, okay?
You and me.
You and me.
Coin flip is sacred.
Your job is waiting for you in that basement, as per the coin.
Fucking do it, already.
That's what she said.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I think we have some of those.
Yeah, you'll have to try them on.
Hello?
Seven and a half, maybe.
I don't know.
Excuse me.
Do you have these in black?
Uh-uh.
Anyways, so like I was saying,
I went to the party the other night.
Yeah, Tony was there.
[PHONE RINGING]
Whatever.
Hey, where have you been?
I called you two hours ago.
HANK:
Sorry, baby, I'm, uh, kind of busy here.
What's up?
Well, kind of a lot, actually, and it's a delicate subject.
So I need you to focus, and...
Hey, sit down!
Sit down!
Damn it, Hank.
I'm sorry, babe, I'm just in the middle of something here.
Get...
Sit down!
Sit your ass down, comprende?
You too, sit down!
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
Shit.
I'm back, babe.
What's up?
Walter Jr.
Yeah, what about him?
Marijuana.
He's smoking it.
Bullshit.
Excuse me, his own mother seems to think so.
Skyler told you that?
She inferred it.
She inferred it, huh?
She strongly inferred it.
Like, "Doctor, my friend suffers from erectile dysfunction."
Please, come on.
All right.
I want you to talk to him.
Walt should talk to him.
Hell, Skyler, better yet.
She'll kick his butt up and down the block.
I think it ought to be you.
You know, tell him some horror stories.
Maybe show him some autopsy pictures.
An autopsy of a pot overdose?
Come on.
I don't know, baby, it's just that, you know,
I figure his dad should be the one doing this thing, don't you think?
Hank, he respects you.
Yeah, all right.
Well, listen, I mean,
I'll swing by their place after work.
Good.
Scare him straight.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, where's my sugar?
Hm.
Muah.
SALESWOMAN:
Excuse me, ma'am.
Ma'am, you need to be wearing footies before you try those on.
I'm extremely clean.
Yeah, well, I'd really appreciate it.
Hey, sorry about that.
Yeah, I'll check.
SALESWOMAN:
You know, I hid a pair for you last week, gray ones.
My manager found them and we put them back on the floor.
I know.
[SASHA DOBSON'S "WITHOUT YOU" PLAYING]
[AMBULANCE SIREN WAILING]
[CAR HORN HONKING]
Hey.
I'm going.
HANK:
What do you think?
WALT JR:
About what?
This look like a nice place?
No, not really.
Think you'd like to live here?
No.
Sure about that?
Yeah, pretty sure.
I thought we were going to Cold Stone Creamery.
Yeah, yeah, well, we took a little detour.
Figure we'll come over here and check out how the other half lives.
This here is what we call the Crystal Palace.
You know who lives in the palace?
Meth-heads.
Nasty, skeevy meth-heads who'd sell their grandma's coochie for a hit.
[CHUCKLES]
Oh, you think that's funny?
That's funny, huh?
Yeah.
Let me tell you something.
Every one of these miserable wastes of skin got started how?
Hm?
How do you think they started?
I don't know.
What do you think it was they were all doing before they graduated to shooting meth in their dicks?
A gateway drug.
That's what we call it.
Dollars to doughnuts, and I shit you not, that gateway drug was marijuana, every time.
You understand?
Um, yeah.
So why are you telling me this?
Because I love you, you little bastard.
And, hey, I was young once, you know.
The world's a messed-up place, you know.
You know, just this, uh, one time, you know...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, you!
Yeah, you, princess.
Get over here.
[CAR HORN HONKING]
Hey, don't make me get out of the car.
Check this out.
HANK:
See what I'm talking about.
Hey, I ain't holding, okay?
Did I say you could open your mouth?
And hands off the car.
Other side.
Go around the other side, talk to my friend here.
What's your name, sweetheart?
Wendy.
HANK:
Wendy, huh?
How much you charge for a windy, Wendy?
I ain't doing him, he's a kid.
Jesus, was that my question?
Don't think so hard, it's gonna hurt your brain.
Are you on the pipe or on the needle?
Nothing.
Neither.
Yeah, yeah.
Show us your teeth, huh?
Come on, Wendy, let's see those pearly whites.
Oh, God.
See that?
Pipe, definitely.
Bigtime, bigtime on the pipe.
You got something you wanna ask Wendy?
Um, no, not really.
You ever smoke anything else, Wendy?
Sausages don't count.
[LAUGHS]
Ahem.
Seriously, tell my friend here how you got started.
Probably used to be, what, like a Girl Scout or probably sang in the church choir?
What are you, like, handicapped?
He broke his leg playing football.
He's a QB.
Got an arm like a howitzer.
So tell me, Wendy, you smoke pot?
Why, you got some?
All right, hoof it, get lost.
Get out of here.
Hey, fair warning, next time I'm gonna bust you.
So, what do you think?
Cool.
JESSE:
Shut the door.
Shut the door.
Lock it.
Lock it, lock it.
Who the hell was that?
Cop and some football player messing with me.
JESSE:
They ask about me, huh?
No, I think they just wanted pot.
JESSE:
Right there.
HOOKER:
Shit, left my root beer.

SKYLER:
Hello?
Hey, sweetie, it's me.
Listen, I'm so sorry.
The time, it just, ha...
It just...
It completely got away from me.
I'm just, ha... uh...
My fault, my fault.
Bogdan just kept me here late, you know, doing some inventory, and I, um, I...
I should've just...
You know, you're right.
L-I gotta learn to say, you know, "No."
But, um...
Sky?
You there?
You're at the car wash?
Yeah.
I seriously doubt that, since you quit two weeks ago.
I called Bogdan, looking for you.
Quite an earful he gave me.
Listen...
Listen, I'll come home and we'll talk about it.
I don't think so, Walt.
Honey...
Wherever you are, why don't you just stay there tonight?
Skyler?

Hello?
Hey, I'm kind of hungry down here.
[♪♪♪]
[COUGHING]
[WALTER COUGHING]
[COUGHING]
Oh.
Come on.
[COUGHING]
Damn.
I didn't think you were coming back.
[GROANS]
[COUGHING]
How long was I out?
Ten, 15 minutes?
I've never seen someone knock themselves out just by coughing.
You breathe in the same shit you used on me?
I've got lung cancer.
[COUGHING]
I'll go make you another sandwich.
WALTER:
It's safe.
There's no poison.
Because that would be the way to do it, if you're gonna do it.
I suppose it would.
I mean, you being a chemist and all.
So that name...
Krazy-8.
Do I really have to call you that?
I mean, no offense, but don't you have a real name?
Domingo.
That's "Sunday," right?
I'd rather call you that, if you don't mind.
Whatever.
I can't say I ever liked it much.
[COUGHS]
So, Domingo, you from around town here or someplace else?
Hey, Walter?
You getting to know me is not gonna make it easier for you to kill me.
Not that I mind, you understand?
You know, you keep telling me that I don't have it in me.
Well, maybe.
But maybe not.
I sure as hell am looking for any reason not to.
I mean, any good reason at all.
Sell me.
Tell me what it is.
I guess I'd start off by promising that if you let me go
I won't come after you, that you'd be safe.
I guess I'd say what happened between us never happened.
And what's best for both parties is we forget all about it.
But you know that anybody in my situation would make promises like that.
And, in my case, they happen to be true.
You'll never know for sure.
So, what else can I tell you?
I don't know.
But you've gotta convince me.
And you're going nowhere until you do.
Hey, yeah.
Yeah.
I'm from here in town, man.
ABQ, born and bred.
Never left.
Studied Business Administration over at UNM, got my degree.
Really?
Does that, uh, come in handy in the drug trade?
It doesn't hurt.
I was gonna study music originally.
Maybe even try out for Oberlin and Berklee.
My pops talked me out of it.
Said there was no money in it unless I wind up some bullshit rock star, and I didn't have a snowball chance of that.
What does your dad do?
He owns Tampico Furniture over on Menaul.
Wait a minute, I know that place.
Wait a minute.
That's...
That's that...
That, uh...
They used to have those...
Those late-night...
The stupid commercials.
That they had, yeah.
Yeah, that's him.
Been doing them for over 30 years.
Wait a minute.
How did it go?
It was, uh...
Wait, wait, wait.
It was...
[SINGING] Don't let shopping Strain your brain-o
Just sing this short refrain-o
Our furniture is bueno Our furniture is bueno
Tampico is the name-o Tampico is the name-o
[BOTH LAUGHING]
[COUGHING]
Pretty moronic.
But what can you do?
Well, it did tend to stick in your head.
Did you write that?
Being the musician in the family.
Hell, no, man.
It was my crazy uncle Alex.
He sings it at bars, trying to pick up on women.
His mind, it's like saying,
"Hey, I wrote 'Stairway to Heaven."'
Yeah, but at Tampico Furniture, I...
I think when my son was born that we bought his bassinet there.
Uh-uh.
We don't sell bassinets there.
It's more of a specialty item.
We did use to sell cribs.
A crib, then, okay.
A crib.
Yeah.
No, I remember that.
In fact, I remember recognizing your dad from those commercials.
Although he wasn't anywhere near as friendly in real life.
Yeah.
No shit.
Did he, uh, try selling you that extended warranty?
Yeah, he probably did.
And I was probably dumb enough to buy it.
Yeah, that was his big thing.
You ask him for a glass of water, he'd tell you you need an extended warranty on the ice.
Did you work there too?
Only my whole life.
Up until the day I said, "Fuck you," and quit.
So, uh... 16 years ago, how old would you have been?
If it was after school, trust me, I was there.
Might have even helped ring you up.
You and your extended warranty on the crib.
[COUGHING]
Small world.
It is.
The paths we take, huh?
[MUTTERS INDISTINCTLY]
Jesse know you've got cancer?
No one but you.
Not your family?
No.
Why not?
Not a conversation that I'm even remotely ready to have.
That's why you're cooking meth?
You wanna leave money for your family.
Hell, I mean,
I'll write you a check right now if you let me go.
Like I said, Walter, this line of work doesn't suit you.
Get out before it's too late.
I don't know what to do.
Yeah.
You do.
I'll get the key.
[♪♪♪]
No.
Oh, no, no, no.
No.
No.
No, don't do this.
Don't do this.
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?
[DOOR CREAKING]
[GRUNTS]
You're doing the right thing, Walter.
Yeah?
Do you wanna?
[COUGHING]
So you're not angry?
What do you mean?
Angry at you?
No.
Live and let live, man.
That's very understanding.
Whatever, man.
I just wanna go home.
Yeah.
Me too.
Unlock me, Walter.
The moment I do... are you gonna stick me with that broken piece of plate?
[BOTH GRUNTING]

And we are going to be watching a very interesting video on carbon
Very important stuff.
GOMEZ:
So, what do you think?
HANK:
Ah, it's a cook site.
Gotta be.
Nobody came way the hell out here just to buy.
Fire there could have started by accident.
I don't think that was meant to destroy evidence.
GOMEZ:
Got a couple of Dooley tracks headed away, towards the road.
So, what, they're in some kind of camper/lab?
They accidentally start a fire and everybody FOs?
Yeah.
Why not?
So why did that little hair-gelled shit leave his car?
Ay-yi-yi.
Gomey, it's a culture in decline.
It's a rich and vibrant culture.
It's a car that jumps up and down.
What the hell?
You people used to be conquistadors, for chrissake.
Smells like a Drakkar Noir factory in here.
I already searched it.
HANK:
Yeah.
You're wasting your time.
Give it up.
If this here's a trap car, it's gonna take more than your dumb white ass to find it.
Oh, yeah?
You are talking to the trap-car master, my friend.
I'm Rain Man counting his toothpicks.
Yeah, you're like Rain Man.

You know that old leather jacket I wear sometime?
The brown one?
Well, make sure it goes to Hoyt.
I told him it was lucky.
It ain't.
But he don't know that.
Sookie'll get the house.
My bank account.
But I want you to have my truck.
Really?
You've been a good friend, Rene.
Thanks, man.
I'm giving it back though, soon as they let you go.
They ain't never letting me go, Rene.
There's something inside me that's just...
- It's wrong.
- Nah, come on now.
It ain't like you went and killed a bunch a... innocent women.
- What?
- They were fangbangers.
If you hadn't have done it, it was a matter of time.
Wait, are you calling my grandma a fangbanger?
Don't get your back all up, you...
I'm just sayin', you must've had your reasons, that's all.
There ain't no good reason for what I did.
- Suppose you're right.
- You can't go in there.
He's my brother.
He's only allowed one visitor at a time.
You can either let me by or throw me in there, but I'm gonna see my brother.
- I'm sorry, Sookie.
I'm so sorry.
- You've have nothing to be sorry for.
I wish I got here sooner, before you went and confessed to something.
I don't even remember doing any of it.
I just know I did.
Jason, you need to shut up, okay?
'Cause I'm real close to finding out who the real killer is.
Transcript:
YYeTs.net
Synchro:
Arrow, mpm
His name's Drew Marshall.
He had a sister named Cindy, and I think he killed her.
Strangled her just like Maudette and Dawn and Amy.
{If she knows this }How come she hasn't gone to the cops and gotten Jason out.
'Cause I tried that, and so far the cops have done diddlysquat to protect me and my family.
I don't have any evidence yet.
I ignore what Drew Marshall looks like.
So you can't really be sure he's the killer.
I've seen what's inside his head.
They'll never believe that about him, but it's the truth.
There's all kinds of strangeness in this world.
I know you wanna help me, but that's only 'cause you can't accept the truth.
I'm a murderer.
And I'm going to hell.
Plain and simple.
You aren't hearing me.
I know who the killer is.
And all we gotta do is find him.
Listen to me, don't be stupid.
- What's your problem?
- Make her go away.
Am I your fucking butler?
Please, just get her out of here.
Now, you heard him.
Zoo's closed.
Did you get the fax from the Bunkie police department about Drew Marshall, the man who's probably the real killer?
Never heard of no fax from no Bunkie P.D., or Drew-whoever.
But I'll tell you one thing.
The real killer is right there, where he belongs.
You are one hell of a sorry excuse for a cop and a human being,
Andy, and it's just a matter of time before everyone knows it.
Hi, I'm Tara.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I thought you might be hungry.
Okay, this isn't food.
This is sculpture.
And this place...
You're not really just a social worker, are you?
I'm a lot of things.
- Just like you.
Coffee?
- Sure.
I mean, you're not just a drunk-driving bartender, are you?
You're also intelligent, resourceful.
Strong.
A survivor.
I don't feel like any of those things right now.
I didn't just wreck my car,
I totaled my whole life.
All of it.
Well, I suppose that's one way of looking at it.
Personally, I see your situation as an opportunity.
I just got a fake exorcism and a DUI.
I probably lost my job.
All of my friends.
And my mother disowned me.
I'm sorry, but I don't get how that's an opportunity.
Maybe life has just cleared out all the things that weren't working.
Now you've got room to rebuild.
Decide exactly what you want your life to look like.
And make that happen.
What do you want, Tara?
What do you want your life to be?
I don't know.
I guess I never really let myself want anything.
That breaks my heart.
Yeah, well, there are people a lot worse off than me.
I'm sure.
I should probably let you get back to helping them.
Instead of watching me cry all over your nice breakfast.
I appreciate everything you've done for me.
And I promise to pay back the bail as soon as I can.
Tara, sit down.
You haven't touched your food, your dress isn't dry, and I think we both know you've got nowhere to go.
Please.
I know it's hard for you to trust me, but I really do just wanna help.
Even if that means giving you a place to stay until you figure things out.
- Why would you do that?
- 'Cause it's what I do.
It's what I want my life to be:
helping people.
Not because I feel sorry for you, and not because I want anything back from you.
- Then why?
- Because you deserve a chance.
And I'm in a position to give you one.
You wanna end this thing, that's fine.
The least you could do is call me back and tell me where the fuck you are so I can stop worrying.
Thanks a lot, I'll talk to you later, bye.
- What are you doing here?
- I got the lunch shift.
With everything going on with Jason, I figured you'd take the day off.
I'm not staying home and hiding, having people think I'm ashamed.
Besides, I'm gonna need all the money I can get to hire a p.i.
Drew Marshall is somewhere in this town.
Who knows how many times he's sat in one of those booths, looked me in right in the eye and ordered a burger and fries.
- Yeah, but wouldn't you have heard him?
- Wouldn't you've smelled him?
I ain't a shortwave radio.
I spend most of my time trying not to listen.
- Sorry, I didn't mean...
- It's okay.
I better start my prep.
You can only have five minutes with him.
Five minutes.
Mr. Stackhouse?
My name is Orry Dawson.
I told 'em I don't need no lawyer.
I'm not a lawyer.
I'm here on behalf of the Fellowship of the Sun.
That anti-vampire church?
We are a religious organization dedicated to the preservation and salvation of the human race.
Good.
'Cause I thought you just hated vampires.
And I used to, but then I got to know one, and he was a pretty decent guy.
Until I got him killed.
See, that's where you're wrong.
What you did, it was a service to your race and to Jesus.
And you should be proud of that.
Last year there were over 800 reported vampire-related attacks in Louisiana alone.
And the law won't do nothing about it.
They are too busy respecting those fiends and their...
Their civil rights.
What about our rights?
Our rights to be safe in our own neighborhoods, our right to our own blood?
No, I don't know nothing about that.
Look, uh...
Officially, the church can't condone what you did.
You took the lives of four women.
Women who had tainted themselves and their race, but still, human women.
But we do recognize that even though your methods may have been flawed, your intentions were pure.
I got no idea what you're talkin' about.
That's smart.
Don't admit to anything.
The church has started up a fund for your defense.
In the meantime, here's something to help you pass the time.
You are a brave soldier, Jason Stackhouse.
God loves you.
You...
You will be saved.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I was looking for Maryann.
She'll be right back.
You must be Tara.
Come on in.
I'm Eggs.
Eggs?
It's actually Benedict.
- Benedict Talley, so...
- Eggs Benedict.
Ah, shit, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have laughed.
- My name's screwed up too.
- Tara's a pretty name.
Suits you.
Maryann did...
Didn't tell me she...
She had a...
A boyfriend.
I'm...
I'm just stayin' here till I get back on my feet.
Just like you.
So collecting stray black people, that some kind of hobby of hers?
She was right about you.
You are funny.
- What else she tell you about me?
- She said...
You crashed your car with a gallon of whiskey in your lap.
It was vodka.
Really cheap vodka.
I'm...
I'm not judging you.
Believe me, all right.
When Maryann found me I was...
Let's just say, I was a hell of a lot worse off than you.
She's a miracle worker.
You'll see.
Yeah, well, I won't be sticking around that long.
That's too bad.
My mama, when she thought something was too good to be true, she'd...
She'd say, "Satan in a Sunday hat".
That's exactly what this is.
You know, it took me a long time to stop looking over my shoulder too.
But there are good people in this world.
Sometimes... good shit happens.
He don't remember doin' it.
Like he had amnesia or something.
Holler if y'all need anything, okay?
Now, he's just sitting there, lookin' like a dog that lost his bone.
And then he says, "I did it.
"I killed those women.
- You were right all along."
- He didn't exactly say that.
You should've seen the look in his eye.
Ice cold.
Like he was talking about road kill.
Excuse me.
Well, thank God you got him, Detective Bellefleur.
Can I buy you a beer?
Show my appreciation?
That's all right, Rosie, I was just doin' my job.
Whole family full of freaks and killers.
Oughta be ashamed to show her face after what her brother did.
Sleazy little manslut, Jason Stackhouse, a goddamned murderer.
I'd pay good money to watch that boy fry.
He was so cute for a murderer, wonder why he never hit on me.
What's going on?
You're right, I shouldn't have come in today.
Why don't you go to my trailer, lie down?
I need to get out of here.
- It's not safe.
- I'm just gonna drive around.
I'll keep my doors locked.
I won't even get out of the car.
I need some time alone.
I gotta get these thoughts out of my head.
All right, all right, yeah.
I've got your tables.
Thank you, Sam.
For everything.
Please, Jesus, don't do this to me.
Shoot, darn it!
Son of a mother!
Fudge!
Evything all right?
Just a... a little car trouble, that's all.
Want me to take a look?
Don't tell anybody, but I don't know much about cars.
Sorry.
Thanks for trying.
I...
I guess I should call a tow.
Why don't you let me give you a ride home?
I'll get my buddy Hank at Auto Haven to take a look on my way back.
I can't be alone.
Course you can't.
How'bout I give you a ride home, stay with you until Sam gets off work?
I couldn't put you out.
Your brother's been real good to me.
Least I could do.
That's so kind of you, Rene.
I just wanna say...
I told Andy, I've known killers, and Jason ain't one.
- Thank you, Terry.
- Nobody ever listens to me.
But they should.
Ready?
I can't believe Jason gave you his truck.
He loves this truck.
I know, right?
I tried talking him out of it.
He wasn't hearing it, though.
Buckle up, now.
Thanks.
It's really true?
You can hear what I'm thinking right now?
What do I think about, think about, think about nothing, nothing, think about nothing...
Don't bother.
Thinking about nothing ain't possible.
Trust me, everyone's tried it around me.
Sooner or later you'll think about something.
What's kinda funny, is that...
Your thoughts don't have an accent.
That must be hard on you, livin' with that.
It is hard.
Sometimes.
You have no idea how sick and twisted some people are.
Lord, I can believe that, yes, ma'am.
It's one thing when they think horrible stuff about me,
I mean,
I'm kinda used to it.
But, when it's about my brother...
He's all I've got left.
I mean, I've lost everyone.
Thanks.
I've lost people too.
It don't ever get any easier.
But, you find ways to cope.
I thought I told you kids to take out the garbage.
What the hell are you watching?
Oh, my Lord.
Where'd you get this?
Coby?
Lisa, you answer me, right now.
It's Rene's.
We found it in the garage.
Go to your room.
It's hotter in here than hell on a Sunday.
I know, Gran used to leave the windows open all day, but I haven't felt safe doin' that in a while.
Have a seat, I'll fix us some iced teas.
Sounds good.
These fuckers' palates are as backwoods as their brains.
- Rene left his vest.
- I'll put it in the lost and found.
Hey, where's Sookie?
Did you see her?
- Where'd she go?
- She left with Rene about 20, 23 minutes ago.
- Rene, you take it sweet?
- Yes, ma'am.
You scared me.
Did I?
Sorry about that.
Don't think about it...
Blood, blood, so much blood...
She wasn't supposed to be here...
Shut up!
- Rene?
- Sookie ain't here?
You weren't supposed to be here.
You all right?
I'm... so jumpy these days.
Let me help you with that.
I'm gonna go get a mop.
What do you think you're doin'?
Stay away!
You're not gonna shoot me.
Told you.
She deserves it, needs it, wants to die.
That's why she fucks them fangers...
Fuck.
Goddamn it.
Get back here, you fucking bitch!
Dang it.
Nothing that'll cover up what you done.
You watching me now?
You freak.
You're the freak, Cindy.
You're the damn freak.
Fuckin' freak.
Fuck!
Spread your legs for a dead man.
Mama'd roll over in her grave...
Get the fuck out of here.
Sookie.
I'll teach you, you bitch!
What're you doing?
Get away from me!
Get out!
I can feel you in my head!
I thought you were Jason.
Die, fang fucker!
Stay the fuck out of my head!
Come on, Sookie.
Let's be...
Let's be friends.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
We can be friends.
Sookie.
Seriously, I was just kidding.
Can you fuckin' hear me, you filthy fucking cunt?
I'm gonna tear out your throat with my hands and fuck your dead face.
Shit.
Goddamn it.
I must have lost her.
Could be hiding in the woods.
I better go back and check.
Mind-reading, vampire-fucking, freak bitch!
You think you're so smart!
You smart now?
What the fuck are you?
You fuckin' freak fuck!
Fuckin' sick fuck.
Die, you fucking freak of nature!
Die...
Fucking bitch!
I... am... sorry.
No, Bill, please.
We gotta get him out of the light.
You look so pretty.
Like someone turned a light on under your skin.
Hospital gave her pain meds.
She's...
She's a little loopy.
Didn't you listen when I said I'd lose my shit if anything ever happened to you?
Don't lose your shit.
I'm fine.
Did Sam tell you that he saved my life?
He turned into a dog and bit Rene.
No shit.
I'm gonna need some of them drugs they gave you.
You guys, we should let her rest.
You need to let people see the real you.
'Cause you're kind and brave.
There's nothing there not to love.
Right back at you.
All right then.
Thanks.
DA's dropping the charges.
No.
No fucking way.
He confessed.
The marks on Amy Burley's neck match Rene's belt.
Or Drew Marshall.
Whatever the hell his name is.
He near about put Sookie in a body bag.
We got no reason to hold Stackhouse.
That's horseshit!
Get ahold of yourself.
I don't need you screwing things up even worse.
So, what?
We're just gonna let him go?
Not "we."
You brought him in.
You let him go.
Right now, Andy.
Is there some way I can get a magazine?
This shit's putting me to sleep.
- What're you doin'?
- Get out of here.
What?
You heard me.
Get the fuck out of here.
- Is this some kinda trick or something?
- No, you stupid shit.
It ain't a trick.
It's a fucking miracle!
Oh, sweet Jesus, please forgive me.
I had no idea, Sookie, I swear.
- Course you didn't.
- I brought him around my kids.
I slept in the bed with him every night.
And all that time, it was nothin' but lies.
I mean, his name, his accent.
God, you think you know someone.
How could I not know?
None of us did.
- Don't blame yourself, honey.
- I can't help it.
I told you to stay out of my thoughts.
Is that why you didn't listen in on Rene?
It's like he kept that part of himself... locked away in some... dark... corner of his mind.
Oh, God.
I am so sorry.
I want you to promise me something, okay?
Okay.
Someday, if I ever find another man.
I want you to look inside his head and tell me everything that's in there.
Arlene, it doesn't really work that way.
Just promise me, okay?
'Cause I have the worst taste in men.
Is Bill gonna be okay?
I don't think so.
Oh, honey.
Oh, sweet baby.
I'm gonna head on over to the bar.
Make sure Terry ain't P-T-S-Ding all over my clam chowder.
Thanks, Lafayette.
I appreciate you holding down the fort.
No worries, boyfriend. 'Cause I'm gonna hit your ass up for a raise, soon as they pull them stitches out your forehead.
Call me later, T.
Where have you been?
I left you like 5 messages.
I didn't get any messages.
What?
Look, we don't have to talk about this now.
Sookie almost died.
And she would've, if you hadn't been there.
I'm glad you were, okay?
I was...
I was worried about you.
I'm sure you were.
You worry about everybody.
But Sookie's right, you're an amazing guy.
You deserve to get everything you want.
And so do I.
What does that mean?
Take good care of her.
Wait, Tara...
Maryann, this is my friend Sam.
Sam, this is Maryann.
Sam, it's so nice to meet you.
You ready to go?
What the hell are you doing here?
Did you think I wasn't gonna find you?
You silly, silly dog.
I should've known.
'Cause there were things he liked to do... in bed that no normal man ever does.
I've never been happier to see you in my life.
That's nice, but, sweetie, I'm... black and blue all over and you're squeezing me.
Sorry.
Shit, look what that son of a bitch did to you.
I can't believe I gave him my truck.
If he was still alive right now, I'm... fuckin' kill him again.
Excuse me.
- Me and my mouth.
- She'll be all right.
Eventually.
You know, I was sitting in that jail, and I just kept thinkin' about all the stupid stuff I'd done.
That must've kept you busy.
And I know it seems like all I ever think about's myself.
And drinking and chasing women.
But that's only 'cause I thought that's all I was good at.
That's not true.
You were good at football.
Not good enough for a scholarship.
I ain't never been good enough for anything.
Or anybody.
Well, except maybe Amy.
But she's gone, so...
So I was in there, waitin' to die too, and I realized
my life wasn't worth nothing.
I'd never done nothing worth being proud of.
And all I could think to do was to end it.
- Jason...
- No, it's okay.
'Cause then, something happened.
I was saved.
I was given a second chance.
And now I know that all this...
this bad stuff that happened, it happened for a reason.
What's that?
I ain't sure yet.
But I do know that I'm meant to do something important with my life.
And soon as I find out what that is,
- I ain't gonna fuck it up.
- That's good.
- I guess.
- Yeah.
I love you, Sook.
And...
I'm gonna take good care of you from now on.
I promise.
How about you just take care of yourself and... stay out of trouble?
Come on, you don't have to worry about me no more.
I'm good.
Why is all fucking garbage on the side of the garbage can?
Nasty motherfuckers.
Got no...
Goddamn home training.
Oh, my God!
Daddy.
Oh, Daddy.
It is you.
I found you.
I found you.
They said you were dead.
But I knew you weren't.
Daddy.
Hold me close...
You're alive?
Technically, no.
But I am healed.
I fed.
Would you like to come in?
Without my blood it'll take weeks for you to heal.
I don't care.
After everything,
I... just need to feel human right now.
I failed you.
You were willing to sacrifice yourself to save me.
If I'd just been...
My life is too short for all that.
{TWO WEEKS LATER}
Yesterday, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that limiting marriage betweenonlyhumanmen and women is unconstitutional, effectively legalizing vampire marriage in the state.
Courthouses will be staying open after dark to accommodate hundreds of couples from all over America.
Oh, my God, you know what this means?
- Now you and Bill can get married.
- Stop it, Arlene.
This isn't Vermont.
Besides, he hasn't even asked me yet.
And I don't know what I'd say if he did.
You should marry Bill.
Hell, I'll even throw you a party.
Won't even break the bank, is all you need is a couple kegs of Tru Blood, seein' as how they don't eat or drink.
Bet there's even a vampire band and vampire wedding decorations.
Put Arlene's party to shame.
You know you're about as subtle as a flying brick?
Maryann says if you want something, you don't wait for it to come to you.
- You demand it...
- Do me a favor, don't quote Maryann to me.
Excuse me for giving a damn.
You heard from your cousin, by any chance?
'Cause I'm about to give away his job.
But this one time Lafayette went to Marthaville for the night.
He ended up go-go dancing in Palm Beach for like 8 months.
Fantastic.
People disappear all the time, but they're never really gone.
The good parts of 'em always stay put.
I hope you're right about that,
Terry.
Your hair's like a sunset after a bomb went off.
Pretty.
And God said,
"Let there be light."
And there was light.
And even though we stand in darkness today, we shall not fear.
For God has given us the ultimate weapon.
The ultimate salvation!
The sun.
And he has placed in front of us a daunting but righteous task.
We will not falter.
We will not rest.
Until we have brought God's holy light down on each and every bloodsucking abomination!
- Amen.
- Praise Jesus!
Time to pack it up, Andy.
My family used to own this whole damn town.
The land this rat hole stands on included.
You don't own this rat hole no more,
- so I'm cuttin' you off.
- Join the club.
One minute you're a hero, the next you can't get a fuckin' drink.
I ain't never seen a bird fly so high it don't have to come down sometime.
- What's that for?
- It's your pity party.
Only one you're getting from me, so suck it up.
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me.
It's just easier for me not to hate you.
Hating takes a lot of energy.
And I'm saving mine up for all the good shit that's coming my way.
'Cause I am a good person, and I deserve good shit in my life.
Yeah, put it on a bumper sticker.
Thank you, Sookie.
Where's Vampire Bill at tonight?
Is he out celebrating?
Some sort of vampire party?
Actually, we're celebrating together later.
Just tell him congratulations from me.
I don't care what nobody says, if I met a nice vampire girl,
- I'd be proud to have her on my arm.
- I'd love to see your mama's face
- if you brought her home for dinner.
- Yeah, me too.
You know, yeah.
I mean, does Bill know anybody my age?
Seriously.
Hi, Daddy.
What is this?
There are favors and there are... favors.
She is extremely annoying.
You can't do this.
We had a deal.
Now the terms have changed.
She's yours.
Unless you wanna give me Sookie?
It's just a suggestion.
Though a few nights with this one may change your mind.
Good luck.
Who's good to eat around here?
He ain't listening to me.
Good luck.
We're closing.
Give me your keys.
I ain't giving you shit, Stackhouse.
I'm a failure.
A pathetic fuckin' loser.
And everybody knows it.
Just like she said they would.
She's real happy with herself.
It don't ever make me happy to see someone in pain.
I'm gonna call your sister to come pick you up.
Detective Bellefleur.
- Where's my car?
- Andy Bellefleur, the only thing you're driving tonight is us crazy.
Portia{ said she's} is on her way to pick you up.
Give me your keys.
I don't have 'em.
Left 'em in the car.
Right here, underneath this light.
- Some son of a bitch stole my car.
- You sure this is where you parked it?
This whole town's gone to shit.
Nobody used to go murdering each other, stealing' cars.
That's what happens when you don't let a good cop do his job.
Ain't that it over there?
That ain't where I parked it.
What the hell?
That ain't mine, I swear.
You know that old leather jacket I wear sometime?
The brown one?
Well, make sure it goes to Hoyt.
I told him it was lucky.
It ain't.
But he don't know that.
Sookie'll get the house.
My bank account.
But I want you to have my truck.
Really?
You've been a good friend, Rene.
Thanks, man.
I'm giving it back though, soon as they let you go.
They ain't never letting me go, Rene.
There's something inside me that's just...
- It's wrong.
- Nah, come on now.
It ain't like you went and killed a bunch a... innocent women.
- What?
- They were fangbangers.
If you hadn't have done it, it was a matter of time.
Wait, are you calling my grandma a fangbanger?
Don't get your back all up, you...
I'm just sayin', you must've had your reasons, that's all.
There ain't no good reason for what I did.
- Suppose you're right.
- You can't go in there.
He's my brother.
He's only allowed one visitor at a time.
You can either let me by or throw me in there, but I'm gonna see my brother.
- I'm sorry, Sookie.
I'm so sorry.
- You've have nothing to be sorry for.
I wish I got here sooner, before you went and confessed to something.
I don't even remember doing any of it.
I just know I did.
Jason, you need to shut up, okay?
'Cause I'm real close to finding out who the real killer is.
Transcript:
YYeTs.net
Synchro:
Arrow, mpm
His name's Drew Marshall.
He had a sister named Cindy, and I think he killed her.
Strangled her just like Maudette and Dawn and Amy.
{\If she knows this }How come she hasn't gone to the cops and gotten Jason out.
'Cause I tried that, and so far the cops have done diddlysquat to protect me and my family.
I don't have any evidence yet.
I ignore what Drew Marshall looks like.
So you can't really be sure he's the killer.
I've seen what's inside his head.
They'll never believe that about him, but it's the truth.
There's all kinds of strangeness in this world.
I know you wanna help me, but that's only 'cause you can't accept the truth.
I'm a murderer.
And I'm going to hell.
Plain and simple.
You aren't hearing me.
I know who the killer is.
And all we gotta do is find him.
Listen to me, don't be stupid.
- What's your problem?
- Make her go away.
Am I your fucking butler?
Please, just get her out of here.
Now, you heard him.
Zoo's closed.
Did you get the fax from the Bunkie police department about Drew Marshall, the man who's probably the real killer?
Never heard of no fax from no Bunkie P.D., or Drew-whoever.
But I'll tell you one thing.
The real killer is right there, where he belongs.
You are one hell of a sorry excuse for a cop and a human being,
Andy, and it's just a matter of time before everyone knows it.
Hi, I'm Tara.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I thought you might be hungry.
Okay, this isn't food.
This is sculpture.
And this place...
You're not really just a social worker, are you?
I'm a lot of things.
- Just like you.
Coffee?
- Sure.
I mean, you're not just a drunk-driving bartender, are you?
You're also intelligent, resourceful.
Strong.
A survivor.
I don't feel like any of those things right now.
I didn't just wreck my car,
I totaled my whole life.
All of it.
Well, I suppose that's one way of looking at it.
Personally, I see your situation as an opportunity.
I just got a fake exorcism and a DUI.
I probably lost my job.
All of my friends.
And my mother disowned me.
I'm sorry, but I don't get how that's an opportunity.
Maybe life has just cleared out all the things that weren't working.
Now you've got room to rebuild.
Decide exactly what you want your life to look like.
And make that happen.
What do you want, Tara?
What do you want your life to be?
I don't know.
I guess I never really let myself want anything.
That breaks my heart.
Yeah, well, there are people a lot worse off than me.
I'm sure.
I should probably let you get back to helping them.
Instead of watching me cry all over your nice breakfast.
I appreciate everything you've done for me.
And I promise to pay back the bail as soon as I can.
Tara, sit down.
You haven't touched your food, your dress isn't dry, and I think we both know you've got nowhere to go.
Please.
I know it's hard for you to trust me, but I really do just wanna help.
Even if that means giving you a place to stay until you figure things out.
- Why would you do that?
- 'Cause it's what I do.
It's what I want my life to be:
helping people.
Not because I feel sorry for you, and not because I want anything back from you.
- Then why?
- Because you deserve a chance.
And I'm in a position to give you one.
You wanna end this thing, that's fine.
The least you could do is call me back and tell me where the fuck you are so I can stop worrying.
Thanks a lot, I'll talk to you later, bye.
- What are you doing here?
- I got the lunch shift.
With everything going on with Jason, I figured you'd take the day off.
I'm not staying home and hiding, having people think I'm ashamed.
Besides, I'm gonna need all the money I can get to hire a p.i.
Drew Marshall is somewhere in this town.
Who knows how many times he's sat in one of those booths, looked me in right in the eye and ordered a burger and fries.
- Yeah, but wouldn't you have heard him?
- Wouldn't you've smelled him?
I ain't a shortwave radio.
I spend most of my time trying not to listen.
- Sorry, I didn't mean...
- It's okay.
I better start my prep.
You can only have five minutes with him.
Five minutes.
Mr. Stackhouse?
My name is Orry Dawson.
I told 'em I don't need no lawyer.
I'm not a lawyer.
I'm here on behalf of the Fellowship of the Sun.
That anti-vampire church?
We are a religious organization dedicated to the preservation and salvation of the human race.
Good.
'Cause I thought you just hated vampires.
And I used to, but then I got to know one, and he was a pretty decent guy.
Until I got him killed.
See, that's where you're wrong.
What you did, it was a service to your race and to Jesus.
And you should be proud of that.
Last year there were over 800 reported vampire-related attacks in Louisiana alone.
And the law won't do nothing about it.
They are too busy respecting those fiends and their...
Their civil rights.
What about our rights?
Our rights to be safe in our own neighborhoods, our right to our own blood?
No, I don't know nothing about that.
Look, uh...
Officially, the church can't condone what you did.
You took the lives of four women.
Women who had tainted themselves and their race, but still, human women.
But we do recognize that even though your methods may have been flawed, your intentions were pure.
I got no idea what you're talkin' about.
That's smart.
Don't admit to anything.
The church has started up a fund for your defense.
In the meantime, here's something to help you pass the time.
You are a brave soldier, Jason Stackhouse.
God loves you.
You...
You will be saved.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I was looking for Maryann.
She'll be right back.
You must be Tara.
Come on in.
I'm Eggs.
Eggs?
It's actually Benedict.
- Benedict Talley, so...
- Eggs Benedict.
Ah, shit, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have laughed.
- My name's screwed up too.
- Tara's a pretty name.
Suits you.
Maryann did...
Didn't tell me she...
She had a...
A boyfriend.
I'm...
I'm just stayin' here till I get back on my feet.
Just like you.
So collecting stray black people, that some kind of hobby of hers?
She was right about you.
You are funny.
- What else she tell you about me?
- She said...
You crashed your car with a gallon of whiskey in your lap.
It was vodka.
Really cheap vodka.
I'm...
I'm not judging you.
Believe me, all right.
When Maryann found me I was...
Let's just say, I was a hell of a lot worse off than you.
She's a miracle worker.
You'll see.
Yeah, well, I won't be sticking around that long.
That's too bad.
My mama, when she thought something was too good to be true, she'd...
She'd say, "Satan in a Sunday hat".
That's exactly what this is.
You know, it took me a long time to stop looking over my shoulder too.
But there are good people in this world.
Sometimes... good shit happens.
He don't remember doin' it.
Like he had amnesia or something.
Holler if y'all need anything, okay?
Now, he's just sitting there, lookin' like a dog that lost his bone.
And then he says, "I did it.
"I killed those women.
- You were right all along."
- He didn't exactly say that.
You should've seen the look in his eye.
Ice cold.
Like he was talking about road kill.
Excuse me.
Well, thank God you got him, Detective Bellefleur.
Can I buy you a beer?
Show my appreciation?
That's all right, Rosie, I was just doin' my job.
Whole family full of freaks and killers.
Oughta be ashamed to show her face after what her brother did.
Sleazy little manslut, Jason Stackhouse, a goddamned murderer.
I'd pay good money to watch that boy fry.
He was so cute for a murderer, wonder why he never hit on me.
What's going on?
You're right, I shouldn't have come in today.
Why don't you go to my trailer, lie down?
I need to get out of here.
- It's not safe.
- I'm just gonna drive around.
I'll keep my doors locked.
I won't even get out of the car.
I need some time alone.
I gotta get these thoughts out of my head.
All right, all right, yeah.
I've got your tables.
Thank you, Sam.
For everything.
Please, Jesus, don't do this to me.
Shoot, darn it!
Son of a mother!
Fudge!
Evything all right?
Just a... a little car trouble, that's all.
Want me to take a look?
Don't tell anybody, but I don't know much about cars.
Sorry.
Thanks for trying.
I...
I guess I should call a tow.
Why don't you let me give you a ride home?
I'll get my buddy Hank at Auto Haven to take a look on my way back.
I can't be alone.
Course you can't.
How'bout I give you a ride home, stay with you until Sam gets off work?
I couldn't put you out.
Your brother's been real good to me.
Least I could do.
That's so kind of you, Rene.
I just wanna say...
I told Andy, I've known killers, and Jason ain't one.
- Thank you, Terry.
- Nobody ever listens to me.
But they should.
Ready?
I can't believe Jason gave you his truck.
He loves this truck.
I know, right?
I tried talking him out of it.
He wasn't hearing it, though.
Buckle up, now.
Thanks.
It's really true?
You can hear what I'm thinking right now?
What do I think about, think about, think about nothing, nothing, think about nothing...
Don't bother.
Thinking about nothing ain't possible.
Trust me, everyone's tried it around me.
Sooner or later you'll think about something.
What's kinda funny, is that...
Your thoughts don't have an accent.
That must be hard on you, livin' with that.
It is hard.
Sometimes.
You have no idea how sick and twisted some people are.
Lord, I can believe that, yes, ma'am.
It's one thing when they think horrible stuff about me,
I mean,
I'm kinda used to it.
But, when it's about my brother...
He's all I've got left.
I mean, I've lost everyone.
Thanks.
I've lost people too.
It don't ever get any easier.
But, you find ways to cope.
I thought I told you kids to take out the garbage.
What the hell are you watching?
Oh, my Lord.
Where'd you get this?
Coby?
Lisa, you answer me, right now.
It's Rene's.
We found it in the garage.
Go to your room.
It's hotter in here than hell on a Sunday.
I know, Gran used to leave the windows open all day, but I haven't felt safe doin' that in a while.
Have a seat, I'll fix us some iced teas.
Sounds good.
These fuckers' palates are as backwoods as their brains.
- Rene left his vest.
- I'll put it in the lost and found.
Hey, where's Sookie?
Did you see her?
- Where'd she go?
- She left with Rene about 20, 23 minutes ago.
- Rene, you take it sweet?
- Yes, ma'am.
You scared me.
Did I?
Sorry about that.
Don't think about it...
Blood, blood, so much blood...
She wasn't supposed to be here...
Shut up!
- Rene?
- Sookie ain't here?
You weren't supposed to be here.
You all right?
I'm... so jumpy these days.
Let me help you with that.
I'm gonna go get a mop.
What do you think you're doin'?
Stay away!
You're not gonna shoot me.
Told you.
She deserves it, needs it, wants to die.
That's why she fucks them fangers...
Fuck.
Goddamn it.
Get back here, you fucking bitch!
Dang it.
Nothing that'll cover up what you done.
You watching me now?
You freak.
You're the freak, Cindy.
You're the damn freak.
Fuckin' freak.
Fuck!
Spread your legs for a dead man.
Mama'd roll over in her grave...
Get the fuck out of here.
Sookie.
I'll teach you, you bitch!
What're you doing?
Get away from me!
Get out!
I can feel you in my head!
I thought you were Jason.
Die, fang fucker!
Stay the fuck out of my head!
Come on, Sookie.
Let's be...
Let's be friends.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
We can be friends.
Sookie.
Seriously, I was just kidding.
Can you fuckin' hear me, you filthy fucking cunt?
I'm gonna tear out your throat with my hands and fuck your dead face.
Shit.
Goddamn it.
I must have lost her.
Could be hiding in the woods.
I better go back and check.
Mind-reading, vampire-fucking, freak bitch!
You think you're so smart!
You smart now?
What the fuck are you?
You fuckin' freak fuck!
Fuckin' sick fuck.
Die, you fucking freak of nature!
Die...
Fucking bitch!
I... am... sorry.
No, Bill, please.
We gotta get him out of the light.
You look so pretty.
Like someone turned a light on under your skin.
Hospital gave her pain meds.
She's...
She's a little loopy.
Didn't you listen when I said I'd lose my shit if anything ever happened to you?
Don't lose your shit.
I'm fine.
Did Sam tell you that he saved my life?
He turned into a dog and bit Rene.
No shit.
I'm gonna need some of them drugs they gave you.
You guys, we should let her rest.
You need to let people see the real you.
'Cause you're kind and brave.
There's nothing there not to love.
Right back at you.
All right then.
Thanks.
DA's dropping the charges.
No.
No fucking way.
He confessed.
The marks on Amy Burley's neck match Rene's belt.
Or Drew Marshall.
Whatever the hell his name is.
He near about put Sookie in a body bag.
We got no reason to hold Stackhouse.
That's horseshit!
Get ahold of yourself.
I don't need you screwing things up even worse.
So, what?
We're just gonna let him go?
Not "we."
You brought him in.
You let him go.
Right now, Andy.
Is there some way I can get a magazine?
This shit's putting me to sleep.
- What're you doin'?
- Get out of here.
What?
You heard me.
Get the fuck out of here.
- Is this some kinda trick or something?
- No, you stupid shit.
It ain't a trick.
It's a fucking miracle!
Oh, sweet Jesus, please forgive me.
I had no idea, Sookie, I swear.
- Course you didn't.
- I brought him around my kids.
I slept in the bed with him every night.
And all that time, it was nothin' but lies.
I mean, his name, his accent.
God, you think you know someone.
How could I not know?
None of us did.
- Don't blame yourself, honey.
- I can't help it.
I told you to stay out of my thoughts.
Is that why you didn't listen in on Rene?
It's like he kept that part of himself... locked away in some... dark... corner of his mind.
Oh, God.
I am so sorry.
I want you to promise me something, okay?
Okay.
Someday, if I ever find another man.
I want you to look inside his head and tell me everything that's in there.
Arlene, it doesn't really work that way.
Just promise me, okay?
'Cause I have the worst taste in men.
Is Bill gonna be okay?
I don't think so.
Oh, honey.
Oh, sweet baby.
I'm gonna head on over to the bar.
Make sure Terry ain't P-T-S-Ding all over my clam chowder.
Thanks, Lafayette.
I appreciate you holding down the fort.
No worries, boyfriend. 'Cause I'm gonna hit your ass up for a raise, soon as they pull them stitches out your forehead.
Call me later, T.
Where have you been?
I left you like 5 messages.
I didn't get any messages.
What?
Look, we don't have to talk about this now.
Sookie almost died.
And she would've, if you hadn't been there.
I'm glad you were, okay?
I was...
I was worried about you.
I'm sure you were.
You worry about everybody.
But Sookie's right, you're an amazing guy.
You deserve to get everything you want.
And so do I.
What does that mean?
Take good care of her.
Wait, Tara...
Maryann, this is my friend Sam.
Sam, this is Maryann.
Sam, it's so nice to meet you.
You ready to go?
What the hell are you doing here?
Did you think I wasn't gonna find you?
You silly, silly dog.
I should've known.
'Cause there were things he liked to do... in bed that no normal man ever does.
I've never been happier to see you in my life.
That's nice, but, sweetie, I'm... black and blue all over and you're squeezing me.
Sorry.
Shit, look what that son of a bitch did to you.
I can't believe I gave him my truck.
If he was still alive right now, I'm... fuckin' kill him again.
Excuse me.
- Me and my mouth.
- She'll be all right.
Eventually.
You know, I was sitting in that jail, and I just kept thinkin' about all the stupid stuff I'd done.
That must've kept you busy.
And I know it seems like all I ever think about's myself.
And drinking and chasing women.
But that's only 'cause I thought that's all I was good at.
That's not true.
You were good at football.
Not good enough for a scholarship.
I ain't never been good enough for anything.
Or anybody.
Well, except maybe Amy.
But she's gone, so...
So I was in there, waitin' to die too, and I realized
my life wasn't worth nothing.
I'd never done nothing worth being proud of.
And all I could think to do was to end it.
- Jason...
- No, it's okay.
'Cause then, something happened.
I was saved.
I was given a second chance.
And now I know that all this...
this bad stuff that happened, it happened for a reason.
What's that?
I ain't sure yet.
But I do know that I'm meant to do something important with my life.
And soon as I find out what that is,
- I ain't gonna fuck it up.
- That's good.
- I guess.
- Yeah.
I love you, Sook.
And...
I'm gonna take good care of you from now on.
I promise.
How about you just take care of yourself and... stay out of trouble?
Come on, you don't have to worry about me no more.
I'm good.
Why is all fucking garbage on the side of the garbage can?
Nasty motherfuckers.
Got no...
Goddamn home training.
Oh, my God!
Daddy.
Oh, Daddy.
It is you.
I found you.
I found you.
They said you were dead.
But I knew you weren't.
Daddy.
Hold me close...
You're alive?
Technically, no.
But I am healed.
I fed.
Would you like to come in?
Without my blood it'll take weeks for you to heal.
I don't care.
After everything,
I... just need to feel human right now.
I failed you.
You were willing to sacrifice yourself to save me.
If I'd just been...
My life is too short for all that.
{\TWO WEEKS LATER}
Yesterday, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that limiting marriage betweenonlyhumanmen and women is unconstitutional, effectively legalizing vampire marriage in the state.
Courthouses will be staying open after dark to accommodate hundreds of couples from all over America.
Oh, my God, you know what this means?
- Now you and Bill can get married.
- Stop it, Arlene.
This isn't Vermont.
Besides, he hasn't even asked me yet.
And I don't know what I'd say if he did.
You should marry Bill.
Hell, I'll even throw you a party.
Won't even break the bank, is all you need is a couple kegs of Tru Blood, seein' as how they don't eat or drink.
Bet there's even a vampire band and vampire wedding decorations.
Put Arlene's party to shame.
You know you're about as subtle as a flying brick?
Maryann says if you want something, you don't wait for it to come to you.
- You demand it...
- Do me a favor, don't quote Maryann to me.
Excuse me for giving a damn.
You heard from your cousin, by any chance?
'Cause I'm about to give away his job.
But this one time Lafayette went to Marthaville for the night.
He ended up go-go dancing in Palm Beach for like 8 months.
Fantastic.
People disappear all the time, but they're never really gone.
The good parts of 'em always stay put.
I hope you're right about that,
Terry.
Your hair's like a sunset after a bomb went off.
Pretty.
And God said,
"Let there be light."
And there was light.
And even though we stand in darkness today, we shall not fear.
For God has given us the ultimate weapon.
The ultimate salvation!
The sun.
And he has placed in front of us a daunting but righteous task.
We will not falter.
We will not rest.
Until we have brought God's holy light down on each and every bloodsucking abomination!
- Amen.
- Praise Jesus!
Time to pack it up, Andy.
My family used to own this whole damn town.
The land this rat hole stands on included.
You don't own this rat hole no more,
- so I'm cuttin' you off.
- Join the club.
One minute you're a hero, the next you can't get a fuckin' drink.
I ain't never seen a bird fly so high it don't have to come down sometime.
- What's that for?
- It's your pity party.
Only one you're getting from me, so suck it up.
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me.
It's just easier for me not to hate you.
Hating takes a lot of energy.
And I'm saving mine up for all the good shit that's coming my way.
'Cause I am a good person, and I deserve good shit in my life.
Yeah, put it on a bumper sticker.
Thank you, Sookie.
Where's Vampire Bill at tonight?
Is he out celebrating?
Some sort of vampire party?
Actually, we're celebrating together later.
Just tell him congratulations from me.
I don't care what nobody says, if I met a nice vampire girl,
- I'd be proud to have her on my arm.
- I'd love to see your mama's face
- if you brought her home for dinner.
- Yeah, me too.
You know, yeah.
I mean, does Bill know anybody my age?
Seriously.
Hi, Daddy.
What is this?
There are favors and there are... favors.
She is extremely annoying.
You can't do this.
We had a deal.
Now the terms have changed.
She's yours.
Unless you wanna give me Sookie?
It's just a suggestion.
Though a few nights with this one may change your mind.
Good luck.
Who's good to eat around here?
He ain't listening to me.
Good luck.
We're closing.
Give me your keys.
I ain't giving you shit, Stackhouse.
I'm a failure.
A pathetic fuckin' loser.
And everybody knows it.
Just like she said they would.
She's real happy with herself.
It don't ever make me happy to see someone in pain.
I'm gonna call your sister to come pick you up.
Detective Bellefleur.
- Where's my car?
- Andy Bellefleur, the only thing you're driving tonight is us crazy.
Portia{\ said she's} is on her way to pick you up.
Give me your keys.
I don't have 'em.
Left 'em in the car.
Right here, underneath this light.
- Some son of a bitch stole my car.
- You sure this is where you parked it?
This whole town's gone to shit.
Nobody used to go murdering each other, stealing' cars.
That's what happens when you don't let a good cop do his job.
Ain't that it over there?
That ain't where I parked it.
What the hell?
That ain't mine, I swear.
La team AB+ vous retrouve I'année prochaine
You know that old leather jacket I wear sometime?
The brown one?
Well, make sure it goes to Hoyt.
I told him it was lucky.
It ain't.
But he don't know that.
Sookie'll get the house.
My bank account.
But I want you to have my truck.
Really?
You've been a good friend, Rene.
Thanks, man.
I'm giving it back though, soon as they let you go.
They ain't never letting me go, Rene.
There's something inside me that's just...
- It's wrong.
- Nah, come on now.
It ain't like you went and killed a bunch a... innocent women.
- What?
- They were fangbangers.
If you hadn't have done it, it was a matter of time.
Wait, are you calling my grandma a fangbanger?
Don't get your back all up, you...
I'm just sayin', you must've had your reasons, that's all.
There ain't no good reason for what I did.
- Suppose you're right.
- You can't go in there.
He's my brother.
He's only allowed one visitor at a time.
You can either let me by or throw me in there, but I'm gonna see my brother.
- I'm sorry, Sookie.
I'm so sorry.
- You've have nothing to be sorry for.
I wish I got here sooner, before you went and confessed to something.
I don't even remember doing any of it.
I just know I did.
Jason, you need to shut up, okay?
'Cause I'm real close to finding out who the real killer is.
Transcript:
YYeTs.net
Synchro:
Arrow, mpm
His name's Drew Marshall.
He had a sister named Cindy, and I think he killed her.
Strangled her just like Maudette and Dawn and Amy.
{\If she knows this }How come she hasn't gone to the cops and gotten Jason out.
'Cause I tried that, and so far the cops have done diddlysquat to protect me and my family.
I don't have any evidence yet.
I ignore what Drew Marshall looks like.
So you can't really be sure he's the killer.
I've seen what's inside his head.
They'll never believe that about him, but it's the truth.
There's all kinds of strangeness in this world.
I know you wanna help me, but that's only 'cause you can't accept the truth.
I'm a murderer.
And I'm going to hell.
Plain and simple.
You aren't hearing me.
I know who the killer is.
And all we gotta do is find him.
Listen to me, don't be stupid.
- What's your problem?
- Make her go away.
Am I your fucking butler?
Please, just get her out of here.
Now, you heard him.
Zoo's closed.
Did you get the fax from the Bunkie police department about Drew Marshall, the man who's probably the real killer?
Never heard of no fax from no Bunkie P.D., or Drew-whoever.
But I'll tell you one thing.
The real killer is right there, where he belongs.
You are one hell of a sorry excuse for a cop and a human being,
Andy, and it's just a matter of time before everyone knows it.
Hi, I'm Tara.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I thought you might be hungry.
Okay, this isn't food.
This is sculpture.
And this place...
You're not really just a social worker, are you?
I'm a lot of things.
- Just like you.
Coffee?
- Sure.
I mean, you're not just a drunk-driving bartender, are you?
You're also intelligent, resourceful.
Strong.
A survivor.
I don't feel like any of those things right now.
I didn't just wreck my car,
I totaled my whole life.
All of it.
Well, I suppose that's one way of looking at it.
Personally, I see your situation as an opportunity.
I just got a fake exorcism and a DUI.
I probably lost my job.
All of my friends.
And my mother disowned me.
I'm sorry, but I don't get how that's an opportunity.
Maybe life has just cleared out all the things that weren't working.
Now you've got room to rebuild.
Decide exactly what you want your life to look like.
And make that happen.
What do you want, Tara?
What do you want your life to be?
I don't know.
I guess I never really let myself want anything.
That breaks my heart.
Yeah, well, there are people a lot worse off than me.
I'm sure.
I should probably let you get back to helping them.
Instead of watching me cry all over your nice breakfast.
I appreciate everything you've done for me.
And I promise to pay back the bail as soon as I can.
Tara, sit down.
You haven't touched your food, your dress isn't dry, and I think we both know you've got nowhere to go.
Please.
I know it's hard for you to trust me, but I really do just wanna help.
Even if that means giving you a place to stay until you figure things out.
- Why would you do that?
- 'Cause it's what I do.
It's what I want my life to be:
helping people.
Not because I feel sorry for you, and not because I want anything back from you.
- Then why?
- Because you deserve a chance.
And I'm in a position to give you one.
You wanna end this thing, that's fine.
The least you could do is call me back and tell me where the fuck you are so I can stop worrying.
Thanks a lot, I'll talk to you later, bye.
- What are you doing here?
- I got the lunch shift.
With everything going on with Jason, I figured you'd take the day off.
I'm not staying home and hiding, having people think I'm ashamed.
Besides, I'm gonna need all the money I can get to hire a p.i.
Drew Marshall is somewhere in this town.
Who knows how many times he's sat in one of those booths, looked me in right in the eye and ordered a burger and fries.
- Yeah, but wouldn't you have heard him?
- Wouldn't you've smelled him?
I ain't a shortwave radio.
I spend most of my time trying not to listen.
- Sorry, I didn't mean...
- It's okay.
I better start my prep.
You can only have five minutes with him.
Five minutes.
Mr. Stackhouse?
My name is Orry Dawson.
I told 'em I don't need no lawyer.
I'm not a lawyer.
I'm here on behalf of the Fellowship of the Sun.
That anti-vampire church?
We are a religious organization dedicated to the preservation and salvation of the human race.
Good.
'Cause I thought you just hated vampires.
And I used to, but then I got to know one, and he was a pretty decent guy.
Until I got him killed.
See, that's where you're wrong.
What you did, it was a service to your race and to Jesus.
And you should be proud of that.
Last year there were over 800 reported vampire-related attacks in Louisiana alone.
And the law won't do nothing about it.
They are too busy respecting those fiends and their...
Their civil rights.
What about our rights?
Our rights to be safe in our own neighborhoods, our right to our own blood?
No, I don't know nothing about that.
Look, uh...
Officially, the church can't condone what you did.
You took the lives of four women.
Women who had tainted themselves and their race, but still, human women.
But we do recognize that even though your methods may have been flawed, your intentions were pure.
I got no idea what you're talkin' about.
That's smart.
Don't admit to anything.
The church has started up a fund for your defense.
In the meantime, here's something to help you pass the time.
You are a brave soldier, Jason Stackhouse.
God loves you.
You...
You will be saved.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I was looking for Maryann.
She'll be right back.
You must be Tara.
Come on in.
I'm Eggs.
Eggs?
It's actually Benedict.
- Benedict Talley, so...
- Eggs Benedict.
Ah, shit, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have laughed.
- My name's screwed up too.
- Tara's a pretty name.
Suits you.
Maryann did...
Didn't tell me she...
She had a...
A boyfriend.
I'm...
I'm just stayin' here till I get back on my feet.
Just like you.
So collecting stray black people, that some kind of hobby of hers?
She was right about you.
You are funny.
- What else she tell you about me?
- She said...
You crashed your car with a gallon of whiskey in your lap.
It was vodka.
Really cheap vodka.
I'm...
I'm not judging you.
Believe me, all right.
When Maryann found me I was...
Let's just say, I was a hell of a lot worse off than you.
She's a miracle worker.
You'll see.
Yeah, well, I won't be sticking around that long.
That's too bad.
My mama, when she thought something was too good to be true, she'd...
She'd say, "Satan in a Sunday hat".
That's exactly what this is.
You know, it took me a long time to stop looking over my shoulder too.
But there are good people in this world.
Sometimes... good shit happens.
He don't remember doin' it.
Like he had amnesia or something.
Holler if y'all need anything, okay?
Now, he's just sitting there, lookin' like a dog that lost his bone.
And then he says, "I did it.
"I killed those women.
- You were right all along."
- He didn't exactly say that.
You should've seen the look in his eye.
Ice cold.
Like he was talking about road kill.
Excuse me.
Well, thank God you got him, Detective Bellefleur.
Can I buy you a beer?
Show my appreciation?
That's all right, Rosie, I was just doin' my job.
Whole family full of freaks and killers.
Oughta be ashamed to show her face after what her brother did.
Sleazy little manslut, Jason Stackhouse, a goddamned murderer.
I'd pay good money to watch that boy fry.
He was so cute for a murderer, wonder why he never hit on me.
What's going on?
You're right, I shouldn't have come in today.
Why don't you go to my trailer, lie down?
I need to get out of here.
- It's not safe.
- I'm just gonna drive around.
I'll keep my doors locked.
I won't even get out of the car.
I need some time alone.
I gotta get these thoughts out of my head.
All right, all right, yeah.
I've got your tables.
Thank you, Sam.
For everything.
Please, Jesus, don't do this to me.
Shoot, darn it!
Son of a mother!
Fudge!
Evything all right?
Just a... a little car trouble, that's all.
Want me to take a look?
Don't tell anybody, but I don't know much about cars.
Sorry.
Thanks for trying.
I...
I guess I should call a tow.
Why don't you let me give you a ride home?
I'll get my buddy Hank at Auto Haven to take a look on my way back.
I can't be alone.
Course you can't.
How'bout I give you a ride home, stay with you until Sam gets off work?
I couldn't put you out.
Your brother's been real good to me.
Least I could do.
That's so kind of you, Rene.
I just wanna say...
I told Andy, I've known killers, and Jason ain't one.
- Thank you, Terry.
- Nobody ever listens to me.
But they should.
Ready?
I can't believe Jason gave you his truck.
He loves this truck.
I know, right?
I tried talking him out of it.
He wasn't hearing it, though.
Buckle up, now.
Thanks.
It's really true?
You can hear what I'm thinking right now?
What do I think about, think about, think about nothing, nothing, think about nothing...
Don't bother.
Thinking about nothing ain't possible.
Trust me, everyone's tried it around me.
Sooner or later you'll think about something.
What's kinda funny, is that...
Your thoughts don't have an accent.
That must be hard on you, livin' with that.
It is hard.
Sometimes.
You have no idea how sick and twisted some people are.
Lord, I can believe that, yes, ma'am.
It's one thing when they think horrible stuff about me,
I mean,
I'm kinda used to it.
But, when it's about my brother...
He's all I've got left.
I mean, I've lost everyone.
Thanks.
I've lost people too.
It don't ever get any easier.
But, you find ways to cope.
I thought I told you kids to take out the garbage.
What the hell are you watching?
Oh, my Lord.
Where'd you get this?
Coby?
Lisa, you answer me, right now.
It's Rene's.
We found it in the garage.
Go to your room.
It's hotter in here than hell on a Sunday.
I know, Gran used to leave the windows open all day, but I haven't felt safe doin' that in a while.
Have a seat, I'll fix us some iced teas.
Sounds good.
These fuckers' palates are as backwoods as their brains.
- Rene left his vest.
- I'll put it in the lost and found.
Hey, where's Sookie?
Did you see her?
- Where'd she go?
- She left with Rene about 20, 23 minutes ago.
- Rene, you take it sweet?
- Yes, ma'am.
You scared me.
Did I?
Sorry about that.
Don't think about it...
Blood, blood, so much blood...
She wasn't supposed to be here...
Shut up!
- Rene?
- Sookie ain't here?
You weren't supposed to be here.
You all right?
I'm... so jumpy these days.
Let me help you with that.
I'm gonna go get a mop.
What do you think you're doin'?
Stay away!
You're not gonna shoot me.
Told you.
She deserves it, needs it, wants to die.
That's why she fucks them fangers...
Fuck.
Goddamn it.
Get back here, you fucking bitch!
Dang it.
Nothing that'll cover up what you done.
You watching me now?
You freak.
You're the freak, Cindy.
You're the damn freak.
Fuckin' freak.
Fuck!
Spread your legs for a dead man.
Mama'd roll over in her grave...
Get the fuck out of here.
Sookie.
I'll teach you, you bitch!
What're you doing?
Get away from me!
Get out!
I can feel you in my head!
I thought you were Jason.
Die, fang fucker!
Stay the fuck out of my head!
Come on, Sookie.
Let's be...
Let's be friends.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
We can be friends.
Sookie.
Seriously, I was just kidding.
Can you fuckin' hear me, you filthy fucking cunt?
I'm gonna tear out your throat with my hands and fuck your dead face.
Shit.
Goddamn it.
I must have lost her.
Could be hiding in the woods.
I better go back and check.
Mind-reading, vampire-fucking, freak bitch!
You think you're so smart!
You smart now?
What the fuck are you?
You fuckin' freak fuck!
Fuckin' sick fuck.
Die, you fucking freak of nature!
Die...
Fucking bitch!
I... am... sorry.
No, Bill, please.
We gotta get him out of the light.
You look so pretty.
Like someone turned a light on under your skin.
Hospital gave her pain meds.
She's...
She's a little loopy.
Didn't you listen when I said I'd lose my shit if anything ever happened to you?
Don't lose your shit.
I'm fine.
Did Sam tell you that he saved my life?
He turned into a dog and bit Rene.
No shit.
I'm gonna need some of them drugs they gave you.
You guys, we should let her rest.
You need to let people see the real you.
'Cause you're kind and brave.
There's nothing there not to love.
Right back at you.
All right then.
Thanks.
DA's dropping the charges.
No.
No fucking way.
He confessed.
The marks on Amy Burley's neck match Rene's belt.
Or Drew Marshall.
Whatever the hell his name is.
He near about put Sookie in a body bag.
We got no reason to hold Stackhouse.
That's horseshit!
Get ahold of yourself.
I don't need you screwing things up even worse.
So, what?
We're just gonna let him go?
Not "we."
You brought him in.
You let him go.
Right now, Andy.
Is there some way I can get a magazine?
This shit's putting me to sleep.
- What're you doin'?
- Get out of here.
What?
You heard me.
Get the fuck out of here.
- Is this some kinda trick or something?
- No, you stupid shit.
It ain't a trick.
It's a fucking miracle!
Oh, sweet Jesus, please forgive me.
I had no idea, Sookie, I swear.
- Course you didn't.
- I brought him around my kids.
I slept in the bed with him every night.
And all that time, it was nothin' but lies.
I mean, his name, his accent.
God, you think you know someone.
How could I not know?
None of us did.
- Don't blame yourself, honey.
- I can't help it.
I told you to stay out of my thoughts.
Is that why you didn't listen in on Rene?
It's like he kept that part of himself... locked away in some... dark... corner of his mind.
Oh, God.
I am so sorry.
I want you to promise me something, okay?
Okay.
Someday, if I ever find another man.
I want you to look inside his head and tell me everything that's in there.
Arlene, it doesn't really work that way.
Just promise me, okay?
'Cause I have the worst taste in men.
Is Bill gonna be okay?
I don't think so.
Oh, honey.
Oh, sweet baby.
I'm gonna head on over to the bar.
Make sure Terry ain't P-T-S-Ding all over my clam chowder.
Thanks, Lafayette.
I appreciate you holding down the fort.
No worries, boyfriend. 'Cause I'm gonna hit your ass up for a raise, soon as they pull them stitches out your forehead.
Call me later, T.
Where have you been?
I left you like 5 messages.
I didn't get any messages.
What?
Look, we don't have to talk about this now.
Sookie almost died.
And she would've, if you hadn't been there.
I'm glad you were, okay?
I was...
I was worried about you.
I'm sure you were.
You worry about everybody.
But Sookie's right, you're an amazing guy.
You deserve to get everything you want.
And so do I.
What does that mean?
Take good care of her.
Wait, Tara...
Maryann, this is my friend Sam.
Sam, this is Maryann.
Sam, it's so nice to meet you.
You ready to go?
What the hell are you doing here?
Did you think I wasn't gonna find you?
You silly, silly dog.
I should've known.
'Cause there were things he liked to do... in bed that no normal man ever does.
I've never been happier to see you in my life.
That's nice, but, sweetie, I'm... black and blue all over and you're squeezing me.
Sorry.
Shit, look what that son of a bitch did to you.
I can't believe I gave him my truck.
If he was still alive right now, I'm... fuckin' kill him again.
Excuse me.
- Me and my mouth.
- She'll be all right.
Eventually.
You know, I was sitting in that jail, and I just kept thinkin' about all the stupid stuff I'd done.
That must've kept you busy.
And I know it seems like all I ever think about's myself.
And drinking and chasing women.
But that's only 'cause I thought that's all I was good at.
That's not true.
You were good at football.
Not good enough for a scholarship.
I ain't never been good enough for anything.
Or anybody.
Well, except maybe Amy.
But she's gone, so...
So I was in there, waitin' to die too, and I realized
my life wasn't worth nothing.
I'd never done nothing worth being proud of.
And all I could think to do was to end it.
- Jason...
- No, it's okay.
'Cause then, something happened.
I was saved.
I was given a second chance.
And now I know that all this...
this bad stuff that happened, it happened for a reason.
What's that?
I ain't sure yet.
But I do know that I'm meant to do something important with my life.
And soon as I find out what that is,
- I ain't gonna fuck it up.
- That's good.
- I guess.
- Yeah.
I love you, Sook.
And...
I'm gonna take good care of you from now on.
I promise.
How about you just take care of yourself and... stay out of trouble?
Come on, you don't have to worry about me no more.
I'm good.
Why is all fucking garbage on the side of the garbage can?
Nasty motherfuckers.
Got no...
Goddamn home training.
Oh, my God!
Daddy.
Oh, Daddy.
It is you.
I found you.
I found you.
They said you were dead.
But I knew you weren't.
Daddy.
Hold me close...
You're alive?
Technically, no.
But I am healed.
I fed.
Would you like to come in?
Without my blood it'll take weeks for you to heal.
I don't care.
After everything,
I... just need to feel human right now.
I failed you.
You were willing to sacrifice yourself to save me.
If I'd just been...
My life is too short for all that.
{\TWO WEEKS LATER}
Yesterday, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that limiting marriage betweenonlyhumanmen and women is unconstitutional, effectively legalizing vampire marriage in the state.
Courthouses will be staying open after dark to accommodate hundreds of couples from all over America.
Oh, my God, you know what this means?
- Now you and Bill can get married.
- Stop it, Arlene.
This isn't Vermont.
Besides, he hasn't even asked me yet.
And I don't know what I'd say if he did.
You should marry Bill.
Hell, I'll even throw you a party.
Won't even break the bank, is all you need is a couple kegs of Tru Blood, seein' as how they don't eat or drink.
Bet there's even a vampire band and vampire wedding decorations.
Put Arlene's party to shame.
You know you're about as subtle as a flying brick?
Maryann says if you want something, you don't wait for it to come to you.
- You demand it...
- Do me a favor, don't quote Maryann to me.
Excuse me for giving a damn.
You heard from your cousin, by any chance?
'Cause I'm about to give away his job.
But this one time Lafayette went to Marthaville for the night.
He ended up go-go dancing in Palm Beach for like 8 months.
Fantastic.
People disappear all the time, but they're never really gone.
The good parts of 'em always stay put.
I hope you're right about that,
Terry.
Your hair's like a sunset after a bomb went off.
Pretty.
And God said,
"Let there be light."
And there was light.
And even though we stand in darkness today, we shall not fear.
For God has given us the ultimate weapon.
The ultimate salvation!
The sun.
And he has placed in front of us a daunting but righteous task.
We will not falter.
We will not rest.
Until we have brought God's holy light down on each and every bloodsucking abomination!
- Amen.
- Praise Jesus!
Time to pack it up, Andy.
My family used to own this whole damn town.
The land this rat hole stands on included.
You don't own this rat hole no more,
- so I'm cuttin' you off.
- Join the club.
One minute you're a hero, the next you can't get a fuckin' drink.
I ain't never seen a bird fly so high it don't have to come down sometime.
- What's that for?
- It's your pity party.
Only one you're getting from me, so suck it up.
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me.
It's just easier for me not to hate you.
Hating takes a lot of energy.
And I'm saving mine up for all the good shit that's coming my way.
'Cause I am a good person, and I deserve good shit in my life.
Yeah, put it on a bumper sticker.
Thank you, Sookie.
Where's Vampire Bill at tonight?
Is he out celebrating?
Some sort of vampire party?
Actually, we're celebrating together later.
Just tell him congratulations from me.
I don't care what nobody says, if I met a nice vampire girl,
- I'd be proud to have her on my arm.
- I'd love to see your mama's face
- if you brought her home for dinner.
- Yeah, me too.
You know, yeah.
I mean, does Bill know anybody my age?
Seriously.
Hi, Daddy.
What is this?
There are favors and there are... favors.
She is extremely annoying.
You can't do this.
We had a deal.
Now the terms have changed.
She's yours.
Unless you wanna give me Sookie?
It's just a suggestion.
Though a few nights with this one may change your mind.
Good luck.
Who's good to eat around here?
He ain't listening to me.
Good luck.
We're closing.
Give me your keys.
I ain't giving you shit, Stackhouse.
I'm a failure.
A pathetic fuckin' loser.
And everybody knows it.
Just like she said they would.
She's real happy with herself.
It don't ever make me happy to see someone in pain.
I'm gonna call your sister to come pick you up.
Detective Bellefleur.
- Where's my car?
- Andy Bellefleur, the only thing you're driving tonight is us crazy.
Portia{\ said she's} is on her way to pick you up.
Give me your keys.
I don't have 'em.
Left 'em in the car.
Right here, underneath this light.
- Some son of a bitch stole my car.
- You sure this is where you parked it?
This whole town's gone to shit.
Nobody used to go murdering each other, stealing' cars.
That's what happens when you don't let a good cop do his job.
Ain't that it over there?
That ain't where I parked it.
What the hell?
That ain't mine, I swear.
You know that old leather jacket I wear sometime?
The brown one?
Well, make sure it goes to Hoyt.
I told him it was lucky.
It ain't.
But he don't know that.
Sookie'll get the house.
My bank account.
But I want you to have my truck.
Really?
You've been a good friend, Rene.
Thanks, man.
I'm giving it back though, soon as they let you go.
They ain't never letting me go, Rene.
There's something inside me that's just...
- It's wrong.
- Nah, come on now.
It ain't like you went and killed a bunch a... innocent women.
- What?
- They were fangbangers.
If you hadn't have done it, it was a matter of time.
Wait, are you calling my grandma a fangbanger?
Don't get your back all up, you...
I'm just sayin', you must've had your reasons, that's all.
There ain't no good reason for what I did.
- Suppose you're right.
- You can't go in there.
He's my brother.
He's only allowed one visitor at a time.
You can either let me by or throw me in there, but I'm gonna see my brother.
- I'm sorry, Sookie.
I'm so sorry.
- You've have nothing to be sorry for.
I wish I got here sooner, before you went and confessed to something.
I don't even remember doing any of it.
I just know I did.
Jason, you need to shut up, okay?
'Cause I'm real close to finding out who the real killer is.
Transcript:
YYeTs.net
Synchro:
Arrow, mpm
His name's Drew Marshall.
He had a sister named Cindy, and I think he killed her.
Strangled her just like Maudette and Dawn and Amy.
{\If she knows this }How come she hasn't gone to the cops and gotten Jason out.
'Cause I tried that, and so far the cops have done diddlysquat to protect me and my family.
I don't have any evidence yet.
I ignore what Drew Marshall looks like.
So you can't really be sure he's the killer.
I've seen what's inside his head.
They'll never believe that about him, but it's the truth.
There's all kinds of strangeness in this world.
I know you wanna help me, but that's only 'cause you can't accept the truth.
I'm a murderer.
And I'm going to hell.
Plain and simple.
You aren't hearing me.
I know who the killer is.
And all we gotta do is find him.
Listen to me, don't be stupid.
- What's your problem?
- Make her go away.
Am I your fucking butler?
Please, just get her out of here.
Now, you heard him.
Zoo's closed.
Did you get the fax from the Bunkie police department about Drew Marshall, the man who's probably the real killer?
Never heard of no fax from no Bunkie P.D., or Drew-whoever.
But I'll tell you one thing.
The real killer is right there, where he belongs.
You are one hell of a sorry excuse for a cop and a human being,
Andy, and it's just a matter of time before everyone knows it.
Hi, I'm Tara.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I thought you might be hungry.
Okay, this isn't food.
This is sculpture.
And this place...
You're not really just a social worker, are you?
I'm a lot of things.
- Just like you.
Coffee?
- Sure.
I mean, you're not just a drunk-driving bartender, are you?
You're also intelligent, resourceful.
Strong.
A survivor.
I don't feel like any of those things right now.
I didn't just wreck my car,
I totaled my whole life.
All of it.
Well, I suppose that's one way of looking at it.
Personally, I see your situation as an opportunity.
I just got a fake exorcism and a DUI.
I probably lost my job.
All of my friends.
And my mother disowned me.
I'm sorry, but I don't get how that's an opportunity.
Maybe life has just cleared out all the things that weren't working.
Now you've got room to rebuild.
Decide exactly what you want your life to look like.
And make that happen.
What do you want, Tara?
What do you want your life to be?
I don't know.
I guess I never really let myself want anything.
That breaks my heart.
Yeah, well, there are people a lot worse off than me.
I'm sure.
I should probably let you get back to helping them.
Instead of watching me cry all over your nice breakfast.
I appreciate everything you've done for me.
And I promise to pay back the bail as soon as I can.
Tara, sit down.
You haven't touched your food, your dress isn't dry, and I think we both know you've got nowhere to go.
Please.
I know it's hard for you to trust me, but I really do just wanna help.
Even if that means giving you a place to stay until you figure things out.
- Why would you do that?
- 'Cause it's what I do.
It's what I want my life to be:
helping people.
Not because I feel sorry for you, and not because I want anything back from you.
- Then why?
- Because you deserve a chance.
And I'm in a position to give you one.
You wanna end this thing, that's fine.
The least you could do is call me back and tell me where the fuck you are so I can stop worrying.
Thanks a lot, I'll talk to you later, bye.
- What are you doing here?
- I got the lunch shift.
With everything going on with Jason, I figured you'd take the day off.
I'm not staying home and hiding, having people think I'm ashamed.
Besides, I'm gonna need all the money I can get to hire a p.i.
Drew Marshall is somewhere in this town.
Who knows how many times he's sat in one of those booths, looked me in right in the eye and ordered a burger and fries.
- Yeah, but wouldn't you have heard him?
- Wouldn't you've smelled him?
I ain't a shortwave radio.
I spend most of my time trying not to listen.
- Sorry, I didn't mean...
- It's okay.
I better start my prep.
You can only have five minutes with him.
Five minutes.
Mr. Stackhouse?
My name is Orry Dawson.
I told 'em I don't need no lawyer.
I'm not a lawyer.
I'm here on behalf of the Fellowship of the Sun.
That anti-vampire church?
We are a religious organization dedicated to the preservation and salvation of the human race.
Good.
'Cause I thought you just hated vampires.
And I used to, but then I got to know one, and he was a pretty decent guy.
Until I got him killed.
See, that's where you're wrong.
What you did, it was a service to your race and to Jesus.
And you should be proud of that.
Last year there were over 800 reported vampire-related attacks in Louisiana alone.
And the law won't do nothing about it.
They are too busy respecting those fiends and their...
Their civil rights.
What about our rights?
Our rights to be safe in our own neighborhoods, our right to our own blood?
No, I don't know nothing about that.
Look, uh...
Officially, the church can't condone what you did.
You took the lives of four women.
Women who had tainted themselves and their race, but still, human women.
But we do recognize that even though your methods may have been flawed, your intentions were pure.
I got no idea what you're talkin' about.
That's smart.
Don't admit to anything.
The church has started up a fund for your defense.
In the meantime, here's something to help you pass the time.
You are a brave soldier, Jason Stackhouse.
God loves you.
You...
You will be saved.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I was looking for Maryann.
She'll be right back.
You must be Tara.
Come on in.
I'm Eggs.
Eggs?
It's actually Benedict.
- Benedict Talley, so...
- Eggs Benedict.
Ah, shit, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have laughed.
- My name's screwed up too.
- Tara's a pretty name.
Suits you.
Maryann did...
Didn't tell me she...
She had a...
A boyfriend.
I'm...
I'm just stayin' here till I get back on my feet.
Just like you.
So collecting stray black people, that some kind of hobby of hers?
She was right about you.
You are funny.
- What else she tell you about me?
- She said...
You crashed your car with a gallon of whiskey in your lap.
It was vodka.
Really cheap vodka.
I'm...
I'm not judging you.
Believe me, all right.
When Maryann found me I was...
Let's just say, I was a hell of a lot worse off than you.
She's a miracle worker.
You'll see.
Yeah, well, I won't be sticking around that long.
That's too bad.
My mama, when she thought something was too good to be true, she'd...
She'd say, "Satan in a Sunday hat".
That's exactly what this is.
You know, it took me a long time to stop looking over my shoulder too.
But there are good people in this world.
Sometimes... good shit happens.
He don't remember doin' it.
Like he had amnesia or something.
Holler if y'all need anything, okay?
Now, he's just sitting there, lookin' like a dog that lost his bone.
And then he says, "I did it.
"I killed those women.
- You were right all along."
- He didn't exactly say that.
You should've seen the look in his eye.
Ice cold.
Like he was talking about road kill.
Excuse me.
Well, thank God you got him, Detective Bellefleur.
Can I buy you a beer?
Show my appreciation?
That's all right, Rosie, I was just doin' my job.
Whole family full of freaks and killers.
Oughta be ashamed to show her face after what her brother did.
Sleazy little manslut, Jason Stackhouse, a goddamned murderer.
I'd pay good money to watch that boy fry.
He was so cute for a murderer, wonder why he never hit on me.
What's going on?
You're right, I shouldn't have come in today.
Why don't you go to my trailer, lie down?
I need to get out of here.
- It's not safe.
- I'm just gonna drive around.
I'll keep my doors locked.
I won't even get out of the car.
I need some time alone.
I gotta get these thoughts out of my head.
All right, all right, yeah.
I've got your tables.
Thank you, Sam.
For everything.
Please, Jesus, don't do this to me.
Shoot, darn it!
Son of a mother!
Fudge!
Evything all right?
Just a... a little car trouble, that's all.
Want me to take a look?
Don't tell anybody, but I don't know much about cars.
Sorry.
Thanks for trying.
I...
I guess I should call a tow.
Why don't you let me give you a ride home?
I'll get my buddy Hank at Auto Haven to take a look on my way back.
I can't be alone.
Course you can't.
How'bout I give you a ride home, stay with you until Sam gets off work?
I couldn't put you out.
Your brother's been real good to me.
Least I could do.
That's so kind of you, Rene.
I just wanna say...
I told Andy, I've known killers, and Jason ain't one.
- Thank you, Terry.
- Nobody ever listens to me.
But they should.
Ready?
I can't believe Jason gave you his truck.
He loves this truck.
I know, right?
I tried talking him out of it.
He wasn't hearing it, though.
Buckle up, now.
Thanks.
It's really true?
You can hear what I'm thinking right now?
What do I think about, think about, think about nothing, nothing, think about nothing...
Don't bother.
Thinking about nothing ain't possible.
Trust me, everyone's tried it around me.
Sooner or later you'll think about something.
What's kinda funny, is that...
Your thoughts don't have an accent.
That must be hard on you, livin' with that.
It is hard.
Sometimes.
You have no idea how sick and twisted some people are.
Lord, I can believe that, yes, ma'am.
It's one thing when they think horrible stuff about me,
I mean,
I'm kinda used to it.
But, when it's about my brother...
He's all I've got left.
I mean, I've lost everyone.
Thanks.
I've lost people too.
It don't ever get any easier.
But, you find ways to cope.
I thought I told you kids to take out the garbage.
What the hell are you watching?
Oh, my Lord.
Where'd you get this?
Coby?
Lisa, you answer me, right now.
It's Rene's.
We found it in the garage.
Go to your room.
It's hotter in here than hell on a Sunday.
I know, Gran used to leave the windows open all day, but I haven't felt safe doin' that in a while.
Have a seat, I'll fix us some iced teas.
Sounds good.
These fuckers' palates are as backwoods as their brains.
- Rene left his vest.
- I'll put it in the lost and found.
Hey, where's Sookie?
Did you see her?
- Where'd she go?
- She left with Rene about 20, 23 minutes ago.
- Rene, you take it sweet?
- Yes, ma'am.
You scared me.
Did I?
Sorry about that.
Don't think about it...
Blood, blood, so much blood...
She wasn't supposed to be here...
Shut up!
- Rene?
- Sookie ain't here?
You weren't supposed to be here.
You all right?
I'm... so jumpy these days.
Let me help you with that.
I'm gonna go get a mop.
What do you think you're doin'?
Stay away!
You're not gonna shoot me.
Told you.
She deserves it, needs it, wants to die.
That's why she fucks them fangers...
Fuck.
Goddamn it.
Get back here, you fucking bitch!
Dang it.
Nothing that'll cover up what you done.
You watching me now?
You freak.
You're the freak, Cindy.
You're the damn freak.
Fuckin' freak.
Fuck!
Spread your legs for a dead man.
Mama'd roll over in her grave...
Get the fuck out of here.
Sookie.
I'll teach you, you bitch!
What're you doing?
Get away from me!
Get out!
I can feel you in my head!
I thought you were Jason.
Die, fang fucker!
Stay the fuck out of my head!
Come on, Sookie.
Let's be...
Let's be friends.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
We can be friends.
Sookie.
Seriously, I was just kidding.
Can you fuckin' hear me, you filthy fucking cunt?
I'm gonna tear out your throat with my hands and fuck your dead face.
Shit.
Goddamn it.
I must have lost her.
Could be hiding in the woods.
I better go back and check.
Mind-reading, vampire-fucking, freak bitch!
You think you're so smart!
You smart now?
What the fuck are you?
You fuckin' freak fuck!
Fuckin' sick fuck.
Die, you fucking freak of nature!
Die...
Fucking bitch!
I... am... sorry.
No, Bill, please.
We gotta get him out of the light.
You look so pretty.
Like someone turned a light on under your skin.
Hospital gave her pain meds.
She's...
She's a little loopy.
Didn't you listen when I said I'd lose my shit if anything ever happened to you?
Don't lose your shit.
I'm fine.
Did Sam tell you that he saved my life?
He turned into a dog and bit Rene.
No shit.
I'm gonna need some of them drugs they gave you.
You guys, we should let her rest.
You need to let people see the real you.
'Cause you're kind and brave.
There's nothing there not to love.
Right back at you.
All right then.
Thanks.
DA's dropping the charges.
No.
No fucking way.
He confessed.
The marks on Amy Burley's neck match Rene's belt.
Or Drew Marshall.
Whatever the hell his name is.
He near about put Sookie in a body bag.
We got no reason to hold Stackhouse.
That's horseshit!
Get ahold of yourself.
I don't need you screwing things up even worse.
So, what?
We're just gonna let him go?
Not "we."
You brought him in.
You let him go.
Right now, Andy.
Is there some way I can get a magazine?
This shit's putting me to sleep.
- What're you doin'?
- Get out of here.
What?
You heard me.
Get the fuck out of here.
- Is this some kinda trick or something?
- No, you stupid shit.
It ain't a trick.
It's a fucking miracle!
Oh, sweet Jesus, please forgive me.
I had no idea, Sookie, I swear.
- Course you didn't.
- I brought him around my kids.
I slept in the bed with him every night.
And all that time, it was nothin' but lies.
I mean, his name, his accent.
God, you think you know someone.
How could I not know?
None of us did.
- Don't blame yourself, honey.
- I can't help it.
I told you to stay out of my thoughts.
Is that why you didn't listen in on Rene?
It's like he kept that part of himself... locked away in some... dark... corner of his mind.
Oh, God.
I am so sorry.
I want you to promise me something, okay?
Okay.
Someday, if I ever find another man.
I want you to look inside his head and tell me everything that's in there.
Arlene, it doesn't really work that way.
Just promise me, okay?
'Cause I have the worst taste in men.
Is Bill gonna be okay?
I don't think so.
Oh, honey.
Oh, sweet baby.
I'm gonna head on over to the bar.
Make sure Terry ain't P-T-S-Ding all over my clam chowder.
Thanks, Lafayette.
I appreciate you holding down the fort.
No worries, boyfriend. 'Cause I'm gonna hit your ass up for a raise, soon as they pull them stitches out your forehead.
Call me later, T.
Where have you been?
I left you like 5 messages.
I didn't get any messages.
What?
Look, we don't have to talk about this now.
Sookie almost died.
And she would've, if you hadn't been there.
I'm glad you were, okay?
I was...
I was worried about you.
I'm sure you were.
You worry about everybody.
But Sookie's right, you're an amazing guy.
You deserve to get everything you want.
And so do I.
What does that mean?
Take good care of her.
Wait, Tara...
Maryann, this is my friend Sam.
Sam, this is Maryann.
Sam, it's so nice to meet you.
You ready to go?
What the hell are you doing here?
Did you think I wasn't gonna find you?
You silly, silly dog.
I should've known.
'Cause there were things he liked to do... in bed that no normal man ever does.
I've never been happier to see you in my life.
That's nice, but, sweetie, I'm... black and blue all over and you're squeezing me.
Sorry.
Shit, look what that son of a bitch did to you.
I can't believe I gave him my truck.
If he was still alive right now, I'm... fuckin' kill him again.
Excuse me.
- Me and my mouth.
- She'll be all right.
Eventually.
You know, I was sitting in that jail, and I just kept thinkin' about all the stupid stuff I'd done.
That must've kept you busy.
And I know it seems like all I ever think about's myself.
And drinking and chasing women.
But that's only 'cause I thought that's all I was good at.
That's not true.
You were good at football.
Not good enough for a scholarship.
I ain't never been good enough for anything.
Or anybody.
Well, except maybe Amy.
But she's gone, so...
So I was in there, waitin' to die too, and I realized
my life wasn't worth nothing.
I'd never done nothing worth being proud of.
And all I could think to do was to end it.
- Jason...
- No, it's okay.
'Cause then, something happened.
I was saved.
I was given a second chance.
And now I know that all this...
this bad stuff that happened, it happened for a reason.
What's that?
I ain't sure yet.
But I do know that I'm meant to do something important with my life.
And soon as I find out what that is,
- I ain't gonna fuck it up.
- That's good.
- I guess.
- Yeah.
I love you, Sook.
And...
I'm gonna take good care of you from now on.
I promise.
How about you just take care of yourself and... stay out of trouble?
Come on, you don't have to worry about me no more.
I'm good.
Why is all fucking garbage on the side of the garbage can?
Nasty motherfuckers.
Got no...
Goddamn home training.
Oh, my God!
Daddy.
Oh, Daddy.
It is you.
I found you.
I found you.
They said you were dead.
But I knew you weren't.
Daddy.
Hold me close...
You're alive?
Technically, no.
But I am healed.
I fed.
Would you like to come in?
Without my blood it'll take weeks for you to heal.
I don't care.
After everything,
I... just need to feel human right now.
I failed you.
You were willing to sacrifice yourself to save me.
If I'd just been...
My life is too short for all that.
{\TWO WEEKS LATER}
Yesterday, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that limiting marriage betweenonlyhumanmen and women is unconstitutional, effectively legalizing vampire marriage in the state.
Courthouses will be staying open after dark to accommodate hundreds of couples from all over America.
Oh, my God, you know what this means?
- Now you and Bill can get married.
- Stop it, Arlene.
This isn't Vermont.
Besides, he hasn't even asked me yet.
And I don't know what I'd say if he did.
You should marry Bill.
Hell, I'll even throw you a party.
Won't even break the bank, is all you need is a couple kegs of Tru Blood, seein' as how they don't eat or drink.
Bet there's even a vampire band and vampire wedding decorations.
Put Arlene's party to shame.
You know you're about as subtle as a flying brick?
Maryann says if you want something, you don't wait for it to come to you.
- You demand it...
- Do me a favor, don't quote Maryann to me.
Excuse me for giving a damn.
You heard from your cousin, by any chance?
'Cause I'm about to give away his job.
But this one time Lafayette went to Marthaville for the night.
He ended up go-go dancing in Palm Beach for like 8 months.
Fantastic.
People disappear all the time, but they're never really gone.
The good parts of 'em always stay put.
I hope you're right about that,
Terry.
Your hair's like a sunset after a bomb went off.
Pretty.
And God said,
"Let there be light."
And there was light.
And even though we stand in darkness today, we shall not fear.
For God has given us the ultimate weapon.
The ultimate salvation!
The sun.
And he has placed in front of us a daunting but righteous task.
We will not falter.
We will not rest.
Until we have brought God's holy light down on each and every bloodsucking abomination!
- Amen.
- Praise Jesus!
Time to pack it up, Andy.
My family used to own this whole damn town.
The land this rat hole stands on included.
You don't own this rat hole no more,
- so I'm cuttin' you off.
- Join the club.
One minute you're a hero, the next you can't get a fuckin' drink.
I ain't never seen a bird fly so high it don't have to come down sometime.
- What's that for?
- It's your pity party.
Only one you're getting from me, so suck it up.
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me.
It's just easier for me not to hate you.
Hating takes a lot of energy.
And I'm saving mine up for all the good shit that's coming my way.
'Cause I am a good person, and I deserve good shit in my life.
Yeah, put it on a bumper sticker.
Thank you, Sookie.
Where's Vampire Bill at tonight?
Is he out celebrating?
Some sort of vampire party?
Actually, we're celebrating together later.
Just tell him congratulations from me.
I don't care what nobody says, if I met a nice vampire girl,
- I'd be proud to have her on my arm.
- I'd love to see your mama's face
- if you brought her home for dinner.
- Yeah, me too.
You know, yeah.
I mean, does Bill know anybody my age?
Seriously.
Hi, Daddy.
What is this?
There are favors and there are... favors.
She is extremely annoying.
You can't do this.
We had a deal.
Now the terms have changed.
She's yours.
Unless you wanna give me Sookie?
It's just a suggestion.
Though a few nights with this one may change your mind.
Good luck.
Who's good to eat around here?
He ain't listening to me.
Good luck.
We're closing.
Give me your keys.
I ain't giving you shit, Stackhouse.
I'm a failure.
A pathetic fuckin' loser.
And everybody knows it.
Just like she said they would.
She's real happy with herself.
It don't ever make me happy to see someone in pain.
I'm gonna call your sister to come pick you up.
Detective Bellefleur.
- Where's my car?
- Andy Bellefleur, the only thing you're driving tonight is us crazy.
Portia{\ said she's} is on her way to pick you up.
Give me your keys.
I don't have 'em.
Left 'em in the car.
Right here, underneath this light.
- Some son of a bitch stole my car.
- You sure this is where you parked it?
This whole town's gone to shit.
Nobody used to go murdering each other, stealing' cars.
That's what happens when you don't let a good cop do his job.
Ain't that it over there?
That ain't where I parked it.
What the hell?
That ain't mine, I swear.
You know that old leather jacket I wear sometimes?
The brown one?
Well, make sure it goes to Hoyt.
I told him it was lucky.
It ain't.
But he don't know that.
Sookie will get the house my bank account.
But I want you to have my truck.
- Really?
- You've been a good friend, Rene.
Hell, thanks, man.
I'm giving it back, though, soon as they let you go.
They ain't never letting me go, Rene.
There's something inside of me that's just...
- It's wrong.
- Oh, come on, now.
Ain't like you went and killed a bunch of innocent women.
- What?
- They were fangbangers.
If you hadn't done it, it was just a matter of time...
- You calling my grandma a fangbanger?
- No.
Now, don't get your back all up, you.
I'm just saying you must have had your reasons, that's all.
There ain't no good reason for what I did.
- Man, suppose you're right.
- I'm going in, whether you like it or not.
- He's my brother.
- He's only allowed one visitor at a time.
Either let me by or throw me in there with him, but I'm gonna see my brother.
Jason.
- I'm sorry, Sookie.
I'm so sorry.
- You have nothing to be sorry for.
I just wish I got here before you confessed to something you didn't do.
I don't even remember doing any of it.
- I just know I did.
- Jason, you need to shut up, okay?
Because I'm real close to finding out who the real killer is.
His name's Drew Marshall.
He had a sister named Cindy, and I think he killed her.
Strangled her just like Maudette and Dawn and Amy.
If she knows all this, then how come she hasn't gone to the cops?
I tried that.
So far the cops have done diddlysquat to protect me and my family.
Besides, I don't have evidence.
I don't even know what Drew Marshall looks like.
So you can't really be sure he's the killer.
I've seen what's inside his head.
I never believed that about her, but it's true.
There's all kinds of strangeness in this world.
Sookie, I know you wanna help me but that's only because you can't accept the truth.
I'm a murderer, and I'm going to hell plain and simple.
- You aren't hearing me.
I think I know who the killer is.
All we gotta do is find him.
Andy.
Listen to me.
Don't be stupid.
- Andy!
- What's your problem?
Make her go away.
- Am I your fucking butler?
- Jason.
Please, just get her out of here.
All right, you heard him.
Zoo's closed.
Did you get the fax from the Bunkie police about Drew Marshall the man who's probably the real killer?
Never heard of no fax from no Bunkie P.D. Or Drew whoever but I'll tell you one thing:
The real killer is right there where he belongs.
You are one hell of a sorry excuse for a cop and a human being, Andy Bellefleur.
And it's just a matter of time before everyone knows it.
Hi, I'm Tara.
- Oh, good morning.
- Good morning.
Thought you might be hungry.
Okay, this isn't food.
This is a sculpture.
And this place...
You're not really just a social worker, are you?
I'm a lot of things, just like you.
- Coffee?
- Sure.
I mean, you're not just a drunk-driving bartender, are you?
You're also intelligent, resourceful, strong.
A survivor.
I don't feel like any of those things right now.
I didn't just wreck my car, I totaled my whole life.
All of it.
Well, I suppose that's one way of looking at it.
Personally, I see your situation as an opportunity.
I just got a fake exorcism and a DUI.
I probably lost my job, all of my friends and my mother disowned me.
I'm sorry, but I don't get how that's an opportunity.
Maybe life has just cleared out all the things that weren't working for you.
Now you've got room to rebuild decide exactly what you want your life to look like and make that happen.
What do you want, Tara?
What do you want your life to be?
I don't know.
I guess I've never really let myself want anything.
Oh, that breaks my heart.
Yeah, well, there are people a lot worse off than me, I'm sure.
I should probably let you get back to helping them instead of watching me cry all over your nice breakfast.
I appreciate everything you've done for me.
And I promise to pay back the bail as soon as I can...
Tara, sit down.
You haven't touched your food, your dress isn't dry and I think we both know you've got nowhere to go.
Please.
I know it's hard for you to trust me, but I really do just wanna help.
Even if that means just giving you a place to stay until you figure things out.
- Why would you do that?
- Because it's what I do.
It's what I want my life to be, helping people.
Not because I feel sorry for you and not because I want anything back from you.
- Then why?
- Because you deserve a chance.
And I'm in a position to give you one.
Fine, you wanna end this?
That's fine.
The least you could do is call and tell me where you are so I can stop worrying about you.
Thanks a lot.
I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
- Sookie, what are you doing here?
- I've got the lunch shift.
Yeah, but with everything going on with Jason, I figured you'd take the day off.
I'm not staying home and hiding, having people think I'm ashamed of my brother.
Besides, I'm gonna need all the money I can get to hire a private investigator.
Drew Marshall is in this town.
Who knows how many times he's sat in one of these booths looks me right in the eye, and ordered a burger and fries?
Wouldn't you have heard him?
Wouldn't you have smelled him?
I ain't a shortwave radio.
I spend most of my time trying not to listen to people.
- Sorry, I didn't mean...
- It's okay.
I'd better start my prep.
You can only have five minutes with him.
Five minutes.
- Mr. Stackhouse?
- Yeah?
- My name is Orry Dawson.
- Oh, I told them I don't need no lawyer.
I'm not a lawyer.
I'm here on behalf of the Fellowship of the Sun.
What, that anti-vampire church?
We are a religious organization dedicated to the preservation and salvation of the human race.
Oh, good, because I thought you just hated vampires.
And I used to, but then I got to know one and he was a pretty decent guy.
Until I got him killed.
You see, that's where you're wrong.
What you did, it was a service to your race and to Jesus.
- And you should be proud of that.
- Yeah.
You know, last year there were over 800 reported vampire-related attacks in Louisiana alone, and the law won't do nothing about it.
They are too busy respecting those fiends and their civil rights.
Well, what about our rights?
Our rights to be safe in our own neighborhoods our right to our own blood.
I don't know nothing about that.
Look officially the Church can't condone what you did.
You took the lives of four women women who had tainted themselves and their race but still, human women.
Hey.
But we do recognize that even though your methods may have been flawed your intentions were pure.
- I got no idea what you're talking about.
- That's smart.
Don't admit to anything.
The Church has started up a fund for your defense.
In the meantime here's something to help you pass the time.
You are a brave soldier, Jason Stackhouse.
- Okay.
- God loves you.
You will be saved.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I was looking for Maryann.
She'll be right back.
You must be Tara.
Come on in.
- I'm Eggs.
- Eggs?
Yeah, well, it's actually Benedict.
Benedict Talley, so...
Eggs Benedict.
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have laughed.
My name's screwed up too.
Tara's a pretty name.
Suits you.
Maryann didn't tell me she had a boyfriend.
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm just staying here till I get back on my feet, just like you.
So collecting stray black people, that some kind of hobby of hers?
She was right about you, you are funny.
Oh, yeah?
What else she tell you about me?
Oh, she said you crashed your car with a gallon of whiskey in your lap.
Yeah.
It was vodka.
Really cheap vodka.
Hey, I'm not judging you, believe me.
When Maryann found me, I was...
Well, let's just say I was a hell of a lot worse off than you.
She's a miracle worker.
You'll see.
Yeah, well, I won't be sticking around that long.
That's too bad.
Well...
My mama when she thought something was too good to be true she'd say, "Satan in a Sunday hat."
That's exactly what this is.
You know, it took me a long time to stop looking over my shoulder too.
But there are good people in this world.
Sometimes good shit happens.
Treating him like he don't remember doing it like he had amnesia or something.
- Hey, Sookie.
- He knows.
- Hey.
- I ain't buying it.
Holler if y'all need anything, okay?
He's just sitting there, looking like a dog that lost his bone.
And then he says:
"I did it.
I killed those women.
You were right all along."
He didn't exactly say that.
Should've seen the look in his eye.
Ice-cold, like he was talking about roadkill.
Excuse me.
Well, thank God you got him, Detective Bellefleur.
Can I buy you a beer, show my appreciation?
That's alright, Rosie, I was just doing my job.
Whole family full of freaks and killers.
Ought to be ashamed to show her face after what her brother did.
Sleazy little man-slut Jason Stackhouse, a goddamn murderer.
I'd pay good money to watch that boy fry.
He was so cute for a murderer.
Wonder why he never hit on me.
Guess I'm lucky.
She knew about him all along.
Hey, what's going on?
You're right, I shouldn't have come in today.
- Go to my trailer and lie down.
- I need to get out of here.
Sookie, it's not safe.
I'm just gonna drive around.
I'll keep my doors locked.
- I won't even get out of the car.
- No, Sookie.
I need some time alone.
I'm...
I gotta get these thoughts out of my head.
All right.
All right, all right.
Yeah.
I got your tables.
Thank you, Sam.
For everything.
I don't wanna go to the can right now.
I'm gonna see where this goes.
Please, Jesus, don't do this to me.
Shoot!
Darn it!
Son of a mother...
Fudge!
Sookie.
Everything all right?
Just a little car trouble, that's all.
Want me to take a look?
Well, don't tell nobody, but I don't know much about cars.
- Sorry.
- Thanks for trying.
I guess I should call a tow.
Well, why don't you let me give you a ride home.
I'll get my buddy Hank down at Auto Haven to take a look on my way back.
I can't be alone.
Course you can't.
How about I give you a ride, stay with you till Sam gets off?
- I couldn't put you out like that.
- No, no, no.
Your brother's been real good to me.
- Least I could do.
- That's so kind of you, Rene.
Hey, Sookie, Rene.
I just wanna say, I told Andy, I've known killers, and Jason ain't one.
- Thank you, Terry.
- Nobody ever listens to me.
But they should.
Ready?
I can't believe Jason gave you his truck.
He loves this truck.
I know, right?
I tried talking him out of it.
He wasn't hearing it, though.
Buckle up, now.
Thanks.
Is it really true?
You can hear what I'm thinking right now?
What do I think about?
Think about nothing, nothing, nothing.
Think about nothing.
Don't bother.
Thinking about nothing ain't possible.
Trust me, everyone's tried it around me.
Sooner or later, you'll think about something.
You know, what's kind of funny is that your thoughts don't have an accent.
That must be hard on you, living with that.
It is hard, sometimes.
You have no idea how sick and twisted some people are.
Oh, Lord, I can believe that.
Yes, ma'am.
It's one thing when they think horrible stuff about me.
I mean, I'm kind of used to it.
But, well, when it's about my brother...
He's all I've got left.
I mean, I've lost everyone.
Thanks.
You know, I've lost people too.
It don't ever get any easier but you find ways to cope.
Coby, Lisa.
I thought I told you kids to take out the garbage.
What the hell are you watching?
Oh, my Lord.
Where'd you get this?
Coby.
Lisa, you answer me right now.
It's Rene's.
We found it in the garage.
Go to your room.
It's hotter in here than hell on a Sunday.
Yeah, Gran used to leave the windows open all day but I haven't felt safe doing that in a while.
- Have a seat.
I'll fix us some iced teas.
- Sounds good.
These fuckers' palates are as backwoods as their brains.
- Sam, Rene left his vest.
- Put it in lost and found.
Hey, where's Sookie?
Did you see her?
- Yep.
- Where'd she go?
She left with Rene about 20, 23 minutes ago.
- Rene, you take it sweet?
- Yes, ma'am.
You scared me.
Did I?
Sorry about that.
Don't think about it.
Blood, blood, blood.
So much.
She wasn't supposed to be here.
Shut up/
- Rene?
- How come Sookie ain't here?
You weren't supposed to be here.
Sookie.
You all right?
I'm so jumpy these days.
- Let me help you with that.
- No.
I'm gonna go get a mop.
What do you think you're doing?
Stay away.
You're not gonna shoot me.
Told you.
She deserves it, needs it, wants to die.
That's why she fucks them fangers.
Fuck.
Goddamn it!
Get back here, you fucking bitch!
- Dang it.
- Ain't nothing that'll cover what you done.
You watching me now?
You freak.
Sookie!
But you're the freak, Cindy.
You're the damn freak.
Fucking freak.
Fuck!
Spread your legs for a dead man?
Mama would roll in her grave.
Get the fuck out of here.
Sookie!
Sookie, I'm gonna get you, you bitch!
No, no.
What are you doing?
Get away from me!
No!
Get out!
Fuck!
I can feel you in my head.
I thought you were Jason.
Die, fang-fucker!
Stay the fuck out of my head!
Fuck!
Sookie!
Sookie!
Sookie.
Come on, Sookie, let's be...
Let's be friends.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
Sookie, I was just playing.
Sookie?
Seriously, I was just kidding.
You fucking hear me, you filthy fucking cunt?
I'm gonna tear out your goddamn throat with my hands and fuck your dead face.
Shit.
Goddamn it, I must have lost her.
Could be hiding in the woods.
I'd better go back and check.
Shit.
Mind-reading, vampire-fucking freak bitch!
You think you're so smart?
You smart now?
Fucking with me.
Fuck.
What the fuck are you?
What the fuck?
Sookie.
Fuck you, you fucking freak fuck!
Fucking sick fuck.
Die, you fucking freak of nature!
Die!
Fucking bitch.
Sookie.
I am sorry.
No.
- No, Bill, please.
- We gotta get him out of the light.
Sookie?
Tara.
You look so pretty.
Like someone turned a light on under your skin.
Hospital gave her pain meds.
She's a little loopy.
Didn't you listen when I said I'd lose my shit if anything ever happened to you?
Don't lose your shit.
I'm fine.
Did Sam tell you that he saved my life?
He turned into a dog and bit Rene.
Oh, shit.
I'm gonna need some of them drugs they gave you.
Hey, you guys, we should let her rest.
Sam you need to let people see the real you because you're kind and brave.
There's nothing there not to love.
Right back at you.
All right, then.
Thanks.
- DA's dropping the charges.
- No.
No fucking way.
He confessed.
The marks on Amy Burley's neck match Rene's belt.
Or Drew Marshall.
Whatever the hell his name is, he near about put Sookie in a body bag.
We got no reason to hold Stackhouse.
That's horseshit!
Get ahold of yourself, Andy.
I don't need you screwing things up worse.
- So, what, we're just gonna let him go?
- Not "we."
You brought him in.
You let him go.
Right now, Andy.
Oh, hey, Andy.
Is there some way I can get a magazine?
This shit's putting me to sleep.
- What are you doing?
- Get out of here.
- What?
- You heard me, get the fuck out of here.
- Is this some kind of trick or something?
- No, you stupid shit.
It ain't a trick.
It's a fucking miracle.
Oh, sweet Jesus, please forgive me.
I had no idea, Sookie, I swear.
- Course you didn't.
- I brought him around my kids.
I slept in the bed with him every night, and all that time it was nothing but lies.
I mean, his name, his accent...
God, you think you know someone.
- How could I not know?
- None of us did.
Don't blame yourself, honey.
I can't help it.
I told you to stay out of my thoughts.
Isn't that why you didn't listen in on Rene?
It's like he kept that part of himself locked away in some dark corner of his mind.
Oh, God.
Sookie.
I'm so sorry.
I want you to promise me something, okay?
Okay.
Someday, if I ever find another man I want you to look inside his head and tell me everything that's in there.
Arlene, it doesn't really work that way.
Just promise me, okay?
Because I have the worst taste in men.
Is Bill gonna be okay?
I don't think so.
No.
Oh, honey.
Oh, sweet baby.
Well, I'm gonna head on over to the bar.
Make sure Terry ain't PTSD'ing all over my clam chowder.
Hey, thanks, Lafayette.
Appreciate you holding down the fort.
Oh, no worries, boyfriend.
I'm gonna hit your ass up for a raise as soon as they pull them stitches out your forehead.
Call me later, T.
Where have you been?
I left you like five messages.
I didn't get any messages.
What?
Look, we don't have to talk about this now.
Sookie almost died.
And she would have if you hadn't have been there so I'm glad you were, okay?
Yeah.
I was worried about you.
I'm sure you were.
You worry about everybody.
Because Sookie's right, you're an amazing guy.
You deserve to get everything you want.
And so do I.
What does that mean?
- Take good care of her.
- Wait, Tara...
Maryann, this is my friend Sam.
Sam, this is Maryann.
Sam, it's so nice to meet you.
You ready to go?
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Did you think I wasn't gonna find you?
You silly, silly dog.
I should've known.
Because there were things he liked to do in bed that no normal man ever does.
Jason.
I've never been happier to see you in my life.
That's nice, but, sweetie, I'm black and blue all over and you're squeezing me.
Oh, sorry.
Shit.
Look what that son of a bitch did to you.
I can't believe I gave him my truck.
If he was still alive right now, I'd fucking kill him again.
Excuse me.
- Me and my mouth.
- She'll be all right.
Eventually.
You know, I was sitting in that jail and I just kept thinking about all the stupid stuff I'd done.
That must have kept you busy.
And I know it seems like all I ever think about is myself and drinking and chasing women.
But that's only because I thought that's all I was good at.
That's not true.
You were good at football.
Not good enough for a scholarship.
I ain't never been good enough for anything or anybody.
Well, except maybe Amy.
But she's gone, so...
So I was in there, waiting to die too and I realized my life wasn't worth nothing.
I've never done nothing worth being proud of.
- All I could think to do was to end it.
- Jason...
No, it's okay, because then something happened.
Sook I was saved.
I was given a second chance.
And now I know that all this bad stuff that happened it happened for a reason.
What's that?
I ain't sure yet, but I do know I'm meant to do something important with my life.
And as soon as I find out what that is, I ain't gonna fuck it up.
- That's good, I guess.
- Yeah.
I love you, Sook.
And I'm gonna take good care of you from now on, I promise.
How about you just take care of yourself and stay out of trouble.
No, you don't have to worry about me no more.
I'm good.
Why is all the fucking garbage on the side of the garbage can?
Nasty motherfuckers.
Got no goddamned home-training.
You motherfucking...
Shit.
Oh, my God.
Daddy.
Oh, Daddy, I missed you.
I found you, I found you.
They said you were dead, but I knew you weren't.
Oh, Daddy.
Hold me close.
You won't ever go away again, will you?
- You're alive.
- Well, technically, no.
But I am healed.
I fed.
Would you like to come in?
Yes.
No.
Without my blood, it'll take weeks for you to heal.
I don't care.
After everything, I just need to feel human right now.
I failed you.
You were willing to sacrifice yourself to save me.
But if I had just been...
My life is too short for all that.
Yesterday the Vermont supreme court ruled that limiting marriage between only human men and women is unconstitutional effectively legalizing vampire marriage in the state.
Courthouses still be staying open to accommodate hundreds of couples all over America.
Oh, my God, Sookie, you know what this means?
Now you and Bill can get married.
Stop it, Arlene.
This isn't Vermont.
Besides, he hasn't even asked me yet and I don't know what I'd say if he did.
I think you should marry Bill.
Hell, I'll even throw you a party.
It won't even break the bank.
All you need is a couple kegs of Tru Blood, seeing as how they don't eat or drink.
Bet there's even a vampire band and vampire wedding decorations.
Put Arlene's party to shame.
You know, you're about as subtle as a flying brick.
Maryann says if you want something you don't wait for it to come, you demand it.
Do me a favor, don't quote Maryann to me.
Well, excuse me for giving a damn.
You heard from your cousin, by any chance?
Because I'm about to give away his job.
But one time Lafayette went to Marthaville for the night.
He ended up go-go dancing in Palm Beach for like eight months.
Fantastic.
Okay.
People disappear all the time, but they're never really gone.
The good parts of them always stay put.
I hope you're right about that, Terry.
Your hair's like a sunset after a bomb went off.
Pretty.
And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
And even though we stand in darkness today, we shall not fear for God has given us the ultimate weapon the ultimate salvation:
The sun.
And he has placed in front of us a daunting but righteous task.
We will not falter.
We will not rest until we have brought God's holy light down on each and every bloodsucking abomination.
- Hallelujah, brother!
- Hallelujah!
- Amen.
- Praise Jesus!
Amen.
Time to pack it up, Andy.
My family used to own this whole damn town the land this rat hole stands on included.
You don't own this rat hole no more so I'm cutting you off.
- Join the club.
One minute you're a hero, next you can't get a fucking drink.
Well, I ain't never seen a bird fly so high it don't have to come down sometime.
- What's that for?
- It's your pity party.
Only one you're getting from me, so suck it up.
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me.
It's just easier for me not to hate you.
Hating takes a lot of energy.
I'm saving mine up for all the good shit that's coming my way.
Because I am a good person, and I deserve good shit in my life.
Yeah, yeah, put it on a bumper sticker.
Thank you, Sookie.
Hey, where's Vampire Bill at tonight?
Is he out celebrating at some sort of vampire party?
Actually, we're celebrating together later.
Well, just tell him congratulations from me.
I mean, I don't care what nobody says if I met a nice vampire girl, I'd be proud to have her on my arm.
I'd love to see your mama's face if you brought her for dinner.
Yeah, me too.
You know, yeah, I mean...
Well, does Bill know anybody my age?
Seriously.
Hi, Daddy.
What is this?
There are favors and there are favors.
She is extremely annoying.
- You can't do this.
We had a deal.
- Well, now the terms have changed.
She's yours.
Unless you wanna give me Sookie.
It's just a suggestion.
Though a few nights with this one may change your mind.
Good luck.
So who's good to eat around here?
He ain't listening to me.
Good luck.
We're closing.
Give me your keys.
I ain't giving you shit, Stackhouse.
I'm a failure, a pathetic fucking loser, and everybody knows it, just like she said.
Bet she's real happy with herself.
It don't ever make me happy to see someone in pain.
I'm gonna call your sister to come pick you up Detective Bellefleur.
Where's my car?
Andy, the only thing you're driving tonight is us crazy.
Portia said she's on her way to pick you up.
Give me your keys.
I don't have them.
Left them in the car.
Right here, underneath this light.
- Some son of a bitch stole my car.
- You sure this is where you parked it?
This whole town's gone to shit.
Nobody used to go murdering each other, stealing cars.
That's what happens when you don't let a good cop do his job.
Ain't that it over there?
That ain't where I parked.
What the hell?
That ain't mine, I swear.
You know that old leather jacket I wear sometime?
The brown one?
Well, make sure it goes to Hoyt.
I told him it was lucky.
It ain't.
But he don't know that.
Sookie'll get the house.
My bank account.
But I want you to have my truck.
Really?
You've been a good friend, Rene.
Thanks, man.
I'm giving it back though, soon as they let you go.
They ain't never letting me go, Rene.
There's something inside me that's just...
- It's wrong.
- Nah, come on now.
It ain't like you went and killed a bunch a... innocent women.
- What?
- They were fangbangers.
If you hadn't have done it, it was a matter of time.
Wait, are you calling my grandma a fangbanger?
Don't get your back all up, you...
I'm just sayin', you must've had your reasons, that's all.
There ain't no good reason for what I did.
- Suppose you're right.
- You can't go in there.
He's my brother.
He's only allowed one visitor at a time.
You can either let me by or throw me in there, but I'm gonna see my brother.
- I'm sorry, Sookie.
I'm so sorry.
- You've have nothing to be sorry for.
I wish I got here sooner, before you went and confessed to something.
I don't even remember doing any of it.
I just know I did.
Jason, you need to shut up, okay?
'Cause I'm real close to finding out who the real killer is.
Transcript:
YYeTs.net
Synchro:
Arrow, mpm
His name's Drew Marshall.
He had a sister named Cindy, and I think he killed her.
Strangled her just like Maudette and Dawn and Amy.
{\If she knows this }How come she hasn't gone to the cops and gotten Jason out.
'Cause I tried that, and so far the cops have done diddlysquat to protect me and my family.
I don't have any evidence yet.
I ignore what Drew Marshall looks like.
So you can't really be sure he's the killer.
I've seen what's inside his head.
They'll never believe that about him, but it's the truth.
There's all kinds of strangeness in this world.
I know you wanna help me, but that's only 'cause you can't accept the truth.
I'm a murderer.
And I'm going to hell.
Plain and simple.
You aren't hearing me.
I know who the killer is.
And all we gotta do is find him.
Listen to me, don't be stupid.
- What's your problem?
- Make her go away.
Am I your fucking butler?
Please, just get her out of here.
Now, you heard him.
Zoo's closed.
Did you get the fax from the Bunkie police department about Drew Marshall, the man who's probably the real killer?
Never heard of no fax from no Bunkie P.D., or Drew-whoever.
But I'll tell you one thing.
The real killer is right there, where he belongs.
You are one hell of a sorry excuse for a cop and a human being,
Andy, and it's just a matter of time before everyone knows it.
Hi, I'm Tara.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I thought you might be hungry.
Okay, this isn't food.
This is sculpture.
And this place...
You're not really just a social worker, are you?
I'm a lot of things.
- Just like you.
Coffee?
- Sure.
I mean, you're not just a drunk-driving bartender, are you?
You're also intelligent, resourceful.
Strong.
A survivor.
I don't feel like any of those things right now.
I didn't just wreck my car,
I totaled my whole life.
All of it.
Well, I suppose that's one way of looking at it.
Personally, I see your situation as an opportunity.
I just got a fake exorcism and a DUI.
I probably lost my job.
All of my friends.
And my mother disowned me.
I'm sorry, but I don't get how that's an opportunity.
Maybe life has just cleared out all the things that weren't working.
Now you've got room to rebuild.
Decide exactly what you want your life to look like.
And make that happen.
What do you want, Tara?
What do you want your life to be?
I don't know.
I guess I never really let myself want anything.
That breaks my heart.
Yeah, well, there are people a lot worse off than me.
I'm sure.
I should probably let you get back to helping them.
Instead of watching me cry all over your nice breakfast.
I appreciate everything you've done for me.
And I promise to pay back the bail as soon as I can.
Tara, sit down.
You haven't touched your food, your dress isn't dry, and I think we both know you've got nowhere to go.
Please.
I know it's hard for you to trust me, but I really do just wanna help.
Even if that means giving you a place to stay until you figure things out.
- Why would you do that?
- 'Cause it's what I do.
It's what I want my life to be: helping people.
Not because I feel sorry for you, and not because I want anything back from you.
- Then why?
- Because you deserve a chance.
And I'm in a position to give you one.
You wanna end this thing, that's fine.
The least you could do is call me back and tell me where the fuck you are so I can stop worrying.
Thanks a lot, I'll talk to you later, bye.
- What are you doing here?
- I got the lunch shift.
With everything going on with Jason, I figured you'd take the day off.
I'm not staying home and hiding, having people think I'm ashamed.
Besides, I'm gonna need all the money I can get to hire a p.i.
Drew Marshall is somewhere in this town.
Who knows how many times he's sat in one of those booths, looked me in right in the eye and ordered a burger and fries.
- Yeah, but wouldn't you have heard him?
- Wouldn't you've smelled him?
I ain't a shortwave radio.
I spend most of my time trying not to listen.
- Sorry, I didn't mean...
- It's okay.
I better start my prep.
You can only have five minutes with him.
Five minutes.
Mr. Stackhouse?
My name is Orry Dawson.
I told 'em I don't need no lawyer.
I'm not a lawyer.
I'm here on behalf of the Fellowship of the Sun.
That anti-vampire church?
We are a religious organization dedicated to the preservation and salvation of the human race.
Good.
'Cause I thought you just hated vampires.
And I used to, but then I got to know one, and he was a pretty decent guy.
Until I got him killed.
See, that's where you're wrong.
What you did, it was a service to your race and to Jesus.
And you should be proud of that.
Last year there were over 800 reported vampire-related attacks in Louisiana alone.
And the law won't do nothing about it.
They are too busy respecting those fiends and their...
Their civil rights.
What about our rights?
Our rights to be safe in our own neighborhoods, our right to our own blood?
No, I don't know nothing about that.
Look, uh...
Officially, the church can't condone what you did.
You took the lives of four women.
Women who had tainted themselves and their race, but still, human women.
But we do recognize that even though your methods may have been flawed, your intentions were pure.
I got no idea what you're talkin' about.
That's smart.
Don't admit to anything.
The church has started up a fund for your defense.
In the meantime, here's something to help you pass the time.
You are a brave soldier, Jason Stackhouse.
God loves you.
You...
You will be saved.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I was looking for Maryann.
She'll be right back.
You must be Tara.
Come on in.
I'm Eggs.
Eggs?
It's actually Benedict.
- Benedict Talley, so...
- Eggs Benedict.
Ah, shit, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have laughed.
- My name's screwed up too.
- Tara's a pretty name.
Suits you.
Maryann did...
Didn't tell me she...
She had a...
A boyfriend.
I'm...
I'm just stayin' here till I get back on my feet.
Just like you.
So collecting stray black people, that some kind of hobby of hers?
She was right about you.
You are funny.
- What else she tell you about me?
- She said...
You crashed your car with a gallon of whiskey in your lap.
It was vodka.
Really cheap vodka.
I'm...
I'm not judging you.
Believe me, all right.
When Maryann found me I was...
Let's just say, I was a hell of a lot worse off than you.
She's a miracle worker.
You'll see.
Yeah, well, I won't be sticking around that long.
That's too bad.
My mama, when she thought something was too good to be true, she'd...
She'd say, "Satan in a Sunday hat".
That's exactly what this is.
You know, it took me a long time to stop looking over my shoulder too.
But there are good people in this world.
Sometimes... good shit happens.
He don't remember doin' it.
Like he had amnesia or something.
Holler if y'all need anything, okay?
Now, he's just sitting there, lookin' like a dog that lost his bone.
And then he says, "I did it.
"I killed those women.
- You were right all along."
- He didn't exactly say that.
You should've seen the look in his eye.
Ice cold.
Like he was talking about road kill.
Excuse me.
Well, thank God you got him, Detective Bellefleur.
Can I buy you a beer?
Show my appreciation?
That's all right, Rosie, I was just doin' my job.
Whole family full of freaks and killers.
Oughta be ashamed to show her face after what her brother did.
Sleazy little manslut, Jason Stackhouse, a goddamned murderer.
I'd pay good money to watch that boy fry.
He was so cute for a murderer, wonder why he never hit on me.
What's going on?
You're right, I shouldn't have come in today.
Why don't you go to my trailer, lie down?
I need to get out of here.
- It's not safe.
- I'm just gonna drive around.
I'll keep my doors locked.
I won't even get out of the car.
I need some time alone.
I gotta get these thoughts out of my head.
All right, all right, yeah.
I've got your tables.
Thank you, Sam.
For everything.
Please, Jesus, don't do this to me.
Shoot, darn it!
Son of a mother!
Fudge!
Evything all right?
Just a... a little car trouble, that's all.
Want me to take a look?
Don't tell anybody, but I don't know much about cars.
Sorry.
Thanks for trying.
I...
I guess I should call a tow.
Why don't you let me give you a ride home?
I'll get my buddy Hank at Auto Haven to take a look on my way back.
I can't be alone.
Course you can't.
How'bout I give you a ride home, stay with you until Sam gets off work?
I couldn't put you out.
Your brother's been real good to me.
Least I could do.
That's so kind of you, Rene.
I just wanna say...
I told Andy, I've known killers, and Jason ain't one.
- Thank you, Terry.
- Nobody ever listens to me.
But they should.
Ready?
I can't believe Jason gave you his truck.
He loves this truck.
I know, right?
I tried talking him out of it.
He wasn't hearing it, though.
Buckle up, now.
Thanks.
It's really true?
You can hear what I'm thinking right now?
What do I think about, think about, think about nothing, nothing, think about nothing...
Don't bother.
Thinking about nothing ain't possible.
Trust me, everyone's tried it around me.
Sooner or later you'll think about something.
What's kinda funny, is that...
Your thoughts don't have an accent.
That must be hard on you, livin' with that.
It is hard.
Sometimes.
You have no idea how sick and twisted some people are.
Lord, I can believe that, yes, ma'am.
It's one thing when they think horrible stuff about me,
I mean,
I'm kinda used to it.
But, when it's about my brother...
He's all I've got left.
I mean, I've lost everyone.
Thanks.
I've lost people too.
It don't ever get any easier.
But, you find ways to cope.
I thought I told you kids to take out the garbage.
What the hell are you watching?
Oh, my Lord.
Where'd you get this?
Coby?
Lisa, you answer me, right now.
It's Rene's.
We found it in the garage.
Go to your room.
It's hotter in here than hell on a Sunday.
I know, Gran used to leave the windows open all day, but I haven't felt safe doin' that in a while.
Have a seat, I'll fix us some iced teas.
Sounds good.
These fuckers' palates are as backwoods as their brains.
- Rene left his vest.
- I'll put it in the lost and found.
Hey, where's Sookie?
Did you see her?
- Where'd she go?
- She left with Rene about 20, 23 minutes ago.
- Rene, you take it sweet?
- Yes, ma'am.
You scared me.
Did I?
Sorry about that.
Don't think about it...
Blood, blood, so much blood...
She wasn't supposed to be here...
Shut up!
- Rene?
- Sookie ain't here?
You weren't supposed to be here.
You all right?
I'm... so jumpy these days.
Let me help you with that.
I'm gonna go get a mop.
What do you think you're doin'?
Stay away!
You're not gonna shoot me.
Told you.
She deserves it, needs it, wants to die.
That's why she fucks them fangers...
Fuck.
Goddamn it.
Get back here, you fucking bitch!
Dang it.
Nothing that'll cover up what you done.
You watching me now?
You freak.
You're the freak, Cindy.
You're the damn freak.
Fuckin' freak.
Fuck!
Spread your legs for a dead man.
Mama'd roll over in her grave...
Get the fuck out of here.
Sookie.
I'll teach you, you bitch!
What're you doing?
Get away from me!
Get out!
I can feel you in my head!
I thought you were Jason.
Die, fang fucker!
Stay the fuck out of my head!
Come on, Sookie.
Let's be...
Let's be friends.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
We can be friends.
Sookie.
Seriously, I was just kidding.
Can you fuckin' hear me, you filthy fucking cunt?
I'm gonna tear out your throat with my hands and fuck your dead face.
Shit.
Goddamn it.
I must have lost her.
Could be hiding in the woods.
I better go back and check.
Mind-reading, vampire-fucking, freak bitch!
You think you're so smart!
You smart now?
What the fuck are you?
You fuckin' freak fuck!
Fuckin' sick fuck.
Die, you fucking freak of nature!
Die...
Fucking bitch!
I... am... sorry.
No, Bill, please.
We gotta get him out of the light.
You look so pretty.
Like someone turned a light on under your skin.
Hospital gave her pain meds.
She's...
She's a little loopy.
Didn't you listen when I said I'd lose my shit if anything ever happened to you?
Don't lose your shit.
I'm fine.
Did Sam tell you that he saved my life?
He turned into a dog and bit Rene.
No shit.
I'm gonna need some of them drugs they gave you.
You guys, we should let her rest.
You need to let people see the real you.
'Cause you're kind and brave.
There's nothing there not to love.
Right back at you.
All right then.
Thanks.
DA's dropping the charges.
No.
No fucking way.
He confessed.
The marks on Amy Burley's neck match Rene's belt.
Or Drew Marshall.
Whatever the hell his name is.
He near about put Sookie in a body bag.
We got no reason to hold Stackhouse.
That's horseshit!
Get ahold of yourself.
I don't need you screwing things up even worse.
So, what?
We're just gonna let him go?
Not "we."
You brought him in.
You let him go.
Right now, Andy.
Is there some way I can get a magazine?
This shit's putting me to sleep.
- What're you doin'?
- Get out of here.
What?
You heard me.
Get the fuck out of here.
- Is this some kinda trick or something?
- No, you stupid shit.
It ain't a trick.
It's a fucking miracle!
Oh, sweet Jesus, please forgive me.
I had no idea, Sookie, I swear.
- Course you didn't.
- I brought him around my kids.
I slept in the bed with him every night.
And all that time, it was nothin' but lies.
I mean, his name, his accent.
God, you think you know someone.
How could I not know?
None of us did.
- Don't blame yourself, honey.
- I can't help it.
I told you to stay out of my thoughts.
Is that why you didn't listen in on Rene?
It's like he kept that part of himself... locked away in some... dark... corner of his mind.
Oh, God.
I am so sorry.
I want you to promise me something, okay?
Okay.
Someday, if I ever find another man.
I want you to look inside his head and tell me everything that's in there.
Arlene, it doesn't really work that way.
Just promise me, okay?
'Cause I have the worst taste in men.
Is Bill gonna be okay?
I don't think so.
Oh, honey.
Oh, sweet baby.
I'm gonna head on over to the bar.
Make sure Terry ain't P-T-S-Ding all over my clam chowder.
Thanks, Lafayette.
I appreciate you holding down the fort.
No worries, boyfriend. 'Cause I'm gonna hit your ass up for a raise, soon as they pull them stitches out your forehead.
Call me later, T.
Where have you been?
I left you like 5 messages.
I didn't get any messages.
What?
Look, we don't have to talk about this now.
Sookie almost died.
And she would've, if you hadn't been there.
I'm glad you were, okay?
I was...
I was worried about you.
I'm sure you were.
You worry about everybody.
But Sookie's right, you're an amazing guy.
You deserve to get everything you want.
And so do I.
What does that mean?
Take good care of her.
Wait, Tara...
Maryann, this is my friend Sam.
Sam, this is Maryann.
Sam, it's so nice to meet you.
You ready to go?
What the hell are you doing here?
Did you think I wasn't gonna find you?
You silly, silly dog.
I should've known.
'Cause there were things he liked to do... in bed that no normal man ever does.
I've never been happier to see you in my life.
That's nice, but, sweetie, I'm... black and blue all over and you're squeezing me.
Sorry.
Shit, look what that son of a bitch did to you.
I can't believe I gave him my truck.
If he was still alive right now, I'm... fuckin' kill him again.
Excuse me.
- Me and my mouth.
- She'll be all right.
Eventually.
You know, I was sitting in that jail, and I just kept thinkin' about all the stupid stuff I'd done.
That must've kept you busy.
And I know it seems like all I ever think about's myself.
And drinking and chasing women.
But that's only 'cause I thought that's all I was good at.
That's not true.
You were good at football.
Not good enough for a scholarship.
I ain't never been good enough for anything.
Or anybody.
Well, except maybe Amy.
But she's gone, so...
So I was in there, waitin' to die too, and I realized
my life wasn't worth nothing.
I'd never done nothing worth being proud of.
And all I could think to do was to end it.
- Jason...
- No, it's okay.
'Cause then, something happened.
I was saved.
I was given a second chance.
And now I know that all this...
this bad stuff that happened, it happened for a reason.
What's that?
I ain't sure yet.
But I do know that I'm meant to do something important with my life.
And soon as I find out what that is,
- I ain't gonna fuck it up.
- That's good.
- I guess.
- Yeah.
I love you, Sook.
And...
I'm gonna take good care of you from now on.
I promise.
How about you just take care of yourself and... stay out of trouble?
Come on, you don't have to worry about me no more.
I'm good.
Why is all fucking garbage on the side of the garbage can?
Nasty motherfuckers.
Got no...
Goddamn home training.
Oh, my God!
Daddy.
Oh, Daddy.
It is you.
I found you.
I found you.
They said you were dead.
But I knew you weren't.
Daddy.
Hold me close...
You're alive?
Technically, no.
But I am healed.
I fed.
Would you like to come in?
Without my blood it'll take weeks for you to heal.
I don't care.
After everything,
I... just need to feel human right now.
I failed you.
You were willing to sacrifice yourself to save me.
If I'd just been...
My life is too short for all that.
{\TWO WEEKS LATER}
Yesterday, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that limiting marriage between only human men and women is unconstitutional, effectively legalizing vampire marriage in the state.
Courthouses will be staying open after dark to accommodate hundreds of couples from all over America.
Oh, my God, you know what this means?
- Now you and Bill can get married.
- Stop it, Arlene.
This isn't Vermont.
Besides, he hasn't even asked me yet.
And I don't know what I'd say if he did.
You should marry Bill.
Hell, I'll even throw you a party.
Won't even break the bank, is all you need is a couple kegs of Tru Blood, seein' as how they don't eat or drink.
Bet there's even a vampire band and vampire wedding decorations.
Put Arlene's party to shame.
You know you're about as subtle as a flying brick?
Maryann says if you want something, you don't wait for it to come to you.
- You demand it...
- Do me a favor, don't quote Maryann to me.
Excuse me for giving a damn.
You heard from your cousin, by any chance?
'Cause I'm about to give away his job.
But this one time Lafayette went to Marthaville for the night.
He ended up go-go dancing in Palm Beach for like 8 months.
Fantastic.
People disappear all the time, but they're never really gone.
The good parts of 'em always stay put.
I hope you're right about that,
Terry.
Your hair's like a sunset after a bomb went off.
Pretty.
And God said,
"Let there be light."
And there was light.
And even though we stand in darkness today, we shall not fear.
For God has given us the ultimate weapon.
The ultimate salvation!
The sun.
And he has placed in front of us a daunting but righteous task.
We will not falter.
We will not rest.
Until we have brought God's holy light down on each and every bloodsucking abomination!
- Amen.
- Praise Jesus!
Time to pack it up, Andy.
My family used to own this whole damn town.
The land this rat hole stands on included.
You don't own this rat hole no more,
- so I'm cuttin' you off.
- Join the club.
One minute you're a hero, the next you can't get a fuckin' drink.
I ain't never seen a bird fly so high it don't have to come down sometime.
- What's that for?
- It's your pity party.
Only one you're getting from me, so suck it up.
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me.
It's just easier for me not to hate you.
Hating takes a lot of energy.
And I'm saving mine up for all the good shit that's coming my way.
'Cause I am a good person, and I deserve good shit in my life.
Yeah, put it on a bumper sticker.
Thank you, Sookie.
Where's Vampire Bill at tonight?
Is he out celebrating?
Some sort of vampire party?
Actually, we're celebrating together later.
Just tell him congratulations from me.
I don't care what nobody says, if I met a nice vampire girl,
- I'd be proud to have her on my arm.
- I'd love to see your mama's face
- if you brought her home for dinner.
- Yeah, me too.
You know, yeah.
I mean, does Bill know anybody my age?
Seriously.
Hi, Daddy.
What is this?
There are favors and there are... favors.
She is extremely annoying.
You can't do this.
We had a deal.
Now the terms have changed.
She's yours.
Unless you wanna give me Sookie?
It's just a suggestion.
Though a few nights with this one may change your mind.
Good luck.
Who's good to eat around here?
He ain't listening to me.
Good luck.
We're closing.
Give me your keys.
I ain't giving you shit, Stackhouse.
I'm a failure.
A pathetic fuckin' loser.
And everybody knows it.
Just like she said they would.
She's real happy with herself.
It don't ever make me happy to see someone in pain.
I'm gonna call your sister to come pick you up.
Detective Bellefleur.
- Where's my car?
- Andy Bellefleur, the only thing you're driving tonight is us crazy.
Portia{\ said she's} is on her way to pick you up.
Give me your keys.
I don't have 'em.
Left 'em in the car.
Right here, underneath this light.
- Some son of a bitch stole my car.
- You sure this is where you parked it?
This whole town's gone to shit.
Nobody used to go murdering each other, stealing' cars.
That's what happens when you don't let a good cop do his job.
Ain't that it over there?
That ain't where I parked it.
What the hell?
That ain't mine, I swear.
You know that old leather jacket I wear sometime?
The brown one?
make sure it goes to Hoyt.
I told him it was lucky.
It ain't.
But he don't know that.
Sookie'll get the house.
My bank account.
But I want you to have my truck.
Really?
Rene.
man.
soon as they let you go.
Rene.
There's something inside me that's just... come on now.
It ain't like you went and killed a bunch a... innocent women.
- What?
- They were fangbangers.
it was a matter of time.
are you calling my grandma a fangbanger?
you... that's all.
There ain't no good reason for what I did.
- Suppose you're right.
- You can't go in there.
He's my brother.
He's only allowed one visitor at a time. but I'm gonna see my brother.
Sookie.
I'm so sorry.
- You've have nothing to be sorry for.
before you went and confessed to something.
I don't even remember doing any of it.
I just know I did.
okay?
'Cause I'm real close to finding out who the real killer is.
Transcript:
YYeTs.net mpm and I think he killed her.
Strangled her just like Maudette and Dawn and Amy.
{\If she knows this }How come she hasn't gone to the cops and gotten Jason out.
and so far the cops have done diddlysquat to protect me and my family.
I don't have any evidence yet.
I ignore what Drew Marshall looks like.
So you can't really be sure he's the killer.
I've seen what's inside his head.
but it's the truth.
There's all kinds of strangeness in this world. but that's only 'cause you can't accept the truth.
I'm a murderer.
And I'm going to hell.
Plain and simple.
You aren't hearing me.
I know who the killer is.
And all we gotta do is find him.
don't be stupid.
- What's your problem?
- Make her go away.
Am I your fucking butler?
just get her out of here.
you heard him.
Zoo's closed.
Did you get the fax from the Bunkie police department the man who's probably the real killer?
or Drew-whoever.
But I'll tell you one thing.
where he belongs. and it's just a matter of time before everyone knows it.
I'm Tara.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I thought you might be hungry.
this isn't food.
This is sculpture.
And this place... are you?
I'm a lot of things.
- Just like you.
Coffee?
- Sure.
are you?
resourceful.
Strong.
A survivor.
I don't feel like any of those things right now.
I totaled my whole life.
All of it.
I suppose that's one way of looking at it.
I see your situation as an opportunity.
I just got a fake exorcism and a DUI.
I probably lost my job.
All of my friends.
And my mother disowned me.
but I don't get how that's an opportunity.
Maybe life has just cleared out all the things that weren't working.
Now you've got room to rebuild.
Decide exactly what you want your life to look like.
And make that happen.
Tara?
What do you want your life to be?
I don't know.
I guess I never really let myself want anything.
That breaks my heart.
there are people a lot worse off than me.
I'm sure.
I should probably let you get back to helping them.
Instead of watching me cry all over your nice breakfast.
I appreciate everything you've done for me.
And I promise to pay back the bail as soon as I can.
sit down. and I think we both know you've got nowhere to go.
Please. but I really do just wanna help.
Even if that means giving you a place to stay until you figure things out.
- Why would you do that?
- 'Cause it's what I do.
It's what I want my life to be:
helping people. and not because I want anything back from you.
- Then why?
- Because you deserve a chance.
And I'm in a position to give you one.
that's fine.
The least you could do is call me back and tell me where the fuck you are so I can stop worrying.
bye.
- What are you doing here?
- I got the lunch shift.
I figured you'd take the day off.
having people think I'm ashamed.
I'm gonna need all the money I can get to hire a p.i.
Drew Marshall is somewhere in this town. looked me in right in the eye and ordered a burger and fries.
but wouldn't you have heard him?
- Wouldn't you've smelled him?
I ain't a shortwave radio.
I spend most of my time trying not to listen.
I didn't mean...
- It's okay.
I better start my prep.
You can only have five minutes with him.
Five minutes.
Mr. Stackhouse?
My name is Orry Dawson.
I told 'em I don't need no lawyer.
I'm not a lawyer.
I'm here on behalf of the Fellowship of the Sun.
That anti-vampire church?
We are a religious organization dedicated to the preservation and salvation of the human race.
Good.
'Cause I thought you just hated vampires. and he was a pretty decent guy.
Until I got him killed.
that's where you're wrong. it was a service to your race and to Jesus.
And you should be proud of that.
Last year there were over 800 reported vampire-related attacks in Louisiana alone.
And the law won't do nothing about it.
They are too busy respecting those fiends and their...
Their civil rights.
What about our rights? our right to our own blood?
I don't know nothing about that.
uh... the church can't condone what you did.
You took the lives of four women. human women.
But we do recognize your intentions were pure.
I got no idea what you're talkin' about.
That's smart.
Don't admit to anything.
The church has started up a fund for your defense. here's something to help you pass the time.
Jason Stackhouse.
God loves you.
You...
You will be saved.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I was looking for Maryann.
She'll be right back.
You must be Tara.
Come on in.
I'm Eggs.
Eggs?
It's actually Benedict.
so...
- Eggs Benedict.
I shouldn't have laughed.
- My name's screwed up too.
- Tara's a pretty name.
Suits you.
Maryann did...
Didn't tell me she...
She had a...
A boyfriend.
I'm...
I'm just stayin' here till I get back on my feet.
Just like you.
that some kind of hobby of hers?
She was right about you.
You are funny.
- What else she tell you about me?
- She said...
You crashed your car with a gallon of whiskey in your lap.
It was vodka.
Really cheap vodka.
I'm...
I'm not judging you.
all right.
When Maryann found me I was...
I was a hell of a lot worse off than you.
She's a miracle worker.
You'll see.
I won't be sticking around that long.
That's too bad. she'd...
Satan in a Sunday hat".
That's exactly what this is.
it took me a long time to stop looking over my shoulder too.
But there are good people in this world.
Sometimes... good shit happens.
He don't remember doin' it.
Like he had amnesia or something.
okay?
looking' like a dog that lost his bone.
I did it.
I killed those women.
- You were right all along."
- He didn't exactly say that.
You should've seen the look in his eye.
Ice cold.
Like he was talking about road kill.
Excuse me.
Detective Bellefleur.
Can I buy you a beer?
Show my appreciation?
I was just doin' my job.
Whole family full of freaks and killers.
Oughta be ashamed to show her face after what her brother did.
a goddamned murderer.
I'd pay good money to watch that boy fry.
wonder why he never hit on me.
What's going on?
I shouldn't have come in today.
lie down?
I need to get out of here.
- It's not safe.
- I'm just gonna drive around.
I'll keep my doors locked.
I won't even get out of the car.
I need some time alone.
I gotta get these thoughts out of my head.
yeah.
I've got your tables.
Sam.
For everything.
don't do this to me.
darn it!
Son of a mother!
Fudge!
Evything all right?
Just a... that's all.
Want me to take a look?
but I don't know much about cars.
Sorry.
Thanks for trying.
I...
I guess I should call a tow.
Why don't you let me give you a ride home?
I'll get my buddy Hank at Auto Haven to take a look on my way back.
I can't be alone.
Course you can't.
stay with you until Sam gets off work?
I couldn't put you out.
Your brother's been real good to me.
Least I could do.
Rene.
I just wanna say... and Jason ain't one.
Terry.
- Nobody ever listens to me.
But they should.
Ready?
I can't believe Jason gave you his truck.
He loves this truck.
right?
though.
now.
Thanks.
It's really true?
You can hear what I'm thinking right now?
think about nothing...
Don't bother.
Thinking about nothing ain't possible.
everyone's tried it around me.
Sooner or later you'll think about something.
is that...
Your thoughts don't have an accent.
living' with that.
It is hard.
Sometimes.
You have no idea how sick and twisted some people are.
ma'am. when it's about my brother...
He's all I've got left.
I've lost everyone.
Thanks.
I've lost people too. you find ways to cope.
I thought I told you kids to take out the garbage.
What the hell are you watching?
my Lord.
Where'd you get this?
Coby?
right now.
It's Rene's.
We found it in the garage.
Go to your room.
It's hotter in here than hell on a Sunday. but I haven't felt safe doin' that in a while.
I'll fix us some iced teas.
Sounds good.
These fuckers' palates are as backwoods as their brains.
- Rene left his vest.
- I'll put it in the lost and found.
where's Sookie?
Did you see her?
- Where'd she go?
- She left with Rene 23 minutes ago.
ma'am.
You scared me.
Did I?
Sorry about that.
so much blood...
She wasn't supposed to be here...
Shut up!
- Rene?
- Sookie ain't here?
You weren't supposed to be here.
You all right?
I'm... so jumpy these days.
Let me help you with that.
I'm gonna go get a mop.
What do you think you're doin'?
Stay away!
You're not gonna shoot me.
Told you.
wants to die.
That's why she fucks them fangers...
Fuck.
Goddamn it.
you fucking bitch!
Dang it.
Nothing that'll cover up what you done.
You watching me now?
You freak.
Cindy.
You're the damn freak.
Fuckin' freak.
Fuck!
Spread your legs for a dead man.
Mama'd roll over in her grave...
Get the fuck out of here.
you bitch!
What're you doing?
Get away from me!
Get out!
I can feel you in my head!
I thought you were Jason.
fang fucker!
Stay the fuck out of my head!
Sookie.
Let's be...
Let's be friends.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
We can be friends.
I was just kidding.
you filthy fucking cunt?
I'm gonna tear out your throat with my hands and fuck your dead face.
Shit.
Goddamn it.
I must have lost her.
Could be hiding in the woods.
I better go back and check.
freak bitch!
You think you're so smart!
You smart now?
What the fuck are you?
You fuckin' freak fuck!
Fuckin' sick fuck.
you fucking freak of nature!
Die...
Fucking bitch!
I... am... sorry.
please.
We gotta get him out of the light.
You look so pretty.
Like someone turned a light on under your skin.
Hospital gave her pain meds.
She's...
She's a little loopy.
Didn't you listen when I said I'd lose my shit if anything ever happened to you?
Don't lose your shit.
I'm fine.
Did Sam tell you that he saved my life?
He turned into a dog and bit Rene.
No shit.
I'm gonna need some of them drugs they gave you.
we should let her rest.
You need to let people see the real you.
'Cause you're kind and brave.
There's nothing there not to love.
Right back at you.
All right then.
Thanks.
DA's dropping the charges.
No.
No fucking way.
He confessed.
The marks on Amy Burley's neck match Rene's belt.
Or Drew Marshall.
Whatever the hell his name is.
He near about put Sookie in a body bag.
We got no reason to hold Stackhouse.
That's horseshit!
Get ahold of yourself.
I don't need you screwing things up even worse.
what?
We're just gonna let him go?
Not "we.
You brought him in.
You let him go.
Andy.
Is there some way I can get a magazine?
This shit's putting me to sleep.
- What're you doin'?
- Get out of here.
What?
You heard me.
Get the fuck out of here.
you stupid shit.
It ain't a trick.
It's a fucking miracle!
please forgive me.
I swear.
- Course you didn't.
- I brought him around my kids.
I slept in the bed with him every night.
it was nothin' but lies.
his accent.
you think you know someone.
How could I not know?
None of us did.
honey.
- I can't help it.
I told you to stay out of my thoughts.
Is that why you didn't listen in on Rene?
It's like he kept that part of himself... locked away in some... dark... corner of his mind.
God.
I am so sorry.
okay?
Okay.
if I ever find another man.
I want you to look inside his head and tell me everything that's in there.
it doesn't really work that way.
okay?
'Cause I have the worst taste in men.
Is Bill gonna be okay?
I don't think so.
honey.
sweet baby.
I'm gonna head on over to the bar.
Make sure Terry ain't P-T-S-Ding all over my clam chowder.
Lafayette.
I appreciate you holding down the fort. soon as they pull them stitches out your forehead.
T.
Where have you been?
I left you like 5 messages.
I didn't get any messages.
What?
we don't have to talk about this now.
Sookie almost died.
if you hadn't been there.
okay?
I was...
I was worried about you.
I'm sure you were.
You worry about everybody. you're an amazing guy.
You deserve to get everything you want.
And so do I.
What does that mean?
Take good care of her.
Tara... this is my friend Sam.
this is Maryann.
it's so nice to meet you.
You ready to go?
What the hell are you doing here?
Did you think I wasn't gonna find you?
silly dog.
I should've known.
'Cause there were things he liked to do... in bed that no normal man ever does.
I've never been happier to see you in my life.
I'm... black and blue all over and you're squeezing me.
Sorry. look what that son of a bitch did to you.
I can't believe I gave him my truck.
I'm... fuckin' kill him again.
Excuse me.
- Me and my mouth.
- She'll be all right.
Eventually. and I just kept thinkin' about all the stupid stuff I'd done.
That must've kept you busy.
And I know it seems like all I ever think about's myself.
And drinking and chasing women.
But that's only 'cause I thought that's all I was good at.
That's not true.
You were good at football.
Not good enough for a scholarship.
I ain't never been good enough for anything.
Or anybody.
except maybe Amy.
so... and I realized
my life wasn't worth nothing.
I'd never done nothing worth being proud of.
And all I could think to do was to end it.
it's okay. something happened.
I was saved.
I was given a second chance. it happened for a reason.
What's that?
I ain't sure yet.
But I do know that I'm meant to do something important
- I ain't gonna fuck it up.
- That's good.
- I guess.
- Yeah.
Sook.
And...
I'm gonna take good care of you from now on.
I promise.
How about you just take care of yourself and... stay out of trouble?
you don't have to worry about me no more.
I'm good.
Why is all fucking garbage on the side of the garbage can?
Nasty motherfuckers.
Got no...
Goddamn home training.
my God!
Daddy.
It is you.
I found you.
I found you.
They said you were dead.
But I knew you weren't.
Daddy.
Hold me close...
You're alive?
no.
But I am healed.
I fed.
Would you like to come in?
Without my blood it'll take weeks for you to heal.
I don't care.
I... just need to feel human right now.
I failed you.
You were willing to sacrifice yourself to save me.
If I'd just been...
My life is too short for all that.

Until we have brought God's holy light down on each and every bloodsucking abomination!
- Amen.
- Praise Jesus!
Andy.
My family used to own this whole damn town.
The land this rat hole stands on included. - so I'm cuttin' you off.
- Join the club.
the next you can't get a fuckin' drink.
I ain't never seen a bird fly so high it don't have to come down sometime.
- What's that for?
- It's your pity party.
so suck it up.
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me.
It's just easier for me not to hate you.
Hating takes a lot of energy.
And I'm saving mine up for all the good shit that's coming my way.
and I deserve good shit in my life.
put it on a bumper sticker.
Sookie.
Where's Vampire Bill at tonight?
Is he out celebrating?
Some sort of vampire party?
we're celebrating together later.
Just tell him congratulations from me.
- I'd be proud to have her on my arm.
- I'd love to see your mama's face me too.
does Bill know anybody my age?
Seriously.
Daddy.
What is this?
There are favors and there are... favors.
She is extremely annoying.
You can't do this.
We had a deal.
Now the terms have changed.
She's yours.
Unless you wanna give me Sookie?
It's just a suggestion.
Though a few nights with this one may change your mind.
Good luck.
Who's good to eat around here?
He ain't listening to me.
Good luck.
We're closing.
Give me your keys.
Stackhouse.
I'm a failure.
A pathetic fuckin' loser.
And everybody knows it.
Just like she said they would.
She's real happy with herself.
It don't ever make me happy to see someone in pain.
I'm gonna call your sister to come pick you up.
Detective Bellefleur.
the only thing you're driving tonight is us crazy.
Portia{\ said she's} is on her way to pick you up.
Give me your keys.
I don't have 'em.
Left 'em in the car.
underneath this light.
- Some son of a bitch stole my car.
- You sure this is where you parked it?
This whole town's gone to shit. stealing' cars.
That's what happens when you don't let a good cop do his job.
Ain't that it over there?
That ain't where I parked it.
What the hell?
I swear.
La team AB+ vous retrouve I'année prochaine
You know that old leather jacket I wear sometimes?
The brown one?
Well, make sure it goes to Hoyt.
I told him it was lucky.
It ain't.
But he don't know that.
Sookie will get the house my bank account.
But I want you to have my truck.
- Really?
- You've been a good friend, Rene.
Hell, thanks, man.
I'm giving it back, though, soon as they let you go.
They ain't never letting me go, Rene.
There's something inside of me thas just...
- ls wrong.
- Oh, come on, now.
Ain't like you went and killed a bunch of innocent women.
- What?
- They were fangbangers.
If you hadn't done it, it was just a matter of time...
- You calling my grandma a fangbanger?
- No.
Now, don't get your back all up, you.
I'm just saying you must have had your reasons, thas all.
There ain't no good reason for what I did.
- Man, suppose you're right.
- I'm going in, whether you like it or not.
- He's my brother.
- He's only allowed one visitor at a time.
Either let me by or throw me in there with him, but I'm gonna see my brother.
Jason.
- I'm sorry, Sookie.
I'm so sorry.
- You have nothing to be sorry for.
I just wish I got here before you confessed to something you didn't do.
I don't even remember doing any of it.
- I just know I did.
- Jason, you need to shut up, okay?
Because I'm real close to finding out who the real killer is.
His name's Drew Marshall.
He had a sister named Cindy, and I think he killed her.
Strangled her just like Maudette and Dawn and Amy.
If she knows all this, then how come she hasn't gone to the cops?
I tried that.
So far the cops have done diddlysquat to protect me and my family.
Besides, I don't have evidence.
I don't even know what Drew Marshall looks like.
So you can't really be sure he's the killer.
I've seen whas inside his head.
I never believed that about her, but is true.
There's all kinds of strangeness in this world.
Sookie, I know you wanna help me but thas only because you can't accept the truth.
I'm a murderer, and I'm going to hell plain and simple.
- You aren't hearing me.
I think I know who the killer is.
All we gotta do is find him.
Andy.
Listen to me.
Don't be stupid.
- Andy!
- Whas your problem?
Make her go away.
- Am I your fucking butler?
- Jason.
Please, just get her out of here.
All right, you heard him.
Zoo's closed.
Did you get the fax from the Bunkie police about Drew Marshall the man who's probably the real killer?
Never heard of no fax from no Bunkie P.D. Or Drew whoever but I'll tell you one thing:
The real killer is right there where he belongs.
You are one hell of a sorry excuse for a cop and a human being, Andy Bellefleur.
And is just a matter of time before everyone knows it.
Hi, I'm Tara.
- Oh, good morning.
- Good morning.
Thought you might be hungry.
Okay, this isn't food.
This is a sculpture.
And this place...
You're not really just a social worker, are you?
I'm a lot of things, just like you.
- Coffee?
- Sure.
I mean, you're not just a drunk-driving bartender, are you?
You're also intelligent, resourceful, strong.
A survivor.
I don't feel like any of those things right now.
I didn't just wreck my car, I totaled my whole life.
All of it.
Well, I suppose thas one way of looking at it.
Personally, I see your situation as an opportunity.
I just got a fake exorcism and a DUI.
I probably lost my job, all of my friends and my mother disowned me.
I'm sorry, but I don't get how thas an opportunity.
Maybe life has just cleared out all the things that weren't working for you.
Now you've got room to rebuild decide exactly what you want your life to look like and make that happen.
What do you want, Tara?
What do you want your life to be?
I don't know.
I guess I've never really let myself want anything.
Oh, that breaks my heart.
Yeah, well, there are people a lot worse off than me, I'm sure.
I should probably let you get back to helping them instead of watching me cry all over your nice breakfast.
I appreciate everything you've done for me.
And I promise to pay back the bail as soon as I can...
Tara, sit down.
You haven't touched your food, your dress isn't dry and I think we both know you've got nowhere to go.
Please.
I know is hard for you to trust me, but I really do just wanna help.
Even if that means just giving you a place to stay until you figure things out.
- Why would you do that?
- Because is what I do.
Ls what I want my life to be, helping people.
Not because I feel sorry for you and not because I want anything back from you.
- Then why?
- Because you deserve a chance.
And I'm in a position to give you one.
Fine, you wanna end this?
Thas fine.
The least you could do is call and tell me where you are so I can stop worrying about you.
Thanks a lot.
I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
- Sookie, what are you doing here?
- I've got the lunch shift.
Yeah, but with everything going on with Jason, I figured you'd take the day off.
I'm not staying home and hiding, having people think I'm ashamed of my brother.
Besides, I'm gonna need all the money I can get to hire a private investigator.
Drew Marshall is in this town.
Who knows how many times he's sat in one of these booths looks me right in the eye, and ordered a burger and fries?
Wouldn't you have heard him?
Wouldn't you have smelled him?
I ain't a shortwave radio.
I spend most of my time trying not to listen to people.
- Sorry, I didn't mean...
- ls okay.
I'd better start my prep.
You can only have five minutes with him.
Five minutes.
- Mr. Stackhouse?
- Yeah?
- My name is Orry Dawson.
- Oh, I told them I don't need no lawyer.
I'm not a lawyer.
I'm here on behalf of the Fellowship of the Sun.
What, that anti-vampire church?
We are a religious organization dedicated to the preservation and salvation of the human race.
Oh, good, because I thought you just hated vampires.
And I used to, but then I got to know one and he was a pretty decent guy.
Until I got him killed.
You see, thas where you're wrong.
What you did, it was a service to your race and to Jesus.
- And you should be proud of that.
- Yeah.
You know, last year there were over 800 reported vampire-related attacks in Louisiana alone, and the law won't do nothing about it.
They are too busy respecting those fiends and their civil rights.
Well, what about our rights?
Our rights to be safe in our own neighborhoods our right to our own blood.
I don't know nothing about that.
Look officially the Church can't condone what you did.
You took the lives of four women women who had tainted themselves and their race but still, human women.
Hey.
But we do recognize that even though your methods may have been flawed your intentions were pure.
- I got no idea what you're talking about.
- Thas smart.
Don't admit to anything.
The Church has started up a fund for your defense.
In the meantime here's something to help you pass the time.
You are a brave soldier, Jason Stackhouse.
- Okay.
- God loves you.
You will be saved.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I was looking for Maryann.
She'll be right back.
You must be Tara.
Come on in.
- I'm Eggs.
- Eggs?
Yeah, well, is actually Benedict.
Benedict Talley, so...
Eggs Benedict.
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have laughed.
My name's screwed up too.
Tara's a pretty name.
Suits you.
Maryann didn't tell me she had a boyfriend.
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm just staying here till I get back on my feet, just like you.
So collecting stray black people, that some kind of hobby of hers?
She was right about you, you are funny.
Oh, yeah?
What else she tell you about me?
Oh, she said you crashed your car with a gallon of whiskey in your lap.
Yeah.
It was vodka.
Really cheap vodka.
Hey, I'm not judging you, believe me.
When Maryann found me, I was...
Well, les just say I was a hell of a lot worse off than you.
She's a miracle worker.
You'll see.
Yeah, well, I won't be sticking around that long.
Thas too bad.
Well...
My mama when she thought something was too good to be true she'd say, "Satan in a Sunday hat."
Thas exactly what this is.
You know, it took me a long time to stop looking over my shoulder too.
But there are good people in this world.
Sometimes good shit happens.
Treating him like he don't remember doing it like he had amnesia or something.
- Hey, Sookie.
- He knows.
- Hey.
- I ain't buying it.
Holler if y'all need anything, okay?
He's just sitting there, looking like a dog that lost his bone.
And then he says:
"I did it.
I killed those women.
You were right all along."
He didn't exactly say that.
Shoulïve seen the look in his eye.
Ice-cold, like he was talking about roadkill.
Excuse me.
Well, thank God you got him, Detective Bellefleur.
Can I buy you a beer, show my appreciation?
Thas alright, Rosie, I was just doing my job.
Whole family full of freaks and killers.
Ought to be ashamed to show her face after what her brother did.
Sleazy little man-slut Jason Stackhouse, a goddamn murderer.
I'd pay good money to watch that boy fry.
He was so cute for a murderer.
Wonder why he never hit on me.
Guess I'm lucky.
She knew about him all along.
Hey, whas going on?
You're right, I shouldn't have come in today.
- Go to my trailer and lie down.
- I need to get out of here.
Sookie, is not safe.
I'm just gonna drive around.
I'll keep my doors locked.
- I won't even get out of the car.
- No, Sookie.
I need some time alone.
I'm...
I gotta get these thoughts out of my head.
All right.
All right, all right.
Yeah.
I got your tables.
Thank you, Sam.
For everything.
I don't wanna go to the can right now.
I'm gonna see where this goes.
Please, Jesus, don't do this to me.
Shoot!
Darn it!
Son of a mother...
Fudge!
Sookie.
Everything all right?
Just a little car trouble, thas all.
Want me to take a look?
Well, don't tell nobody, but I don't know much about cars.
- Sorry.
- Thanks for trying.
I guess I should call a tow.
Well, why don't you let me give you a ride home.
I'll get my buddy Hank down at Auto Haven to take a look on my way back.
I can't be alone.
Course you can't.
How about I give you a ride, stay with you till Sam gets off?
- I couldn't put you out like that.
- No, no, no.
Your brother's been real good to me.
- Least I could do.
- Thas so kind of you, Rene.
Hey, Sookie, Rene.
I just wanna say, I told Andy, I've known killers, and Jason ain't one.
- Thank you, Terry.
- Nobody ever listens to me.
But they should.
Ready?
I can't believe Jason gave you his truck.
He loves this truck.
I know, right?
I tried talking him out of it.
He wasn't hearing it, though.
Buckle up, now.
Thanks.
Is it really true?
You can hear what I'm thinking right now?
What do I think about?
Think about nothing, nothing, nothing.
Think about nothing.
Don't bother.
Thinking about nothing ain't possible.
Trust me, everyone's tried it around me.
Sooner or later, you'll think about something.
You know, whas kind of funny is that your thoughts don't have an accent.
That must be hard on you, living with that.
It is hard, sometimes.
You have no idea how sick and twisted some people are.
Oh, Lord, I can believe that.
Yes, ma'am.
Ls one thing when they think horrible stuff about me.
I mean, I'm kind of used to it.
But, well, when is about my brother...
He's all I've got left.
I mean, I've lost everyone.
Thanks.
You know, I've lost people too.
It don't ever get any easier but you find ways to cope.
Coby, Lisa.
I thought I told you kids to take out the garbage.
What the hell are you watching?
Oh, my Lord.
Where'd you get this?
Coby.
Lisa, you answer me right now.
Ls Rene's.
We found it in the garage.
Go to your room.
Ls hotter in here than hell on a Sunday.
Yeah, Gran used to leave the windows open all day but I haven't felt safe doing that in a while.
- Have a seat.
I'll fix us some iced teas.
- Sounds good.
These fuckers' palates are as backwoods as their brains.
- Sam, Rene left his vest.
- Put it in lost and found.
Hey, where's Sookie?
Did you see her?
- Yep.
- Where'd she go?
She left with Rene about 20, 23 minutes ago.
- Rene, you take it sweet?
- Yes, ma'am.
You scared me.
Did I?
Sorry about that.
Don't think about it.
Blood, blood, blood.
So much.
She wasn't supposed to be here.
Shut up!
- Rene?
- How come Sookie ain't here?
You weren't supposed to be here.
Sookie.
You all right?
I'm so jumpy these days.
- Let me help you with that.
- No.
I'm gonna go get a mop.
What do you think you're doing?
Stay away.
You're not gonna shoot me.
Told you.
She deserves it, needs it, wants to die.
Thas why she fucks them fangers.
Fuck.
Goddamn it!
Get back here, you fucking bitch!
- Dang it.
- Ain't nothing thall cover what you done.
You watching me now?
You freak.
Sookie!
But you're the freak, Cindy.
You're the damn freak.
Fucking freak.
Fuck!
Spread your legs for a dead man?
Mama would roll in her grave.
Get the fuck out of here.
Sookie!
Sookie, I'm gonna get you, you bitch!
No, no.
What are you doing?
Get away from me!
No!
Get out!
Fuck!
I can feel you in my head.
I thought you were Jason.
Die, fang-fucker!
Stay the fuck out of my head!
Fuck!
Sookie!
Sookie!
Sookie.
Come on, Sookie, les be...
Les be friends.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
Sookie, I was just playing.
Sookie?
Seriously, I was just kidding.
You fucking hear me, you filthy fucking cunt?
I'm gonna tear out your goddamn throat with my hands and fuck your dead face.
Shit.
Goddamn it, I must have lost her.
Could be hiding in the woods.
I'd better go back and check.
Shit.
Mind-reading, vampire-fucking freak bitch!
You think you're so smart?
You smart now?
Fucking with me.
Fuck.
What the fuck are you?
What the fuck?
Sookie.
Fuck you, you fucking freak fuck!
Fucking sick fuck.
Die, you fucking freak of nature!
Die!
Fucking bitch.
Sookie.
I am sorry.
No.
- No, Bill, please.
- We gotta get him out of the light.
Sookie?
Tara.
You look so pretty.
Like someone turned a light on under your skin.
Hospital gave her pain meds.
She's a little loopy.
Didn't you listen when I said I'd lose my shit if anything ever happened to you?
Don't lose your shit.
I'm fine.
Did Sam tell you that he saved my life?
He turned into a dog and bit Rene.
Oh, shit.
I'm gonna need some of them drugs they gave you.
Hey, you guys, we should let her rest.
Sam you need to let people see the real you because you're kind and brave.
There's nothing there not to love.
Right back at you.
All right, then.
Thanks.
- DA's dropping the charges.
- No.
No fucking way.
He confessed.
The marks on Amy Burley's neck match Rene's belt.
Or Drew Marshall.
Whatever the hell his name is, he near about put Sookie in a body bag.
We got no reason to hold Stackhouse.
Thas horseshit!
Get ahold of yourself, Andy.
I don't need you screwing things up worse.
- So, what, we're just gonna let him go?
- Not "we."
You brought him in.
You let him go.
Right now, Andy.
Oh, hey, Andy.
Is there some way I can get a magazine?
This shis putting me to sleep.
- What are you doing?
- Get out of here.
- What?
- You heard me, get the fuck out of here.
- Is this some kind of trick or something?
- No, you stupid shit.
It ain't a trick.
Ls a fucking miracle.
Oh, sweet Jesus, please forgive me.
I had no idea, Sookie, I swear.
- Course you didn't.
- I brought him around my kids.
I slept in the bed with him every night, and all that time it was nothing but lies.
I mean, his name, his accent...
God, you think you know someone.
- How could I not know?
- None of us did.
Don't blame yourself, honey.
I can't help it.
I told you to stay out of my thoughts.
Isn't that why you didn't listen in on Rene?
Ls like he kept that part of himself locked away in some dark corner of his mind.
Oh, God.
Sookie.
I'm so sorry.
I want you to promise me something, okay?
Okay.
Someday, if I ever find another man I want you to look inside his head and tell me everything thas in there.
Arlene, it doesn't really work that way.
Just promise me, okay?
Because I have the worst taste in men.
Is Bill gonna be okay?
I don't think so.
No.
Oh, honey.
Oh, sweet baby.
Well, I'm gonna head on over to the bar.
Make sure Terry ain't PTSD'ing all over my clam chowder.
Hey, thanks, Lafayette.
Appreciate you holding down the fort.
Oh, no worries, boyfriend.
I'm gonna hit your ass up for a raise as soon as they pull them stitches out your forehead.
Call me later, T.
Where have you been?
I left you like five messages.
I didn't get any messages.
What?
Look, we don't have to talk about this now.
Sookie almost died.
And she would have if you hadn't have been there so I'm glad you were, okay?
Yeah.
I was worried about you.
I'm sure you were.
You worry about everybody.
Because Sookie's right, you're an amazing guy.
You deserve to get everything you want.
And so do I.
What does that mean?
- Take good care of her.
- Wait, Tara...
Maryann, this is my friend Sam.
Sam, this is Maryann.
Sam, is so nice to meet you.
You ready to go?
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Did you think I wasn't gonna find you?
You silly, silly dog.
I shoulïve known.
Because there were things he liked to do in bed that no normal man ever does.
Jason.
I've never been happier to see you in my life.
Thas nice, but, sweetie, I'm black and blue all over and you're squeezing me.
Oh, sorry.
Shit.
Look what that son of a bitch did to you.
I can't believe I gave him my truck.
If he was still alive right now, I'd fucking kill him again.
Excuse me.
- Me and my mouth.
- She'll be all right.
Eventually.
You know, I was sitting in that jail and I just kept thinking about all the stupid stuff I'd done.
That must have kept you busy.
And I know it seems like all I ever think about is myself and drinking and chasing women.
But thas only because I thought thas all I was good at.
Thas not true.
You were good at football.
Not good enough for a scholarship.
I ain't never been good enough for anything or anybody.
Well, except maybe Amy.
But she's gone, so...
So I was in there, waiting to die too and I realized my life wasn't worth nothing.
I've never done nothing worth being proud of.
- All I could think to do was to end it.
- Jason...
No, is okay, because then something happened.
Sook I was saved.
I was given a second chance.
And now I know that all this bad stuff that happened it happened for a reason.
Whas that?
I ain't sure yet, but I do know I'm meant to do something important with my life.
And as soon as I find out what that is, I ain't gonna fuck it up.
- Thas good, I guess.
- Yeah.
I love you, Sook.
And I'm gonna take good care of you from now on, I promise.
How about you just take care of yourself and stay out of trouble.
No, you don't have to worry about me no more.
I'm good.
Why is all the fucking garbage on the side of the garbage can?
Nasty motherfuckers.
Got no goddamned home-training.
You motherfucking...
Shit.
Oh, my God.
Daddy.
Oh, Daddy, I missed you.
I found you, I found you.
They said you were dead, but I knew you weren't.
Oh, Daddy.
Hold me close.
You won't ever go away again, will you?
- You're alive.
- Well, technically, no.
But I am healed.
I fed.
Would you like to come in?
Yes.
No.
Without my blood, ill take weeks for you to heal.
I don't care.
After everything, I just need to feel human right now.
I failed you.
You were willing to sacrifice yourself to save me.
But if I had just been...
My life is too short for all that.
Yesterday the Vermont supreme court ruled that limiting marriage between only human men and women is unconstitutional effectively legalizing vampire marriage in the state.
Courthouses still be staying open to accommodate hundreds of couples all over America.
Oh, my God, Sookie, you know what this means?
Now you and Bill can get married.
Stop it, Arlene.
This isn't Vermont.
Besides, he hasn't even asked me yet and I don't know what I'd say if he did.
I think you should marry Bill.
Hell, I'll even throw you a party.
It won't even break the bank.
All you need is a couple kegs of Tru Blood, seeing as how they don't eat or drink.
Bet there's even a vampire band and vampire wedding decorations.
Put Arlene's party to shame.
You know, you're about as subtle as a flying brick.
Maryann says if you want something you don't wait for it to come, you demand it.
Do me a favor, don't quote Maryann to me.
Well, excuse me for giving a damn.
You heard from your cousin, by any chance?
Because I'm about to give away his job.
But one time Lafayette went to Marthaville for the night.
He ended up go-go dancing in Palm Beach for like eight months.
Fantastic.
Okay.
People disappear all the time, but they're never really gone.
The good parts of them always stay put.
I hope you're right about that, Terry.
Your hair's like a sunset after a bomb went off.
Pretty.
And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
And even though we stand in darkness today, we shall not fear for God has given us the ultimate weapon the ultimate salvation:
The sun.
And he has placed in front of us a daunting but righteous task.
We will not falter.
We will not rest until we have brought Goïs holy light down on each and every bloodsucking abomination.
- Hallelujah, brother!
- Hallelujah!
- Amen.
- Praise Jesus!
Amen.
Time to pack it up, Andy.
My family used to own this whole damn town the land this rat hole stands on included.
You don't own this rat hole no more so I'm cutting you off.
- Join the club.
One minute you're a hero, next you can't get a fucking drink.
Well, I ain't never seen a bird fly so high it don't have to come down sometime.
- Whas that for?
- Ls your pity party.
Only one you're getting from me, so suck it up.
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me.
Ls just easier for me not to hate you.
Hating takes a lot of energy.
I'm saving mine up for all the good shit thas coming my way.
Because I am a good person, and I deserve good shit in my life.
Yeah, yeah, put it on a bumper sticker.
Thank you, Sookie.
Hey, where's Vampire Bill at tonight?
Is he out celebrating at some sort of vampire party?
Actually, we're celebrating together later.
Well, just tell him congratulations from me.
I mean, I don't care what nobody says if I met a nice vampire girl, I'd be proud to have her on my arm.
I'd love to see your mama's face if you brought her for dinner.
Yeah, me too.
You know, yeah, I mean...
Well, does Bill know anybody my age?
Seriously.
Hi, Daddy.
What is this?
There are favors and there are favors.
She is extremely annoying.
- You can't do this.
We had a deal.
- Well, now the terms have changed.
She's yours.
Unless you wanna give me Sookie.
Ls just a suggestion.
Though a few nights with this one may change your mind.
Good luck.
So who's good to eat around here?
He ain't listening to me.
Good luck.
We're closing.
Give me your keys.
I ain't giving you shit, Stackhouse.
I'm a failure, a pathetic fucking loser, and everybody knows it, just like she said.
Bet she's real happy with herself.
It don't ever make me happy to see someone in pain.
I'm gonna call your sister to come pick you up Detective Bellefleur.
Where's my car?
Andy, the only thing you're driving tonight is us crazy.
Portia said she's on her way to pick you up.
Give me your keys.
I don't have them.
Left them in the car.
Right here, underneath this light.
- Some son of a bitch stole my car.
- You sure this is where you parked it?
This whole town's gone to shit.
Nobody used to go murdering each other, stealing cars.
Thas what happens when you don't let a good cop do his job.
Ain't that it over there?
That ain't where I parked.
What the hell?
That ain't mine, I swear.
You know that old leather jacket I wear sometime?
The brown one?
Well, make sure it goes to Hoyt.
I told him it was lucky.
It ain't.
But he don't know that.
Sookie'll get the house.
My bank account.
But I want you to have my truck.
Really?
You've been a good friend, Rene.
Thanks, man.
I'm giving it back though, soon as they let you go.
They ain't never letting me go, Rene.
There's something inside me that's just...
- It's wrong.
- Nah, come on now.
It ain't like you went and killed a bunch a... innocent women.
- What?
- They were fangbangers.
If you hadn't have done it, it was a matter of time.
Wait, are you calling my grandma a fangbanger?
Don't get your back all up, you...
I'm just sayin', you must've had your reasons, that's all.
There ain't no good reason for what I did.
- Suppose you're right.
- You can't go in there.
He's my brother.
He's only allowed one visitor at a time.
You can either let me by or throw me in there, but I'm gonna see my brother.
- I'm sorry, Sookie.
I'm so sorry.
- You've have nothing to be sorry for.
I wish I got here sooner, before you went and confessed to something.
I don't even remember doing any of it.
I just know I did.
Jason, you need to shut up, okay?
'Cause I'm real close to finding out who the real killer is.

Arrow, mpm
His name's Drew Marshall.
He had a sister named Cindy, and I think he killed her.
Strangled her just like Maudette and Dawn and Amy.
{\If she knows this }How come she hasn't gone to the cops and gotten Jason out.
'Cause I tried that, and so far the cops have done diddlysquat to protect me and my family.
I don't have any evidence yet.
I ignore what Drew Marshall looks like.
So you can't really be sure he's the killer.
I've seen what's inside his head.
They'll never believe that about him, but it's the truth.
There's all kinds of strangeness in this world.
I know you wanna help me, but that's only 'cause you can't accept the truth.
I'm a murderer.
And I'm going to hell.
Plain and simple.
You aren't hearing me.
I know who the killer is.
And all we gotta do is find him.
Listen to me, don't be stupid.
- What's your problem?
- Make her go away.
Am I your fucking butler?
Please, just get her out of here.
Now, you heard him.
Zoo's closed.
Did you get the fax from the Bunkie police department about Drew Marshall, the man who's probably the real killer?
Never heard of no fax from no Bunkie P.D., or Drew-whoever.
But I'll tell you one thing.
The real killer is right there, where he belongs.
You are one hell of a sorry excuse for a cop and a human being,
Andy, and it's just a matter of time before everyone knows it.
Hi, I'm Tara.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I thought you might be hungry.
Okay, this isn't food.
This is sculpture.
And this place...
You're not really just a social worker, are you?
I'm a lot of things.
- Just like you.
Coffee?
- Sure.
I mean, you're not just a drunk-driving bartender, are you?
You're also intelligent, resourceful.
Strong.
A survivor.
I don't feel like any of those things right now.
I didn't just wreck my car,
I totaled my whole life.
All of it.
Well, I suppose that's one way of looking at it.
Personally, I see your situation as an opportunity.
I just got a fake exorcism and a DUI.
I probably lost my job.
All of my friends.
And my mother disowned me.
I'm sorry, but I don't get how that's an opportunity.
Maybe life has just cleared out all the things that weren't working.
Now you've got room to rebuild.
Decide exactly what you want your life to look like.
And make that happen.
What do you want, Tara?
What do you want your life to be?
I don't know.
I guess I never really let myself want anything.
That breaks my heart.
Yeah, well, there are people a lot worse off than me.
I'm sure.
I should probably let you get back to helping them.
Instead of watching me cry all over your nice breakfast.
I appreciate everything you've done for me.
And I promise to pay back the bail as soon as I can.
Tara, sit down.
You haven't touched your food, your dress isn't dry, and I think we both know you've got nowhere to go.
Please.
I know it's hard for you to trust me, but I really do just wanna help.
Even if that means giving you a place to stay until you figure things out.
- Why would you do that?
- 'Cause it's what I do.
It's what I want my life to be:
helping people.
Not because I feel sorry for you, and not because I want anything back from you.
- Then why?
- Because you deserve a chance.
And I'm in a position to give you one.
You wanna end this thing, that's fine.
The least you could do is call me back and tell me where the fuck you are so I can stop worrying.
Thanks a lot, I'll talk to you later, bye.
- What are you doing here?
- I got the lunch shift.
With everything going on with Jason, I figured you'd take the day off.
I'm not staying home and hiding, having people think I'm ashamed.
Besides, I'm gonna need all the money I can get to hire a p.i.
Drew Marshall is somewhere in this town.
Who knows how many times he's sat in one of those booths, looked me in right in the eye and ordered a burger and fries.
- Yeah, but wouldn't you have heard him?
- Wouldn't you've smelled him?
I ain't a shortwave radio.
I spend most of my time trying not to listen.
- Sorry, I didn't mean...
- It's okay.
I better start my prep.
You can only have five minutes with him.
Five minutes.
Mr. Stackhouse?
My name is Orry Dawson.
I told 'em I don't need no lawyer.
I'm not a lawyer.
I'm here on behalf of the Fellowship of the Sun.
That anti-vampire church?
We are a religious organization dedicated to the preservation and salvation of the human race.
Good.
'Cause I thought you just hated vampires.
And I used to, but then I got to know one, and he was a pretty decent guy.
Until I got him killed.
See, that's where you're wrong.
What you did, it was a service to your race and to Jesus.
And you should be proud of that.
Last year there were over 800 reported vampire-related attacks in Louisiana alone.
And the law won't do nothing about it.
They are too busy respecting those fiends and their...
Their civil rights.
What about our rights?
Our rights to be safe in our own neighborhoods, our right to our own blood?
No, I don't know nothing about that.
Look, uh...
Officially, the church can't condone what you did.
You took the lives of four women.
Women who had tainted themselves and their race, but still, human women.
But we do recognize that even though your methods may have been flawed, your intentions were pure.
I got no idea what you're talkin' about.
That's smart.
Don't admit to anything.
The church has started up a fund for your defense.
In the meantime, here's something to help you pass the time.
You are a brave soldier, Jason Stackhouse.
God loves you.
You...
You will be saved.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I was looking for Maryann.
She'll be right back.
You must be Tara.
Come on in.
I'm Eggs.
Eggs?
It's actually Benedict.
- Benedict Talley, so...
- Eggs Benedict.
Ah, shit, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have laughed.
- My name's screwed up too.
- Tara's a pretty name.
Suits you.
Maryann did...
Didn't tell me she...
She had a...
A boyfriend.
I'm...
I'm just stayin' here till I get back on my feet.
Just like you.
So collecting stray black people, that some kind of hobby of hers?
She was right about you.
You are funny.
- What else she tell you about me?
- She said...
You crashed your car with a gallon of whiskey in your lap.
It was vodka.
Really cheap vodka.
I'm...
I'm not judging you.
Believe me, all right.
When Maryann found me I was...
Let's just say, I was a hell of a lot worse off than you.
She's a miracle worker.
You'll see.
Yeah, well, I won't be sticking around that long.
That's too bad.
My mama, when she thought something was too good to be true, she'd...
She'd say, "Satan in a Sunday hat".
That's exactly what this is.
You know, it took me a long time to stop looking over my shoulder too.
But there are good people in this world.
Sometimes... good shit happens.
He don't remember doin' it.
Like he had amnesia or something.
Holler if y'all need anything, okay?
Now, he's just sitting there, lookin' like a dog that lost his bone.
And then he says, "I did it.
"I killed those women.
- You were right all along."
- He didn't exactly say that.
You should've seen the look in his eye.
Ice cold.
Like he was talking about road kill.
Excuse me.
Well, thank God you got him, Detective Bellefleur.
Can I buy you a beer?
Show my appreciation?
That's all right, Rosie, I was just doin' my job.
Whole family full of freaks and killers.
Oughta be ashamed to show her face after what her brother did.
Sleazy little manslut, Jason Stackhouse, a goddamned murderer.
I'd pay good money to watch that boy fry.
He was so cute for a murderer, wonder why he never hit on me.
What's going on?
You're right, I shouldn't have come in today.
Why don't you go to my trailer, lie down?
I need to get out of here.
- It's not safe.
- I'm just gonna drive around.
I'll keep my doors locked.
I won't even get out of the car.
I need some time alone.
I gotta get these thoughts out of my head.
All right, all right, yeah.
I've got your tables.
Thank you, Sam.
For everything.
Please, Jesus, don't do this to me.
Shoot, darn it!
Son of a mother!
Fudge!
Evything all right?
Just a... a little car trouble, that's all.
Want me to take a look?
Don't tell anybody, but I don't know much about cars.
Sorry.
Thanks for trying.
I...
I guess I should call a tow.
Why don't you let me give you a ride home?
I'll get my buddy Hank at Auto Haven to take a look on my way back.
I can't be alone.
Course you can't.
How'bout I give you a ride home, stay with you until Sam gets off work?
I couldn't put you out.
Your brother's been real good to me.
Least I could do.
That's so kind of you, Rene.
I just wanna say...
I told Andy, I've known killers, and Jason ain't one.
- Thank you, Terry.
- Nobody ever listens to me.
But they should.
Ready?
I can't believe Jason gave you his truck.
He loves this truck.
I know, right?
I tried talking him out of it.
He wasn't hearing it, though.
Buckle up, now.
Thanks.
It's really true?
You can hear what I'm thinking right now?
What do I think about, think about, think about nothing, nothing, think about nothing...
Don't bother.
Thinking about nothing ain't possible.
Trust me, everyone's tried it around me.
Sooner or later you'll think about something.
What's kinda funny, is that...
Your thoughts don't have an accent.
That must be hard on you, livin' with that.
It is hard.
Sometimes.
You have no idea how sick and twisted some people are.
Lord, I can believe that, yes, ma'am.
It's one thing when they think horrible stuff about me,
I mean,
I'm kinda used to it.
But, when it's about my brother...
He's all I've got left.
I mean, I've lost everyone.
Thanks.
I've lost people too.
It don't ever get any easier.
But, you find ways to cope.
I thought I told you kids to take out the garbage.
What the hell are you watching?
Oh, my Lord.
Where'd you get this?
Coby?
Lisa, you answer me, right now.
It's Rene's.
We found it in the garage.
Go to your room.
It's hotter in here than hell on a Sunday.
I know, Gran used to leave the windows open all day, but I haven't felt safe doin' that in a while.
Have a seat, I'll fix us some iced teas.
Sounds good.
These fuckers' palates are as backwoods as their brains.
- Rene left his vest.
- I'll put it in the lost and found.
Hey, where's Sookie?
Did you see her?
- Where'd she go?
- She left with Rene about 20, 23 minutes ago.
- Rene, you take it sweet?
- Yes, ma'am.
You scared me.
Did I?
Sorry about that.
Don't think about it...
Blood, blood, so much blood...
She wasn't supposed to be here...
Shut up!
- Rene?
- Sookie ain't here?
You weren't supposed to be here.
You all right?
I'm... so jumpy these days.
Let me help you with that.
I'm gonna go get a mop.
What do you think you're doin'?
Stay away!
You're not gonna shoot me.
Told you.
She deserves it, needs it, wants to die.
That's why she fucks them fangers...
Fuck.
Goddamn it.
Get back here, you fucking bitch!
Dang it.
Nothing that'll cover up what you done.
You watching me now?
You freak.
You're the freak, Cindy.
You're the damn freak.
Fuckin' freak.
Fuck!
Spread your legs for a dead man.
Mama'd roll over in her grave...
Get the fuck out of here.
Sookie.
I'll teach you, you bitch!
What're you doing?
Get away from me!
Get out!
I can feel you in my head!
I thought you were Jason.
Die, fang fucker!
Stay the fuck out of my head!
Come on, Sookie.
Let's be...
Let's be friends.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
We can be friends.
Sookie.
Seriously, I was just kidding.
Can you fuckin' hear me, you filthy fucking cunt?
I'm gonna tear out your throat with my hands and fuck your dead face.
Shit.
Goddamn it.
I must have lost her.
Could be hiding in the woods.
I better go back and check.
Mind-reading, vampire-fucking, freak bitch!
You think you're so smart!
You smart now?
What the fuck are you?
You fuckin' freak fuck!
Fuckin' sick fuck.
Die, you fucking freak of nature!
Die...
Fucking bitch!
I... am... sorry.
No, Bill, please.
We gotta get him out of the light.
You look so pretty.
Like someone turned a light on under your skin.
Hospital gave her pain meds.
She's...
She's a little loopy.
Didn't you listen when I said I'd lose my shit if anything ever happened to you?
Don't lose your shit.
I'm fine.
Did Sam tell you that he saved my life?
He turned into a dog and bit Rene.
No shit.
I'm gonna need some of them drugs they gave you.
You guys, we should let her rest.
You need to let people see the real you.
'Cause you're kind and brave.
There's nothing there not to love.
Right back at you.
All right then.
Thanks.
DA's dropping the charges.
No.
No fucking way.
He confessed.
The marks on Amy Burley's neck match Rene's belt.
Or Drew Marshall.
Whatever the hell his name is.
He near about put Sookie in a body bag.
We got no reason to hold Stackhouse.
That's horseshit!
Get ahold of yourself.
I don't need you screwing things up even worse.
So, what?
We're just gonna let him go?
Not "we."
You brought him in.
You let him go.
Right now, Andy.
Is there some way I can get a magazine?
This shit's putting me to sleep.
- What're you doin'?
- Get out of here.
What?
You heard me.
Get the fuck out of here.
- Is this some kinda trick or something?
- No, you stupid shit.
It ain't a trick.
It's a fucking miracle!
Oh, sweet Jesus, please forgive me.
I had no idea, Sookie, I swear.
- Course you didn't.
- I brought him around my kids.
I slept in the bed with him every night.
And all that time, it was nothin' but lies.
I mean, his name, his accent.
God, you think you know someone.
How could I not know?
None of us did.
- Don't blame yourself, honey.
- I can't help it.
I told you to stay out of my thoughts.
Is that why you didn't listen in on Rene?
It's like he kept that part of himself... locked away in some... dark... corner of his mind.
Oh, God.
I am so sorry.
I want you to promise me something, okay?
Okay.
Someday, if I ever find another man.
I want you to look inside his head and tell me everything that's in there.
Arlene, it doesn't really work that way.
Just promise me, okay?
'Cause I have the worst taste in men.
Is Bill gonna be okay?
I don't think so.
Oh, honey.
Oh, sweet baby.
I'm gonna head on over to the bar.
Make sure Terry ain't P-T-S-Ding all over my clam chowder.
Thanks, Lafayette.
I appreciate you holding down the fort.
No worries, boyfriend. 'Cause I'm gonna hit your ass up for a raise, soon as they pull them stitches out your forehead.
Call me later, T.
Where have you been?
I left you like 5 messages.
I didn't get any messages.
What?
Look, we don't have to talk about this now.
Sookie almost died.
And she would've, if you hadn't been there.
I'm glad you were, okay?
I was...
I was worried about you.
I'm sure you were.
You worry about everybody.
But Sookie's right, you're an amazing guy.
You deserve to get everything you want.
And so do I.
What does that mean?
Take good care of her.
Wait, Tara...
Maryann, this is my friend Sam.
Sam, this is Maryann.
Sam, it's so nice to meet you.
You ready to go?
What the hell are you doing here?
Did you think I wasn't gonna find you?
You silly, silly dog.
I should've known.
'Cause there were things he liked to do... in bed that no normal man ever does.
I've never been happier to see you in my life.
That's nice, but, sweetie, I'm... black and blue all over and you're squeezing me.
Sorry.
Shit, look what that son of a bitch did to you.
I can't believe I gave him my truck.
If he was still alive right now, I'm... fuckin' kill him again.
Excuse me.
- Me and my mouth.
- She'll be all right.
Eventually.
You know, I was sitting in that jail, and I just kept thinkin' about all the stupid stuff I'd done.
That must've kept you busy.
And I know it seems like all I ever think about's myself.
And drinking and chasing women.
But that's only 'cause I thought that's all I was good at.
That's not true.
You were good at football.
Not good enough for a scholarship.
I ain't never been good enough for anything.
Or anybody.
Well, except maybe Amy.
But she's gone, so...
So I was in there, waitin' to die too, and I realized
my life wasn't worth nothing.
I'd never done nothing worth being proud of.
And all I could think to do was to end it.
- Jason...
- No, it's okay.
'Cause then, something happened.
I was saved.
I was given a second chance.
And now I know that all this...
this bad stuff that happened, it happened for a reason.
What's that?
I ain't sure yet.
But I do know that I'm meant to do something important with my life.
And soon as I find out what that is,
- I ain't gonna fuck it up.
- That's good.
- I guess.
- Yeah.
I love you, Sook.
And...
I'm gonna take good care of you from now on.
I promise.
How about you just take care of yourself and... stay out of trouble?
Come on, you don't have to worry about me no more.
I'm good.
Why is all fucking garbage on the side of the garbage can?
Nasty motherfuckers.
Got no...
Goddamn home training.
Oh, my God!
Daddy.
Oh, Daddy.
It is you.
I found you.
I found you.
They said you were dead.
But I knew you weren't.
Daddy.
Hold me close...
You're alive?
Technically, no.
But I am healed.
I fed.
Would you like to come in?
Without my blood it'll take weeks for you to heal.
I don't care.
After everything,
I... just need to feel human right now.
I failed you.
You were willing to sacrifice yourself to save me.
If I'd just been...
My life is too short for all that.
{\TWO WEEKS LATER}
Yesterday, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that limiting marriage betweenonlyhumanmen and women is unconstitutional, effectively legalizing vampire marriage in the state.
Courthouses will be staying open after dark to accommodate hundreds of couples from all over America.
Oh, my God, you know what this means?
- Now you and Bill can get married.
- Stop it, Arlene.
This isn't Vermont.
Besides, he hasn't even asked me yet.
And I don't know what I'd say if he did.
You should marry Bill.
Hell, I'll even throw you a party.
Won't even break the bank, is all you need is a couple kegs of Tru Blood, seein' as how they don't eat or drink.
Bet there's even a vampire band and vampire wedding decorations.
Put Arlene's party to shame.
You know you're about as subtle as a flying brick?
Maryann says if you want something, you don't wait for it to come to you.
- You demand it...
- Do me a favor, don't quote Maryann to me.
Excuse me for giving a damn.
You heard from your cousin, by any chance?
'Cause I'm about to give away his job.
But this one time Lafayette went to Marthaville for the night.
He ended up go-go dancing in Palm Beach for like 8 months.
Fantastic.
People disappear all the time, but they're never really gone.
The good parts of 'em always stay put.
I hope you're right about that,
Terry.
Your hair's like a sunset after a bomb went off.
Pretty.
And God said,
"Let there be light."
And there was light.
And even though we stand in darkness today, we shall not fear.
For God has given us the ultimate weapon.
The ultimate salvation!
The sun.
And he has placed in front of us a daunting but righteous task.
We will not falter.
We will not rest.
Until we have brought God's holy light down on each and every bloodsucking abomination!
- Amen.
- Praise Jesus!
Time to pack it up, Andy.
My family used to own this whole damn town.
The land this rat hole stands on included.
You don't own this rat hole no more,
- so I'm cuttin' you off.
- Join the club.
One minute you're a hero, the next you can't get a fuckin' drink.
I ain't never seen a bird fly so high it don't have to come down sometime.
- What's that for?
- It's your pity party.
Only one you're getting from me, so suck it up.
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me.
It's just easier for me not to hate you.
Hating takes a lot of energy.
And I'm saving mine up for all the good shit that's coming my way.
'Cause I am a good person, and I deserve good shit in my life.
Yeah, put it on a bumper sticker.
Thank you, Sookie.
Where's Vampire Bill at tonight?
Is he out celebrating?
Some sort of vampire party?
Actually, we're celebrating together later.
Just tell him congratulations from me.
I don't care what nobody says, if I met a nice vampire girl,
- I'd be proud to have her on my arm.
- I'd love to see your mama's face
- if you brought her home for dinner.
- Yeah, me too.
You know, yeah.
I mean, does Bill know anybody my age?
Seriously.
Hi, Daddy.
What is this?
There are favors and there are... favors.
She is extremely annoying.
You can't do this.
We had a deal.
Now the terms have changed.
She's yours.
Unless you wanna give me Sookie?
It's just a suggestion.
Though a few nights with this one may change your mind.
Good luck.
Who's good to eat around here?
He ain't listening to me.
Good luck.
We're closing.
Give me your keys.
I ain't giving you shit, Stackhouse.
I'm a failure.
A pathetic fuckin' loser.
And everybody knows it.
Just like she said they would.
She's real happy with herself.
It don't ever make me happy to see someone in pain.
I'm gonna call your sister to come pick you up.
Detective Bellefleur.
- Where's my car?
- Andy Bellefleur, the only thing you're driving tonight is us crazy.
Portia{\ said she's} is on her way to pick you up.
Give me your keys.
I don't have 'em.
Left 'em in the car.
Right here, underneath this light.
- Some son of a bitch stole my car.
- You sure this is where you parked it?
This whole town's gone to shit.
Nobody used to go murdering each other, stealing' cars.
That's what happens when you don't let a good cop do his job.
Ain't that it over there?
That ain't where I parked it.
What the hell?
That ain't mine, I swear.
La team AB+ vous retrouve I'année prochaine
You know that old leather jacket I wear sometime?
The brown one?
Well, make sure it goes to Hoyt.
I told him it was lucky.
It ain't.
But he don't know that.
Sookie'll get the house.
My bank account.
But I want you to have my truck.
Really?
You've been a good friend, Rene.
Thanks, man.
I'm giving it back though, soon as they let you go.
They ain't never letting me go, Rene.
There's something inside me that's just...
- It's wrong.
- Nah, come on now.
It ain't like you went and killed a bunch a... innocent women.
- What?
- They were fangbangers.
If you hadn't have done it, it was a matter of time.
Wait, are you calling my grandma a fangbanger?
Don't get your back all up, you...
I'm just sayin', you must've had your reasons, that's all.
There ain't no good reason for what I did.
- Suppose you're right.
- You can't go in there.
He's my brother.
He's only allowed one visitor at a time.
You can either let me by or throw me in there, but I'm gonna see my brother.
- I'm sorry, Sookie.
I'm so sorry.
- You've have nothing to be sorry for.
I wish I got here sooner, before you went and confessed to something.
I don't even remember doing any of it.
I just know I did.
Jason, you need to shut up, okay?
'Cause I'm real close to finding out who the real killer is.

His name's Drew Marshall.
He had a sister named Cindy, and I think he killed her.
Strangled her just like Maudette and Dawn and Amy.
How come she hasn't gone to the cops and gotten Jason out.
'Cause I tried that, and so far the cops have done diddlysquat to protect me and my family.
I don't have any evidence yet.
I ignore what Drew Marshall looks like.
So you can't really be sure he's the killer.
I've seen what's inside his head.
They'll never believe that about him, but it's the truth.
There's all kinds of strangeness in this world.
I know you wanna help me, but that's only 'cause you can't accept the truth.
I'm a murderer.
And I'm going to hell.
Plain and simple.
You aren't hearing me.
I know who the killer is.
And all we gotta do is find him.
Listen to me, don't be stupid.
- What's your problem?
- Make her go away.
Am I your fucking butler?
Please, just get her out of here.
Now, you heard him.
Zoo's closed.
Did you get the fax from the Bunkie police department about Drew Marshall, the man who's probably the real killer?
Never heard of no fax from no Bunkie P.D., or Drew-whoever.
But I'll tell you one thing.
The real killer is right there, where he belongs.
You are one hell of a sorry excuse for a cop and a human being,
Andy, and it's just a matter of time before everyone knows it.
Hi, I'm Tara.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I thought you might be hungry.
Okay, this isn't food.
This is sculpture.
And this place...
You're not really just a social worker, are you?
I'm a lot of things.
- Just like you.
Coffee?
- Sure.
I mean, you're not just a drunk-driving bartender, are you?
You're also intelligent, resourceful.
Strong.
A survivor.
I don't feel like any of those things right now.
I didn't just wreck my car,
I totaled my whole life.
All of it.
Well, I suppose that's one way of looking at it.
Personally, I see your situation as an opportunity.
I just got a fake exorcism and a dui.
I probably lost my job.
All of my friends.
And my mother disowned me.
I'm sorry, but I don't get how that's an opportunity.
Maybe life has just cleared out all the things that weren't working.
Now you've got room to rebuild.
Decide exactly what you want your life to look like.
And make that happen.
What do you want, Tara?
What do you want your life to be?
I don't know.
I guess I never really let myself want anything.
That breaks my heart.
Yeah, well, there are people a lot worse off than me.
I'm sure.
I should probably let you get back to helping them.
Instead of watching me cry all over your nice breakfast.
I appreciate everything you've done for me.
And I promise to pay back the bail as soon as I can.
Tara, sit down.
You haven't touched your food, your dress isn't dry, and I think we both know you've got nowhere to go.
Please.
I know it's hard for you to trust me, but I really do just wanna help.
Even if that means giving you a place to stay until you figure things out.
- Why would you do that?
- 'Cause it's what I do.
It's what I want my life to be:
helping people.
Not because I feel sorry for you, and not because I want anything back from you.
- Then why?
- Because you deserve a chance.
And I'm in a position to give you one.
You wanna end this thing, that's fine.
The least you could do is call me back and tell me where the fuck you are so I can stop worrying.
Thanks a lot, I'll talk to you later, bye.
- What are you doing here?
- I got the lunch shift.
With everything going on with Jason, I figured you'd take the day off.
I'm not staying home and hiding, having people think I'm ashamed.
Besides, I'm gonna need all the money I can get to hire a p. i.
Drew Marshall is somewhere in this town.
Who knows how many times he's sat in one of those booths, looked me in right in the eye and ordered a burger and fries.
- Yeah, but wouldn't you have heard him?
- Wouldn't you've smelled him?
I ain't a shortwave radio.
I spend most of my time trying not to listen.
- Sorry, I didn't mean...
- It's okay.
I better start my prep.
You can only have five minutes with him.
Five minutes.
Mr. Stackhouse?
My name is Orry Dawson.
I told 'em I don't need no lawyer.
I'm not a lawyer.
I'm here on behalf of the Fellowship of the Sun.
That anti-vampire church?
We are a religious organization dedicated to the preservation and salvation of the human race.
Good.
'Cause I thought you just hated vampires.
And I used to, but then I got to know one, and he was a pretty decent guy.
Until I got him killed.
See, that's where you're wrong.
What you did, it was a service to your race and to Jesus.
And you should be proud of that.
Last year there were over 800 reported vampire-related attacks in Louisiana alone.
And the law won't do nothing about it.
They are too busy respecting those fiends and their...
Their civil rights.
What about our rights?
Our rights to be safe in our own neighborhoods, our right to our own blood?
No, I don't know nothing about that.
Look, uh...
Officially, the church can't condone what you did.
You took the lives of four women.
Women who had tainted themselves and their race, but still, human women.
But we do recognize that even though your methods may have been flawed, your intentions were pure.
I got no idea what you're talkin' about.
That's smart.
Don't admit to anything.
The church has started up a fund for your defense.
In the meantime, here's something to help you pass the time.
You are a brave soldier, Jason Stackhouse.
God loves you.
You...
You will be saved.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I was looking for Maryann.
She'll be right back.
You must be Tara.
Come on in.
I'm Eggs.
Eggs?
It's actually Benedict.
- Benedict Talley, so...
- Eggs Benedict.
Ah, shit, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have laughed.
- My name's screwed up too.
- Tara's a pretty name.
Suits you.
Maryann did...
Didn't tell me she...
She had a...
A boyfriend.
I'm...
I'm just stayin' here till I get back on my feet.
Just like you.
So collecting stray black people, that some kind of hobby of hers?
She was right about you.
You are funny.
- What else she tell you about me?
- She said...
You crashed your car with a gallon of whiskey in your lap.
It was vodka.
Really cheap vodka.
I'm...
I'm not judging you.
Believe me, all right.
When Maryann found me I was...
Let's just say, I was a hell of a lot worse off than you.
She's a miracle worker.
You'll see.
Yeah, well, I won't be sticking around that long.
That's too bad.
My mama, when she thought something was too good to be true, she'd...
She'd say, "Satan in a Sunday hat".
That's exactly what this is.
You know, it took me a long time to stop looking over my shoulder too.
But there are good people in this world.
Sometimes... good shit happens.
He don't remember doin' it.
Like he had amnesia or something.
Holler if y'all need anything, okay?
Now, he's just sitting there, lookin' like a dog that lost his bone.
And then he says, "I did it.
"I killed those women.
- You were right all along. "
- He didn't exactly say that.
You should've seen the look in his eye.
Ice cold.
Like he was talking about road kill.
Excuse me.
Well, thank God you got him, Detective Bellefleur.
Can I buy you a beer?
Show my appreciation?
That's all right, Rosie, I was just doin' my job.
Whole family full of freaks and killers.
Oughta be ashamed to show her face after what her brother did.
Sleazy little manslut, Jason Stackhouse, a goddamned murderer.
I'd pay good money to watch that boy fry.
He was so cute for a murderer, wonder why he never hit on me.
What's going on?
You're right, I shouldn't have come in today.
Why don't you go to my trailer, lie down?
I need to get out of here.
- It's not safe.
- I'm just gonna drive around.
I'll keep my doors locked.
I won't even get out of the car.
I need some time alone.
I gotta get these thoughts out of my head.
All right, all right, yeah.
I've got your tables.
Thank you, Sam.
For everything.
Please, Jesus, don't do this to me.
Shoot, darn it!
Son of a mother!
Fudge!
Evything all right?
Just a... a little car trouble, that's all.
Want me to take a look?
Don't tell anybody, but I don't know much about cars.
Sorry.
Thanks for trying.
I...
I guess I should call a tow.
Why don't you let me give you a ride home?
I'll get my buddy Hank at Auto Haven to take a look on my way back.
I can't be alone.
Course you can't.
How'bout I give you a ride home, stay with you until Sam gets off work?
I couldn't put you out.
Your brother's been real good to me.
Least I could do.
That's so kind of you, Rene.
I just wanna say...
I told Andy, I've known killers, and Jason ain't one.
- Thank you, Terry.
- Nobody ever listens to me.
But they should.
Ready?
I can't believe Jason gave you his truck.
He loves this truck.
I know, right?
I tried talking him out of it.
He wasn't hearing it, though.
Buckle up, now.
Thanks.
It's really true?
You can hear what I'm thinking right now?
What do I think about, think about, think about nothing, nothing, think about nothing...
Don't bother.
Thinking about nothing ain't possible.
Trust me, everyone's tried it around me.
Sooner or later you'll think about something.
What's kinda funny, is that...
Your thoughts don't have an accent.
That must be hard on you, livin' with that.
It is hard.
Sometimes.
You have no idea how sick and twisted some people are.
Lord, I can believe that, yes, ma'am.
It's one thing when they think horrible stuff about me,
I mean,
I'm kinda used to it.
But, when it's about my brother...
He's all I've got left.
I mean, I've lost everyone.
Thanks.
I've lost people too.
It don't ever get any easier.
But, you find ways to cope.
I thought I told you kids to take out the garbage.
What the hell are you watching?
Oh, my Lord.
Where'd you get this?
Coby?
Lisa, you answer me, right now.
It's Rene's.
We found it in the garage.
Go to your room.
It's hotter in here than hell on a Sunday.
I know, Gran used to leave the windows open all day, but I haven't felt safe doin' that in a while.
Have a seat, I'll fix us some iced teas.
Sounds good.
These fuckers' palates are as backwoods as their brains.
- Rene left his vest.
- I'll put it in the lost and found.
Hey, where's Sookie?
Did you see her?
- Where'd she go?
- She left with Rene about 20, 23 minutes ago.
- Rene, you take it sweet?
- Yes, ma'am.
You scared me.
Did I?
Sorry about that.
Don't think about it...
Blood, blood, so much blood...
She wasn't supposed to be here...
Shut up!
- Rene?
- Sookie ain't here?
You weren't supposed to be here.
You all right?
I'm... so jumpy these days.
Let me help you with that.
I'm gonna go get a mop.
What do you think you're doin'?
Stay away!
You're not gonna shoot me.
Told you.
She deserves it, needs it, wants to die.
That's why she fucks them fangers...
Fuck.
Goddamn it.
Get back here, you fucking bitch!
Dang it.
Nothing that'll cover up what you done.
You watching me now?
You freak.
You're the freak, Cindy.
You're the damn freak.
Fuckin' freak.
Fuck!
Spread your legs for a dead man.
Mama'd roll over in her grave...
Get the fuck out of here.
Sookie.
I'll teach you, you bitch!
What're you doing?
Get away from me!
Get out!
I can feel you in my head!
I thought you were Jason.
Die, fang fucker!
Stay the fuck out of my head!
Come on, Sookie.
Let's be...
Let's be friends.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
We can be friends.
Sookie.
Seriously, I was just kidding.
Can you fuckin' hear me, you filthy fucking cunt?
I'm gonna tear out your throat with my hands and fuck your dead face.
Shit.
Goddamn it.
I must have lost her.
Could be hiding in the woods.
I better go back and check.
Mind-reading, vampire-fucking, freak bitch!
You think you're so smart!
You smart now?
What the fuck are you?
You fuckin' freak fuck!
Fuckin' sick fuck.
Die, you fucking freak of nature!
Die...
Fucking bitch!
I... am... sorry.
No, Bill, please.
We gotta get him out of the light.
You look so pretty.
Like someone turned a light on under your skin.
Hospital gave her pain meds.
She's...
She's a little loopy.
Didn't you listen when I said I'd lose my shit if anything ever happened to you?
Don't lose your shit.
I'm fine.
Did Sam tell you that he saved my life?
He turned into a dog and bit Rene.
No shit.
I'm gonna need some of them drugs they gave you.
You guys, we should let her rest.
You need to let people see the real you.
'Cause you're kind and brave.
There's nothing there not to love.
Right back at you.
All right then.
Thanks.
DA's dropping the charges.
No.
No fucking way.
He confessed.
The marks on Amy Burley's neck match Rene's belt.
Or Drew Marshall.
Whatever the hell his name is.
He near about put Sookie in a body bag.
We got no reason to hold Stackhouse.
That's horseshit!
Get ahold of yourself.
I don't need you screwing things up even worse.
So, what?
We're just gonna let him go?
Not "we. "
You brought him in.
You let him go.
Right now, Andy.
Is there some way I can get a magazine?
This shit's putting me to sleep.
- What're you doin'?
- Get out of here.
What?
You heard me.
Get the fuck out of here.
- Is this some kinda trick or something?
- No, you stupid shit.
It ain't a trick.
It's a fucking miracle!
Oh, sweet Jesus, please forgive me.
I had no idea, Sookie, I swear.
- Course you didn't.
- I brought him around my kids.
I slept in the bed with him every night.
And all that time, it was nothin' but lies.
I mean, his name, his accent.
God, you think you know someone.
How could I not know?
None of us did.
- Don't blame yourself, honey.
- I can't help it.
I told you to stay out of my thoughts.
Is that why you didn't listen in on Rene?
It's like he kept that part of himself... locked away in some... dark... corner of his mind.
Oh, God.
I am so sorry.
I want you to promise me something, okay?
Okay.
Someday, if I ever find another man.
I want you to look inside his head and tell me everything that's in there.
Arlene, it doesn't really work that way.
Just promise me, okay?
'Cause I have the worst taste in men.
Is Bill gonna be okay?
I don't think so.
Oh, honey.
Oh, sweet baby.
I'm gonna head on over to the bar.
Make sure Terry ain't P-T-S-Ding all over my clam chowder.
Thanks, Lafayette.
I appreciate you holding down the fort.
No worries, boyfriend. 'Cause I'm gonna hit your ass up for a raise, soon as they pull them stitches out your forehead.
Call me later, T.
Where have you been?
I left you like 5 messages.
I didn't get any messages.
What?
Look, we don't have to talk about this now.
Sookie almost died.
And she would've, if you hadn't been there.
I'm glad you were, okay?
I was...
I was worried about you.
I'm sure you were.
You worry about everybody.
But Sookie's right, you're an amazing guy.
You deserve to get everything you want.
And so do I.
What does that mean?
Take good care of her.
Wait, Tara...
Maryann, this is my friend Sam.
Sam, this is Maryann.
Sam, it's so nice to meet you.
You ready to go?
What the hell are you doing here?
Did you think I wasn't gonna find you?
You silly, silly dog.
I should've known.
'Cause there were things he liked to do... in bed that no normal man ever does.
I've never been happier to see you in my life.
That's nice, but, sweetie, I'm... black and blue all over and you're squeezing me.
Sorry.
Shit, look what that son of a bitch did to you.
I can't believe I gave him my truck.
If he was still alive right now, I'm... fuckin' kill him again.
Excuse me.
- Me and my mouth.
- She'll be all right.
Eventually.
You know, I was sitting in that jail, and I just kept thinkin' about all the stupid stuff I'd done.
That must've kept you busy.
And I know it seems like all I ever think about's myself.
And drinking and chasing women.
But that's only 'cause I thought that's all I was good at.
That's not true.
You were good at football.
Not good enough for a scholarship.
I ain't never been good enough for anything.
Or anybody.
Well, except maybe Amy.
But she's gone, so...
So I was in there, waitin' to die too, and I realized
my life wasn't worth nothing.
I'd never done nothing worth being proud of.
And all I could think to do was to end it.
- Jason...
- No, it's okay.
'Cause then, something happened.
I was saved.
I was given a second chance.
And now I know that all this...
this bad stuff that happened, it happened for a reason.
What's that?
I ain't sure yet.
But I do know that I'm meant to do something important with my life.
And soon as I find out what that is,
- I ain't gonna fuck it up.
- That's good.
- I guess.
- Yeah.
I love you, Sook.
And...
I'm gonna take good care of you from now on.
I promise.
How about you just take care of yourself and... stay out of trouble?
Come on, you don't have to worry about me no more.
I'm good.
Why is all fucking garbage on the side of the garbage can?
Nasty motherfuckers.
Got no...
Goddamn home training.
Oh, my God!
Daddy.
Oh, Daddy.
It is you.
I found you.
I found you.
They said you were dead.
But I knew you weren't.
Daddy.
Hold me close...
You're alive?
Technically, no.
But I am healed.
I fed.
Would you like to come in?
Without my blood it'll take weeks for you to heal.
I don't care.
After everything,
I... just need to feel human right now.
I failed you.
You were willing to sacrifice yourself to save me.
If I'd just been...
My life is too short for all that.
Yesterday, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that limiting marriage between only human men and women is unconstitutional, effectively legalizing vampire marriage in the state.
Courthouses will be staying open after dark to accommodate hundreds of couples from all over America.
Oh, my God, you know what this means?
- Now you and Bill can get married.
- Stop it, Arlene.
This isn't Vermont.
Besides, he hasn't even asked me yet.
And I don't know what I'd say if he did.
You should marry Bill.
Hell, I'll even throw you a party.
Won't even break the bank, is all you need is a couple kegs of Tru Blood, seein' as how they don't eat or drink.
Bet there's even a vampire band and vampire wedding decorations.
Put Arlene's party to shame.
You know you're about as subtle as a flying brick?
Maryann says if you want something, you don't wait for it to come to you.
- You demand it...
- Do me a favor, don't quote Maryann to me.
Excuse me for giving a damn.
You heard from your cousin, by any chance?
'Cause I'm about to give away his job.
But this one time Lafayette went to Marthaville for the night.
He ended up go-go dancing in Palm Beach for like 8 months.
Fantastic.
People disappear all the time, but they're never really gone.
The good parts of 'em always stay put.
I hope you're right about that,
Terry.
Your hair's like a sunset after a bomb went off.
Pretty.
And God said,
"Let there be light. "
And there was light.
And even though we stand in darkness today, we shall not fear.
For God has given us the ultimate weapon.
The ultimate salvation!
The sun.
And he has placed in front of us a daunting but righteous task.
We will not falter.
We will not rest.
Until we have brought God's holy light down on each and every bloodsucking abomination!
- Amen.
- Praise Jesus!
Time to pack it up, Andy.
My family used to own this whole damn town.
The land this rat hole stands on included.
You don't own this rat hole no more,
- so I'm cuttin' you off.
- Join the club.
One minute you're a hero, the next you can't get a fuckin' drink.
I ain't never seen a bird fly so high it don't have to come down sometime.
- What's that for?
- It's your pity party.
Only one you're getting from me, so suck it up.
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me.
It's just easier for me not to hate you.
Hating takes a lot of energy.
And I'm saving mine up for all the good shit that's coming my way.
'Cause I am a good person, and I deserve good shit in my life.
Yeah, put it on a bumper sticker.
Thank you, Sookie.
Where's Vampire Bill at tonight?
Is he out celebrating?
Some sort of vampire party?
Actually, we're celebrating together later.
Just tell him congratulations from me.
I don't care what nobody says, if I met a nice vampire girl,
- I'd be proud to have her on my arm.
- I'd love to see your mama's face
- if you brought her home for dinner.
- Yeah, me too.
You know, yeah.
I mean, does Bill know anybody my age?
Seriously.
Hi, Daddy.
What is this?
There are favors and there are... favors.
She is extremely annoying.
You can't do this.
We had a deal.
Now the terms have changed.
She's yours.
Unless you wanna give me Sookie?
It's just a suggestion.
Though a few nights with this one may change your mind.
Good luck.
Who's good to eat around here?
He ain't listening to me.
Good luck.
We're closing.
Give me your keys.
I ain't giving you shit, Stackhouse.
I'm a failure.
A pathetic fuckin' loser.
And everybody knows it.
Just like she said they would.
She's real happy with herself.
It don't ever make me happy to see someone in pain.
I'm gonna call your sister to come pick you up.
Detective Bellefleur.
- Where's my car?
- Andy Bellefleur, the only thing you're driving tonight is us crazy.
Portia is on her way to pick you up.
Give me your keys.
I don't have 'em.
Left 'em in the car.
Right here, underneath this light.
- Some son of a bitch stole my car.
- You sure this is where you parked it?
This whole town's gone to shit.
Nobody used to go murdering each other, stealing' cars.
That's what happens when you don't let a good cop do his job.
Ain't that it over there?
That ain't where I parked it.
What the hell?
That ain't mine, I swear.
You know that old leather jacket I wear sometime?
The brown one?
Well, make sure it goes to Hoyt.
I told him it was lucky.
It ain't.
But he don't know that.
Sookie'll get the house.
My bank account.
But I want you to have my truck.
Really?
You've been a good friend, Rene.
Thanks, man.
I'm giving it back though, soon as they let you go.
They ain't never letting me go, Rene.
There's something inside me that's just...
- It's wrong.
- Nah, come on now.
It ain't like you went and killed a bunch a... innocent women.
- What?
- They were fangbangers.
If you hadn't have done it, it was a matter of time.
Wait, are you calling my grandma a fangbanger?
Don't get your back all up, you...
I'm just sayin', you must've had your reasons, that's all.
There ain't no good reason for what I did.
- Yeah, suppose you're right.
- You can't go in there.
He's my brother.
Sorry Sookie, He's only allowed one visitor at a time.
You can either let me by or throw me in there, but I'm gonna see my brother.
- I'm sorry, Sookie.
I'm so sorry.
- You've have nothing to be sorry for.
I wish I got here sooner, before you went and confessed to something you didn't do.
I don't even remember doing any of it.
I just know I did.
Jason, you need to shut up, okay?
'Cause I'm real close to finding out who the real killer is.

Hi, I'm Tara.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I thought you might be hungry.
Okay, this isn't food.
This is sculpture.
And this place...
You're not really just a social worker, are you?
I'm a lot of things.
- Just like you.
Coffee?
- Sure.
I mean, you're not just a drunk-driving bartender, are you?
You're also intelligent, resourceful.
Strong.
A survivor.
I don't feel like any of those things right now.
I didn't just wreck my car,
I totaled my whole life.
All of it.
Well, I suppose that's one way of looking at it.
Personally, I see your situation as an opportunity.
I just got a fake exorcism and a dui.
I probably lost my job.
All of my friends.
And my mother disowned me.
I'm sorry, but I don't get how that's an opportunity.
Maybe life has just cleared out all the things that weren't working.
Now you've got room to rebuild.
Decide exactly what you want your life to look like.
And make that happen.
What do you want, Tara?
What do you want your life to be?
I don't know.
I guess I never really let myself want anything.
That breaks my heart.
Yeah, well, there are people a lot worse off than me.
I'm sure.
I should probably let you get back to helping them.
Instead of watching me cry all over your nice breakfast.
I appreciate everything you've done for me.
And I promise to pay back the bail as soon as I can.
Tara, sit down.
You haven't touched your food, your dress isn't dry, and I think we both know you've got nowhere to go.
Please.
I know it's hard for you to trust me, but I really do just wanna help.
Even if that means giving you a place to stay until you figure things out.
- Why would you do that?
- 'Cause it's what I do.
It's what I want my life to be:
helping people.
Not because I feel sorry for you, and not because I want anything back from you.
- Then why?
- Because you deserve a chance.
And I'm in a position to give you one.
Fine, you wanna end this thing, that's fine.
The least you could do is call me back and tell me where the fuck you are so I can stop worrying.
Thanks a lot, I'll talk to you later, bye.
- Sookie, what are you doing here?
- I got the lunch shift.
Yeah, with everything going on with Jason, I figured you'd take the day off.
I'm not staying home and hiding, having people think I'm ashamed of my brother.
Besides, I'm gonna need all the money I can get to hire a private investigator.
Drew Marshall is somewhere in this town.
Who knows how many times he's sat in one of those booths, looked me in right in the eye and ordered a burger and fries.
- Yeah, but wouldn't you have heard him?
- Wouldn't you've smelled him?
I ain't a shortwave radio.
I spend most of my time trying not to listen to people.
- Sorry, I didn't mean...
- It's okay.
I better start my prep.
You can only have five minutes with him.
Five minutes.
Mr. Stackhouse?
- Yeah.
- My name is Orry Dawson.
I told 'em I don't need no lawyer.
I'm not a lawyer.
I'm here on behalf of the Fellowship of the Sun.
That anti-vampire church?
We are a religious organization dedicated to the preservation and salvation of the human race.
Good.
'Cause I thought you just hated vampires.
And I used to, but then I got to know one, and he was a pretty decent guy.
Until I got him killed.
See, that's where you're wrong.
What you did, it was a service to your race and to Jesus.
And you should be proud of that.
- Yeah.
- You know, last year there were over 800 reported vampire-related attacks.
in Louisiana alone.
And the law won't do nothing about it.
They are too busy respecting those fiends and their...
Their civil rights.
Well, what about our rights?
Our rights to be safe in our own neighborhoods, our right to our own blood?
No, I don't know nothing about that.
Look, uh...
Officially, the church can't condone what you did.
You took the lives of four women.
Women who had tainted themselves and their race, but still, human women.
Hey.
But we do recognize that even though your methods may have been flawed, your intentions were pure.
I got no idea what you're talkin' about.
That's smart.
Don't admit to anything.
The church has started up a fund for your defense.
In the meantime, here's something to help you pass the time.
You are a brave soldier, Jason Stackhouse.
Okay.
God loves you.
You...
You will be saved.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I was looking for Maryann.
She'll be right back.
You must be Tara.
Come on in.
I'm Eggs.
Eggs?
It's actually Benedict.
- Benedict Talley, so...
- Eggs Benedict.
Ah, shit, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have laughed.
- My name's screwed up too.
- Tara's a pretty name.
Suits you.
Maryann did...
Didn't tell me she...
She had a...
A boyfriend.
Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm...
I'm just stayin' here till I get back on my feet.
Just like you.
So collecting stray black people, that some kind of hobby of hers?
She was right about you.
You are funny.
Oh, yeah?
- What else she tell you about me?
- Oh, she said...
You crashed your car with a gallon of whiskey in your lap.
It was vodka.
Really cheap vodka.
Hey, I'm...
I'm not judging you.
Believe me, all right.
When Maryann found me I was...
Let's just say, I was a hell of a lot worse off than you.
She's a miracle worker.
You'll see.
Yeah, well, I won't be sticking around that long.
That's too bad.
My mama, when she thought something was too good to be true, she'd...
She'd say, "Satan in a Sunday hat".
That's exactly what this is.
You know, it took me a long time to stop looking over my shoulder too.
But there are good people in this world.
Sometimes... good shit happens.
He don't remember doin' it.
Like he had amnesia or something.
- Hey, Sookie.
- Hey.
Holler if y'all need anything, okay?
Now, he's just sitting there, lookin' like a dog that lost his bone.
And then he says, "I did it.
"I killed those women.
- You were right all along. "
- He didn't exactly say that.
You should've seen the look in his eye.
Ice cold.
Like he was talking about road kill.
Excuse me.
Well, thank God you got him, Detective Bellefleur.
Can I buy you a beer?
Show my appreciation?
That's all right, Rosie, I was just doin' my job.
Whole family full of freaks and killers.
Oughta be ashamed to show her face after what her brother did.
Sleazy little manslut, Jason Stackhouse, a goddamned murderer.
I'd pay good money to watch that boy fry.
He was so cute for a murderer, wonder why he never hit on me.
What's going on?
You're right, I shouldn't have come in today.
Why don't you go to my trailer, lie down?
I need to get out of here.
- It's not safe.
- I'm just gonna drive around.
- I'll keep my doors locked.
I won't even get out of the car.
- No Sookie.
I need some time alone.
I gotta get these thoughts out of my head.
All right, all right, yeah.
I've got your tables.
Thank you, Sam.
- For everything.
- Hey.
Please, Jesus, don't do this to me.
Shoot, darn it!
Son of a mother!
Fudge!
Sookie.
Everything all right?
Just a... a little car trouble, that's all.
Want me to take a look?
Don't tell anybody, but I don't know much about cars.
Sorry.
Thanks for trying.
I...
I guess I should call a tow.
Why don't you let me give you a ride home?
I'll get my buddy Hank at Auto Haven to take a look on my way back.
I... can't be alone.
Course you can't.
How about I give you a ride home, stay with you until Sam gets off work, huh?
I couldn't put you out.
No, no, no, no.
Your brother's been real good to me.
Least I could do.
That's so kind of you, Rene.
Hey Sookie, Rene.
I just wanna say...
I told Andy, I've known killers, and Jason ain't one.
- Thank you, Terry.
- Nobody ever listens to me.
But they should.
Ready?
I can't believe Jason gave you his truck.
He loves this truck.
I know, right?
I tried talking him out of it.
He wasn't hearing it, though.
Buckle up, now.
Thanks.
It's really true?
You can hear what I'm thinking right now?
What do I think about, think about, think about nothing, nothing, think about nothing...
Don't bother.
Thinking about nothing ain't possible.
Trust me, everyone's tried it around me.
Sooner or later you'll think about something.
What's kinda funny, is that...
Your thoughts don't have an accent.
That must be hard on you, livin' with that.
It is hard.
Sometimes.
You have no idea how sick and twisted some people are.
Lord, I can believe that, yes, ma'am.
It's one thing when they think horrible stuff about me,
I mean,
I'm kinda used to it.
But, when it's about my brother...
He's all I've got left.
I mean, I've lost everyone.
Thanks.
I've lost people too, me.
It don't ever get any easier.
But, you find ways to cope.
I thought I told you kids to take out the garbage.
What the hell are you watching?
Oh, my Lord.
Where'd you get this?
Coby?
Lisa, you answer me, right now.
It's Rene's.
We found it in the garage.
Go to your room.
It's hotter in here than hell on a Sunday.
I know, Gran used to leave the windows open all day, but I haven't felt safe doin' that in a while.
Have a seat, I'll fix us some iced teas.
Sounds good.
These fuckers' palates are as backwoods as their brains.
- Sam, Rene left his vest.
- I'll put it in the lost and found.
Hey, where's Sookie?
Did you see her?
- Yeah.
- Where'd she go?
- She left with Rene about 20, 23 minutes ago.
- Rene, you take it sweet?
- Yes, ma'am.
You scared me.
Did I?
Sorry about that.
Don't think about it...
Blood, blood, so much blood...
She wasn't supposed to be here...
Shut up!
- Rene?
- Sookie ain't here?
You weren't supposed to be here.
Sookie.
You all right?
I'm... so jumpy these days.
Let me help you with that.
No, I'm gonna go get a mop.
What do you think you're doin'?
Stay away!
You're not gonna shoot me.
Told you.
She deserves it, needs it, wants to die.
That's why she fucks them fangers...
Fuck.
Goddamn it.
Get back here, you fucking bitch!
Dang it.
There ain't nothing that'll cover up what you have done.
You watching me now?
You freak.
Sookie.
You're the freak, Cindy.
You're the damn freak.
Fuckin' freak.
Fuck!
Spread your legs for a dead man.
Mama'd roll over in her grave...
Get the fuck out of here.
Sookie.
Sookie.
I'll teach you, you bitch!
No, no, what're you doing?
Get away from me!
Get out!
I can feel you in my head!
I thought you were Jason.
Die, fang fucker!
Stay the fuck out of my head!
Sookie.
Sookie.
Sookie.
Come on, Sookie.
Let's be...
Let's be friends.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
We can be friends.
Sookie.
Seriously, I was just kidding.
Can you fuckin' hear me, you filthy fucking cunt?
I'm gonna tear out your throat with my hands and fuck your dead face.
Shit.
Goddamn it.
I must have lost her.
She could be hiding in the woods.
I better go back and check.
Mind-reading, vampire-fucking, freak bitch!
You think you're so smart!
You smart now?
Fuck.
What the fuck are you?
Sookie.
Fuck you, You fuckin' freak fuck!
Fuckin' sick fuck.
Die, you fucking freak of nature!
Die...
Fucking bitch!
Sookie.
I... am... sorry.
No.
No, Bill, please.
We gotta get him out of the light.
Sookie.
Tara.
You look so pretty.
Like someone turned a light on under your skin.
Hospital gave her pain meds.
She's...
She's a little loopy.
Didn't you listen when I said I'd lose my shit if anything ever happened to you?
Don't lose your shit.
I'm fine.
Did Sam tell you that he saved my life?
He turned into a dog and bit Rene.
No shit.
I'm gonna need some of them drugs they gave you.
You guys, we should let her rest.
Sam.
You need to let people see the real you.
'Cause you're kind and brave.
There's nothing there not to love.
Right back at you.
All right then.
Thanks.
DA's dropping the charges.
No.
No fucking way.
He confessed.
The marks on Amy Burley's neck match Rene's belt.
Or Drew Marshall.
Whatever the hell his name is.
He near about put Sookie in a body bag.
We got no reason to hold Stackhouse.
That's horseshit!
Get ahold of yourself.
I don't need you screwing things up even worse.
So, what?
We're just gonna let him go?
Not "we. "
You brought him in.
You let him go.
Right now, Andy.
Oh, hey Andy.
Is there some way I can get a magazine or something?
This shit's putting me to sleep.
- What're you doin'?
- Get out of here.
What?
You heard me.
Get the fuck out of here.
- Is this some kinda trick or something?
- No, you stupid shit.
It ain't a trick.
It's a fucking miracle!
Oh, sweet Jesus, please forgive me.
I had no idea, Sookie, I swear.
- Course you didn't.
- I brought him around my kids.
I slept in the bed with him every night.
And all that time, it was nothin' but lies.
I mean, his name, his accent.
God, you think you know someone.
How could I not know?
None of us did.
- Don't blame yourself, honey.
- I can't help it.
I told you to stay out of my thoughts.
Is that why you didn't listen in on Rene?
It's like he kept that part of himself... locked away in some... dark... corner of his mind.
Oh, God.
Sookie.
I am so sorry.
I want you to promise me something, okay?
Okay.
Someday, if I ever find another man.
I want you to look inside his head and tell me everything that's in there.
Arlene, it doesn't really work that way.
Just promise me, okay?
'Cause I have the worst taste in men.
Is Bill gonna be okay?
I don't think so.
No.
Oh, honey.
Oh, sweet baby.
I'm gonna head on over to the bar.
Make sure Terry ain't P-T-S-Ding all over my clam chowder.
Thanks, Lafayette.
I appreciate you holding down the fort.
No worries, boyfriend. 'Cause I'm gonna hit your ass up for a raise, soon as they pull them stitches out your forehead.
Call me later, T.
Where have you been?
I left you like 5 messages.
I didn't get any messages.
What?
Look, we don't have to talk about this now.
Sookie almost died.
And she would've, if you hadn't been there so.
I'm glad you were, okay?
I was...
I was worried about you.
I'm sure you were.
You worry about everybody.
But Sookie's right, you're an amazing guy.
You deserve to get everything you want.
And so do I.
What does that mean?
Take good care of her.
Wait, Tara...
Maryann, this is my friend Sam.
Sam, this is Maryann.
Sam, it's so nice to meet you.
You ready to go?
What the hell are you doing here?
Did you think I wasn't gonna find you?
You silly, silly dog.
I should've known.
'Cause there were things he liked to do... in bed that no normal man ever does.
Jason.
I've never been happier to see you in my life.
That's nice, but, sweetie, I'm... black and blue all over and you're squeezing me.
Oh, sorry.
Shit, look what that son of a bitch did to you.
I can't believe I gave him my truck.
If he was still alive right now, I'm... fuckin' kill him again.
Excuse me.
- Me and my mouth.
- She'll be all right.
Eventually.
You know, I was sitting in that jail, and I just kept thinkin' about all the stupid stuff I'd done.
That must've kept you busy.
And I know it seems like all I ever think about's myself.
And drinking and chasing women.
But that's only 'cause I thought that's all I was good at.
That's not true.
You were good at football.
Not good enough for a scholarship.
I ain't never been good enough for anything.
Or anybody.
Well, except maybe Amy.
But she's gone, so...
So I was in there, waitin' to die too, and I realized
my life wasn't worth nothing.
I'd never done nothing worth being proud of.
And all I could think to do was to end it.
- Jason...
- No, it's okay.
'Cause then, something happened.
Sook.
I was saved.
I was given a second chance.
And now I know that all this...
this bad stuff that happened, it happened for a reason.
What's that?
I ain't sure yet.
But I do know that I'm meant to do something important with my life.
And soon as I find out what that is,
- I ain't gonna fuck it up.
- That's good.
- I guess.
- Yeah.
I love you, Sook.
And...
I'm gonna take good care of you from now on.
I promise.
How about you just take care of yourself and... stay out of trouble?
Come on, you don't have to worry about me no more.
I'm good.
Why is all fucking garbage on the side of the garbage can?
Nasty motherfuckers.
Got no...
Goddamn home training.
Oh, my God!
Daddy.
Oh, Daddy.
It is you.
I found you.
I found you.
They said you were dead.
But I knew you weren't.
Daddy.
Hold me close...
You're alive?
Well, technically, no.
But I am healed.
I fed.
Would you like to come in?
Yes.
Without my blood it'll take weeks for you to heal.
I don't care.
After everything,
I... just need to feel human right now.
I failed you.
You were willing to sacrifice yourself to save me.
If I'd just been...
My life is too short for all that.
{TWO WEEKS LATER}
Yesterday, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that limiting marriage between only human men and women is unconstitutional, effectively legalizing vampire marriage in the state.
Courthouses will be staying open after dark to accommodate hundreds of couples from all over America.
Oh, my God, you know what this means?
- Now you and Bill can get married.
- Stop it, Arlene.
This isn't Vermont.
Besides, he hasn't even asked me yet.
And I don't know what I'd say if he did.
You should marry Bill.
Hell, I'll even throw you a party.
Won't even break the bank, is all you need is a couple kegs of Tru Blood, seein' as how they don't eat or drink.
Bet there's even a vampire band and vampire wedding decorations.
Put Arlene's party to shame.
You know you're about as subtle as a flying brick?
Maryann says if you want something, you don't wait for it to come to you.
- You demand it...
- Do me a favor, don't quote Maryann to me.
Excuse me for giving a damn.
You heard from your cousin, by any chance?
'Cause I'm about to give away his job.
But this one time Lafayette went to Marthaville for the night.
He ended up go-go dancing in Palm Beach for like 8 months.
Fantastic.
People disappear all the time, but they're never really gone.
The good parts of 'em always stay put.
I hope you're right about that,
Terry.
Your hair's like a sunset after a bomb went off.
Pretty.
And God said,
"Let there be light. "
And there was light.
And even though we stand in darkness today, we shall not fear.
For God has given us the ultimate weapon.
The ultimate salvation!
The sun.
And he has placed in front of us a daunting but righteous task.
We will not falter.
We will not rest.
Until we have brought God's holy light down on each and every bloodsucking abomination!
- Amen.
- Praise Jesus!
Time to pack it up, Andy.
My family used to own this whole damn town.
The land this rat hole stands on included.
You don't own this rat hole no more,
- so I'm cuttin' you off.
- Join the club.
One minute you're a hero, the next you can't get a fuckin' drink.
I ain't never seen a bird fly so high it don't have to come down sometime.
- What's that for?
- It's your pity party.
Only one you're getting from me, so suck it up.
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me.
It's just easier for me not to hate you.
Hating takes a lot of energy.
And I'm saving mine up for all the good shit that's coming my way.
'Cause I am a good person, and I deserve good shit in my life.
Yeah, put it on a bumper sticker.
Thank you, Sookie.
Where's Vampire Bill at tonight?
Is he out celebrating?
Some sort of vampire party?
Actually, we're celebrating together later.
Well, just tell him congratulations from me.
I don't care what nobody says, if I met a nice vampire girl,
- I'd be proud to have her on my arm.
- I'd love to see your mama's face
- if you brought her home for dinner.
- Yeah, me too.
You know, yeah.
I mean, does Bill know anybody my age?
Seriously.
Hi, Daddy.
What is this?
There are favors and there are... favors.
She is extremely annoying.
You can't do this.
We had a deal.
Well, now the terms have changed.
She's yours.
Unless you wanna give me Sookie?
It's just a suggestion.
Though a few nights with this one may change your mind.
Good luck.
00:51:23 -- 00:51:26 ..oh du juva frihet..(added tr)
So, who's good to eat around here?
He ain't listening to me.
Good luck.
We're closing.
Give me your keys.
I ain't giving you shit, Stackhouse.
I'm a failure.
A pathetic fuckin' loser.
And everybody knows it.
Just like she said they would.
She's real happy with herself.
It don't ever make me happy to see someone in pain.
I'm gonna call your sister to come pick you up.
Detective Bellefleur.
- Where's my car?
- Andy Bellefleur, the only thing you're driving tonight is us crazy.
Portia{ said she's} is on her way to pick you up.
Give me your keys.
I don't have 'em.
Left 'em in the car.
Right here, underneath this light.
- Some son of a bitch stole my car.
- You sure this is where you parked it?
This whole town's gone to shit.
Nobody used to go murdering each other, stealing' cars.
That's what happens when you don't let a good cop do his job.
Ain't that it over there?
That ain't where I parked it.
What the hell?
That ain't mine, I swear.
You know that old leather jacket I wear sometime?
The brown one?
Well, make sure it goes to Hoyt.
I told him it was lucky.
It ain't.
But he don't know that.
Sookie'll get the house.
My bank account.
But I want you to have my truck.
Really?
You've been a good friend, Rene.
Thanks, man.
I'm giving it back though, soon as they let you go.
They ain't never letting me go, Rene.
There's something inside me that's just...
- It's wrong.
- Nah, come on now.
It ain't like you went and killed a bunch a... innocent women.
- What?
- They were fangbangers.
If you hadn't have done it, it was a matter of time.
Wait, are you calling my grandma a fangbanger?
Don't get your back all up, you...
I'm just sayin', you must've had your reasons, that's all.
There ain't no good reason for what I did.
- Yeah, suppose you're right.
- You can't go in there.
He's my brother.
Sorry Sookie, He's only allowed one visitor at a time.
You can either let me by or throw me in there, but I'm gonna see my brother.
- I'm sorry, Sookie.
I'm so sorry.
- You've have nothing to be sorry for.
I wish I got here sooner, before you went and confessed to something you didn't do.
I don't even remember doing any of it.
I just know I did.
Jason, you need to shut up, okay?
'Cause I'm real close to finding out who the real killer is.

True Blood, Season 1, episode 12, Season Finale.
His name's Drew Marshall.
He had a sister named Cindy, and I think he killed her.
Strangled her just like Maudette and Dawn and Amy.
If she knows this, How come she hasn't gone to the cops and gotten Jason out.
'Cause I tried that, and so far the cops have done diddlysquat to protect me and my family.
I don't have any evidence yet.
I don't even know what Drew Marshall looks like.
So you can't really be sure he's the killer.
I've seen what's inside his head.
They'll never believe that about him, but it's the truth.
There's all kinds of strangeness in this world.
I know you wanna help me, but that's only 'cause you can't accept the truth.
I'm a murderer.
And I'm going to hell.
Plain and simple.
You aren't hearing me.
I know who the killer is.
And all we gotta do is find him.
- Andy!
Listen to me, don't be stupid.
- Andy!
- What's your problem?
- Make her go away.
Am I your fucking butler?
Please, just get her out of here.
Now, you heard him.
Zoo's closed.
Did you get the fax from the Bunkie police department about Drew Marshall, the man who's probably the real killer?
Never heard of no fax from no Bunkie P. D., or Drew-whoever.
But I'll tell you one thing.
The real killer is right there, where he belongs.
You are one hell of a sorry excuse for a cop and a human being,
Andy Bellefleur, and it's just a matter of time before everyone knows it.
Hi, I'm Tara.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I thought you might be hungry.
Okay, this isn't food.
This is sculpture.
And this place...
You're not really just a social worker, are you?
I'm a lot of things.
- Just like you.
Coffee?
- Sure.
I mean, you're not just a drunk-driving bartender, are you?
You're also intelligent, resourceful.
Strong.
A survivor.
I don't feel like any of those things right now.
I didn't just wreck my car,
I totaled my whole life.
All of it.
Well, I suppose that's one way of looking at it.
Personally, I see your situation as an opportunity.
I just got a fake exorcism and a dui.
I probably lost my job.
All of my friends.
And my mother disowned me.
I'm sorry, but I don't get how that's an opportunity.
Maybe life has just cleared out all the things that weren't working.
Now you've got room to rebuild.
Decide exactly what you want your life to look like.
And make that happen.
What do you want, Tara?
What do you want your life to be?
I don't know.
I guess I never really let myself want anything.
That breaks my heart.
Yeah, well, there are people a lot worse off than me.
I'm sure.
I should probably let you get back to helping them.
Instead of watching me cry all over your nice breakfast.
I appreciate everything you've done for me.
And I promise to pay back the bail as soon as I can.
Tara, sit down.
You haven't touched your food, your dress isn't dry, and I think we both know you've got nowhere to go.
Please.
I know it's hard for you to trust me, but I really do just wanna help.
Even if that means giving you a place to stay until you figure things out.
- Why would you do that?
- 'Cause it's what I do.
It's what I want my life to be:
helping people.
Not because I feel sorry for you, and not because I want anything back from you.
- Then why?
- Because you deserve a chance.
And I'm in a position to give you one.
Fine, you wanna end this thing, that's fine.
The least you could do is call me back and tell me where the fuck you are so I can stop worrying.
Thanks a lot, I'll talk to you later, bye.
- Sookie, what are you doing here?
- I got the lunch shift.
Yeah, with everything going on with Jason, I figured you'd take the day off.
I'm not staying home and hiding, having people think I'm ashamed of my brother.
Besides, I'm gonna need all the money I can get to hire a private investigator.
Drew Marshall is somewhere in this town.
Who knows how many times he's sat in one of those booths, looked me in right in the eye and ordered a burger and fries.
- Yeah, but wouldn't you have heard him?
- Wouldn't you've smelled him?
I ain't a shortwave radio.
I spend most of my time trying not to listen to people.
- Sorry, I didn't mean...
- It's okay.
I better start my prep.
You can only have five minutes with him.
Five minutes.
Mr. Stackhouse?
- Yeah.
- My name is Orry Dawson.
I told 'em I don't need no lawyer.
I'm not a lawyer.
I'm here on behalf of the Fellowship of the Sun.
That anti-vampire church?
We are a religious organization dedicated to the preservation and salvation of the human race.
Good.
'Cause I thought you just hated vampires.
And I used to, but then I got to know one, and he was a pretty decent guy.
Until I got him killed.
See, that's where you're wrong.
What you did, it was a service to your race and to Jesus.
And you should be proud of that.
- Yeah.
- You know, last year there were over 800 reported vampire-related attacks.
in Louisiana alone.
And the law won't do nothing about it.
They are too busy respecting those fiends and their...
Their civil rights.
Well, what about our rights?
Our rights to be safe in our own neighborhoods, our right to our own blood?
No, I don't know nothing about that.
Look, uh...
Officially, the church can't condone what you did.
You took the lives of four women.
Women who had tainted themselves and their race, but still, human women.
Hey.
But we do recognize that even though your methods may have been flawed, your intentions were pure.
I got no idea what you're talkin' about.
That's smart.
Don't admit to anything.
The church has started up a fund for your defense.
In the meantime, here's something to help you pass the time.
You are a brave soldier, Jason Stackhouse.
Okay.
God loves you.
You...
You will be saved.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I was looking for Maryann.
She'll be right back.
You must be Tara.
Come on in.
I'm Eggs.
Eggs?
It's actually Benedict.
- Benedict Talley, so...
- Eggs Benedict.
Ah, shit, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have laughed.
- My name's screwed up too.
- Tara's a pretty name.
Suits you.
Maryann did...
Didn't tell me she...
She had a...
A boyfriend.
Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm...
I'm just stayin' here till I get back on my feet.
Just like you.
So collecting stray black people, that some kind of hobby of hers?
She was right about you.
You are funny.
Oh, yeah?
- What else she tell you about me?
- Oh, she said...
You crashed your car with a gallon of whiskey in your lap.
It was vodka.
Really cheap vodka.
Hey, I'm...
I'm not judging you.
Believe me, all right.
When Maryann found me I was...
Let's just say, I was a hell of a lot worse off than you.
She's a miracle worker.
You'll see.
Yeah, well, I won't be sticking around that long.
That's too bad.
My mama, when she thought something was too good to be true, she'd...
She'd say, "Satan in a Sunday hat".
That's exactly what this is.
You know, it took me a long time to stop looking over my shoulder too.
But there are good people in this world.
Sometimes... good shit happens.
He don't remember doin' it.
Like he had amnesia or something.
- Hey, Sookie.
- Hey.
Holler if y'all need anything, okay?
Now, he's just sitting there, lookin' like a dog that lost his bone.
And then he says, "I did it.
"I killed those women.
- You were right all along. "
- He didn't exactly say that.
You should've seen the look in his eye.
Ice cold.
Like he was talking about road kill.
Excuse me.
Well, thank God you got him, Detective Bellefleur.
Can I buy you a beer?
Show my appreciation?
That's all right, Rosie, I was just doin' my job.
Whole family full of freaks and killers.
Oughta be ashamed to show her face after what her brother did.
Sleazy little manslut, Jason Stackhouse, a goddamned murderer.
I'd pay good money to watch that boy fry.
He was so cute for a murderer, wonder why he never hit on me.
What's going on?
You're right, I shouldn't have come in today.
Why don't you go to my trailer, lie down?
I need to get out of here.
- It's not safe.
- I'm just gonna drive around.
- I'll keep my doors locked.
I won't even get out of the car.
- No Sookie.
I need some time alone.
I gotta get these thoughts out of my head.
All right, all right, yeah.
I've got your tables.
Thank you, Sam.
- For everything.
- Hey.
Please, Jesus, don't do this to me.
Shoot, darn it!
Son of a mother!
Fudge!
Sookie.
Everything all right?
Just a... a little car trouble, that's all.
Want me to take a look?
Don't tell anybody, but I don't know much about cars.
Sorry.
Thanks for trying.
I...
I guess I should call a tow.
Why don't you let me give you a ride home?
I'll get my buddy Hank at Auto Haven to take a look on my way back.
I... can't be alone.
Course you can't.
How about I give you a ride home, stay with you until Sam gets off work, huh?
I couldn't put you out.
No, no, no, no.
Your brother's been real good to me.
Least I could do.
That's so kind of you, Rene.
Hey Sookie, Rene.
I just wanna say...
I told Andy, I've known killers, and Jason ain't one.
- Thank you, Terry.
- Nobody ever listens to me.
But they should.
Ready?
I can't believe Jason gave you his truck.
He loves this truck.
I know, right?
I tried talking him out of it.
He wasn't hearing it, though.
Buckle up, now.
Thanks.
It's really true?
You can hear what I'm thinking right now?
What do I think about, think about, think about nothing, nothing, think about nothing...
Don't bother.
Thinking about nothing ain't possible.
Trust me, everyone's tried it around me.
Sooner or later you'll think about something.
What's kinda funny, is that...
Your thoughts don't have an accent.
That must be hard on you, livin' with that.
It is hard.
Sometimes.
You have no idea how sick and twisted some people are.
Lord, I can believe that, yes, ma'am.
It's one thing when they think horrible stuff about me,
I mean,
I'm kinda used to it.
But, when it's about my brother...
He's all I've got left.
I mean, I've lost everyone.
Thanks.
I've lost people too, me.
It don't ever get any easier.
But, you find ways to cope.
I thought I told you kids to take out the garbage.
What the hell are you watching?
Oh, my Lord.
Where'd you get this?
Coby?
Lisa, you answer me, right now.
It's Rene's.
We found it in the garage.
Go to your room.
It's hotter in here than hell on a Sunday.
I know, Gran used to leave the windows open all day, but I haven't felt safe doin' that in a while.
Have a seat, I'll fix us some iced teas.
Sounds good.
These fuckers' palates are as backwoods as their brains.
- Sam, Rene left his vest.
- I'll put it in the lost and found.
Hey, where's Sookie?
Did you see her?
- Yeah.
- Where'd she go?
- She left with Rene about 20, 23 minutes ago.
- Rene, you take it sweet?
- Yes, ma'am.
You scared me.
Did I?
Sorry about that.
Don't think about it...
Blood, blood, so much blood...
She wasn't supposed to be here...
Shut up!
- Rene?
- Sookie ain't here?
You weren't supposed to be here.
Sookie.
You all right?
I'm... so jumpy these days.
Let me help you with that.
No, I'm gonna go get a mop.
What do you think you're doin'?
Stay away!
You're not gonna shoot me.
Told you.
She deserves it, needs it, wants to die.
That's why she fucks them fangers...
Fuck.
Goddamn it.
Get back here, you fucking bitch!
Dang it.
There ain't nothing that'll cover up what you have done.
You watching me now?
You freak.
Sookie.
You're the freak, Cindy.
You're the damn freak.
Fuckin' freak.
Fuck!
Spread your legs for a dead man.
Mama'd roll over in her grave...
Get the fuck out of here.
Sookie.
Sookie.
I'll teach you, you bitch!
No, no, what're you doing?
Get away from me!
Get out!
I can feel you in my head!
I thought you were Jason.
Die, fang fucker!
Stay the fuck out of my head!
Sookie.
Sookie.
Sookie.
Come on, Sookie.
Let's be...
Let's be friends.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
We can be friends.
Sookie.
Seriously, I was just kidding.
Can you fuckin' hear me, you filthy fucking cunt?
I'm gonna tear out your throat with my hands and fuck your dead face.
Shit.
Goddamn it.
I must have lost her.
She could be hiding in the woods.
I better go back and check.
Mind-reading, vampire-fucking, freak bitch!
You think you're so smart!
You smart now?
Fuck.
What the fuck are you?
Sookie.
Fuck you, You fuckin' freak fuck!
Fuckin' sick fuck.
Die, you fucking freak of nature!
Die...
Fucking bitch!
Sookie.
I... am... sorry.
No.
No, Bill, please.
We gotta get him out of the light.
Sookie.
Tara.
You look so pretty.
Like someone turned a light on under your skin.
Hospital gave her pain meds.
She's...
She's a little loopy.
Didn't you listen when I said I'd lose my shit if anything ever happened to you?
Don't lose your shit.
I'm fine.
Did Sam tell you that he saved my life?
He turned into a dog and bit Rene.
No shit.
I'm gonna need some of them drugs they gave you.
You guys, we should let her rest.
Sam.
You need to let people see the real you.
'Cause you're kind and brave.
There's nothing there not to love.
Right back at you.
All right then.
Thanks.
DA's dropping the charges.
No.
No fucking way.
He confessed.
The marks on Amy Burley's neck match Rene's belt.
Or Drew Marshall.
Whatever the hell his name is.
He near about put Sookie in a body bag.
We got no reason to hold Stackhouse.
That's horseshit!
Get ahold of yourself.
I don't need you screwing things up even worse.
So, what?
We're just gonna let him go?
Not "we. "
You brought him in.
You let him go.
Right now, Andy.
Oh, hey Andy.
Is there some way I can get a magazine or something?
This shit's putting me to sleep.
- What're you doin'?
- Get out of here.
What?
You heard me.
Get the fuck out of here.
- Is this some kinda trick or something?
- No, you stupid shit.
It ain't a trick.
It's a fucking miracle!
Oh, sweet Jesus, please forgive me.
I had no idea, Sookie, I swear.
- Course you didn't.
- I brought him around my kids.
I slept in the bed with him every night.
And all that time, it was nothin' but lies.
I mean, his name, his accent.
God, you think you know someone.
How could I not know?
None of us did.
- Don't blame yourself, honey.
- I can't help it.
I told you to stay out of my thoughts.
Is that why you didn't listen in on Rene?
It's like he kept that part of himself... locked away in some... dark... corner of his mind.
Oh, God.
Sookie.
I am so sorry.
I want you to promise me something, okay?
Okay.
Someday, if I ever find another man.
I want you to look inside his head and tell me everything that's in there.
Arlene, it doesn't really work that way.
Just promise me, okay?
'Cause I have the worst taste in men.
Is Bill gonna be okay?
I don't think so.
No.
Oh, honey.
Oh, sweet baby.
I'm gonna head on over to the bar.
Make sure Terry ain't P-T-S-Ding all over my clam chowder.
Thanks, Lafayette.
I appreciate you holding down the fort.
No worries, boyfriend. 'Cause I'm gonna hit your ass up for a raise, soon as they pull them stitches out your forehead.
Call me later, T.
Where have you been?
I left you like 5 messages.
I didn't get any messages.
What?
Look, we don't have to talk about this now.
Sookie almost died.
And she would've, if you hadn't been there so.
I'm glad you were, okay?
I was...
I was worried about you.
I'm sure you were.
You worry about everybody.
But Sookie's right, you're an amazing guy.
You deserve to get everything you want.
And so do I.
What does that mean?
Take good care of her.
Wait, Tara...
Maryann, this is my friend Sam.
Sam, this is Maryann.
Sam, it's so nice to meet you.
You ready to go?
What the hell are you doing here?
Did you think I wasn't gonna find you?
You silly, silly dog.
I should've known.
'Cause there were things he liked to do... in bed that no normal man ever does.
Jason.
I've never been happier to see you in my life.
That's nice, but, sweetie, I'm... black and blue all over and you're squeezing me.
Oh, sorry.
Shit, look what that son of a bitch did to you.
I can't believe I gave him my truck.
If he was still alive right now, I'm... fuckin' kill him again.
Excuse me.
- Me and my mouth.
- She'll be all right.
Eventually.
You know, I was sitting in that jail, and I just kept thinkin' about all the stupid stuff I'd done.
That must've kept you busy.
And I know it seems like all I ever think about's myself.
And drinking and chasing women.
But that's only 'cause I thought that's all I was good at.
That's not true.
You were good at football.
Not good enough for a scholarship.
I ain't never been good enough for anything.
Or anybody.
Well, except maybe Amy.
But she's gone, so...
So I was in there, waitin' to die too, and I realized
my life wasn't worth nothing.
I'd never done nothing worth being proud of.
And all I could think to do was to end it.
- Jason...
- No, it's okay.
'Cause then, something happened.
Sook.
I was saved.
I was given a second chance.
And now I know that all this...
this bad stuff that happened, it happened for a reason.
What's that?
I ain't sure yet.
But I do know that I'm meant to do something important with my life.
And soon as I find out what that is,
- I ain't gonna fuck it up.
- That's good.
- I guess.
- Yeah.
I love you, Sook.
And...
I'm gonna take good care of you from now on.
I promise.
How about you just take care of yourself and... stay out of trouble?
Come on, you don't have to worry about me no more.
I'm good.
Why is all fucking garbage on the side of the garbage can?
Nasty motherfuckers.
Got no...
Goddamn home training.
Oh, my God!
Daddy.
Oh, Daddy.
It is you.
I found you.
I found you.
They said you were dead.
But I knew you weren't.
Daddy.
Hold me close...
You're alive?
Well, technically, no.
But I am healed.
I fed.
Would you like to come in?
Yes.
Without my blood it'll take weeks for you to heal.
I don't care.
After everything,
I... just need to feel human right now.
I failed you.
You were willing to sacrifice yourself to save me.
If I'd just been...
My life is too short for all that.
{TWO WEEKS LATER}
Yesterday, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that limiting marriage between only human men and women is unconstitutional, effectively legalizing vampire marriage in the state.
Courthouses will be staying open after dark to accommodate hundreds of couples from all over America.
Oh, my God, you know what this means?
- Now you and Bill can get married.
- Stop it, Arlene.
This isn't Vermont.
Besides, he hasn't even asked me yet.
And I don't know what I'd say if he did.
You should marry Bill.
Hell, I'll even throw you a party.
Won't even break the bank, is all you need is a couple kegs of Tru Blood, seein' as how they don't eat or drink.
Bet there's even a vampire band and vampire wedding decorations.
Put Arlene's party to shame.
You know you're about as subtle as a flying brick?
Maryann says if you want something, you don't wait for it to come to you.
- You demand it...
- Do me a favor, don't quote Maryann to me.
Excuse me for giving a damn.
You heard from your cousin, by any chance?
'Cause I'm about to give away his job.
But this one time Lafayette went to Marthaville for the night.
He ended up go-go dancing in Palm Beach for like 8 months.
Fantastic.
People disappear all the time, but they're never really gone.
The good parts of 'em always stay put.
I hope you're right about that,
Terry.
Your hair's like a sunset after a bomb went off.
Pretty.
And God said,
"Let there be light. "
And there was light.
And even though we stand in darkness today, we shall not fear.
For God has given us the ultimate weapon.
The ultimate salvation!
The sun.
And he has placed in front of us a daunting but righteous task.
We will not falter.
We will not rest.
Until we have brought God's holy light down on each and every bloodsucking abomination!
- Amen.
- Praise Jesus!
Time to pack it up, Andy.
My family used to own this whole damn town.
The land this rat hole stands on included.
You don't own this rat hole no more,
- so I'm cuttin' you off.
- Join the club.
One minute you're a hero, the next you can't get a fuckin' drink.
I ain't never seen a bird fly so high it don't have to come down sometime.
- What's that for?
- It's your pity party.
Only one you're getting from me, so suck it up.
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me.
It's just easier for me not to hate you.
Hating takes a lot of energy.
And I'm saving mine up for all the good shit that's coming my way.
'Cause I am a good person, and I deserve good shit in my life.
Yeah, put it on a bumper sticker.
Thank you, Sookie.
Where's Vampire Bill at tonight?
Is he out celebrating?
Some sort of vampire party?
Actually, we're celebrating together later.
Well, just tell him congratulations from me.
I don't care what nobody says, if I met a nice vampire girl,
- I'd be proud to have her on my arm.
- I'd love to see your mama's face
- if you brought her home for dinner.
- Yeah, me too.
You know, yeah.
I mean, does Bill know anybody my age?
Seriously.
Hi, Daddy.
What is this?
There are favors and there are... favors.
She is extremely annoying.
You can't do this.
We had a deal.
Well, now the terms have changed.
She's yours.
Unless you wanna give me Sookie?
It's just a suggestion.
Though a few nights with this one may change your mind.
Good luck.
So, who's good to eat around here?
He ain't listening to me.
Good luck.
We're closing.
Give me your keys.
I ain't giving you shit, Stackhouse.
I'm a failure.
A pathetic fuckin' loser.
And everybody knows it.
Just like she said they would.
She's real happy with herself.
It don't ever make me happy to see someone in pain.
I'm gonna call your sister to come pick you up.
Detective Bellefleur.
- Where's my car?
- Andy Bellefleur, the only thing you're driving tonight is us crazy.
Portia{ said she's} is on her way to pick you up.
Give me your keys.
I don't have 'em.
Left 'em in the car.
Right here, underneath this light.
- Some son of a bitch stole my car.
- You sure this is where you parked it?
This whole town's gone to shit.
Nobody used to go murdering each other, stealing' cars.
That's what happens when you don't let a good cop do his job.
Ain't that it over there?
That ain't where I parked it.
What the hell?
That ain't mine, I swear.
You know that old leather jacket I wear sometime?
The brown one?
Well, make sure it goes to Hoyt.
I told him it was lucky.
It ain't.
But he don't know that.
Sookie'll get the house.
My bank account.
But I want you to have my truck.
Really?
You've been a good friend, Rene.
Thanks, man.
I'm giving it back though, soon as they let you go.
They ain't never letting me go, Rene.
There's something inside me that's just...
- It's wrong.
- Nah, come on now.
It ain't like you went and killed a bunch a... innocent women.
- What?
- They were fangbangers.
If you hadn't have done it, it was a matter of time.
Wait, are you calling my grandma a fangbanger?
Don't get your back all up, you...
I'm just sayin', you must've had your reasons, that's all.
There ain't no good reason for what I did.
- Yeah, suppose you're right.
- You can't go in there.
He's my brother.
Sorry Sookie, He's only allowed one visitor at a time.
You can either let me by or throw me in there, but I'm gonna see my brother.
- I'm sorry, Sookie.
I'm so sorry.
- You've have nothing to be sorry for.
I wish I got here sooner, before you went and confessed to something you didn't do.
I don't even remember doing any of it.
I just know I did.
Jason, you need to shut up, okay?
'Cause I'm real close to finding out who the real killer is.

True Blood, Season 1, episode 12, Season Finale.
His name's Drew Marshall.
He had a sister named Cindy, and I think he killed her.
Strangled her just like Maudette and Dawn and Amy.
If she knows this, How come she hasn't gone to the cops and gotten Jason out.
'Cause I tried that, and so far the cops have done diddlysquat to protect me and my family.
I don't have any evidence yet.
I ignore what Drew Marshall looks like.
So you can't really be sure he's the killer.
I've seen what's inside his head.
They'll never believe that about him, but it's the truth.
There's all kinds of strangeness in this world.
I know you wanna help me, but that's only 'cause you can't accept the truth.
I'm a murderer.
And I'm going to hell.
Plain and simple.
You aren't hearing me.
I know who the killer is.
And all we gotta do is find him.
- Andy!
Listen to me, don't be stupid.
- Andy!
- What's your problem?
- Make her go away.
Am I your fucking butler?
Please, just get her out of here.
Now, you heard him.
Zoo's closed.
Did you get the fax from the Bunkie police department about Drew Marshall, the man who's probably the real killer?
Never heard of no fax from no Bunkie P.D., or Drew-whoever.
But I'll tell you one thing.
The real killer is right there, where he belongs.
You are one hell of a sorry excuse for a cop and a human being,
Andy Bellefleur, and it's just a matter of time before everyone knows it.
Hi, I'm Tara.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I thought you might be hungry.
Okay, this isn't food.
This is sculpture.
And this place...
You're not really just a social worker, are you?
I'm a lot of things.
- Just like you.
Coffee?
- Sure.
I mean, you're not just a drunk-driving bartender, are you?
You're also intelligent, resourceful.
Strong.
A survivor.
I don't feel like any of those things right now.
I didn't just wreck my car,
I totaled my whole life.
All of it.
Well, I suppose that's one way of looking at it.
Personally, I see your situation as an opportunity.
I just got a fake exorcism and a DUI.
I probably lost my job.
All of my friends.
And my mother disowned me.
I'm sorry, but I don't get how that's an opportunity.
Maybe life has just cleared out all the things that weren't working.
Now you've got room to rebuild.
Decide exactly what you want your life to look like.
And make that happen.
What do you want, Tara?
What do you want your life to be?
I don't know.
I guess I never really let myself want anything.
That breaks my heart.
Yeah, well, there are people a lot worse off than me.
I'm sure.
I should probably let you get back to helping them.
Instead of watching me cry all over your nice breakfast.
I appreciate everything you've done for me.
And I promise to pay back the bail as soon as I can.
Tara, sit down.
You haven't touched your food, your dress isn't dry, and I think we both know you've got nowhere to go.
Please.
I know it's hard for you to trust me, but I really do just wanna help.
Even if that means giving you a place to stay until you figure things out.
- Why would you do that?
- 'Cause it's what I do.
It's what I want my life to be:
helping people.
Not because I feel sorry for you, and not because I want anything back from you.
- Then why?
- Because you deserve a chance.
And I'm in a position to give you one.
Fine, you wanna end this thing, that's fine.
The least you could do is call me back and tell me where the fuck you are so I can stop worrying.
Thanks a lot, I'll talk to you later, bye.
- Sookie, what are you doing here?
- I got the lunch shift.
Yeah, with everything going on with Jason, I figured you'd take the day off.
I'm not staying home and hiding, having people think I'm ashamed of my brother.
Besides, I'm gonna need all the money I can get to hire a private investigator.
Drew Marshall is somewhere in this town.
Who knows how many times he's sat in one of those booths, looked me in right in the eye and ordered a burger and fries.
- Yeah, but wouldn't you have heard him?
- Wouldn't you've smelled him?
I ain't a shortwave radio.
I spend most of my time trying not to listen to people.
- Sorry, I didn't mean...
- It's okay.
I better start my prep.
You can only have five minutes with him.
Five minutes.
Mr. Stackhouse?
- Yeah.
- My name is Orry Dawson.
I told 'em I don't need no lawyer.
I'm not a lawyer.
I'm here on behalf of the Fellowship of the Sun.
That anti-vampire church?
We are a religious organization dedicated to the preservation and salvation of the human race.
Good.
'Cause I thought you just hated vampires.
And I used to, but then I got to know one, and he was a pretty decent guy.
Until I got him killed.
See, that's where you're wrong.
What you did, it was a service to your race and to Jesus.
And you should be proud of that.
- Yeah.
- You know, last year there were over 800 reported vampire-related attacks.
in Louisiana alone.
And the law won't do nothing about it.
They are too busy respecting those fiends and their...
Their civil rights.
Well, what about our rights?
Our rights to be safe in our own neighborhoods, our right to our own blood?
No, I don't know nothing about that.
Look, uh...
Officially, the church can't condone what you did.
You took the lives of four women.
Women who had tainted themselves and their race, but still, human women.
Hey.
But we do recognize that even though your methods may have been flawed, your intentions were pure.
I got no idea what you're talkin' about.
That's smart.
Don't admit to anything.
The church has started up a fund for your defense.
In the meantime, here's something to help you pass the time.
You are a brave soldier, Jason Stackhouse.
Okay.
God loves you.
You...
You will be saved.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I was looking for Maryann.
She'll be right back.
You must be Tara.
Come on in.
I'm Eggs.
Eggs?
It's actually Benedict.
- Benedict Talley, so...
- Eggs Benedict.
Ah, shit, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have laughed.
- My name's screwed up too.
- Tara's a pretty name.
Suits you.
Maryann did...
Didn't tell me she...
She had a...
A boyfriend.
Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm...
I'm just stayin' here till I get back on my feet.
Just like you.
So collecting stray black people, that some kind of hobby of hers?
She was right about you.
You are funny.
Oh, yeah?
- What else she tell you about me?
- Oh, she said...
You crashed your car with a gallon of whiskey in your lap.
It was vodka.
Really cheap vodka.
Hey, I'm...
I'm not judging you.
Believe me, all right.
When Maryann found me I was...
Let's just say, I was a hell of a lot worse off than you.
She's a miracle worker.
You'll see.
Yeah, well, I won't be sticking around that long.
That's too bad.
My mama, when she thought something was too good to be true, she'd...
She'd say, "Satan in a Sunday hat".
That's exactly what this is.
You know, it took me a long time to stop looking over my shoulder too.
But there are good people in this world.
Sometimes... good shit happens.
He don't remember doin' it.
Like he had amnesia or something.
- Hey, Sookie.
- Hey.
Holler if y'all need anything, okay?
Now, he's just sitting there, lookin' like a dog that lost his bone.
And then he says, "I did it.
"I killed those women.
- You were right all along."
- He didn't exactly say that.
You should've seen the look in his eye.
Ice cold.
Like he was talking about road kill.
Excuse me.
Well, thank God you got him, Detective Bellefleur.
Can I buy you a beer?
Show my appreciation?
That's all right, Rosie, I was just doin' my job.
Whole family full of freaks and killers.
Oughta be ashamed to show her face after what her brother did.
Sleazy little manslut, Jason Stackhouse, a goddamned murderer.
I'd pay good money to watch that boy fry.
He was so cute for a murderer, wonder why he never hit on me.
What's going on?
You're right, I shouldn't have come in today.
Why don't you go to my trailer, lie down?
I need to get out of here.
- It's not safe.
- I'm just gonna drive around.
- I'll keep my doors locked.
I won't even get out of the car.
- No Sookie.
I need some time alone.
I gotta get these thoughts out of my head.
All right, all right, yeah.
I've got your tables.
Thank you, Sam.
- For everything.
- Hey.
Please, Jesus, don't do this to me.
Shoot, darn it!
Son of a mother!
Fudge!
Sookie.
Everything all right?
Just a... a little car trouble, that's all.
Want me to take a look?
Don't tell anybody, but I don't know much about cars.
Sorry.
Thanks for trying.
I...
I guess I should call a tow.
Why don't you let me give you a ride home?
I'll get my buddy Hank at Auto Haven to take a look on my way back.
I... can't be alone.
Course you can't.
How about I give you a ride home, stay with you until Sam gets off work, huh?
I couldn't put you out.
No, no, no, no.
Your brother's been real good to me.
Least I could do.
That's so kind of you, Rene.
Hey Sookie, Rene.
I just wanna say...
I told Andy, I've known killers, and Jason ain't one.
- Thank you, Terry.
- Nobody ever listens to me.
But they should.
Ready?
I can't believe Jason gave you his truck.
He loves this truck.
I know, right?
I tried talking him out of it.
He wasn't hearing it, though.
Buckle up, now.
Thanks.
It's really true?
You can hear what I'm thinking right now?
What do I think about, think about, think about nothing, nothing, think about nothing...
Don't bother.
Thinking about nothing ain't possible.
Trust me, everyone's tried it around me.
Sooner or later you'll think about something.
What's kinda funny, is that...
Your thoughts don't have an accent.
That must be hard on you, livin' with that.
It is hard.
Sometimes.
You have no idea how sick and twisted some people are.
Lord, I can believe that, yes, ma'am.
It's one thing when they think horrible stuff about me,
I mean,
I'm kinda used to it.
But, when it's about my brother...
He's all I've got left.
I mean, I've lost everyone.
Thanks.
I've lost people too, me.
It don't ever get any easier.
But, you find ways to cope.
I thought I told you kids to take out the garbage.
What the hell are you watching?
Oh, my Lord.
Where'd you get this?
Coby?
Lisa, you answer me, right now.
It's Rene's.
We found it in the garage.
Go to your room.
It's hotter in here than hell on a Sunday.
I know, Gran used to leave the windows open all day, but I haven't felt safe doin' that in a while.
Have a seat, I'll fix us some iced teas.
Sounds good.
These fuckers' palates are as backwoods as their brains.
- Sam, Rene left his vest.
- I'll put it in the lost and found.
Hey, where's Sookie?
Did you see her?
-Yeah.
- Where'd she go?
- She left with Rene about 20, 23 minutes ago.
- Rene, you take it sweet?
- Yes, ma'am.
You scared me.
Did I?
Sorry about that.
Don't think about it...
Blood, blood, so much blood...
She wasn't supposed to be here...
Shut up!
- Rene?
- Sookie ain't here?
You weren't supposed to be here.
Sookie.
You all right?
I'm... so jumpy these days.
Let me help you with that.
No, I'm gonna go get a mop.
What do you think you're doin'?
Stay away!
You're not gonna shoot me.
Told you.
She deserves it, needs it, wants to die.
That's why she fucks them fangers...
Fuck.
Goddamn it.
Get back here, you fucking bitch!
Dang it.
There ain't nothing that'll cover up what you have done.
You watching me now?
You freak.
Sookie.
You're the freak, Cindy.
You're the damn freak.
Fuckin' freak.
Fuck!
Spread your legs for a dead man.
Mama'd roll over in her grave...
Get the fuck out of here.
Sookie.
Sookie.
I'll teach you, you bitch!
No, no, what're you doing?
Get away from me!
Get out!
I can feel you in my head!
I thought you were Jason.
Die, fang fucker!
Stay the fuck out of my head!
Sookie.
Sookie.
Sookie.
Come on, Sookie.
Let's be...
Let's be friends.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
We can be friends.
Sookie.
Seriously, I was just kidding.
Can you fuckin' hear me, you filthy fucking cunt?
I'm gonna tear out your throat with my hands and fuck your dead face.
Shit.
Goddamn it.
I must have lost her.
She could be hiding in the woods.
I better go back and check.
Mind-reading, vampire-fucking, freak bitch!
You think you're so smart!
You smart now?
Fuck.
What the fuck are you?
Sookie.
Fuck you, You fuckin' freak fuck!
Fuckin' sick fuck.
Die, you fucking freak of nature!
Die...
Fucking bitch!
Sookie.
I... am... sorry.
No.
No, Bill, please.
We gotta get him out of the light.
Sookie.
Tara.
You look so pretty.
Like someone turned a light on under your skin.
Hospital gave her pain meds.
She's...
She's a little loopy.
Didn't you listen when I said I'd lose my shit if anything ever happened to you?
Don't lose your shit.
I'm fine.
Did Sam tell you that he saved my life?
He turned into a dog and bit Rene.
No shit.
I'm gonna need some of them drugs they gave you.
You guys, we should let her rest.
Sam.
You need to let people see the real you.
'Cause you're kind and brave.
There's nothing there not to love.
Right back at you.
All right then.
Thanks.
DA's dropping the charges.
No.
No fucking way.
He confessed.
The marks on Amy Burley's neck match Rene's belt.
Or Drew Marshall.
Whatever the hell his name is.
He near about put Sookie in a body bag.
We got no reason to hold Stackhouse.
That's horseshit!
Get ahold of yourself.
I don't need you screwing things up even worse.
So, what?
We're just gonna let him go?
Not "we."
You brought him in.
You let him go.
Right now, Andy.
Oh, hey Andy.
Is there some way I can get a magazine or something?
This shit's putting me to sleep.
- What're you doin'?
- Get out of here.
What?
You heard me.
Get the fuck out of here.
- Is this some kinda trick or something?
- No, you stupid shit.
It ain't a trick.
It's a fucking miracle!
Oh, sweet Jesus, please forgive me.
I had no idea, Sookie, I swear.
- Course you didn't.
- I brought him around my kids.
I slept in the bed with him every night.
And all that time, it was nothin' but lies.
I mean, his name, his accent.
God, you think you know someone.
How could I not know?
None of us did.
- Don't blame yourself, honey.
- I can't help it.
I told you to stay out of my thoughts.
Is that why you didn't listen in on Rene?
It's like he kept that part of himself... locked away in some... dark... corner of his mind.
Oh, God.
Sookie.
I am so sorry.
I want you to promise me something, okay?
Okay.
Someday, if I ever find another man.
I want you to look inside his head and tell me everything that's in there.
Arlene, it doesn't really work that way.
Just promise me, okay?
'Cause I have the worst taste in men.
Is Bill gonna be okay?
I don't think so.
No.
Oh, honey.
Oh, sweet baby.
I'm gonna head on over to the bar.
Make sure Terry ain't P-T-S-Ding all over my clam chowder.
Thanks, Lafayette.
I appreciate you holding down the fort.
No worries, boyfriend. 'Cause I'm gonna hit your ass up for a raise, soon as they pull them stitches out your forehead.
Call me later, T.
Where have you been?
I left you like 5 messages.
I didn't get any messages.
What?
Look, we don't have to talk about this now.
Sookie almost died.
And she would've, if you hadn't been there so.
I'm glad you were, okay?
I was...
I was worried about you.
I'm sure you were.
You worry about everybody.
But Sookie's right, you're an amazing guy.
You deserve to get everything you want.
And so do I.
What does that mean?
Take good care of her.
Wait, Tara...
Maryann, this is my friend Sam.
Sam, this is Maryann.
Sam, it's so nice to meet you.
You ready to go?
What the hell are you doing here?
Did you think I wasn't gonna find you?
You silly, silly dog.
I should've known.
'Cause there were things he liked to do... in bed that no normal man ever does.
Jason.
I've never been happier to see you in my life.
That's nice, but, sweetie, I'm... black and blue all over and you're squeezing me.
Oh, sorry.
Shit, look what that son of a bitch did to you.
I can't believe I gave him my truck.
If he was still alive right now, I'm... fuckin' kill him again.
Excuse me.
- Me and my mouth.
- She'll be all right.
Eventually.
You know, I was sitting in that jail, and I just kept thinkin' about all the stupid stuff I'd done.
That must've kept you busy.
And I know it seems like all I ever think about's myself.
And drinking and chasing women.
But that's only 'cause I thought that's all I was good at.
That's not true.
You were good at football.
Not good enough for a scholarship.
I ain't never been good enough for anything.
Or anybody.
Well, except maybe Amy.
But she's gone, so...
So I was in there, waitin' to die too, and I realized
my life wasn't worth nothing.
I'd never done nothing worth being proud of.
And all I could think to do was to end it.
- Jason...
- No, it's okay.
'Cause then, something happened.
Sook.
I was saved.
I was given a second chance.
And now I know that all this...
this bad stuff that happened, it happened for a reason.
What's that?
I ain't sure yet.
But I do know that I'm meant to do something important with my life.
And soon as I find out what that is,
- I ain't gonna fuck it up.
- That's good.
- I guess.
- Yeah.
I love you, Sook.
And...
I'm gonna take good care of you from now on.
I promise.
How about you just take care of yourself and... stay out of trouble?
Come on, you don't have to worry about me no more.
I'm good.
Why is all fucking garbage on the side of the garbage can?
Nasty motherfuckers.
Got no...
Goddamn home training.
Oh, my God!
Daddy.
Oh, Daddy.
It is you.
I found you.
I found you.
They said you were dead.
But I knew you weren't.
Daddy.
Hold me close...
You're alive?
Well, technically, no.
But I am healed.
I fed.
Would you like to come in?
Yes.
Without my blood it'll take weeks for you to heal.
I don't care.
After everything,
I... just need to feel human right now.
I failed you.
You were willing to sacrifice yourself to save me.
If I'd just been...
My life is too short for all that.
{\TWO WEEKS LATER}
Yesterday, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that limiting marriage betweenonlyhumanmen and women is unconstitutional, effectively legalizing vampire marriage in the state.
Courthouses will be staying open after dark to accommodate hundreds of couples from all over America.
Oh, my God, you know what this means?
- Now you and Bill can get married.
- Stop it, Arlene.
This isn't Vermont.
Besides, he hasn't even asked me yet.
And I don't know what I'd say if he did.
You should marry Bill.
Hell, I'll even throw you a party.
Won't even break the bank, is all you need is a couple kegs of Tru Blood, seein' as how they don't eat or drink.
Bet there's even a vampire band and vampire wedding decorations.
Put Arlene's party to shame.
You know you're about as subtle as a flying brick?
Maryann says if you want something, you don't wait for it to come to you.
- You demand it...
- Do me a favor, don't quote Maryann to me.
Excuse me for giving a damn.
You heard from your cousin, by any chance?
'Cause I'm about to give away his job.
But this one time Lafayette went to Marthaville for the night.
He ended up go-go dancing in Palm Beach for like 8 months.
Fantastic.
People disappear all the time, but they're never really gone.
The good parts of 'em always stay put.
I hope you're right about that,
Terry.
Your hair's like a sunset after a bomb went off.
Pretty.
And God said,
"Let there be light."
And there was light.
And even though we stand in darkness today, we shall not fear.
For God has given us the ultimate weapon.
The ultimate salvation!
The sun.
And he has placed in front of us a daunting but righteous task.
We will not falter.
We will not rest.
Until we have brought God's holy light down on each and every bloodsucking abomination!
- Amen.
- Praise Jesus!
Time to pack it up, Andy.
My family used to own this whole damn town.
The land this rat hole stands on included.
You don't own this rat hole no more,
- so I'm cuttin' you off.
- Join the club.
One minute you're a hero, the next you can't get a fuckin' drink.
I ain't never seen a bird fly so high it don't have to come down sometime.
- What's that for?
- It's your pity party.
Only one you're getting from me, so suck it up.
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me.
It's just easier for me not to hate you.
Hating takes a lot of energy.
And I'm saving mine up for all the good shit that's coming my way.
'Cause I am a good person, and I deserve good shit in my life.
Yeah, put it on a bumper sticker.
Thank you, Sookie.
Where's Vampire Bill at tonight?
Is he out celebrating?
Some sort of vampire party?
Actually, we're celebrating together later.
Well, just tell him congratulations from me.
I don't care what nobody says, if I met a nice vampire girl,
- I'd be proud to have her on my arm.
- I'd love to see your mama's face
- if you brought her home for dinner.
- Yeah, me too.
You know, yeah.
I mean, does Bill know anybody my age?
Seriously.
Hi, Daddy.
What is this?
There are favors and there are... favors.
She is extremely annoying.
You can't do this.
We had a deal.
Well, now the terms have changed.
She's yours.
Unless you wanna give me Sookie?
It's just a suggestion.
Though a few nights with this one may change your mind.
Good luck.
[talking in a foreign language]
So, who's good to eat around here?
He ain't listening to me.
Good luck.
We're closing.
Give me your keys.
I ain't giving you shit, Stackhouse.
I'm a failure.
A pathetic fuckin' loser.
And everybody knows it.
Just like she said they would.
She's real happy with herself.
It don't ever make me happy to see someone in pain.
I'm gonna call your sister to come pick you up.
Detective Bellefleur.
- Where's my car?
- Andy Bellefleur, the only thing you're driving tonight is us crazy.
Portia{\ said she's} is on her way to pick you up.
Give me your keys.
I don't have 'em.
Left 'em in the car.
Right here, underneath this light.
- Some son of a bitch stole my car.
- You sure this is where you parked it?
This whole town's gone to shit.
Nobody used to go murdering each other, stealing' cars.
That's what happens when you don't let a good cop do his job.
Ain't that it over there?
That ain't where I parked it.
What the hell?
That ain't mine, I swear.
You know that old leather jacket I wear sometime?
The brown one?
Well, make sure it goes to Hoyt.
I told him it was lucky.
It ain't.
But he don't know that.
Sookie'll get the house.
My bank account.
But I want you to have my truck.
Really?
You've been a good friend, Rene.
Thanks, man.
I'm giving it back though, soon as they let you go.
They ain't never letting me go, Rene.
There's something inside me that's just...
- It's wrong.
- Nah, come on now.
It ain't like you went and killed a bunch a... innocent women.
- What?
- They were fangbangers.
If you hadn't have done it, it was a matter of time.
Wait, are you calling my grandma a fangbanger?
Don't get your back all up, you...
I'm just sayin', you must've had your reasons, that's all.
There ain't no good reason for what I did.
- Suppose you're right.
- You can't go in there.
He's my brother.
He's only allowed one visitor at a time.
You can either let me by or throw me in there, but I'm gonna see my brother.
- I'm sorry, Sookie.
I'm so sorry.
- You've have nothing to be sorry for.
I wish I got here sooner, before you went and confessed to something.
I don't even remember doing any of it.
I just know I did.
Jason, you need to shut up, okay?
'Cause I'm real close to finding out who the real killer is.
Transcript:
YYeTs.net
Synchro:
Arrow, mpm
His name's Drew Marshall.
He had a sister named Cindy, and I think he killed her.
Strangled her just like Maudette and Dawn and Amy.
{\If she knows this }How come she hasn't gone to the cops and gotten Jason out.
'Cause I tried that, and so far the cops have done diddlysquat to protect me and my family.
I don't have any evidence yet.
I ignore what Drew Marshall looks like.
So you can't really be sure he's the killer.
I've seen what's inside his head.
They'll never believe that about him, but it's the truth.
There's all kinds of strangeness in this world.
I know you wanna help me, but that's only 'cause you can't accept the truth.
I'm a murderer.
And I'm going to hell.
Plain and simple.
You aren't hearing me.
I know who the killer is.
And all we gotta do is find him.
Listen to me, don't be stupid.
- What's your problem?
- Make her go away.
Am I your fucking butler?
Please, just get her out of here.
Now, you heard him.
Zoo's closed.
Did you get the fax from the Bunkie police department about Drew Marshall, the man who's probably the real killer?
Never heard of no fax from no Bunkie P.D., or Drew-whoever.
But I'll tell you one thing.
The real killer is right there, where he belongs.
You are one hell of a sorry excuse for a cop and a human being,
Andy, and it's just a matter of time before everyone knows it.
Hi, I'm Tara.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I thought you might be hungry.
Okay, this isn't food.
This is sculpture.
And this place...
You're not really just a social worker, are you?
I'm a lot of things.
- Just like you.
Coffee?
- Sure.
I mean, you're not just a drunk-driving bartender, are you?
You're also intelligent, resourceful.
Strong.
A survivor.
I don't feel like any of those things right now.
I didn't just wreck my car,
I totaled my whole life.
All of it.
Well, I suppose that's one way of looking at it.
Personally, I see your situation as an opportunity.
I just got a fake exorcism and a DUI.
I probably lost my job.
All of my friends.
And my mother disowned me.
I'm sorry, but I don't get how that's an opportunity.
Maybe life has just cleared out all the things that weren't working.
Now you've got room to rebuild.
Decide exactly what you want your life to look like.
And make that happen.
What do you want, Tara?
What do you want your life to be?
I don't know.
I guess I never really let myself want anything.
That breaks my heart.
Yeah, well, there are people a lot worse off than me.
I'm sure.
I should probably let you get back to helping them.
Instead of watching me cry all over your nice breakfast.
I appreciate everything you've done for me.
And I promise to pay back the bail as soon as I can.
Tara, sit down.
You haven't touched your food, your dress isn't dry, and I think we both know you've got nowhere to go.
Please.
I know it's hard for you to trust me, but I really do just wanna help.
Even if that means giving you a place to stay until you figure things out.
- Why would you do that?
- 'Cause it's what I do.
It's what I want my life to be:
helping people.
Not because I feel sorry for you, and not because I want anything back from you.
- Then why?
- Because you deserve a chance.
And I'm in a position to give you one.
You wanna end this thing, that's fine.
The least you could do is call me back and tell me where the fuck you are so I can stop worrying.
Thanks a lot, I'll talk to you later, bye.
- What are you doing here?
- I got the lunch shift.
With everything going on with Jason, I figured you'd take the day off.
I'm not staying home and hiding, having people think I'm ashamed.
Besides, I'm gonna need all the money I can get to hire a p.i.
Drew Marshall is somewhere in this town.
Who knows how many times he's sat in one of those booths, looked me in right in the eye and ordered a burger and fries.
- Yeah, but wouldn't you have heard him?
- Wouldn't you've smelled him?
I ain't a shortwave radio.
I spend most of my time trying not to listen.
- Sorry, I didn't mean...
- It's okay.
I better start my prep.
You can only have five minutes with him.
Five minutes.
Mr. Stackhouse?
My name is Orry Dawson.
I told 'em I don't need no lawyer.
I'm not a lawyer.
I'm here on behalf of the Fellowship of the Sun.
That anti-vampire church?
We are a religious organization dedicated to the preservation and salvation of the human race.
Good.
'Cause I thought you just hated vampires.
And I used to, but then I got to know one, and he was a pretty decent guy.
Until I got him killed.
See, that's where you're wrong.
What you did, it was a service to your race and to Jesus.
And you should be proud of that.
Last year there were over 800 reported vampire-related attacks in Louisiana alone.
And the law won't do nothing about it.
They are too busy respecting those fiends and their...
Their civil rights.
What about our rights?
Our rights to be safe in our own neighborhoods, our right to our own blood?
No, I don't know nothing about that.
Look, uh...
Officially, the church can't condone what you did.
You took the lives of four women.
Women who had tainted themselves and their race, but still, human women.
But we do recognize that even though your methods may have been flawed, your intentions were pure.
I got no idea what you're talkin' about.
That's smart.
Don't admit to anything.
The church has started up a fund for your defense.
In the meantime, here's something to help you pass the time.
You are a brave soldier, Jason Stackhouse.
God loves you.
You...
You will be saved.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I was looking for Maryann.
She'll be right back.
You must be Tara.
Come on in.
I'm Eggs.
Eggs?
It's actually Benedict.
- Benedict Talley, so...
- Eggs Benedict.
Ah, shit, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have laughed.
- My name's screwed up too.
- Tara's a pretty name.
Suits you.
Maryann did...
Didn't tell me she...
She had a...
A boyfriend.
I'm...
I'm just stayin' here till I get back on my feet.
Just like you.
So collecting stray black people, that some kind of hobby of hers?
She was right about you.
You are funny.
- What else she tell you about me?
- She said...
You crashed your car with a gallon of whiskey in your lap.
It was vodka.
Really cheap vodka.
I'm...
I'm not judging you.
Believe me, all right.
When Maryann found me I was...
Let's just say, I was a hell of a lot worse off than you.
She's a miracle worker.
You'll see.
Yeah, well, I won't be sticking around that long.
That's too bad.
My mama, when she thought something was too good to be true, she'd...
She'd say, "Satan in a Sunday hat".
That's exactly what this is.
You know, it took me a long time to stop looking over my shoulder too.
But there are good people in this world.
Sometimes... good shit happens.
He don't remember doin' it.
Like he had amnesia or something.
Holler if y'all need anything, okay?
Now, he's just sitting there, lookin' like a dog that lost his bone.
And then he says, "I did it.
"I killed those women.
- You were right all along."
- He didn't exactly say that.
You should've seen the look in his eye.
Ice cold.
Like he was talking about road kill.
Excuse me.
Well, thank God you got him, Detective Bellefleur.
Can I buy you a beer?
Show my appreciation?
That's all right, Rosie, I was just doin' my job.
Whole family full of freaks and killers.
Oughta be ashamed to show her face after what her brother did.
Sleazy little manslut, Jason Stackhouse, a goddamned murderer.
I'd pay good money to watch that boy fry.
He was so cute for a murderer, wonder why he never hit on me.
What's going on?
You're right, I shouldn't have come in today.
Why don't you go to my trailer, lie down?
I need to get out of here.
- It's not safe.
- I'm just gonna drive around.
I'll keep my doors locked.
I won't even get out of the car.
I need some time alone.
I gotta get these thoughts out of my head.
All right, all right, yeah.
I've got your tables.
Thank you, Sam.
For everything.
Please, Jesus, don't do this to me.
Shoot, darn it!
Son of a mother!
Fudge!
Evything all right?
Just a... a little car trouble, that's all.
Want me to take a look?
Don't tell anybody, but I don't know much about cars.
Sorry.
Thanks for trying.
I...
I guess I should call a tow.
Why don't you let me give you a ride home?
I'll get my buddy Hank at Auto Haven to take a look on my way back.
I can't be alone.
Course you can't.
How'bout I give you a ride home, stay with you until Sam gets off work?
I couldn't put you out.
Your brother's been real good to me.
Least I could do.
That's so kind of you, Rene.
I just wanna say...
I told Andy, I've known killers, and Jason ain't one.
- Thank you, Terry.
- Nobody ever listens to me.
But they should.
Ready?
I can't believe Jason gave you his truck.
He loves this truck.
I know, right?
I tried talking him out of it.
He wasn't hearing it, though.
Buckle up, now.
Thanks.
It's really true?
You can hear what I'm thinking right now?
What do I think about, think about, think about nothing, nothing, think about nothing...
Don't bother.
Thinking about nothing ain't possible.
Trust me, everyone's tried it around me.
Sooner or later you'll think about something.
What's kinda funny, is that...
Your thoughts don't have an accent.
That must be hard on you, livin' with that.
It is hard.
Sometimes.
You have no idea how sick and twisted some people are.
Lord, I can believe that, yes, ma'am.
It's one thing when they think horrible stuff about me,
I mean,
I'm kinda used to it.
But, when it's about my brother...
He's all I've got left.
I mean, I've lost everyone.
Thanks.
I've lost people too.
It don't ever get any easier.
But, you find ways to cope.
I thought I told you kids to take out the garbage.
What the hell are you watching?
Oh, my Lord.
Where'd you get this?
Coby?
Lisa, you answer me, right now.
It's Rene's.
We found it in the garage.
Go to your room.
It's hotter in here than hell on a Sunday.
I know, Gran used to leave the windows open all day, but I haven't felt safe doin' that in a while.
Have a seat, I'll fix us some iced teas.
Sounds good.
These fuckers' palates are as backwoods as their brains.
- Rene left his vest.
- I'll put it in the lost and found.
Hey, where's Sookie?
Did you see her?
- Where'd she go?
- She left with Rene about 20, 23 minutes ago.
- Rene, you take it sweet?
- Yes, ma'am.
You scared me.
Did I?
Sorry about that.
Don't think about it...
Blood, blood, so much blood...
She wasn't supposed to be here...
Shut up!
- Rene?
- Sookie ain't here?
You weren't supposed to be here.
You all right?
I'm... so jumpy these days.
Let me help you with that.
I'm gonna go get a mop.
What do you think you're doin'?
Stay away!
You're not gonna shoot me.
Told you.
She deserves it, needs it, wants to die.
That's why she fucks them fangers...
Fuck.
Goddamn it.
Get back here, you fucking bitch!
Dang it.
Nothing that'll cover up what you done.
You watching me now?
You freak.
You're the freak, Cindy.
You're the damn freak.
Fuckin' freak.
Fuck!
Spread your legs for a dead man.
Mama'd roll over in her grave...
Get the fuck out of here.
Sookie.
I'll teach you, you bitch!
What're you doing?
Get away from me!
Get out!
I can feel you in my head!
I thought you were Jason.
Die, fang fucker!
Stay the fuck out of my head!
Come on, Sookie.
Let's be...
Let's be friends.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
We can be friends.
Sookie.
Seriously, I was just kidding.
Can you fuckin' hear me, you filthy fucking cunt?
I'm gonna tear out your throat with my hands and fuck your dead face.
Shit.
Goddamn it.
I must have lost her.
Could be hiding in the woods.
I better go back and check.
Mind-reading, vampire-fucking, freak bitch!
You think you're so smart!
You smart now?
What the fuck are you?
You fuckin' freak fuck!
Fuckin' sick fuck.
Die, you fucking freak of nature!
Die...
Fucking bitch!
I... am... sorry.
No, Bill, please.
We gotta get him out of the light.
You look so pretty.
Like someone turned a light on under your skin.
Hospital gave her pain meds.
She's...
She's a little loopy.
Didn't you listen when I said I'd lose my shit if anything ever happened to you?
Don't lose your shit.
I'm fine.
Did Sam tell you that he saved my life?
He turned into a dog and bit Rene.
No shit.
I'm gonna need some of them drugs they gave you.
You guys, we should let her rest.
You need to let people see the real you.
'Cause you're kind and brave.
There's nothing there not to love.
Right back at you.
All right then.
Thanks.
DA's dropping the charges.
No.
No fucking way.
He confessed.
The marks on Amy Burley's neck match Rene's belt.
Or Drew Marshall.
Whatever the hell his name is.
He near about put Sookie in a body bag.
We got no reason to hold Stackhouse.
That's horseshit!
Get ahold of yourself.
I don't need you screwing things up even worse.
So, what?
We're just gonna let him go?
Not "we."
You brought him in.
You let him go.
Right now, Andy.
Is there some way I can get a magazine?
This shit's putting me to sleep.
- What're you doin'?
- Get out of here.
What?
You heard me.
Get the fuck out of here.
- Is this some kinda trick or something?
- No, you stupid shit.
It ain't a trick.
It's a fucking miracle!
Oh, sweet Jesus, please forgive me.
I had no idea, Sookie, I swear.
- Course you didn't.
- I brought him around my kids.
I slept in the bed with him every night.
And all that time, it was nothin' but lies.
I mean, his name, his accent.
God, you think you know someone.
How could I not know?
None of us did.
- Don't blame yourself, honey.
- I can't help it.
I told you to stay out of my thoughts.
Is that why you didn't listen in on Rene?
It's like he kept that part of himself... locked away in some... dark... corner of his mind.
Oh, God.
I am so sorry.
I want you to promise me something, okay?
Okay.
Someday, if I ever find another man.
I want you to look inside his head and tell me everything that's in there.
Arlene, it doesn't really work that way.
Just promise me, okay?
'Cause I have the worst taste in men.
Is Bill gonna be okay?
I don't think so.
Oh, honey.
Oh, sweet baby.
I'm gonna head on over to the bar.
Make sure Terry ain't P-T-S-Ding all over my clam chowder.
Thanks, Lafayette.
I appreciate you holding down the fort.
No worries, boyfriend. 'Cause I'm gonna hit your ass up for a raise, soon as they pull them stitches out your forehead.
Call me later, T.
Where have you been?
I left you like 5 messages.
I didn't get any messages.
What?
Look, we don't have to talk about this now.
Sookie almost died.
And she would've, if you hadn't been there.
I'm glad you were, okay?
I was...
I was worried about you.
I'm sure you were.
You worry about everybody.
But Sookie's right, you're an amazing guy.
You deserve to get everything you want.
And so do I.
What does that mean?
Take good care of her.
Wait, Tara...
Maryann, this is my friend Sam.
Sam, this is Maryann.
Sam, it's so nice to meet you.
You ready to go?
What the hell are you doing here?
Did you think I wasn't gonna find you?
You silly, silly dog.
I should've known.
'Cause there were things he liked to do... in bed that no normal man ever does.
I've never been happier to see you in my life.
That's nice, but, sweetie, I'm... black and blue all over and you're squeezing me.
Sorry.
Shit, look what that son of a bitch did to you.
I can't believe I gave him my truck.
If he was still alive right now, I'm... fuckin' kill him again.
Excuse me.
- Me and my mouth.
- She'll be all right.
Eventually.
You know, I was sitting in that jail, and I just kept thinkin' about all the stupid stuff I'd done.
That must've kept you busy.
And I know it seems like all I ever think about's myself.
And drinking and chasing women.
But that's only 'cause I thought that's all I was good at.
That's not true.
You were good at football.
Not good enough for a scholarship.
I ain't never been good enough for anything.
Or anybody.
Well, except maybe Amy.
But she's gone, so...
So I was in there, waitin' to die too, and I realized
my life wasn't worth nothing.
I'd never done nothing worth being proud of.
And all I could think to do was to end it.
- Jason...
- No, it's okay.
'Cause then, something happened.
I was saved.
I was given a second chance.
And now I know that all this...
this bad stuff that happened, it happened for a reason.
What's that?
I ain't sure yet.
But I do know that I'm meant to do something important with my life.
And soon as I find out what that is,
- I ain't gonna fuck it up.
- That's good.
- I guess.
- Yeah.
I love you, Sook.
And...
I'm gonna take good care of you from now on.
I promise.
How about you just take care of yourself and... stay out of trouble?
Come on, you don't have to worry about me no more.
I'm good.
Why is all fucking garbage on the side of the garbage can?
Nasty motherfuckers.
Got no...
Goddamn home training.
Oh, my God!
Daddy.
Oh, Daddy.
It is you.
I found you.
I found you.
They said you were dead.
But I knew you weren't.
Daddy.
Hold me close...
You're alive?
Technically, no.
But I am healed.
I fed.
Would you like to come in?
Without my blood it'll take weeks for you to heal.
I don't care.
After everything,
I... just need to feel human right now.
I failed you.
You were willing to sacrifice yourself to save me.
If I'd just been...
My life is too short for all that.
{\TWO WEEKS LATER}
Yesterday, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that limiting marriage betweenonlyhumanmen and women is unconstitutional, effectively legalizing vampire marriage in the state.
Courthouses will be staying open after dark to accommodate hundreds of couples from all over America.
Oh, my God, you know what this means?
- Now you and Bill can get married.
- Stop it, Arlene.
This isn't Vermont.
Besides, he hasn't even asked me yet.
And I don't know what I'd say if he did.
You should marry Bill.
Hell, I'll even throw you a party.
Won't even break the bank, is all you need is a couple kegs of Tru Blood, seein' as how they don't eat or drink.
Bet there's even a vampire band and vampire wedding decorations.
Put Arlene's party to shame.
You know you're about as subtle as a flying brick?
Maryann says if you want something, you don't wait for it to come to you.
- You demand it...
- Do me a favor, don't quote Maryann to me.
Excuse me for giving a damn.
You heard from your cousin, by any chance?
'Cause I'm about to give away his job.
But this one time Lafayette went to Marthaville for the night.
He ended up go-go dancing in Palm Beach for like 8 months.
Fantastic.
People disappear all the time, but they're never really gone.
The good parts of 'em always stay put.
I hope you're right about that,
Terry.
Your hair's like a sunset after a bomb went off.
Pretty.
And God said,
"Let there be light."
And there was light.
And even though we stand in darkness today, we shall not fear.
For God has given us the ultimate weapon.
The ultimate salvation!
The sun.
And he has placed in front of us a daunting but righteous task.
We will not falter.
We will not rest.
Until we have brought God's holy light down on each and every bloodsucking abomination!
- Amen.
- Praise Jesus!
Time to pack it up, Andy.
My family used to own this whole damn town.
The land this rat hole stands on included.
You don't own this rat hole no more,
- so I'm cuttin' you off.
- Join the club.
One minute you're a hero, the next you can't get a fuckin' drink.
I ain't never seen a bird fly so high it don't have to come down sometime.
- What's that for?
- It's your pity party.
Only one you're getting from me, so suck it up.
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me.
It's just easier for me not to hate you.
Hating takes a lot of energy.
And I'm saving mine up for all the good shit that's coming my way.
'Cause I am a good person, and I deserve good shit in my life.
Yeah, put it on a bumper sticker.
Thank you, Sookie.
Where's Vampire Bill at tonight?
Is he out celebrating?
Some sort of vampire party?
Actually, we're celebrating together later.
Just tell him congratulations from me.
I don't care what nobody says, if I met a nice vampire girl,
- I'd be proud to have her on my arm.
- I'd love to see your mama's face
- if you brought her home for dinner.
- Yeah, me too.
You know, yeah.
I mean, does Bill know anybody my age?
Seriously.
Hi, Daddy.
What is this?
There are favors and there are... favors.
She is extremely annoying.
You can't do this.
We had a deal.
Now the terms have changed.
She's yours.
Unless you wanna give me Sookie?
It's just a suggestion.
Though a few nights with this one may change your mind.
Good luck.
Who's good to eat around here?
He ain't listening to me.
Good luck.
We're closing.
Give me your keys.
I ain't giving you shit, Stackhouse.
I'm a failure.
A pathetic fuckin' loser.
And everybody knows it.
Just like she said they would.
She's real happy with herself.
It don't ever make me happy to see someone in pain.
I'm gonna call your sister to come pick you up.
Detective Bellefleur.
- Where's my car?
- Andy Bellefleur, the only thing you're driving tonight is us crazy.
Portia{\ said she's} is on her way to pick you up.
Give me your keys.
I don't have 'em.
Left 'em in the car.
Right here, underneath this light.
- Some son of a bitch stole my car.
- You sure this is where you parked it?
This whole town's gone to shit.
Nobody used to go murdering each other, stealing' cars.
That's what happens when you don't let a good cop do his job.
Ain't that it over there?
That ain't where I parked it.
What the hell?
That ain't mine, I swear.
I'm...

I'm on my way up.
Now I'm inside your room.
Ton, we should break up, I'm already with someone else.
Hey man, you know you can't ride past us without saying, hi!
Deaw, we agreed not to cause any trouble today?
Let's go!
Come on hurry up!
Hurry up and step on it!
Hey, where do you think you're going, get over here right now!
You guys are out of control!
Huh?
What did you say?
Don't you think you guys are going too far?
Too far?
What do you mean, Pink?
What you guys...
Please...
Please don't hurt me!
I...
I...
I got to go visit my dad in the hospital.
Visit your father?
So you think that you are cool, getting us expelled?
I don't know anything about that.
I just wanted my notebook back.
What the hell kind of dumb ass excuse is that?
You know, opening a person's bag without permission is stealing!
If you only wanted your book, why didn't you just take it.
But when you saw the weed,
Why did you rat us out to the principle?
But I really didn't know that there was a teacher standing behind me.
Oh really?
You really didn't know huh?
- You didn't know huh?
- I bet you know now!
Please...
Please stop hurting me!
I'm so sorry!
You know what?
I think tomorrow you should leave.
And don't ever let me see your stinking ugly face here again!
Have I made myself perfectly clear?
You god damn loser!
What a piece of shit man!
You know what they do with trash?
Hey loser!
They either bury trash or burn it!
But in your case,
I think should be burned!
Hey!
You better make yourself disappear!
Transfer to another school or something.
If you don't want to be burned alive.
Don't ever let us see your face again!
Got it?
Hey!
Over here!
Look...
Here goes your bicycle!
It's a damn pity.
Your bike is over there.
You should go fetch it!
Hey man, why not just let him fall all the way over?
Damn!
Man, he almost fell over for real!
If he fell over, he'd hit the ground like a lump of shit!
Whoa!
Fucking shit man, that was close!
You can all stop betting.
The banker wins with a natural 9.
Banker cleans house!
Everyone pay up!
You want the shirt off my back too?
- Your shirt!
?
- Here just take it all man.
Hey chill out, don't get angry.
Hey, did you mark these cards?
Of course they're marked, how do you think I win all the time?
Hey, what kind of a face card is this?
Dude, that's a joker!
I forgot to take it out... sorry.
Deaw
Hey if Ngid really got hurt, I really hope your dad will be able to help us out again.
Hey, Pink why do you even bring that up?
I think he's probably doing ok.
He probably dropped out of school by now.
You know, we need to stop smoking so much weed.
My dad yelled at me about this already.
If Ngid didn't find the weed, everything would be ok now.
Damn it!
He's better off dead!
Actually you know what?
Yesterday I saw his bike.
Yesterday afternoon while on my way home
His bike was still here.
But I didn't see him anywhere around.
Speak of the Devil!
Do you have a problem or something?
You want a piece of me?
So, the last time wasn't painful enough?
That's enough already!
You might really kill him this time!
Don't get in my way Pink!
You are all animals that deserve to die!
Yo, don't move!
Yo!
What the hell are you laughing at?
No!
Not me!
Go away.
Get away from me!
No!
Not me!
Deaw, what the hell are we going to do now?
Let's ditch this place and get out of here!
Go on!
Get out of here!
There's no time to grab anything!
Get out!
Move your ass!
What are we going to do?
Let's go to the hospital!
- Start the car damn it!
Let's go!
- Where's the nearest hospital?
On the ground floor of my apartment, there is a clinic.
That's the nearest one, let's just go there!
- Let's go!
Hurry!
- Come on!
Go already!
Yo
Here?
No!
No!
Not here, the next street!
Turn left on this street!
Ok!
Ok!
Yo!
Yo!
Tood, get your ass out of the car!
Come on!
Get out!
Yo!
How the hell am I going to explain this to her parents?
I think we better call the police!
Shit, there's a dead body downstairs!
That's our friend down there!
What the fuck is going on?
Damn it!
This is crazy!
Did u see Yogurt's face when she looked into the book?
And...
Ngid's horrified look on his face right before he fell out of the window...
Man, I got something to tell you all!
I saw
I saw
Saw what?
I saw...
I saw him doing...
You saw him doing what?
Hey, what if somebody sees us?
That's good!
It's more exciting that way.
And if it was one of the professors?
That's even better and even more exciting.
Hey do you hear that, over there?
Girl, I think you're hearing things?
Stop!
Listen for yourself!
Who the hell is reciting prayers around here!
?
No, Bon I am not in the mood anymore.
Who the hell is that?
Whoever looks into your eyes will be cursed to die!
Shit man don't tell me that
Ngid was playing with black magic!
Probably to get us back for what we did to him.
His dad is an undertaker.
That would probably make sense of all this!
Or...
Or what?
Maybe the paper was cursed!
He probably took pictures of people who died with their eyes open and created a curse.
When you look at the picture, you are doomed to die.
I think it is written something like...
Hey!
What's This?
Something like..."I see you now"
I see you now
Why the hell are all of you staring at me?
Deaw, don't look at it!
I didn't mean to...
I am sorry...
Is this what you call being burned alive?
Well, if you expect me to believe the testimony that you gave to us that would be difficult.
You're going to tell me that all of your friends died because of this book!
And I've assigned someone to contact your parents.
They should be here soon.
Please, wait here until they arrive.
Don't go anywhere.
We will be right back.
Ummm, would you like something to eat?
Pink
Look at me, look straight into my eyes!
Are we not part of the same gang?
Yeah, are we not all friends, Pink?
Pink, we are waiting for you?
Pink, come join us.
Pink come on give me your hand.
So we can be together.
You don't like us anymore?
It's your turn now.
No!
I don't have anything to do with all this!
The deadly curse was invoked when he used pictures of people who died with their eyes open, in the ritual of black magic.
I never did anything to you.
I was never involved in anything that happened.
That's right you didn't do anything, except stand idly by and watched.
And now...
This is what I want you to see.
Come on.
Look!
No, I don't want to look!
I didn't do anything to you.
I was never involved.
There is no way out of this.
Just take a look.
You're going to die anyways.
Just look, so you can die and we can end this now!
Open your eyes!
Take a Look!
I told you to open your eyes!
And look!
We have a man down in the bathroom, we need backup right away!
Arrest him right now!
Watch out, he's got a gun!
Just stay here, no need to...
You don't need to worry about me anymore.
They can't hurt me anymore.
You can no longer take me away.
"I see you now! "
Hey, are you guys sleepy yet?
Why, what's up?
Have you ever heard the myth about sleeping in the jungle?
They say when you go camping you should never sleep on the edge.
How come?
Our punk ass friend Tiea once told me a story when he went camping and ended up sleeping on the edge.
When night fell, he heard the sounds of footsteps of a person walking towards him.
Then he felt as if someone was brushing up against his leg.
He was so startled that he sat up in his sleeping bag.
And you know what he saw...
A succubus!
A female ghost?
Sitting at the end of his feet.
Was she Hot?
Yeah, she looked really hot man, only if...
Dude, what a pervert, I haven't even finished my story yet and here you are changing the subject.
Now where was I...
Tiea, told me that
It was definitely a woman with very long hair covering her face.
Pale white complexion.
Just sitting there at the end of his feet.
So what did Tiea do?
What the hell do you think Tiea could do?
He just lay there with his eyes closed waiting for the sun to rise.
And you know what he did that very next day?
He shared his ordeal with one of the park rangers there.
The park ranger confessed to him that some time ago...
A woman accidentally drowned!
And do you know what?
The place where you are sleeping Shin, right here, is the exact same spot!
- Holy Shit... now you're in trouble.
- Man, that's scary!
My hairs are even standing on end.
Dude, don't talk about ghosts while we are here in the middle of the jungle.
- We better get some sleep.
- Hey hold on a sec.
Have you guys ever wondered why do all ghosts always have to be female with long hair covering their face and eyes?
Every time I watch a movie, it's the same old story.
- Have you ever seen the movie "Shutter"?
- You Asshole!
No I haven't seen "Shutter" yet, so don't spoil the ending for me.
You've never seen "Shutter"?
At the end of the story...
The ghost is sitting on the guy's shoulders.
- You are so full of it!
- No seriously!
- That's why his shoulders always hurt.
- That's enough!
I don't believe there are such things as ghosts.
When I was a guide, I brought some people kayaking.
I slept alone in the jungle.
I didn't see a damn thing!
You see, Shin you think too much.
Retard...
Real or not real, it really doesn't matter to me right now.
I am just scared.
For arguments sake
If one out of the four of us was to accidentally die.
Would you guys be scared?
If one of us died, I wouldn't be scared.
I think I would be more afraid if I was to die.
What a bastard man.
Seriously though
I think... if one of us were to die and it turned out to be Shin over here.
I think that would be the most horrifying.
How come?
Well just take a look at his face.
Even when he is alive he is scary!
Oh please...
Mr. handsome.
Mr. most good-looking jerk ass!
Why are you standing up?
- Because?
- Hey, Ter and Puak
Move aside so I can sleep in the middle.
You got to be joking, don't tell me you really are scared?
Well if you are so brave then why don't you sleep on the edge?
I am not scared, I'm just too damn lazy to move my ass.
Come on Ter
Ter
If you're not scared then just let me sleep in your spot.
What I meant was that I wouldn't be scared if one of us was a ghost.
But if I saw a ghost, hell yeah I would be scared.
Come on!
Please just let me sleep somewhere in the middle.
Man what is your problem?
Go back to sleep!
Hey can you assholes just stop acting so childish.
Let's just all go to sleep, I am really sleepy now.
Yeah...
Aey is sleepy, so shut up and go to sleep already.
Hey, I swear if I die
I'm going to come back and haunt whoever sleeps in the middle first.
Amen man!
May all your prayers come true!
Did you brush?
You breath stinks!
Just keep our raft going down this general heading.
By the time we reach our camping grounds, it will be almost evening time.
Shin, why the hell are u looking at that damn compass anyway?
Can't you see that the river flows in only one direction!
It's not like we can turn towards some other direction.
I thought it would come in handy.
You numbskull, just put it away.
I'm the king of the world!
Oh Please...
Puak, are you a retard too?
Why are you shouting?
Don't you remember Jack Dawson.
Haven't you ever watched the movie "Titanic"?
Jack was standing at the front of the boat when he screamed,
I'm the king of the world!
Puak, you're an idiot!
You're going to make the raft capsize.
No, I just want to be Jack.
Shin, don't tell me that you don't even know that the Titanic sank?
I haven't seen that movie yet.
What!
You haven't seen Titanic yet?
Did you know at the end of the movie, Rose is sitting on Jack's shoulders too.
Shutter, they copied the idea from Titanic.
- Really?
Are you serious?
- Yes of course it's true.
Titanic was the first to come up with the idea decades ago.
Damn Thai movies.
Aren't there any VDO stores around your house?
Heads Up!
It's time to rock n' roll!
Yeahhhhh...
Here were go!
Man, what a ride!
Shin, you got to help us paddle.
Puak you idiot!
Puak don't stand up!
Sit down before the raft flips over!
Puak!
Puak don't stand up!
Puak sit your ass down!
Puak!
Ter!
Help!
Shin?
Puak?
Shin?
Puak?
You guys ok?
OK, how about you?
Where the hell is Ter?
Oh yeah!
Where is Ter?
Ter!
Ter!
Ter!
Shit!
Ter, doesn't know how to swim very well.
Yeah...
So where is he?
- Ter!
- Damn!
Oh Shit!
Ter!
Help!
Ter!
Ter!
Ter!
Aey, Hurry up!
Help!
Ter, don't struggle!
Ter, stop struggling, you are pulling me down!
Help!
- Help!
- Ter, don't struggle!
Aey, be careful!
Oh!
Fuck!
Where are they?
Aey!
Ter!
Aey!
Where did they go?
Aey!
Ter!
There is Ter!
You're ok, I got you!
It's OK.
Sit down.
You're alright?
You're ok right?
Where is Aey?
- Aey, where is he?
- Aey!
- Aey!
- Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey, where the hell are you?
Aey!
Do you think he is ok?
Yeah I think he is ok.
Hey, don't worry!
You are probably more stressed than he is right now.
Why the fuck are you even crying?
You don't even know if Aey is even dead yet.
If we find out for sure that he is dead, then you can cry.
But we already looked for him everywhere!
Hey don't think too much.
Tomorrow when we get out of the jungle, we can notify the park rangers to help us search for him again.
Tonight we better get some sleep.
Trust me tomorrow we have a long hike ahead of us.
Good night.
I'm gonna go to sleep now.
Ter, c'mon get some sleep.
What's wrong Ter, why don't you lay down and sleep?
Why aren't you sleeping in the same spot as before?
What do you mean by "the same spot"?
Last night I slept next to Aey.
So tonight I should get to sleep on the edge.
Oh Please...
just pick a spot anywhere and go to sleep.
It's getting late damn it.
Ter, don't tell me that you are thinking about what Aey said to us.
What the hell are you talking about?
What he said about what he would do if he died?
He said he would come back and haunt the person in the middle first.
You bastard!
Aey isn't dead yet, you idiot!
Stop being retarded!
We will find him tomorrow, so just go to sleep will you?
If you are not scared then why don't you sleep in the middle?
Oh Man...
Shin!
Your feet really stink!
My feet don't smell.
The stench of your feet is damn strong.
Get them away from me.
Why did you to take a whiff of my feet?
Did you hear that?
What?
What noise?
It sounds like... someone is walking towards us.
Who's there?
Aey is that you?
Aey?
Aey?
Aey!
Aey you bastard, it's you!
We thought you were dead.
Aey, so what happened to you?
Shin, grab a towel and dry him off.
Sure.
Hey buddy are you ok?
Are you hurt anywhere?
How did you survive anyways?
I feel cold!
If he feels cold then dry him off, man.
Ok!
Aey go and change out of those wet clothes before you get sick.
I spent a lot of time looking for you.
We're happy to have you back.
It's amazing you survived.
You are so damn lucky man!
That's for sure.
Damn lucky!
Hey, where are you going?
I need a smoke.
Me too.
Where is your cigarette?
Yeah, I thought so.
You feel like something strange is going on here?
- Like what?
- Shit man!
Can you talk a little quieter?
I'm talking about Aey.
What about Aey?
What kind of person can be underwater for that long and not drown?
The fact he is ok is a blessing.
So stop thinking so negatively.
Aey.
Are you alright?
Aey?
Are you ok?
Aey?
Aey?
Aey!
Aey!
What's happening to you?
Huh?
What the hell are you doing out here, you don't smoke?
I'm starting today.
Hey take it easy.
You're way too old to act like a bad boy.
Ter.
Are you thinking, what I am thinking?
What the fuck is wrong with both of you?
Puak...
What if Aey did die already?
Dead?
That's fucking impossible...
Who the hell is in that tent then?
Shit man have you ever seen the movie The Sixth Sense?
Why?
The movie is about people who didn't know that they were dead already.
Really?
And why are you telling me this?
I didn't watch that movie yet.
Too Bad!
Now you know how I feel.
I think Aey came back to haunt you, Ter.
You are the jerk that caused him to drown.
Hey, don't talk shit like that.
I think he came back to haunt you because you cursed him to die!
What?
But you just told me that he isn't even dead yet?
I am just kidding... you idiot!
Hey you guys think Aey is really dead, don't you?
I don't know, I could be thinking too much.
I think so, you guys think way too much.
I need to take a piss.
Well you better take a piss somewhere far away from the tent.
It's bad enough that Shin's feet already stink up the place.
I wanna go too.
Ter, why don't you take Aey with you?
Hey buddy
Do you realize that you are sweating a lot?
Are you Ok?
You're not feeling cold anymore are you?
If you're feeling better, that's good.
Oh Shit!
Snake!
I'm so fucked man!
What the hell is the matter with you, Ter?
Aey, he's dead already!
HUH!
Aey, he is dead!
Do you know what you are saying?
Look, here he comes.
What the hell, Ter?
Aey, he's dead, I saw his body.
Man if you are joking around, this isn't funny at all!
I'm not shitting you!
I just saw his body floating in the river.
You're out of your mind.
SHIT!
Ter, don't let go!
- What the fuck is wrong with you people?
- Aey!
- Puak, don't open it?
- Puak, Don't!
- Puak, Aey!
- But it's cold out there.
You guys are acting really retarded.
Holy Shit!
Why didn't you fucking stop me?
I don't think what we are doing is right?
Remember, he is our friend.
But he is a ghost now.
I can never be friends with a ghost!
Aey.
Leave us alone.
You're dead!
Do you hear me?
Aey.
You think he's gone?
Puak, go and take a look.
Why me?
Puak, just go man!
Asshole!
I think he is really gone.
Damn it, where are my glasses?
Has Aey really gone?
Not sure, maybe.
How the hell are we going to get down from here?
Well how did we get up here in the first place?
Hey... this way man.
Where the hell is it?
Who's that?
Who ever the hell is there, just tell me who you are!
It's me.
Puak...
Fuck man, you really scared me!
There's nothing to be fucking scared of.
Just open your eyes.
Here you go.
You bastard.
Why didn't you hand it to me sooner?
Hey, Ter.
Shin...
Puak!
Hurry man!
Shit!
It's Aey's body.
Shit Man!
What are we going to do now?
I think we better get the hell out of here and let the park rangers come and retrieve his body tomorrow.
Don't tell me you are going to take Aey's body with us, aren't you?
Let's just go!
Aey, I am sorry.
Wait a second.
Now what?
Let's just hurry and get out of here.
Aey!
What the hell are you doing, screaming out his name?
Aey!
What the hell are you yelling his name out for?
I am calling him over so I can show him his dead body.
This way he will realize that he is dead already and won't keep haunting us like this.
Aey!
Aey!
Come on out where ever you are.
Aey, you are dead!
So don't bother us anymore.
Here look, this is your dead body.
Look at it!
Ter!
Ter!
Look!
So what, are we dead or are we alive?
Puak!
Damn it, the twist is just like in the movie "The Others".
Shit man, don't go and spoil the ending again, will you?
What the fuck are you worried about?
We're all already fucking dead, man!
This is what I've been trying to tell you all this time.
But you were all too busy being chicken shit to listen.
So I had to lead you here so you can see with your own eyes.
Shit!
Snake!
How about it... so, am I still your friend?
Yes, of course.
Hello
Hello Pim, did you just wake up?
Can we talk now or are you with your boyfriend?
Nope, I can talk.
So when are you going to introduce that hot boyfriend of yours to us?
So this affair is so hush hush that you don't even have time to see us anymore.
Can I help you with anything?
It's like this Pim, there is a special charter flight scheduled for tomorrow and they requested the same air crew as before.
Do you remember Prince Albert and his princess who chartered a plane for their honeymoon last year?
They are coming back again and want to stay in Phuket just like before.
Yes, I remember.
I also wonder why they requested to have the exact same crew as before.
The only difference this time is that the Princess will be traveling alone.
The rumor going around is that she was physically abused and is no longer the favorite flavor of the month.
The prince has somebody new.
Oh really, I'm sorry but tomorrow I am not free.
Can you try to find someone else to fly?
This request came down from the big boss, so there is no choice.
Last time it was you on that flight.
I just got done scheduling Tui for this flight too.
That's fine then.
What happened to Tui, why isn't she here yet?
Pim, it looks like you're going to have to fly solo.
Huh, how come?
Ter, Tui's younger brother drowned last night in Chiang Mai.
I can't find a replacement on such short notice.
That's fine.
Your Highness, May I humbly introduce myself as Pim Wongpoom.
May I have the honor of being your personal flight attendant on Flight 224.
Beverages will be served shortly, Your Highness.
Your Highness, would you care for coffee or tea?
Excuse me, Your Highness.
Would you care for coffee or tea?
Coffee or tea, Your Highness?
Coffee.
Sorry.
A fresh cup of coffee for you, Your Highness.
It doesn't matter.
Just bring me lunch.
Of course.
Just a moment, Your Highness.
Wait.
How's your arm?
It's fine, Your Highness.
I see you have a Persia ring too.
Can you take it off so I can have a closer look at it?
In my country, if a woman has an affair with a married man,
Do you know what the punishment is?
She is arrested...
Then undressed in public.
Then stoned till dead by the villagers.
And before she dies...
She has to get down on her knees and beg for forgiveness from the wife of the man she slept with.
Your Highness!
Your lunch, Your Highness.
I won't eat this kind of food.
But Your Highness,
This is what the Bureau of the Royal Household advised to serve to you.
I insist.
But we have nothing else available to serve you.
How about your food?
Sorry.
I much prefer to have your food.
May I?
Suddenly, Your Highness.
"Remark:
Princess has an allergy to shrimp."
So you want to be picky, huh?
Your Highness.
Captain, we are about to land would you like anything else?
No thank you!
Okay.
Would you care for some water, Your Highness?
Phuket International Airport, 22 hours later.
Yesterday evening Princess Sophia of the Republic of Vanistan passed away in Phuket.
At 9:00 pm. in her private hotel suite, at the age of 34.
Doctors still have not determined the cause of dea
The royal house has requested to have the body flown back to their country within 15 hours.
Golden Star Airlines will schedule a special flight to deliver the princess's body back to her country within time.
Miss Pim, the Royal House has requested that we deliver the princess's body within 15 hours.
We cannot load her body in the cargo compartment being that she is a member of a Royal family.
So we have arranged for her body to be seated in the cabin.
Miss Pim, you must take good care of the princess's body.
No unauthorized personnel are allowed on this flight.
Yes, I understand.
Do you know that after this flight you will be under investigation?
Yes
Captain,
Yes, Miss Pim?
Captain, can you please come out here for a second?
Why what is the problem?
Ummm, I...
Just tell me what's wrong.
Forget it, it's nothing.
Miss Pim, we are in an area of heavy turbulence.
I'm Sorry.
Your food, captain.
Thank You
"Time to Destination 6 Hours"
Is there anything else Miss Pim?
Captain, please don't play any pranks on me.
Where is the princess's body?
What are you talking about?
You know you have broken a lot of in-flight regulations?
Try to get a hold of yourself!
The body of the Princess.
Where did you move her body to?
If you keep talking crazy like this I won't answer the phone anymore.
Captain!
Open the Door!
We need to land the plane now!
I demand that we land the plane right now!
Open!
You must open this door right now!
Open the door right now!
Open it!
Pim!
Let me go, let me go right now.
What is the matter with you, are you crazy?
Are you out of your mind?
Please go and look if the princess's body is there.
I've had enough!
I won't listen to anymore of your craziness.
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go right now!
Let me go!
Pim, when we land you will be under investigation.
Captain, just let me go, please.
Let me go please!
I am scared.
I won't do it again.
Please... no more.
I won't fool around with him anymore.
Please, just let me go.
Just arrive aboard.

Ton, we should break up, I'm already with someone else.
Hey man, you know you can't ride past us without saying, hi!
Deaw, we agreed not to cause any trouble today?
Let's go!
Come on hurry up!
Hurry up and step on it!
Hey, where do you think you're going, get over here right now!
You guys are out of control!
Huh?
What did you say?
Don't you think you guys are going too far?
Too far?
What do you mean, Pink?
What you guys...
Please...
Please don't hurt me!
I...
I...
I got to go visit my dad in the hospital.
Visit your father?
So you think that you are cool, getting us expelled?
I don't know anything about that.
I just wanted my notebook back.
What the hell kind of dumb ass excuse is that?
You know, opening a person's bag without permission is stealing!
If you only wanted your book, why didn't you just take it.
But when you saw the weed,
Why did you rat us out to the principle?
But I really didn't know that there was a teacher standing behind me.
Oh really?
You really didn't know huh?
- You didn't know huh?
- I bet you know now!
Please...
Please stop hurting me!
I'm so sorry!
You know what?
I think tomorrow you should leave.
And don't ever let me see your stinking ugly face here again!
Have I made myself perfectly clear?
You god damn loser!
What a piece of shit man!
You know what they do with trash?
Hey loser!
They either bury trash or burn it!
But in your case,
I think should be burned!
Hey!
You better make yourself disappear!
Transfer to another school or something.
If you don't want to be burned alive.
Don't ever let us see your face again!
Got it?
Hey!
Over here!
Look...
Here goes your bicycle!
It's a damn pity.
Your bike is over there.
You should go fetch it!
Hey man, why not just let him fall all the way over?
Damn!
Man, he almost fell over for real!
If he fell over, he'd hit the ground like a lump of shit!
Whoa!
Fucking shit man, that was close!
You can all stop betting.
The banker wins with a natural 9.
Banker cleans house!
Everyone pay up!
You want the shirt off my back too?
- Your shirt!
?
- Here just take it all man.
Hey chill out, don't get angry.
Hey, did you mark these cards?
Of course they're marked, how do you think I win all the time?
Hey, what kind of a face card is this?
Dude, that's a joker!
I forgot to take it out... sorry.
Deaw
Hey if Ngid really got hurt, I really hope your dad will be able to help us out again.
Hey, Pink why do you even bring that up?
I think he's probably doing ok.
He probably dropped out of school by now.
You know, we need to stop smoking so much weed.
My dad yelled at me about this already.
If Ngid didn't find the weed, everything would be ok now.
Damn it!
He's better off dead!
Actually you know what?
Yesterday I saw his bike.
Yesterday afternoon while on my way home
His bike was still here.
But I didn't see him anywhere around.
Speak of the Devil!
Do you have a problem or something?
You want a piece of me?
So, the last time wasn't painful enough?
That's enough already!
You might really kill him this time!
Don't get in my way Pink!
You are all animals that deserve to die!
Yo, don't move!
Yo!
What the hell are you laughing at?
No!
Not me!
Go away.
Get away from me!
No!
Not me!
Deaw, what the hell are we going to do now?
Let's ditch this place and get out of here!
Go on!
Get out of here!
There's no time to grab anything!
Get out!
Move your ass!
What are we going to do?
Let's go to the hospital!
- Start the car damn it!
Let's go!
- Where's the nearest hospital?
On the ground floor of my apartment, there is a clinic.
That's the nearest one, let's just go there!
- Let's go!
Hurry!
- Come on!
Go already!
Yo
Here?
No!
No!
Not here, the next street!
Turn left on this street!
Ok!
Ok!
Yo!
Yo!
Tood, get your ass out of the car!
Come on!
Get out!
Yo!
How the hell am I going to explain this to her parents?
I think we better call the police!
Shit, there's a dead body downstairs!
That's our friend down there!
What the fuck is going on?
Damn it!
This is crazy!
Did u see Yogurt's face when she looked into the book?
And...
Ngid's horrified look on his face right before he fell out of the window...
Man, I got something to tell you all!
I saw
I saw
Saw what?
I saw...
I saw him doing...
You saw him doing what?
Hey, what if somebody sees us?
That's good!
It's more exciting that way.
And if it was one of the professors?
That's even better and even more exciting.
Hey do you hear that, over there?
Girl, I think you're hearing things?
Stop!
Listen for yourself!
Who the hell is reciting prayers around here!
?
No, Bon I am not in the mood anymore.
Who the hell is that?
Whoever looks into your eyes will be cursed to die!
Shit man don't tell me that
Ngid was playing with black magic!
Probably to get us back for what we did to him.
His dad is an undertaker.
That would probably make sense of all this!
Or...
Or what?
Maybe the paper was cursed!
He probably took pictures of people who died with their eyes open and created a curse.
When you look at the picture, you are doomed to die.
I think it is written something like...
Hey!
What's This?
Something like..."I see you now"
I see you now
Why the hell are all of you staring at me?
Deaw, don't look at it!
I didn't mean to...
I am sorry...
Is this what you call being burned alive?
Well, if you expect me to believe the testimony that you gave to us that would be difficult.
You're going to tell me that all of your friends died because of this book!
And I've assigned someone to contact your parents.
They should be here soon.
Please, wait here until they arrive.
Don't go anywhere.
We will be right back.
Ummm, would you like something to eat?
Pink
Look at me, look straight into my eyes!
Are we not part of the same gang?
Yeah, are we not all friends, Pink?
Pink, we are waiting for you?
Pink, come join us.
Pink come on give me your hand.
So we can be together.
You don't like us anymore?
It's your turn now.
No!
I don't have anything to do with all this!
The deadly curse was invoked when he used pictures of people who died with their eyes open, in the ritual of black magic.
I never did anything to you.
I was never involved in anything that happened.
That's right you didn't do anything, except stand idly by and watched.
And now...
This is what I want you to see.
Come on.
Look!
No, I don't want to look!
I didn't do anything to you.
I was never involved.
There is no way out of this.
Just take a look.
You're going to die anyways.
Just look, so you can die and we can end this now!
Open your eyes!
Take a Look!
I told you to open your eyes!
And look!
We have a man down in the bathroom, we need backup right away!
Arrest him right now!
Watch out, he's got a gun!
Just stay here, no need to...
You don't need to worry about me anymore.
They can't hurt me anymore.
You can no longer take me away.
"I see you now!"
Hey, are you guys sleepy yet?
Why, what's up?
Have you ever heard the myth about sleeping in the jungle?
They say when you go camping you should never sleep on the edge.
How come?
Our punk ass friend Tiea once told me a story when he went camping and ended up sleeping on the edge.
When night fell, he heard the sounds of footsteps of a person walking towards him.
Then he felt as if someone was brushing up against his leg.
He was so startled that he sat up in his sleeping bag.
And you know what he saw...
A succubus!
A female ghost?
Sitting at the end of his feet.
Was she Hot?
Yeah, she looked really hot man, only if...
Dude, what a pervert, I haven't even finished my story yet and here you are changing the subject.
Now where was I...
Tiea, told me that
It was definitely a woman with very long hair covering her face.
Pale white complexion.
Just sitting there at the end of his feet.
So what did Tiea do?
What the hell do you think Tiea could do?
He just lay there with his eyes closed waiting for the sun to rise.
And you know what he did that very next day?
He shared his ordeal with one of the park rangers there.
The park ranger confessed to him that some time ago...
A woman accidentally drowned!
And do you know what?
The place where you are sleeping Shin, right here, is the exact same spot!
- Holy Shit... now you're in trouble.
- Man, that's scary!
My hairs are even standing on end.
Dude, don't talk about ghosts while we are here in the middle of the jungle.
- We better get some sleep.
- Hey hold on a sec.
Have you guys ever wondered why do all ghosts always have to be female with long hair covering their face and eyes?
Every time I watch a movie, it's the same old story.
- Have you ever seen the movie "Shutter"?
- You Asshole!
No I haven't seen "Shutter" yet, so don't spoil the ending for me.
You've never seen "Shutter"?
At the end of the story...
The ghost is sitting on the guy's shoulders.
- You are so full of it!
- No seriously!
- That's why his shoulders always hurt.
- That's enough!
I don't believe there are such things as ghosts.
When I was a guide, I brought some people kayaking.
I slept alone in the jungle.
I didn't see a damn thing!
You see, Shin you think too much.
Retard...
Real or not real, it really doesn't matter to me right now.
I am just scared.
For arguments sake
If one out of the four of us was to accidentally die.
Would you guys be scared?
If one of us died, I wouldn't be scared.
I think I would be more afraid if I was to die.
What a bastard man.
Seriously though
I think... if one of us were to die
and it turned out to be Shin over here.
I think that would be the most horrifying.
How come?
Well just take a look at his face.
Even when he is alive he is scary!
Oh please...
Mr. handsome.
Mr. most good-looking jerk ass!
Why are you standing up?
- Because?
- Hey, Ter and Puak
Move aside so I can sleep in the middle.
You got to be joking, don't tell me you really are scared?
Well if you are so brave then why don't you sleep on the edge?
I am not scared, I'm just too damn lazy to move my ass.
Come on Ter
Ter
If you're not scared then just let me sleep in your spot.
What I meant was that I wouldn't be scared if one of us was a ghost.
But if I saw a ghost, hell yeah I would be scared.
Come on!
Please just let me sleep somewhere in the middle.
Man what is your problem?
Go back to sleep!
Hey can you assholes just stop acting so childish.
Let's just all go to sleep, I am really sleepy now.
Yeah...
Aey is sleepy, so shut up and go to sleep already.
Hey, I swear if I die
I'm going to come back and haunt whoever sleeps in the middle first.
Amen man!
May all your prayers come true!
Did you brush?
You breath stinks!
Just keep our raft going down this general heading.
By the time we reach our camping grounds, it will be almost evening time.
Shin, why the hell are u looking at that damn compass anyway?
Can't you see that the river flows in only one direction!
It's not like we can turn towards some other direction.
I thought it would come in handy.
You numbskull, just put it away.
I'm the king of the world!
Oh Please...
Puak, are you a retard too?
Why are you shouting?
Don't you remember Jack Dawson.
Haven't you ever watched the movie "Titanic"?
Jack was standing at the front of the boat when he screamed,
I'm the king of the world!
Puak, you're an idiot!
You're going to make the raft capsize.
No, I just want to be Jack.
Shin, don't tell me that you don't even know that the Titanic sank?
I haven't seen that movie yet.
What!
You haven't seen Titanic yet?
Did you know at the end of the movie, Rose is sitting on Jack's shoulders too.
Shutter, they copied the idea from Titanic.
- Really?
Are you serious?
- Yes of course it's true.
Titanic was the first to come up with the idea decades ago.
Damn Thai movies.
Aren't there any VDO stores around your house?
Heads Up!
It's time to rock n' roll!
Yeahhhhh...
Here were go!
Man, what a ride!
Shin, you got to help us paddle.
Puak you idiot!
Puak don't stand up!
Sit down before the raft flips over!
Puak!
Puak don't stand up!
Puak sit your ass down!
Puak!
Ter!
Help!
Shin?
Puak?
Shin?
Puak?
You guys ok?
OK, how about you?
Where the hell is Ter?
Oh yeah!
Where is Ter?
Ter!
Ter!
Ter!
Shit!
Ter, doesn't know how to swim very well.
Yeah...
So where is he?
- Ter!
- Damn!
Oh Shit!
Ter!
Help!
Ter!
Ter!
Ter!
Aey, Hurry up!
Help!
Ter, don't struggle!
Ter, stop struggling, you are pulling me down!
Help!
- Help!
- Ter, don't struggle!
Aey, be careful!
Oh!
Fuck!
Where are they?
Aey!
Ter!
Aey!
Where did they go?
Aey!
Ter!
There is Ter!
You're ok, I got you!
It's OK.
Sit down.
You're alright?
You're ok right?
Where is Aey?
- Aey, where is he?
- Aey!
- Aey!
- Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey, where the hell are you?
Aey!
Do you think he is ok?
Yeah I think he is ok.
Hey, don't worry!
You are probably more stressed than he is right now.
Why the fuck are you even crying?
You don't even know if Aey is even dead yet.
If we find out for sure that he is dead, then you can cry.
But we already looked for him everywhere!
Hey don't think too much.
Tomorrow when we get out of the jungle, we can notify the park rangers to help us search for him again.
Tonight we better get some sleep.
Trust me tomorrow we have a long hike ahead of us.
Good night.
I'm gonna go to sleep now.
Ter, c'mon get some sleep.
What's wrong Ter, why don't you lay down and sleep?
Why aren't you sleeping in the same spot as before?
What do you mean by "the same spot"?
Last night I slept next to Aey.
So tonight I should get to sleep on the edge.
Oh Please...
just pick a spot anywhere and go to sleep.
It's getting late damn it.
Ter, don't tell me that you are thinking about what Aey said to us.
What the hell are you talking about?
What he said about what he would do if he died?
He said he would come back and haunt the person in the middle first.
You bastard!
Aey isn't dead yet, you idiot!
Stop being retarded!
We will find him tomorrow, so just go to sleep will you?
If you are not scared then why don't you sleep in the middle?
Oh Man...
Shin!
Your feet really stink!
My feet don't smell.
The stench of your feet is damn strong.
Get them away from me.
Why did you to take a whiff of my feet?
Did you hear that?
What?
What noise?
It sounds like... someone is walking towards us.
Who's there?
Aey is that you?
Aey?
Aey?
Aey!
Aey you bastard, it's you!
We thought you were dead.
Aey, so what happened to you?
Shin, grab a towel and dry him off.
Sure.
Hey buddy are you ok?
Are you hurt anywhere?
How did you survive anyways?
I feel cold!
If he feels cold then dry him off, man.
Ok!
Aey go and change out of those wet clothes before you get sick.
I spent a lot of time looking for you.
We're happy to have you back.
It's amazing you survived.
You are so damn lucky man!
That's for sure.
Damn lucky!
Hey, where are you going?
I need a smoke.
Me too.
Where is your cigarette?
Yeah, I thought so.
You feel like something strange is going on here?
- Like what?
- Shit man!
Can you talk a little quieter?
I'm talking about Aey.
What about Aey?
What kind of person can be underwater for that long and not drown?
The fact he is ok is a blessing.
So stop thinking so negatively.
Aey.
Are you alright?
Aey?
Are you ok?
Aey?
Aey?
Aey!
Aey!
What's happening to you?
Huh?
What the hell are you doing out here, you don't smoke?
I'm starting today.
Hey take it easy.
You're way too old to act like a bad boy.
Ter.
Are you thinking, what I am thinking?
What the fuck is wrong with both of you?
Puak...
What if Aey did die already?
Dead?
That's fucking impossible...
Who the hell is in that tent then?
Shit man have you ever seen the movie The Sixth Sense?
Why?
The movie is about people who didn't know that they were dead already.
Really?
And why are you telling me this?
I didn't watch that movie yet.
Too Bad!
Now you know how I feel.
I think Aey came back to haunt you, Ter.
You are the jerk that caused him to drown.
Hey, don't talk shit like that.
I think he came back to haunt you because you cursed him to die!
What?
But you just told me that he isn't even dead yet?
I am just kidding... you idiot!
Hey you guys think Aey is really dead, don't you?
I don't know, I could be thinking too much.
I think so, you guys think way too much.
I need to take a piss.
Well you better take a piss somewhere far away from the tent.
It's bad enough that Shin's feet already stink up the place.
I wanna go too.
Ter, why don't you take Aey with you?
Hey buddy
Do you realize that you are sweating a lot?
Are you Ok?
You're not feeling cold anymore are you?
If you're feeling better, that's good.
Oh Shit!
Snake!
I'm so fucked man!
What the hell is the matter with you, Ter?
Aey, he's dead already!
HUH!
Aey, he is dead!
Do you know what you are saying?
Look, here he comes.
What the hell, Ter?
Aey, he's dead, I saw his body.
Man if you are joking around, this isn't funny at all!
I'm not shitting you!
I just saw his body floating in the river.
You're out of your mind.
SHIT!
Ter, don't let go!
- What the fuck is wrong with you people?
- Aey!
- Puak, don't open it?
- Puak, Don't!
- Puak, Aey!
- But it's cold out there.
You guys are acting really retarded.
Holy Shit!
Why didn't you fucking stop me?
I don't think what we are doing is right?
Remember, he is our friend.
But he is a ghost now.
I can never be friends with a ghost!
Aey.
Leave us alone.
You're dead!
Do you hear me?
Aey.
You think he's gone?
Puak, go and take a look.
Why me?
Puak, just go man!
Asshole!
I think he is really gone.
Damn it, where are my glasses?
Has Aey really gone?
Not sure, maybe.
How the hell are we going to get down from here?
Well how did we get up here in the first place?
Hey... this way man.
Where the hell is it?
Who's that?
Who ever the hell is there, just tell me who you are!
It's me.
Puak...
Fuck man, you really scared me!
There's nothing to be fucking scared of.
Just open your eyes.
Here you go.
You bastard.
Why didn't you hand it to me sooner?
Hey, Ter.
Shin...
Puak!
Hurry man!
Shit!
It's Aey's body.
Shit Man!
What are we going to do now?
I think we better get the hell out of here and let the park rangers come and retrieve his body tomorrow.
Don't tell me you are going to take Aey's body with us, aren't you?
Let's just go!
Aey, I am sorry.
Wait a second.
Now what?
Let's just hurry and get out of here.
Aey!
What the hell are you doing, screaming out his name?
Aey!
What the hell are you yelling his name out for?
I am calling him over so I can show him his dead body.
This way he will realize that he is dead already and won't keep haunting us like this.
Aey!
Aey!
Come on out where ever you are.
Aey, you are dead!
So don't bother us anymore.
Here look, this is your dead body.
Look at it!
Ter!
Ter!
Look!
So what, are we dead or are we alive?
Puak!
Damn it, the twist is just like in the movie "The Others".
Shit man, don't go and spoil the ending again, will you?
What the fuck are you worried about?
We're all already fucking dead, man!
This is what I've been trying to tell you all this time.
But you were all too busy being chicken shit to listen.
So I had to lead you here so you can see with your own eyes.
Shit!
Snake!
How about it... so, am I still your friend?
Yes, of course.
Hello
Hello Pim, did you just wake up?
Can we talk now or are you with your boyfriend?
Nope, I can talk.
So when are you going to introduce that hot boyfriend of yours to us?
So this affair is so hush hush that you don't even have time to see us anymore.
Can I help you with anything?
It's like this Pim, there is a special charter flight scheduled for tomorrow and they requested the same air crew as before.
Do you remember Prince Albert and his princess who chartered a plane for their honeymoon last year?
They are coming back again and want to stay in Phuket just like before.
Yes, I remember.
I also wonder why they requested to have the exact same crew as before.
The only difference this time is that the Princess will be traveling alone.
The rumor going around is that she was physically abused and is no longer the favorite flavor of the month.
The prince has somebody new.
Oh really, I'm sorry but tomorrow I am not free.
Can you try to find someone else to fly?
This request came down from the big boss, so there is no choice.
Last time it was you on that flight.
I just got done scheduling Tui for this flight too.
That's fine then.
What happened to Tui, why isn't she here yet?
Pim, it looks like you're going to have to fly solo.
Huh, how come?
Ter, Tui's younger brother drowned last night in Chiang Mai.
I can't find a replacement on such short notice.
That's fine.
Your Highness, May I humbly introduce myself as Pim Wongpoom.
May I have the honor of being your personal flight attendant on Flight 224.
Beverages will be served shortly, Your Highness.
Your Highness, would you care for coffee or tea?
Excuse me, Your Highness.
Would you care for coffee or tea?
Coffee or tea, Your Highness?
Coffee.
Sorry.
A fresh cup of coffee for you, Your Highness.
It doesn't matter.
Just bring me lunch.
Of course.
Just a moment, Your Highness.
Wait.
How's your arm?
It's fine, Your Highness.
I see you have a Persia ring too.
Can you take it off so I can have a closer look at it?
In my country, if a woman has an affair with a married man,
Do you know what the punishment is?
She is arrested...
Then undressed in public.
Then stoned till dead by the villagers.
And before she dies...
She has to get down on her knees and beg for forgiveness from the wife of the man she slept with.
Your Highness!
Your lunch, Your Highness.
I won't eat this kind of food.
But Your Highness,
This is what the Bureau of the Royal Household advised to serve to you.
I insist.
But we have nothing else available to serve you.
How about your food?
Sorry.
I much prefer to have your food.
May I?
Suddenly, Your Highness.
"Remark:
Princess has an allergy to shrimp."
So you want to be picky, huh?
Your Highness.
Captain, we are about to land would you like anything else?
No thank you!
Okay.
Would you care for some water, Your Highness?
Phuket International Airport, 22 hours later.
Yesterday evening Princess Sophia of the Republic of Vanistan passed away in Phuket.
At 9:00 pm. in her private hotel suite, at the age of 34.
Doctors still have not determined the cause of dea
The royal house has requested to have the body flown back to their country within 15 hours.
Golden Star Airlines will schedule a special flight to deliver the princess's body back to her country within time.
Miss Pim, the Royal House has requested that we deliver the princess's body within 15 hours.
We cannot load her body in the cargo compartment being that she is a member of a Royal family.
So we have arranged for her body to be seated in the cabin.
Miss Pim, you must take good care of the princess's body.
No unauthorized personnel are allowed on this flight.
Yes, I understand.
Do you know that after this flight you will be under investigation?
Yes
Captain,
Yes, Miss Pim?
Captain, can you please come out here for a second?
Why what is the problem?
Ummm, I...
Just tell me what's wrong.
Forget it, it's nothing.
Miss Pim, we are in an area of heavy turbulence.
I'm Sorry.
Your food, captain.
Thank You
"Time to Destination 6 Hours"
Is there anything else Miss Pim?
Captain, please don't play any pranks on me.
Where is the princess's body?
What are you talking about?
You know you have broken a lot of in-flight regulations?
Try to get a hold of yourself!
The body of the Princess.
Where did you move her body to?
If you keep talking crazy like this I won't answer the phone anymore.
Captain!
Open the Door!
We need to land the plane now!
I demand that we land the plane right now!
Open!
You must open this door right now!
Open the door right now!
Open it!
Pim!
Let me go, let me go right now.
What is the matter with you, are you crazy?
Are you out of your mind?
Please go and look if the princess's body is there.
I've had enough!
I won't listen to anymore of your craziness.
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go right now!
Let me go!
Pim, when we land you will be under investigation.
Captain, just let me go, please.
Let me go please!
I am scared.
I won't do it again.
Please... no more.
I won't fool around with him anymore.
Please, just let me go.
Just arrive aboard.

Loneliness
I'm so lonely
From Puak:
"A lonely girl desperately seeking a rich man.
Good looks is a must."
Puak, you're so cruel.
I hope you drown at Chiang Mai.
Then, you'll be all alone.
Just like me.
Haha.
Puak:
You're foul mouthed.
Take care!
They'll be coming for the rents.
They were here.
Almost broke down my front door!
Have a nice camping trip.
May I know you?
Just want to be your friend.
Do I know you?
Not right now, later, maybe...?
A you a girl or a guy?
A guy.
Sorry.
The number you've just dialed is not available.
Please try again later.
Hello:)
New message... 0
Hi, it's me.
What are you doing?
Enjoying the night at the balcony.
And you?
Lying down.
All alone...
Do you have any MSN account?
Sorry, I have no room for a computer.
My place is so crammed.
Too bad...
If you're bored we could chat on MSN.
I am not bored...
Are you?
No.
Just lonely.
Have been confined in my room for quite a while.
Me too.
Have been alone for a 100 days.
Are you sick or something?
No..
Just unlucky.
The taxi I was in, was involved in an accident.
My leg has been in a cast for more than 3 months.
Cheer up!
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Gone to bed yet?
No, not sleepy right now.
May I have your photo?
Why don't we swap photos.
OK?
No problem.
Why don't you send yours first.
Not as pretty as you would have imagined...
Not as handsome as you expected...
Cheater!
That's my photo.
Look again.
I'm by your side.
Phone number search.
Sorry.
The number you've just dialed has been disconnected.
Son of Princess Sophia of Virnistan passed away at Phuket.
Causes still unknown.
It is 100 days since the funeral.
Rumours have it that he took his own life.
It is also rumoured that she left her cell phone in his coffin.
In case her son feels lonely
Or wants to get in touch with her.
Me too.
Have been alone for a 100 days.
Why are you afraid?
Don't put down the phone or you'll be sorry.
I'm passing by your apartment.
Can I meet you?
No, please...
My boyfriend will be upset.
That's a lie!
He's not there.
You're all alone...
I'm at the entrance of your apartment.
Coming up...
I'm here...
From Oh...
Ton, I want to break up with you.
I have a new boyfriend...
Hey undertaker!
Are you running from us?
Let me handle this!
Let's go!
Hurry up!
Where are you going?
Let's take a ride!
I think we're over reacting.
Huh, what did you say?
Don't you think it's a bit excessive.
The way you're treating him.
What's that Pink?
I can't hear you.
It's what you're doing...
Please.
Stop...
Don't hurt me...
My father is sick in the hospital.
I have to see him.
Because of you all of us are suspended from school.
I...
I did not wish for that to happen.
I just wanted my notebook back.
That's just an excuse.
Only a thief will open other's bag without permission.
And why didn't you mind your own business?
Why did you report to the teachers about the drugs?
I didn't know they were there.
You didn't know?
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.
I think, it would be better if you quit the school tomorrow.
I don't want to see your ugly face anymore!
Don't let me see you again!
What are we going to do with him?
Undertaker!
You are a discard, understand?
A discard!
Rubbish should be burnt!
You'd better disappear from the face of this earth!
Move out of school...
Or you'll be burnt alive!
Understand?
Get out of our sight!
Stand up!
Is this your bicycle?
Why don't you go after it!
Should we push him out?
Look at him!
He's scared out of his wits!
Shit!
He almost fell out!
The Deadly Charm
I've got 7.
Mine's 9.
I lose.
I lose again.
What's the bet this time?
This is really boring.
Think positive.
You're lucky with cards!
Let's see how I fare this time.
Hey!
What kind of a card is that?
Hmm.
That's a Joker... you idiot.
Diew, if Ngeed dies...
Will your father be able to help us again?
Hey Pink, why do you say that?
I think he's just fine.
And he'll quit school for sure.
And we should all quit the drugs.
My dad got mad at me for getting suspended.
If Ngeed didn't stumble on it, nobody would've known about the drugs.
Maybe he's better off dead.
Speaking of him...
Saw his bike on my way home yesterday.
His bike is still there.
But no signs of him...
What the hell...
Are you looking for trouble, undertaker?
The last beating wasn't enough for you?
Haven't you learned your lesson?
Enough!
Stop it!
He's had enough!
Mind your own business, Pink!
You're nothing but trash.
All of you deserve to die.
Yo, keep still!
Why the hell are you laughing?
No!
No!
No!
Not me!
No!
Not me!
What happened?
Diew, what should we do?
Let's get out of here!
Hurry up!
Get out of here!
What are we going to do?
The hospital!
Hurry up!
Where's the nearest hospital?
There's a clinic near my place.
Go there!
Alright.
Alright..
Yo!
Ping!
Is this it?
No, next lane.
Yes turn into this lane.
Yo!
Yo!
Get her out.
Hurry!
Yo!
Yo!
What do we tell Yo's parents?
Let's go to the police, there's a dead body down there!
But she's our friend!
What..
What the hell..
What the hell is going on?
Something's not right...
Did you see Yo's face when she opened the book?
And Ngeed was in a state of shock before he fell.
I saw...
I saw what he was doing...
What if someone sees us here...?
Good.
Make it more exiting!
But, what if, it's the teacher?
Great.
Make it doubly exciting!
What's that noise?
Just ignore it.
Stop and listen!
Hell!
Who is chanting his prayers here?
Ball, I'm not in the mood anymore.
Who is that?
Look into my eyes!
Are you telling me, Ngeed practiced black magic?
Is he planning his revenge on us?
His father in an undertaker.
It's reasonable for him to practice black magic.
Or maybe...
Maybe what, Ed?
He was performing the rituals of the Deadly Charm.
To perform the rituals of The Deadly Charm, you need a photo of someone who died with his eyes open.
Anybody who looks into the eye will be found dead.
There's something written on this photo.
"I am watching you.." Something like that?
I am watching you...
What are you looking at?
I didn't mean to do it.
I'm sorry...
How does it look, to be burnt alive?
What you have told us.
Is beyond imagination...
They're just unbelievable...
Are you saying these books killed your friends?
I got hold of your parents.
They're on their way.
Please stay in the room.
Make yourself comfortable.
We'll be right back.
Hungry?
You want something to eat?
Pink.
Look at me, Pink.
Aren't you part of the gang?
Aren't we your friends, Pink?
We're waiting for you Pink.
Don't leave us Pink.
Give me your hand Pink.
Come with us.
Don't you like me anymore?
It's your turn now.
No, I was not involved in this.
To perform the rituals of The Deadly Charm, you need a photo of someone who died with his eyes open.
I have never hurt you.
I was not involved.
Right, you just stood still and didn't do anything...
And this is what I want you to see.
Look at it!
- No I won't.
Please...
I have never hurt you.
I was not involved.
You cannot run away from your guilt!
Look at it!
This will end right here!
Look at it!
Look at it!
Emergency!
Emergency!
A policeman has been shot.
Get him!
Be careful, he's got a gun!
Miss, please stay here, don't...
You don't have to worry.
They won't get to me.
They cannot take me.
I am watching you...!
- Hey are you asleep yet?
- No, what is it?
Have you heard this before:
"Don't sleep at the outer fringe if you're in the woods at night."
- And why not?
- Tia once told me that..
He slept on the outer fringe while in the woods one night.
And late at night...
He heard footsteps approaching closer and closer towards him.
Then he felt a touch on his leg.
Frightened, he opened his eyes slowly.
And what did he see?
..
A beautiful woman...
Is the ghost cute?
She was just standing there..
Of course...
Hey let me finish the story, OK?
Tia just said that she was a woman.
With black, beautiful, flowing hair, covering her face...
Pale skin...
Sitting at his feet..
So what did he do?
He didn't know what to do..
He just closed his eyes tight until it was dawn.
In the morning he went to ask the local people there.
They said, a woman had drowned in a river close to where he was camped.
And the location where Tia once slept...
Is where you are sleeping right now, Chin.
- What the hell!
- I'm having goose pimples right now..
Shit!
Why tell a ghost story in the middle of the night!
Wait a minute..
You don't believe that bullshit, do you?
Why must ghosts always be females, with long hair, covering their faces?
Every horror movies I've watched have similar ghosts...
Have you seen the film Shutter?
Shit!
I haven't.
Please don't spoil it for me!
Really..
You've not watched Shutter?
At the end, the ghost was sitting on the lead actor's shoulders.
Shit!
You spoiled it for me!
It's true.
That is why he always have neck pains.
Seriously,
I don't believe ghost exists.
I've camped here before.
Slept alone...
And nothing happened.
Right...
There's nothing to worry Chin.
Ghost or no ghost is beside the point.
I'm about to pee in my pants right this moment.
Here's a thought.
What if...
One of us dies all of a sudden..
Will you be scared?
If it's you, of course I won't be frightened
But I'll be really scared if...
I have to die.
Come to think of it, amongst the four of us...
Chin will be the scariest ghost.
Why?
Look at his face.
His looks is already so scary while still alive!
What about you?
So handsome huh?
- What's going on?
Ter, Puak move aside, I want to sleep in the middle.
Hey, are you really scared?
You aren't scared, so go sleep on the outside.
I'm not scared, just too lazy to move.
Ter..
Ter..
You're not scared right?
Let me sleep here, please...
I won't be scared if you die, but I'm scared of real ghosts.
Let me sleep in the middle please...
Don't push me, go away!
Hey stop arguing.
Let's sleep.
I'm sleepy now.
See, Ae is sleepy now.
Go back to your place.
And if I die, I'll come back,
And haunt the one in the middle first!
Sure...
I hope you die soon!
The Man In The Middle
We have to go this way.
It'll lead us to the campground.
Could be there by dusk.
Chin, no need to use the compass.
The river flows only one way.
Yeah look.
Just follow the river.
There's no other way.
Is there?
I'm just being cautious.
That's why I brought the compass.
Never mind.
Just put it away.
I am the king of the world.
Puak, are you crazy or something?
Jack Dawson...
Have you watched TITANIC?
He was on the ship shouting,
"I am the king of the world"
Do you want our boat to sink too?
Like the Titanic?
Of course not!
I just want to be Jack.
Chin, don't tell me you don't know,
That the Titanic sank!
?
I have never watched it yet.
Haven't watched TITANIC?
Did you know, at the end, Rose was on Jack's neck.
SHUTTER copied this scene.
Really?
True...
Titanic was released more than 10 years ago.
Damn, copycat Thai movies!
Does your village has a movie rental store?
Hey, here comes the fun!
What a thrill!
Be careful!
Puak, sit down!
- Chin, Puak.
Are you OK?
- OK, and you?
Where is Ter?
Ter!
Ter!
Ter!
He's not a good swimmer!
Over there!
Damn!
Ter!
Ter!
Ter!
Help!
Ter!
Help, Help!
Ter!
Ter, don't struggle!
What happened to them!
?
Where are they?
Ter!
Be careful.
Sit down.
Sit down.
I'm okay...
Where's Ae?
Ae!
Where are you!
?
Do you think he's alright?
Yes, I think he's safe.
Don't worry.
You're the one who's worried!
Else why are you crying?
Ae's still alive.
If he dies...
Then it's time to cry.
But we looked for him everywhere...
Don't worry about him.
Tomorrow, we'll ask for help, from the local people here.
Why don't we take a rest.
We have a very long day tomorrow.
I'm going to bed.
Ter...
Let's go.
Ter?
What's the matter Ter?
Why didn't you sleep in the same position?
Same position?
Last night I slept on Ae's side.
I should be sleeping on the fringe.
C'mon..
Don't make a fuss.
Just go to sleep.
Ter, are you thinking about what Ae said last night..?
What are you babbling about?
He said if he dies, he'd haunt the one who's sleeping in the middle.
C'mon..
Ae is still alive.
He's not dead!
You're talking rubbish!
We'll find him tomorrow, let's sleep.
If you're not afraid, could you sleep in the middle?
Damn you Chin!
Your feet are horrible!
I didn't smell anything.
Take your feet out of my face!
Put your nose away from my feet then.
Shh..
Did you hear that?
What's that?
What's that noise?
Sounds like footsteps approaching our tent.
Who's that?
Ae, is that you?
Ae.
Ae..
Ae!
I thought you drowned!
Ae, how are you?
Chin, get him a towel.
Are you feeling okay?
Any injuries?
How did you get back here?
I'm so cold...
Let me wipe you.
Why don't you change your clothes.
It's all wet.
We searched for you for quite a while!
I'm so glad you're fine.
Yes, he looks fine.
Can't find any injuries.
This is great!
You're one lucky guy!
Hey!
Where are you going?
- Smoke.
- I'll keep you company.
Thought you want to smoke?
Let me have one.
Don't you think it's strange?
- What's strange?
- Hush...
Keep your voice down.
I mean to say, Ae..
Why?
He almost drowned today.
But he acts as if nothing happened.
It's good that he's fine.
Isn't it?
Ae..
Are you all right?
Ae..
Are you okay?
Ae..
Ae..
Ae..
What are you doing out here?
You don't smoke!
I'm starting right now!
Take it easy..
Welcome to the man's world...
Ter..
Are you thinking, What I'm thinking?
What the heck are you talking about?
Puak...
I think Ae is dead.
Bullshit!
If he's dead, who's in the tent then?
Damn, haven't you watched THE SIXTH SENSE?
Why?
The ghost does not know that he is already dead.
Idiot!
You spoiled it for me!
Haven't seen it yet!
It's my turn...
Or did he come back to take revenge on you, Ter?
He drowned saving your life.
Idiot!
Don't be ridiculous!
I think he's back because...
you cursed him to die!
But I thought you said he's alive!
Didn't you?
I was only kidding!
Hehehe!
Do you really think he's dead?
Don't know, maybe I'm confused.
That's right.
You think too much.
I'm going to pee then.
Go pee far away from the tent.
Chin's foot is more than enough to make me sick.
Hold on..
I'll go too.
Ter, why don't you go with Ae then?
Looks like, you're sweating a lot.
Are you okay?
Not feeling cold anymore?
Hmm..
Okay, that's good.
Corpse!
Damn it..
Damn it..
What's wrong with you, Ter?
Ae is dead!
I said, Ae is dead!
What are you talking about?
There he is, on his way back.
What are you doing, Ter?
Believe me, Ae is dead.
I saw his corpse.
Are you kidding me?
That's not funny!
It's true!
I saw his corpse floating out there.
Crazy..
Ter, don't let him in!
What is wrong with you people?
Don't tease him.
It's so cold outside.
Let him in.
We cannot let him in!
Why is he doing this to us?
He's still our friend, isn't he?
But he's dead!
You're a ghost.
Not our friend!
Ae..
Please leave us alone.
You're already dead!
Ae..
Has he left?
Puak, why don't you take a look?
What!
Why me?
I think he's gone.
Shit!
Where's my glasses?
Is Ae dead?
Maybe...
Oh shit!
How do we get down?
How did we get up here so high?
Who's that?
Who's there?
Tell me who are you?
Hey it's me, Puak.
Shit!
You scared the hell out of me!
What are you afraid of?
Here's your glasses.
Why can't I find it earlier?
You scared the shit out of me!
Is that you, Ter?
Chin, Puak..
Hurry!
Ae's body!
What should we do now?
Why don't we get out of here first!
We'll inform the authorities to pick up his body later.
We're not taking his body with us, right?
Ae, forgive me...
Wait...
What are you waiting for?
Lets' go.
Ae!
Why are you calling for him?
Stop calling for him!
I'm calling for him to look at his body.
Only then will he realise, he is dead.
Ae!
You are already dead!
Ae, please look...
This is your body!
Look!
Ter...
Ter..
Look at it..
So.. are we humans or ghosts?
Damn!
Same twisted story like THE OTHERS!
Shit!
You spoiled it again!
Why do you have to worry?
We are all dead!
I've tried to tell all of you.
But you kept running away from me, scared...
So I let you see them for yourselves.
So?
Are we still friends?
I guess so..
Yes...
Hello Pim, just woke up?
Can we talk?
Are you with your boyfriend?
No.
I'm alone.
So when will you take your boyfriend to meet us?
Are you afraid I'll take him away from you?
Anything I can do for you?
Pim, we have a special flight tomorrow.
Remember Prince Albert and his princess?
They booked our airlines, for their honeymoon last year?
They have requested the same team of flight staff.
They'd like our airlines to take them to Phuket again.
Yes, I remember...
The Last Flight
I do not understand either.
Why ask for the same team of flight staff,
When only the Princess is going to Phuket.
Rumours have it that she's fallen out of favour.
And the Prince has a new flame.
Really?
But I've made other arrangements.
Can't you find a replacement.
Hey Pim, the boss said it must be you.
Nobody else.
Because you've served them very well before.
I've just convinced Tui to join you too.
Yes, OK then.
I Understand..
Where's Tui?
Why isn't he here yet?
Pim, I'm afraid you have to go alone.
Why?
What happened to Tui?
Tui's brother, Ter was found drowned at last night.
I can't find others to go with you.
Really?
Your Highness,
May I humbly introduce myself as Pim Wongpoom.
May I have the honour of being your personal flight attendant on Flight 224.
Beverage will be served shortly, your highness.
Your highness, would you care for a coffee or tea?
Excuse me, your highness.
Would you care for coffee or tea?
Coffee or tea, your highness?
Coffee.
Sorry...
A fresh cup of coffee for you, your highness.
It doesn't matter.
Just bring me lunch.
Of course.
Just a moment, your highness.
Wait.
How's your arm?
It is fine, your highness.
I see you have a Virnistan ring too.
Can you take it off, so I can have a closer look at it?
In my country..
if a woman has an affair with a married man...
Do you know what the punishment is?
She'll get arrested.
Then undressed in public.
Then stoned to death by the villagers.
And before she dies...
She has to get down on her knees...
And beg for forgiveness from the wife of the man she slept with.
Your highness...
Your lunch, your highness.
I won't eat this kind of food.
But your highness,
This is what the royal household has asked to be served.
I insist.
But we have nothing else available to serve you.
How about your food?
Sorry?
I much prefer to have your food.
May I?
Certainly, your highness.
Remark:
Princess has an allergy to shrimp.
What a spoiled Princess!
Your highness...
Captain, would you like something for lunch?
- No, thank you.
- All right.
Would you care for some water, your highness?
Phuket International Airport, 22 hours later
Yesterday, Princess Sophia of Virnistan passed away at 9pm in a hotel room at Phuket.
Aged 34, cause of death is still unknown.
Spokesman for the royal household has requested for the late Princess Sophia,
to be flown back to Virnistan within the next 15 hours.
Golden Star Airlines is preparing a special flight to fly the late princess.
Miss Pim, they want us to send the princess back within 15 hours.
To honour Her Royal Highness, we've made special arrangements to accommodate her in the plane's cabin.
Miss Pim...
Your duty is to look after the princess's body.
Nobody else is allowed into the cabin.
Yes, captain.
And after this flight, you'll have to attend an investigation.
I understand...
Captain.
Yes, Miss Pim?
Captain, could you please come out here?
What's the matter?
Well...
Miss Pim, what is it?
Nothing.., Captain.
Miss Pim, this is not the time for games.
I'm sorry.
Dinner, Captain.
Thanks.
What is it Miss Pim?
Captain are you playing tricks?
Where's the body of the princess?
What are you talking about?
Have you gone mad?
Where's the body of the princess?
She's nowhere to be found!
What nonsense are you talking about!
I'm hanging up the phone...
Captain..
Captain..
Captain!
Captain!
Please land the plane right now!
Captain!
Land the plane!
Open the door!
Open the door!
Let me go!
Pim!
Let me out of here!
Have you gone mad?
The princess body has disappeared!
Stop this nonsense!
Let me go!
No!
Let me go!
Pim, when we land.
You will be disciplined.
Captain, please...
Please, leave me alone...
I beg you.
I made a mistake.
I won't do it again.
I'll leave him, I promise.

Now I'm inside your room.
Ton, we should break up, I'm already with someone else.
Hey man, you know you can't ride past us without saying, hi!
Deaw, we agreed not to cause any trouble today?
Let's go!
Come on hurry up!
Hurry up and step on it!
Hey, where do you think you're going, get over here right now!
You guys are out of control!
Huh?
What did you say?
Don't you think you guys are going too far?
Too far?
What do you mean, Pink?
What you guys...
Please...
Please don't hurt me!
I...
I...
I got to go visit my dad in the hospital.
Visit your father?
So you think that you are cool, getting us expelled?
I don't know anything about that.
I just wanted my notebook back.
What the hell kind of dumb ass excuse is that?
You know, opening a person's bag without permission is stealing!
If you only wanted your book, why didn't you just take it.
But when you saw the weed,
Why did you rat us out to the principle?
But I really didn't know that there was a teacher standing behind me.
Oh really?
You really didn't know huh?
- You didn't know huh?
- I bet you know now!
Please...
Please stop hurting me!
I'm so sorry!
You know what?
I think tomorrow you should leave.
And don't ever let me see your stinking ugly face here again!
Have I made myself perfectly clear?
You god damn loser!
What a piece of shit man!
You know what they do with trash?
Hey loser!
They either bury trash or burn it!
But in your case,
I think should be burned!
Hey!
You better make yourself disappear!
Transfer to another school or something.
If you don't want to be burned alive.
Don't ever let us see your face again!
Got it?
Hey!
Over here!
Look...
Here goes your bicycle!
It's a damn pity.
Your bike is over there.
You should go fetch it!
Hey man, why not just let him fall all the way over?
Damn!
Man, he almost fell over for real!
If he fell over, he'd hit the ground like a lump of shit!
Whoa!
Fucking shit man, that was close!

Hey, what kind of a face card is this?
Dude, that's a joker!
I forgot to take it out...
Sorry.
Deaw
Hey if Ngid really got hurt, I really hope your dad will be able to help us out again.
Hey, Pink why do you even bring that up?
I think he's probably doing ok.
He probably dropped out of school by now.
You know, we need to stop smoking so much weed.
My dad yelled at me about this already.
If Ngid didn't find the weed, everything would be ok now.
Damn it!
He's better off dead!
Actually you know what?
Yesterday I saw his bike.
Yesterday afternoon while on my way home
His bike was still here.
But I didn't see him anywhere around.
Speak of the Devil!
Do you have a problem or something?
You want a piece of me?
So, the last time wasn't painful enough?
That's enough already!
You might really kill him this time!
Don't get in my way Pink!
You are all animals that deserve to die!
Yo, don't move!
Yo!
What the hell are you laughing at?
No!
Not me!
Go away.
Get away from me!
No!
Not me!
Deaw, what the hell are we going to do now?
Let's ditch this place and get out of here!
Go on!
Get out of here!
There's no time to grab anything!
Get out!
Move your ass!
What are we going to do?
Let's go to the hospital!
- Start the car damn it!
Let's go!
- Where's the nearest hospital?
On the ground floor of my apartment, there is a clinic.
That's the nearest one, let's just go there!
- Let's go!
Hurry!
- Come on!
Go already!
Yo
Here?
No!
No!
Not here, the next street!
Turn left on this street!
Ok!
Ok!
Yo!
Yo!
Tood, get your ass out of the car!
Come on!
Get out!
Yo!
How the hell am I going to explain this to her parents?
I think we better call the police!
Shit, there's a dead body downstairs!
That's our friend down there!
What the fuck is going on?
Damn it!
This is crazy!
Did u see Yogurt's face when she looked into the book?
And...
Ngid's horrified look on his face right before he fell out of the window...
Man, I got something to tell you all!
I saw
I saw
Saw what?
I saw...
I saw him doing...
You saw him doing what?
Hey, what if somebody sees us?
That's good!
It's more exciting that way.
And if it was one of the professors?
That's even better and even more exciting.
Hey do you hear that, over there?
Girl, I think you're hearing things?
Stop!
Listen for yourself!
Who the hell is reciting prayers around here!
?
No, Bon I am not in the mood anymore.
Who the hell is that?
Whoever looks into your eyes will be cursed to die!
Shit man, don't tell me that...
Ngid was playing with black magic!
Probably to get us back for what we did to him.
His dad is an undertaker.
That would probably make sense of all this!
Or...
Or what?
Maybe the paper was cursed!
He probably took pictures of people who died with their eyes open and created a curse.
When you look at the picture, you are doomed to die.
I think it is written something like...
Hey!
What's This?
Something like...
"I see you now"
I see you now
Why the hell are all of you staring at me?
Deaw, don't look at it!
I didn't mean to...
I am sorry...
Is this what you call being burned alive?
Well, if you expect me to believe the testimony that you gave to us that would be difficult.
You're going to tell me that all of your friends died because of this book!
And I've assigned someone to contact your parents.
They should be here soon.
Please, wait here until they arrive.
Don't go anywhere.
We will be right back.
Ummm, would you like something to eat?
Pink
Look at me, look straight into my eyes!
Are we not part of the same gang?
Yeah, are we not all friends, Pink?
Pink, we are waiting for you.
Pink, come join us.
Pink come on give me your hand.
So we can be together.
You don't like us anymore?
It's your turn now.
No!
I don't have anything to do with all this!
The deadly curse was invoked when he used pictures of people who died with their eyes open, in the ritual of black magic.
I never did anything to you.
I was never involved in anything that happened.
That's right you didn't do anything, except stand idly by and watched.
And now...
This is what I want you to see.
Come on.
Look!
No, I don't want to look!
I didn't do anything to you.
I was never involved.
There is no way out of this.
Just take a look.
You're going to die anyways.
Just look, so you can die and we can end this now!
Open your eyes!
Take a Look!
I told you to open your eyes!
And look!
We have a man down in the bathroom, we need backup right away!
Arrest him right now!
Watch out, he's got a gun!
Just stay here, no need to...
You don't need to worry about me anymore.
They can't hurt me anymore.
You can no longer take me away.
"I see you now!"
Hey, are you guys sleepy yet?
Why, what's up?
Have you ever heard the myth about sleeping in the jungle?
They say when you go camping you should never sleep on the edge.
How come?
Our punk ass friend Tiea once told me a story when he went camping and ended up sleeping on the edge.
When night fell, he heard the sounds of footsteps of a person walking towards him.
Then he felt as if someone was brushing up against his leg.
He was so startled that he sat up in his sleeping bag.
And you know what he saw...
A succubus!
A female ghost?
Sitting at the end of his feet.
Was she Hot?
Yeah, she looked really hot man, only if...
Dude, what a pervert, I haven't even finished my story yet and here you are changing the subject.
Now where was I...
Tiea, told me that
It was definitely a woman with very long hair covering her face.
Pale white complexion.
Just sitting there at the end of his feet.
So what did Tiea do?
What the hell do you think Tiea could do?
He just lay there with his eyes closed waiting for the sun to rise.
And you know what he did that very next day?
He shared his ordeal with one of the park rangers there.
The park ranger confessed to him that some time ago...
A woman accidentally drowned!
And do you know what?
The place where you are sleeping Shin, right here, is the exact same spot!
- Holy Shit... now you're in trouble.
- Man, that's scary!
My hairs are even standing on end.
Dude, don't talk about ghosts while we are here in the middle of the jungle.
- We better get some sleep.
- Hey hold on a sec.
Have you guys ever wondered why do all ghosts always have to be female with long hair covering their face and eyes?
Every time I watch a movie, it's the same old story.
- Have you ever seen the movie "Shutter"?
- You Asshole!
No I haven't seen "Shutter" yet, so don't spoil the ending for me.
You've never seen "Shutter"?
At the end of the story...
The ghost is sitting on the guy's shoulders.
- You are so full of it!
- No seriously!
- That's why his shoulders always hurt.
- That's enough!
I don't believe there are such things as ghosts.
When I was a guide, I brought some people kayaking.
I slept alone in the jungle.
I didn't see a damn thing!
You see, Shin you think too much.
Retard...
Real or not real, it really doesn't matter to me right now.
I am just scared.
For arguments sake
If one out of the four of us was to accidentally die.
Would you guys be scared?
If one of us died, I wouldn't be scared.
I think I would be more afraid if I was to die.
What a bastard man.
Seriously though
I think... if one of us were to die and it turned out to be Shin over here.
I think that would be the most horrifying.
How come?
Well just take a look at his face.
Even when he is alive he is scary!
Oh please...
Mr. handsome.
Mr. most good-looking jerk ass!
Why are you standing up?
- Because?
- Hey, Ter and Puak
Move aside so I can sleep in the middle.
You got to be joking, don't tell me you really are scared?
Well if you are so brave then why don't you sleep on the edge?
I am not scared, I'm just too damn lazy to move my ass.
Come on Ter
Ter
If you're not scared then just let me sleep in your spot.
What I meant was that I wouldn't be scared if one of us was a ghost.
But if I saw a ghost, hell yeah I would be scared.
Come on!
Please just let me sleep somewhere in the middle.
Man what is your problem?
Go back to sleep!
Hey can you assholes just stop acting so childish.
Let's just all go to sleep, I am really sleepy now.
Yeah...
Aey is sleepy, so shut up and go to sleep already.
Hey, I swear if I die
I'm going to come back and haunt whoever sleeps in the middle first.
Amen man!
May all your prayers come true!
Did you brush?
You breath stinks!
IN THE MIDDLE
Just keep our raft going down this general heading.
By the time we reach our camping grounds, it will be almost evening time.
Shin, why the hell are u looking at that damn compass anyway?
Can't you see that the river flows in only one direction!
It's not like we can turn towards some other direction.
I thought it would come in handy.
You numb-skull, just put it away.
I'm the king of the world!
Oh Please...
Puak, are you a retard too?
Why are you shouting?
Don't you remember Jack Dawson.
Haven't you ever watched the movie "Titanic"?
Jack was standing at the front of the boat when he screamed,
I'm the king of the world!
Puak, you're an idiot!
You're going to make the raft capsize.
No, I just want to be Jack.
Shin, don't tell me that you don't even know that the Titanic sank?
I haven't seen that movie yet.
What!
You haven't seen Titanic yet?
Did you know at the end of the movie, Rose is sitting on Jack's shoulders too.
Shutter, they copied the idea from Titanic.
- Really?
Are you serious?
- Yes of course it's true.
Titanic was the first to come up with the idea decades ago.
Damn Thai movies.
Aren't there any VDO stores around your house?
Heads Up!
It's time to rock n' roll!
Yeahhhhh...
Here were go!
Man, what a ride!
Shin, you got to help us paddle.
Puak you idiot!
Puak don't stand up!
Sit down before the raft flips over!
Puak!
Puak don't stand up!
Puak sit your ass down!
Puak!
Ter!
Help!
Shin?
Puak?
Shin?
Puak?
You guys ok?
OK, how about you?
Where the hell is Ter?
Oh yeah!
Where is Ter?
Ter!
Ter!
Ter!
Shit!
Ter, doesn't know how to swim very well.
Yeah...
So where is he?
- Ter!
- Damn!
Oh Shit!
Ter!
Help!
Ter!
Ter!
Ter!
Aey, Hurry up!
Help!
Ter, don't struggle!
Ter, stop struggling, you are pulling me down!
Help!
- Help!
- Ter, don't struggle!
Aey, be careful!
Oh!
Fuck!
Where are they?
Aey!
Ter!
Aey!
Where did they go?
Aey!
Ter!
There is Ter!
You're OK, I got you!
It's OK.
Sit down.
You're alright?
You're OK right?
Where is Aey?
- Aey, where is he?
- Aey!
- Aey!
- Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey, Where the hell are you?
Aey!
Do you think he is OK?
Yeah I think he is OK.
Hey, don't worry!
You are probably more stressed than he is right now.
Why the fuck are you even crying?
You don't even know if Aey is even dead yet.
If we find out for sure that he is dead, then you can cry.
But we already looked for him everywhere!
Hey don't think too much.
Tomorrow when we get out of the jungle, we can notify the park rangers to help us search for him again.
Tonight we better get some sleep.
Trust me tomorrow we have a long hike ahead of us.
Good night.
I'm gonna go to sleep now.
Ter, c'mon get some sleep.
What's wrong Ter, why don't you lay down and sleep?
Why aren't you sleeping in the same spot as before?
What do you mean by "the same spot"?
Last night I slept next to Aey.
So tonight I should get to sleep on the edge.
Oh Please...just pick a spot anywhere and go to sleep.
It's getting late damn it.
Ter, don't tell me that you are thinking about what Aey said to us.
What the hell are you talking about?
What he said about what he would do if he died?
He said he would come back and haunt the person in the middle first.
You bastard!
Aey isn't dead yet, you idiot!
Stop being retarded!
We will find him tomorrow, so just go to sleep will you?
If you are not scared then why don't you sleep in the middle?
Oh Man...
Shin!
Your feet really stink!
My feet don't smell.
The stench of your feet is damn strong.
Get them away from me.
Why did you to take a whiff of my feet?
Did you hear that?
What?
What noise?
It sounds like... someone is walking towards us.
Who's there?
Aey is that you?
Aey?
Aey?
Aey!
Aey you bastard, it's you!
We thought you were dead.
Aey, so what happened to you?
Shin, grab a towel and dry him off.
Sure.
Hey buddy are you ok?
Are you hurt anywhere?
How did you survive anyways?
I feel cold!
If he feels cold then dry him off, man.
Ok!
Aey go and change out of those wet clothes before you get sick.
I spent a lot of time looking for you.
We're happy to have you back.
It's amazing you survived.
You are so damn lucky man!
That's for sure.
Damn lucky!
Hey, where are you going?
I need a smoke.
Me too.
Where is your cigarette?
Yeah, I thought so.
You feel like something strange is going on here?
- Like what?
- Shit man!
Can you talk a little quieter?
I'm talking about Aey.
What about Aey?
What kind of person can be underwater for that long and not drown?
The fact he is OK is a blessing.
So stop thinking so negatively.
Aey.
Are you alright?
Aey?
Are you ok?
Aey?
Aey?
Aey!
Aey!
What's happening to you?
Huh?
What the hell are you doing out here?
You don't smoke.
I'm starting today.
Hey, take it easy.
You're way too old to act like a bad boy.
Ter.
Are you thinking what I am thinking?
What the fuck is wrong with both of you?
Puak...
What if Aey did die already?
Dead?
That's fucking impossible...
Who the hell is in that tent then?
Shit man!
Have you ever seen the movie The Sixth Sense?
Why?
The movie is about people who didn't know that they were dead already.
Really?
And why are you telling me this?
I didn't watch that movie yet.
Too Bad!
Now you know how I feel.
I think Aey came back to haunt you, Ter.
You are the jerk that caused him to drown.
Hey, don't talk shit like that.
I think he came back to haunt you because you cursed him to die!
What?
But you just told me that he isn't even dead yet?
I am just kidding...
you idiot!
Hey you guys think Aey is really dead, don't you?
I don't know, I could be thinking too much.
I think so, you guys think way too much.
I need to take a piss.
Well you better take a piss somewhere far away from the tent.
It's bad enough that Shin's feet already stink up the place.
I wanna go too.
Ter, why don't you take Aey with you?
Hey buddy
Do you realize that you are sweating a lot?
Are you OK?
You're not feeling cold anymore are you?
If you're feeling better, that's good.
Oh Shit!
Snake!
I'm so fucked man!
What the hell is the matter with you, Ter?
Aey, he's dead already!
Huh!
Aey, he is dead!
Do you know what you are saying?
Look, here he comes.
What the hell, Ter?
Aey, he's dead, I saw his body.
Man if you are joking around, this isn't funny at all!
I'm not shitting you!
I just saw his body floating in the river.
You're out of your mind.
Shit!
Ter, don't let go!
- What the fuck is wrong with you people?
- Aey!
- Puak, don't open it?
- Puak, Don't!
- Puak, Aey!
- But it's cold out there.
You guys are acting really retarded.
Holy Shit!
Why didn't you fucking stop me?
I don't think what we are doing is right?
Remember, he is our friend.
But he is a ghost now.
I can never be friends with a ghost!
Aey.
Leave us alone.
You're dead!
Do you hear me?
Aey.
You think he's gone?
Puak, go and take a look.
Why me?
Puak, just go man!
Asshole!
I think he is really gone.
Damn it, where are my glasses?
Has Aey really gone?
Not sure, maybe.
How the hell are we going to get down from here?
Well how did we get up here in the first place?
Hey...
this way man.
Where the hell is it?
Who's that?
Who ever the hell is there, just tell me who you are!
It's me.
Puak...
Fuck man, you really scared me!
There's nothing to be fucking scared of.
Just open your eyes.
Here you go.
You bastard.
Why didn't you hand it to me sooner?
Hey, Ter.
Shin, Puak!
Hurry man!
Shit!
It's Aey's body.
Shit Man!
What are we going to do now?
I think we better get the hell out of here and let the park rangers come and retrieve his body tomorrow.
Don't tell me you are going to take Aey's body with us, aren't you?
Let's just go!
Aey, I am sorry.
Wait a second.
Now what?
Let's just hurry and get out of here.
Aey!
What the hell are you doing, screaming out his name?
Aey!
What the hell are you yelling his name out for?
I am calling him over so I can show him his dead body.
This way he will realize that he is dead already and won't keep haunting us like this.
Aey!
Aey!
Come on out where ever you are.
Aey, you are dead!
So don't bother us anymore.
Here look, this is your dead body.
Look at it!
Ter!
Ter!
Look!
So what, are we dead or are we alive?
Puak!
Damn it,
The twist is just like in the movie "The Others"
Shit man,
Don't go and spoil the ending again, will you?
What the fuck are you worried about?
We're all already fucking dead, man!
This is what I've been trying to tell you all this time.
But you were all too busy being chicken shit to listen.
So I had to lead you here so you can see with your own eyes.
Shit!
Snake!
How about it... so, am I still your friend?
Yes, of course.
Hello
Hello Pim, did you just wake up?
Can we talk now or are you with your boyfriend?
Nope, I can talk.
So when are you going to introduce that hot boyfriend of yours to us?
So this affair is so hush hush that you don't even have time to see us anymore.
Can I help you with anything?
It's like this Pim, there is a special charter flight scheduled for tomorrow and they requested the same air crew as before.
Do you remember Prince Albert and his princess who chartered a plane for their honeymoon last year?
They are coming back again and want to stay in Phuket just like before.
Yes, I remember.
LAST FRIGHT
I also wonder why they requested to have the exact same crew as before.
The only difference this time is that the Princess will be traveling alone.
The rumor going around is that she was physically abused and is no longer the favorite flavor of the month.
The prince has somebody new.
Oh really, I'm sorry but tomorrow I am not free.
Can you try to find someone else to fly?
This request came down from the big boss, so there is no choice.
Last time it was you on that flight.
I just got done scheduling Tui for this flight too.
That's fine then.
What happened to Tui, why isn't she here yet?
Pim, it looks like you're going to have to fly solo.
Huh, how come?
Ter, Tui's younger brother drowned last night in Chiang Mai.
I can't find a replacement on such short notice.
That's fine.
Your Highness, May I humbly introduce myself as Pim Wongpoom.
May I have the honor of being your personal flight attendant on Flight 224.
Beverages will be served shortly, Your Highness.
Your Highness, would you care for coffee or tea?
Excuse me, Your Highness.
Would you care for coffee or tea?
Coffee or tea, Your Highness?
Coffee.
Sorry.
A fresh cup of coffee for you, Your Highness.
It doesn't matter.
Just bring me lunch.
Of course.
Just a moment, Your Highness.
Wait.
How's your arm?
It's fine, Your Highness.
I see you have a Persia ring too.
Can you take it off so I can have a closer look at it?
In my country, if a woman has an affair with a married man,
Do you know what the punishment is?
She is arrested...
Then undressed in public.
Then stoned till dead by the villagers.
And before she dies...
She has to get down on her knees and beg for forgiveness from the wife of the man she slept with.
Your Highness!
Your lunch, Your Highness.
I won't eat this kind of food.
But Your Highness,
This is what the Bureau of the Royal Household advised to serve to you.
I insist.
But, we have nothing else available to serve you.
How about your food?
Sorry.
I much prefer to have your food.
May I?
Suddenly, Your Highness.
"Remark:
Princess has an allergy to shrimp."
So you want to be picky, huh?
Your Highness.
Captain, we are about to land, would you like anything else?
No, thank you!
Okay.
Would you care for some water, Your Highness?
Phuket International Airport 22 hours later
Yesterday evening, Princess Sophia... of the Republic of Vanistan passed away in Phuket... at 9:00 pm in her private hotel suite, at the age of 34.
Doctors still have not determined the cause of death
The royal house has requested to have the body flown back to their country within 15 hours.
Golden Star Airlines... will schedule a special flight to deliver the princess's body back to her country within time.
Miss Pim, the Royal House has requested that we deliver the princess's body within 15 hours.
We cannot load her body in the cargo compartment being that she is a member of a Royal family.
So we have arranged for her body to be seated in the cabin.
Miss Pim, you must take good care of the princess's body.
No unauthorized personnel are allowed on this flight.
Yes, I understand.
Do you know that after this flight, you will be under investigation?
Yes
Captain,
Yes, Miss Pim?
Captain, can you please come out here for a second?
Why, what is the problem?
Ummm, I...
Just tell me what's wrong.
Forget it, it's nothing.
Miss Pim, we are in an area of heavy turbulence.
I'm Sorry.
Your food, captain.
Thank You
"Time to Destination 6 Hours"
Is there anything else Miss Pim?
Captain, please don't play any pranks on me.
Where is the princess's body?
What are you talking about?
You know you have broken a lot of in-flight regulations?
Try to get a hold of yourself!
The body of the Princess.
Where did you move her body to?
If you keep talking crazy like this I won't answer the phone anymore.
Captain!
Open the Door!
We need to land the plane now!
I demand that we land the plane right now!
Open!
You must open this door right now!
Open the door right now!
Open it!
Pim!
Let me go, let me go right now.
What is the matter with you, are you crazy?
Are you out of your mind?
Please go and look if the princess's body is there.
I've had enough!
I won't listen to anymore of your craziness.
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go right now!
Let me go!
Pim, when we land you will be under investigation.
Captain, just let me go, Please.
Let me go please!
I am scared.
I won't do it again.
Please...
No more.
I won't fool around with him anymore.
Please, just let me go.
Just arrive on board.

Hey man, you know you can't ride past us without saying, hi!
Deaw, we agreed not to cause any trouble today?
Let's go!
Come on hurry up!
Hurry up and step on it!
Hey, where do you think you're going, get over here right now!
You guys are out of control!
Huh?
What did you say?
Don't you think you guys are going too far?
Too far?
What do you mean, Pink?
What you guys...
Please...
Please don't hurt me!
I...
I...
I got to go visit my dad in the hospital.
Visit your father?
So you think that you are cool, getting us expelled?
I don't know anything about that.
I just wanted my notebook back.
What the hell kind of dumb ass excuse is that?
You know, opening a person's bag without permission is stealing!
If you only wanted your book, why didn't you just take it.
But when you saw the weed, why did you rat us out to the principle?
But I really didn't know that there was a teacher standing behind me.
Oh really?
You really didn't know huh?
- You didn't know huh?
- I bet you know now!
Please...
Please stop hurting me!
I'm so sorry!
You know what?
I think tomorrow you should leave.
And don't ever let me see your stinking ugly face here again!
Have I made myself perfectly clear?
You god damn loser!
What a piece of shit man!
You know what they do with trash?
Hey loser!
They either bury trash or burn it!
But in your case,
I think should be burned!
Hey!
You better make yourself disappear!
Transfer to another school or something.
If you don't want to be burned alive.
Don't ever let us see your face again!
Got it?
Hey!
Over here!
Look...
Here goes your bicycle!
It's a damn pity.
Your bike is over there.
You should go fetch it!
Hey man, why not just let him fall all the way over?
Damn!
Man, he almost fell over for real!
If he fell over, he'd hit the ground like a lump of shit!
Whoa!
Fucking shit man, that was close!
You can all stop betting.
The banker wins with a natural 9.
Banker cleans house!
Everyone pay up!
You want the shirt off my back too?
- Your shirt!
?
- Here just take it all man.
Hey chill out, don't get angry.
Hey, did you mark these cards?
Of course they're marked, how do you think I win all the time?
Hey, what kind of a face card is this?
Dude, that's ajoker!
I forgot to take it out... sorry.
Deaw
Hey if Ngid really got hurt, I really hope your dad will be able to help us out again.
Hey, Pink why do you even bring that up?
I think he's probably doing ok.
He probably dropped out of school by now.
You know, we need to stop smoking so much weed.
My dad yelled at me about this already.
If Ngid didn't find the weed, everything would be ok now.
Damn it!
He's better off dead!
Actually you know what?
Yesterday I saw his bike.
Yesterday afternoon while on my way home
His bike was still here.
But I didn't see him anywhere around.
Speak of the Devil!
Do you have a problem or something?
You want a piece of me?
So, the last time wasn't painful enough?
That's enough already!
You might really kill him this time!
Don't get in my way Pink!
You are all animals that deserve to die!
Yo, don't move!
Yo!
What the hell are you laughing at?
No!
Not me!
Go away.
Get away from me!
No!
Not me!
Deaw, what the hell are we going to do now?
Let's ditch this place and get out of here!
Go on!
Get out of here!
There's no time to grab anything!
Get out!
Move your ass!
What are we going to do?
Let's go to the hospital!
- Start the car damn it!
Let's go!
- Where's the nearest hospital?
On the ground floor of my apartment, there is a clinic.
That's the nearest one, let's just go there!
- Let's go!
Hurry!
- Come on!
Go already!
Yo
Here?
No!
No!
Not here, the next street!
Turn left on this street!
Ok!
Ok!
Yo!
Yo!
Tood, get your ass out of the car!
Come on!
Get out!
Yo!
How the hell am I going to explain this to her parents?
I think we better call the police!
Shit, there's a dead body downstairs!
That's our friend down there!
What the fuck is going on?
Damn it!
This is crazy!
Did u see Yogurt's face when she looked into the book?
And...
Ngid's horrified look on his face right before he fell out of the window...
Man, I got something to tell you all!
I saw
I saw
Saw what?
I saw...
I saw him doing...
You saw him doing what?
Hey, what if somebody sees us?
That's good!
It's more exciting that way.
And if it was one of the professors?
That's even better and even more exciting.
Hey do you hear that, over there...?
Girl, I think you're hearing things?
Stop!
Listen for yourself!
Who the hell is reciting prayers around here!
?
No, Bon I am not in the mood anymore.
Who the hell is that?
Whoever looks into your eyes will be cursed to die!
Shit man don't tell me that
Ngid was playing with black magic!
Probably to get us back for what we did to him.
His dad is an undertaker.
That would probably make sense of all this!
Or...
Or what?
Maybe the paper was cursed!
He probably took pictures of people who died with their eyes open and created a curse.
When you look at the picture, you are doomed to die.
I think it is written something like...
Hey!
What's This?
Something like..."I see you now"
I see you now
why the hell are all of you staring at me?
Deaw, don't look at it!
I didn't mean to...
I am sorry...
Is this what you call being burned alive?
Well, if you expect me to believe the testimony that you gave to us that would be difficult.
You're going to tell me that all of your friends died because of this book!
And I've assigned someone to contact your parents.
They should be here soon.
Please, wait here until they arrive.
Don't go anywhere.
We will be right back.
Ummm, would you like something to eat?
Pink
Look at me, look straight into my eyes!
Are we not part of the same gang?
Yeah, are we not all friends, Pink?
Pink, we are waiting for you?
Pink, come join us.
Pink come on give me your hand.
So we can be together.
You don't like us anymore?
It's your turn now.
No!
I don't have anything to do with all this!
The deadly curse was invoked when he used pictures of people who died with their eyes open, in the ritual of black magic.
I never did anything to you.
I was never involved in anything that happened.
That's right you didn't do anything, except stand idly by and watched.
And now...
This is what I want you to see.
Come on.
Look!
No, I don't want to look!
I didn't do anything to you.
I was never involved.
There is no way out of this.
Just take a look.
You're going to die anyways.
Just look, so you can die and we can end this now!
Open your eyes!
Take a look!
I told you to open your eyes!
And look!
We have a man down in the bathroom, we need backup right away!
Arrest him right now!
Watch out, he's got a gun!
Just stay here, no need to...
You don't need to worry about me anymore.
They can't hurt me anymore.
You can no longer take me away.
"I see you now!"
Hey, are you guys sleepy yet?
Why, what's up?
Have you ever heard the myth about sleeping in the jungle?
They say when you go camping you should never sleep on the edge.
How come?
Our punk ass friend Tiea once told me a story when he went camping and ended up sleeping on the edge.
When night fell, he heard the sounds of footsteps of a person walking towards him.
Then he felt as if someone was brushing up against his leg.
He was so startled that he sat up in his sleeping bag.
And you know what he saw...
A succubus!
A female ghost?
Sitting at the end of his feet.
Was she Hot?
Yeah, she looked really hot man, only if...
Dude, what a pervert, I haven't even finished my story yet and here you are changing the subject.
Now where was I...
Tiea, told me that
It was definitely a woman with very long hair covering her face.
Pale white complexion.
Just sitting there at the end of his feet.
So what did Tiea do?
What the hell do you think Tiea could do?
He just lay there with his eyes closed waiting for the sun to rise.
And you know what he did that very next day?
He shared his ordeal with one of the park rangers there.
The park ranger confessed to him that some time ago...
A woman accidentally drowned!
And do you know what?
The place where you are sleeping Shin, right here, is the exact same spot!
- Holy Shit... now you're in trouble.
- Man, that's scary!
My hairs are even standing on end.
Dude, don't talk about ghosts while we are here in the middle of the jungle.
- We better get some sleep.
- Hey hold on a sec.
Have you guys ever wondered why do all ghosts always have to be female with long hair covering their face and eyes?
Every time I watch a movie, it's the same old story.
- Have you ever seen the movie "Shutter"?
- You Asshole!
No I haven't seen "Shutter" yet, so don't spoil the ending for me.
You've never seen "Shutter"?
At the end of the story...
The ghost is sitting on the guy's shoulders.
- You are so full of it!
- No seriously!
- That's why his shoulders always hurt.
- That's enough!
I don't believe there are such things as ghosts.
When I was a guide, I brought some people kayaking.
I slept alone in the jungle.
I didn't see a damn thing!
You see, Shin you think too much.
Retard...
Real or not real, it really doesn't matter to me right now.
I am just scared.
For arguments sake
If one out of the four of us was to accidentally die.
Would you guys be scared?
If one of us died, I wouldn't be scared.
I think I would be more afraid if I was to die.
What a bastard man.
Seriously though
I think... if one of us were to die
and it turned out to be Shin over here.
I think that would be the most horrifying.
How come?
Well just take a look at his face.
Even when he is alive he is scary!
Oh please...
Mr. Handsome.
Mr. Most good-looking jerk ass!
Why are you standing up?
- Because?
- Hey, Ter and Puak
Move aside so I can sleep in the middle.
You got to be joking, don't tell me you really are scared?
Well if you are so brave then why don't you sleep on the edge?
I am not scared, I'm just too damn lazy to move my ass.
Come on Ter
Ter
If you're not scared then just let me sleep in your spot.
What I meant was that I wouldn't be scared if one of us was a ghost.
But if I saw a ghost, hell yeah I would be scared.
Come on!
Please just let me sleep somewhere in the middle.
Man what is your problem?
Go back to sleep!
Hey can you assholes just stop acting so childish.
Let's just all go to sleep, I am really sleepy now.
Yeah...
Aey is sleepy, so shut up and go to sleep already.
Hey, I swear if I die
I'm going to come back and haunt whoever sleeps in the middle first.
Amen man!
May all your prayers come true!
Did you brush?
You breath stinks!
Just keep our raft going down this general heading.
By the time we reach our camping grounds, it will be almost evening time.
Shin, why the hell are u looking at that damn compass anyway?
Can't you see that the river flows in only one direction!
It's not like we can turn towards some other direction.
I thought it would come in handy.
You numbskull, just put it away.
I'm the king of the world!
Oh Please...
Puak, are you a retard too?
Why are you shouting?
Don't you remember Jack Dawson.
Haven't you ever watched the movie "Titanic"?
Jack was standing at the front of the boat when he screamed,
I'm the king of the world!
Puak, you're an idiot!
You're going to make the raft capsize.
No, I just want to be Jack.
Shin, don't tell me that you don't even know that the Titanic sank?
I haven't seen that movie yet.
What!
You haven't seen Titanic yet?
Did you know at the end of the movie, Rose is sitting on Jack's shoulders too.
Shutter, they copied the idea from Titanic.
- Really?
Are you serious?
- Yes of course it's true.
Titanic was the first to come up with the idea decades ago.
Damn Thai movies.
Aren't there any vdo stores around your house?
Heads Up!
It's time to rock n' roll!
Yeahhhhh...
Here were go!
Man, what a ride!
Shin, you got to help us paddle.
Puak you idiot!
Puak don't stand up!
Sit down before the raft flips over!
Puak!
Puak don't stand up!
Puak sit your ass down!
Puak!
Ter!
Help!
Shin?
Puak?
Shin?
Puak?
You guys ok?
OK, how about you?
Where the hell is Ter?
Oh yeah!
Where is Ter?
Ter!
Ter!
Ter!
Shit!
Ter, doesn't know how to swim very well.
Yeah...
So where is he?
- Ter!
- Damn!
Oh Shit!
Ter!
Help!
Ter!
Ter!
Ter!
Aey, Hurry up!
Help!
Ter, don't struggle!
Ter, stop struggling, you are pulling me down!
Help!
- Help!
- Ter, don't struggle!
Aey, be careful!
Oh!
Fuck!
Where are they?
Aey!
Ter!
Aey!
Where did they go?
Aey!
Ter!
There is Ter!
You're ok, I got you!
It's OK.
Sit down.
You're alright?
You're ok right?
Where is Aey?
- Aey, where is he?
- Aey!
- Aey!
- Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey!
Aey, where the hell are you?
Aey!
Do you think he is ok?
Yeah I think he is ok.
Hey, don't worry!
You are probably more stressed than he is right now.
Why the fuck are you even crying?
You don't even know if Aey is even dead yet.
If we find out for sure that he is dead, then you can cry.
But we already looked for him everywhere!
Hey don't think too much.
Tomorrow when we get out of the jungle, we can notify the park rangers to help us search for him again.
Tonight we better get some sleep.
Trust me tomorrow we have a long hike ahead of us.
Good night.
I'm gonna go to sleep now.
Ter, c'mon get some sleep.
What's wrong Ter, why don't you lay down and sleep?
Why aren't you sleeping in the same spot as before?
What do you mean by "the same spot"?
Last night I slept next to Aey.
So tonight I should get to sleep on the edge.
Oh Please...
just pick a spot anywhere and go to sleep.
It's getting late damn it.
Ter, don't tell me that you are thinking about what Aey said to us.
What the hell are you talking about?
What he said about what he would do if he died?
He said he would come back and haunt the person in the middle first.
You bastard!
Aey isn't dead yet, you idiot!
Stop being retarded!
We will find him tomorrow, sojust go to sleep will you?
If you are not scared then why don't you sleep in the middle?
Oh Man...
Shin!
Your feet really stink!
My feet don't smell.
The stench of your feet is damn strong.
Get them away from me.
Why did you to take a whiff of my feet?
Did you hear that?
What?
What noise?
It sounds like... someone is walking towards us.
Who's there?
Aey is that you?
Aey?
Aey?
Aey!
Aey you bastard, it's you!
We thought you were dead.
Aey, so what happened to you?
Shin, grab a towel and dry him off.
Sure.
Hey buddy are you ok?
Are you hurt anywhere?
How did you survive anyways?
I feel cold!
If he feels cold then dry him off, man.
Ok!
Aey go and change out of those wet clothes before you get sick.
I spent a lot of time looking for you.
We're happy to have you back.
It's amazing you survived.
You are so damn lucky man!
That's for sure.
Damn lucky!
Hey, where are you going?
I need a smoke.
Me too.
Where is your cigarette?
Yeah, I thought so.
You feel like something strange is going on here?
- Like what?
- Shit man!
Can you talk a little quieter?
I'm talking about Aey.
What about Aey?
What kind of person can be underwater for that long and not drown?
The fact he is ok is a blessing.
So stop thinking so negatively.
Aey.
Are you alright?
Aey?
Are you ok?
Aey?
Aey?
Aey!
Aey!
What's happening to you?
Huh?
What the hell are you doing out here, you don't smoke?
I'm starting today.
Hey take it easy.
You're way too old to act like a bad boy.
Ter.
Are you thinking, what I am thinking?
What the fuck is wrong with both of you?
Puak... what if Aey did die already?
Dead?
That's fucking impossible... who the hell is in that tent then?
Shit man have you ever seen the movie The Sixth Sense?
Why?
The movie is about people who didn't know that they were dead already.
Really?
And why are you telling me this?
I didn't watch that movie yet.
Too Bad!
Now you know how I feel.
I think Aey came back to haunt you, Ter.
You are the jerk that caused him to drown.
Hey, don't talk shit like that.
I think he came back to haunt you because you cursed him to die!
What?
But you just told me that he isn't even dead yet?
I am just kidding... you idiot!
Hey you guys think Aey is really dead, don't you?
I don't know, I could be thinking too much.
I think so, you guys think way too much.
I need to take a piss.
Well you better take a piss somewhere far away from the tent.
It's bad enough that Shin's feet already stink up the place.
I wanna go too.
Ter, why don't you take Aey with you?
Hey buddy
Do you realize that you are sweating a lot?
Are you Ok?
You're not feeling cold anymore are you?
If you're feeling better, that's good.
Oh Shit!
Snake!
I'm so fucked man!
What the hell is the matter with you, Ter?
Aey, he's dead already!
HUH!
Aey, he is dead!
Do you know what you are saying?
Look, here he comes.
What the hell, Ter?
Aey, he's dead, I saw his body.
Man if you are joking around, this isn't funny at all!
I'm not shitting you!
I just saw his body floating in the river.
You're out of your mind.
SHIT!
Ter, don't let go!
- What the fuck is wrong with you people?
- Aey!
- Puak, don't open it?
- Puak, Don't!
- Puak, Aey!
- But it's cold out there.
You guys are acting really retarded.
Holy Shit!
Why didn't you fucking stop me?
I don't think what we are doing is right?
Remember, he is our friend.
But he is a ghost now.
I can never be friends with a ghost!
Aey.
Leave us alone.
You're dead!
Do you hear me?
Aey.
You think he's gone?
Puak, go and take a look.
Why me?
Puak, just go man!
Asshole!
I think he is really gone.
Damn it, where are my glasses?
Has Aey really gone?
Not sure, maybe.
How the hell are we going to get down from here?
Well how did we get up here in the first place?
Hey... this way man.
Where the hell is it?
Who's that?
Who ever the hell is there, just tell me who you are!
It's me.
Puak...
Fuck man, you really scared me!
There's nothing to be fucking scared of.
Just open your eyes.
Here you go.
You bastard.
Why didn't you hand it to me sooner?
Hey, Ter.
Shin...
Puak!
Hurry man!
Shit!
It's Aey's body.
Shit Man!
What are we going to do now?
I think we better get the hell out of here and let the park rangers come and retrieve his body tomorrow.
Don't tell me you are going to take Aey's body with us, aren't you?
Let's just go!
Aey, I am sorry.
Wait a second.
Now what?
Let's just hurry and get out of here.
Aey!
What the hell are you doing, screaming out his name?
Aey!
What the hell are you yelling his name out for?
I am calling him over so I can show him his dead body.
This way he will realize that he is dead already and won't keep haunting us like this.
Aey!
Aey!
Come on out where ever you are.
Aey, you are dead!
So don't bother us anymore.
Here look, this is your dead body.
Look at it!
Ter!
Ter!
Look!
So what, are we dead or are we alive?
Puak!
Damn it, the twist is just like in the movie "The Others".
Shit man, don't go and spoil the ending again, will you?
What the fuck are you worried about?
We're all already fucking dead, man!
This is what I've been trying to tell you all this time.
But you were all too busy being chicken shit to listen.
So I had to lead you here so you can see with your own eyes.
Shit!
Snake!
How about it... so, am I still your friend?
Yes, of course.
Hello
Hello Pim, did you just wake up?
Can we talk now or are you with your boyfriend?
Nope, I can talk.
So when are you going to introduce that hot boyfriend of yours to us?
So this affair is so hush hush that you don't even have time to see us anymore.
Can I help you with anything?
It's like this Pim, there is a special charter flight scheduled for tomorrow and they requested the same air crew as before.
Do you remember Prince Albert and his princess who chartered a plane for their honeymoon last year?
They are coming back again and want to stay in Phuket just like before.
Yes, I remember.
I also wonder why they requested to have the exact same crew as before.
The only difference this time is that the Princess will be traveling alone.
The rumor going around is that she was physically abused and is no longer the favorite flavor of the month.
The prince has somebody new.
Oh really, I'm sorry but tomorrow I am not free.
Can you try to find someone else to fly?
This request came down from the big boss, so there is no choice.
Last time it was you on that flight.
I just got done scheduling Tui for this flight too.
That's fine then.
What happened to Tui, why isn't she here yet?
Pim, it looks like you're going to have to fly solo.
Huh, how come?
Ter, Tui's younger brother drowned last night in Chiang Mai.
I can't find a replacement on such short notice.
That's fine.
Your Highness, May I humbly introduce myself as Pim wongpoom.
May I have the honor of being your personal flight attendant on Flight 224.
Beverages will be served shortly, Your Highness.
Your Highness, would you care for coffee or tea?
Excuse me, Your Highness.
Would you care for coffee or tea?
Coffee or tea, Your Highness?
Coffee.
Sorry.
A fresh cup of coffee for you, Your Highness.
It doesn't matter.
Just bring me lunch.
Of course.
Just a moment, Your Highness.
Wait.
How's your arm?
It's fine, Your Highness.
I see you have a Persia ring too.
Can you take it off so I can have a closer look at it?
In my country, if a woman has an affair with a married man,
Do you know what the punishment is?
She is arrested...
Then undressed in public.
Then stoned till dead by the villagers.
And before she dies...
She has to get down on her knees and beg for forgiveness from the wife of the man she slept with.
Your Highness!
Your lunch, Your Highness.
I won't eat this kind of food.
But Your Highness,
This is what the Bureau of the Royal Household advised to serve to you.
I insist.
But we have nothing else available to serve you.
How about your food?
Sorry.
I much prefer to have your food.
May I?
Suddenly, Your Highness.
"Remark:
Princess has an allergy to shrimp."
So you want to be picky, huh?
Your Highness.
Captain, we are about to land would you like anything else?
No thank you!
Okay.
Would you care for some water, Your Highness?
Phuket International Airport, 22 hours Later
Yesterday evening Princess Sophia of the Republic of vanistan passed away in Phuket.
At 9:00 pm.
In her private hotel suite, at the age of 34.
Doctors still have not determined the cause of dea
The royal house has requested to have the body flown back to their country within 15 hours.
Golden Star Airlines will schedule a special flight to deliver the princess's body back to her country within time.
Miss Pim, the Royal House has requested that we deliver the princess's body within 15 hours.
We cannot load her body in the cargo compartment being that she is a member of a Royal family.
So we have arranged for her body to be seated in the cabin.
Miss Pim, you must take good care of the princess's body.
No unauthorized personnel are allowed on this flight.
Yes, I understand.
Do you know that after this flight you will be under investigation?
Yes
Captain,
Yes, Miss Pim?
Captain, can you please come out here for a second?
Why what is the problem?
Ummm, I...
Just tell me what's wrong.
Forget it, it's nothing.
Miss Pim, we are in an area of heavy turbulence.
I'm Sorry.
Your food, captain.
Thank You
"Time to Destination 6 Hours"
Is there anything else Miss Pim?
Captain, please don't play any pranks on me.
Where is the princess's body?
What are you talking about?
You know you have broken a lot of in-flight regulations?
Try to get a hold of yourself!
The body of the Princess.
Where did you move her body to?
If you keep talking crazy like this I won't answer the phone anymore.
Captain!
Open the Door!
We need to land the plane now!
I demand that we land the plane right now!
Open!
You must open this door right now!
Open the door right now!
Open it!
Pim!
Let me go, let me go right now.
What is the matter with you, are you crazy?
Are you out of your mind?
Please go and look if the princess's body is there.
I've had enough!
I won't listen to anymore of your craziness.
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go right now!
Let me go!
Pim, when we land you will be under investigation.
Captain, just let me go, please.
Let me go please!
I am scared.
I won't do it again.
Please... no more.
I won't fool around with him anymore.
Please, just let me go.
Just arrive aboard.

Loneliness
I'm so lonely
From Puak:
"A lonely girl desperately seeking a rich man.
Good looks is a must."
Puak, you're so cruel.
I hope you drown at Chiangmai.
Then, you"ll be all alone.
Just like me.
Haha.
Puak :
You"re foul mouthed.
Take care!
They'll be coming for the rents.
They were here.
Almost broke down my front door!
Have a nice camping trip.
May I know you?
Just want to be your friend.
Do I know you?
Not right now, later, maybe...?
A you a girl or a guy?
A guy.
Sorry.
The number you"ve just dialled is not available.
Please try again later.
Hello :)
New message... 0
Hi, its me.
What are you doing?
Enjoying the night at the balcony.
And you?
Lying down.
All alone...
Do you have any MSN account?
Sorry, I have no room for a computer.
My place is so crammed.
Too bad...
If you"re bored we could chat on MSN.
I am not bored...
Are you?
No.
Just lonely.
Have been confined in my room for quite a while.
Me too.
Have been alone for a 100 days.
Are you sick or something?
No..
Just unlucky.
The taxi I was in, was involved in an accident.
My leg has been in a cast for more than 3 months.
Cheer up!
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Gone to bed yet?
No, not sleepy right now.
May I have your photo?
Why don't we swap photos.
Ok?
No problem.
Why don't you send yours first.
Not as pretty as you would have imagined...
Not as handsome as you expected...
Cheater!
That's my photo.
Look again.
I'm by your side.
Phone number search.
Sorry.
The number you've just dialled has been disconnected.
Son of Princess Sophia of Virnistan passed away at Phuket.
Causes still unknown.
It is 100 days since the funeral.
Rumours have it that he took his own life.
It is also rumoured that she left her cell phone in his coffin.
In case her son feels lonely
Or wants to get in touch with her.
Me too.
Have been alone for a 100 days.
Why are you afraid?
Don't put down the phone or you"ll be sorry.
I'm passing by your apartment.
Can I meet you?
No, please...
My boyfriend will be upset.
That's a lie!
He's not there.
You"re all alone...
I'm at the entrance of your apartment.
Coming up...
I'm here...
From Oh...
Ton, I want to break up with you.
I have a new boyfriend...
Hey undertaker!
Are you running from us?
Let me handle this!
Let's go!
Hurry up!
Where are you going?
Let's take a ride!
I think we're over reacting.
Huh, what did you say?
Don't you think it's a bit excessive.
The way you"re treating him.
What's that Pink?
I can't hear you.
It's what you"re doing...
Please.
Stop...
Don't hurt me...
My father is sick in the hospital.
I have to see him.
Because of you all of us are suspended from school.
I...
I did not wish for that to happen.
I just wanted my notebook back.
That's just an excuse.
Only a thief will open other's bag without permission.
And why didn't you mind your own business?
Why did you report to the teachers about the drugs?
I didn't know they were there.
You didn't know?
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.
I think, it would be better if you quit the school tommorrow.
I don't want to see your ugly face anymore!
Don't let me see you again!
What are we going to do with him?
Undertaker!
You are a discard, understand?
A discard!
Rubbish should be burnt!
You'd better disappear from the face of this earth!
Move out of school...
Or you"ll be burnt alive!
Understand?
Get out of our sight!
Stand up!
Is this your bicycle?
Why don't you go after it!
Should we push him out?
Look at him!
He's scared out of his wits!
Shit!
He almost fell out!
The Deadly Charm
I"ve got 7.
Mine's 9.
I lose.
I lose again.
What's the bet this time?
This is really boring.
Think positive.
You're lucky with cards!
Let's see how I fare this time.
Hey!
What kind of a card is that?
Hmm.
That's a Joker... you idiot.
Diew, if Ngeed dies...
Will your father be able to help us again?
Hey Pink, why do you say that?
I think he's just fine.
And he"ll quit school for sure.
And we should all quit the drugs.
My dad got mad at me for getting suspended.
If Ngeed didn't stumble on it, nobody would've known about the drugs.
Maybe he's better of dead.
Speaking of him...
Saw his bike on my way home yesterday.
His bike is still there.
But no signs of him...
What the hell...
Are you looking for trouble, undertaker?
The last beating wasn't enough for you?
Haven't you learnt your lesson?
Enough!
Stop it!
He's had enough!
Mind your own business, Pink!
You"re nothing but trash.
All of you deserve to die.
Yo, keep still!
Why the hell are you laughing?
No!
No!
No!
Not me!
No!
Not me!
What happened?
Diew, what should we do?
Let's get out of here!
Hurry up!
Get out of here!
What are we going to do?
The hospital!
Hurry up!
Where's the nearest hospital?
There's a clinic near my place.
Go there!
Alright.
Alright..
Yo!
Ping!
Is this it?
No, next lane.
Yes turn into this lane.
Yo!
Yo! Get her out.
Hurry!
Yo!
Yo!
What do we tell Yo's parents?
Let's go to the police, there's a dead body down there!
But she's our friend!
What..
What the hell..
What the hell is going on?
Something's not right...
Did you see Yo's face when she opened the book?
And Ngeed was in a state of shock before he fell.
I saw...
I saw what he was doing...
What if someone sees us here...?
Good.
Make it more exiting!
But, what if, it's the teacher?
Great.
Make it doubly exciting!
What's that noise?
Just ignore it.
Stop and listen!
Hell!
Who is chanting his prayers here?
Ball, I'm not in the mood anymore.
Who is that?
Look into my eyes!
Are you telling me, Ngeed practised black magic?
Is he planning his revenge on us?
His father in an undertaker.
It's resonable for him to practise black magic.
Or maybe...
Maybe what, Ed?
He was performing the rituals of the Deadly Charm.
To perform the rituals of The Deadly Charm, you need a photo of someone who died with his eyes open.
Anybody who looks into the eye will be found dead.
There's something written on this photo.
"I am watching you.." Something like that?
I am watching you...
What are you looking at?
I didn't mean to do it.
I'm sorry...
How does it look, to be burnt alive?
What you have told us.
Is beyond imagination...
They're just unbelieveable...
Are you saying these books killed your friends?
I got hold of your parents.
They're on their way.
Please stay in the room.
Make yourself comfortable.
We"ll be right back.
Hungry?
You want something to eat?
Pink.
Look at me, Pink.
Aren't you part of the gang?
Aren't we your friends, Pink?
We're waiting for you Pink.
Don't leave us Pink.
Give me your hand Pink.
Come with us.
Don't you like me anymore?
It's your turn now.
No, I was not involved in this.
To perform the rituals of The Deadly Charm, you need a photo of someone who died with his eyes open.
I have never hurt you.
I was not involved.
Right, you just stood still and didn't do anything...
And this is what I want you to see.
Look at it!
- No I won't.
Please...
I have never hurt you.
I was not involved.
You cannot run away from your guilt!
Look at it!
This will end right here!
Look at it!
Look at it!
Emergency!
Emergency!
A policeman has been shot.
Get him!
Be careful, he's got a gun!
Miss, please stay here, don't...
You don't have to worry.
They won't get to me.
They cannot take me.
I am watching you...!
- Hey are you asleep yet?
- No, what is it?
Have you heard this before:
"Don't sleep at the outer fringe if you're in the woods at night."
- And why not?
- Tia once told me that..
He slept on the outer fringe while in the woods one night.
And late at night...
He heard footsteps approaching closer and closer towards him.
Then he felt a touch on his leg.
Frightened, he opened his eyes slowly.
And what did he see?
..
A beautiful woman...
Is the ghost cute?
She was just standing there..
Of course...
Hey let me finish the story, ok?
Tia just said that she was a woman.
With black, beautiful, flowing hair, covering her face...
Pale skin...
Sitting at his feet..
So what did he do?
He didn't know what to do..
He just closed his eyes tight until it was dawn.
In the morning he went to ask the local people there.
They said, a woman had drowned in a river close to where he was camped.
And the location where Tia once slept...
Is where you are sleeping right now, Chin.
- What the hell!
- I'm having goose pimples right now..
Shit!
Why tell a ghost story in the middle of the night!
Wait a minute..
You don't believe that bullshit, do you?
Why must ghosts always be females, with long hair, covering their faces?
Evey horror movies I've watched have similar ghosts...
Have you seen the film Shutter?
Shit!
I haven't.
Please don't spoil it for me!
Really..
You've not watched Shutter?
At the end, the ghost was sitting on the lead actor's shoulders.
Shit!
You spoilt it for me!
It's true.
That is why he always have neck pains.
Seriously,
I don't believe ghost exists.
I've camped here before.
Slept alone...
And nothing happened.
Right...
There's nothing to worry Chin.
Ghost or no ghost is besides the point.
I'm about to pee in my pants right this moment.
Here's a thought.
What if...
One of us dies all of a sudden..
Will you be scared?
If its you, of course I won't be frightened
But I'll be really scared if...
I have to die.
Come to think of it, amongst the four of us...
Chin will be the scariest ghost.
Why?
Look at his face.
His looks is already so scary while still alive!
What about you?
So handsome huh?
-What's going on?
Ter, Puak move aside, I want to sleep in the middle.
Hey, are you really scared?
You aren't scared, so go sleep on the outside.
I'm not scared, just too lazy to move.
Ter..
Ter..
You're not scared right?
Let me sleep here, please...
I won't be scared if you die, but I'm scared of real ghosts.
Let me sleep in the middle please...
Don't push me, go away!
Hey stop arguing.
Lets's sleep.
I'm sleepy now.
See, Ae is sleepy now.
Go back to your place.
And if I die, I"ll come back,
And haunt the one in the middle first!
Sure...
I hope you die soon!
The Man In The Middle
We have to go this way.
It"ll lead us to the campground.
Could be there by dusk.
Chin, no need to use the compass.
The river flows only one way.
Yeah look.
Just follow the river.
There's no other way.
Is there?
I'm just being cautious.
That's why I brought the compass.
Never mind.
Just put it away.
I am the king of the world.
Puak, are you crazy or something?
Jack Dawson...
Have you watched TITANIC?
He was on the ship shouting,
"I am the king of the world"
Do you want our boat to sink too?
Like the Titanic?
Of course not!
I just want to be Jack.
Chin, don't tell me you don't know,
That the Titanic sank !
?
I have never watched it yet.
Haven't watched TITANIC?
Did you know, at the end, Rose was on Jack's neck.
SHUTTER copied this scene.
Really?
True...
Titanic was released more than 10 years ago.
Damn, copycat Thai movies!
Does your village has a movie rental store?
Hey, here comes the fun!
What a thrill!
Be careful!
Puak, sit down!
- Chin, Puak.
Are you ok?
- Ok, and you ?
Where is Ter?
Ter!
Ter!
Ter!
He's not a good swimmer!
Over there!
Damn!
Ter!
Ter!
Ter!
Help!
Ter!
Help, Help!
Ter!
Ter, don't struggle!
What happened to them!
?
Where are they?
Ter!
Be careful.
Sit down.
Sit down.
I'm okay...
Where's Ae?
Ae!
Where are you!
?
Do you think he's alright?
Yes, I think he's safe.
Don't worry.
You're the one who's worried!
Else why are you crying?
Ae's still alive.
If he dies...
Then it's time to cry.
But we looked for him everywhere...
Don't worry about him.
Tomorrow, we"ll ask for help, from the local people here.
Why don't we take a rest.
We have a very long day tommorrow.
I'm going to bed.
Ter...
Let's go.
Ter?
What's the matter Ter?
Why didn't you sleep in the same position?
Same position?
Last night I slept on Ae's side.
I should be sleeping on the fringe.
C'mon..
Don't make a fuss.
Just go to sleep.
Ter, are you thinking about what Ae said last night..?
What are you babbling about?
He said if he dies, he'd haunt the one who's sleeping in the middle.
C'mon..
Ae is still alive.
He's not dead!
You're talking rubbish!
We'll find him tomorrow, let's sleep.
If you're not afraid, could you sleep in the middle?
Damn you Chin!
Your feet are horrible!
I didn't smell anything.
Take your feet out of my face!
Put your nose away from my feet then.
Shh..
Did you hear that?
What's that?
What's that noise?
Sounds like footsteps approching our tent.
Who's that?
Ae, is that you?
Ae.
Ae..
Ae!
I thought you drowned!
Ae, how are you?
Chin, get him a towel.
Are you feeling okay?
Any injuries?
How did you get back here?
I'm so cold...
Let me wipe you.
Why don't you change your clothes.
It's all wet.
We searched for you for quite a while!
I'm so glad you're fine.
Yes, he looks fine.
Can't find any injuries.
This is great!
You're one lucky guy!
Hey!
Where're you going?
- Smoke.
- I'll keep you company.
Thought you want to smoke?
Let me have one.
Don't you think it's strange?
- What's strange?
- Hush...
Keep your voice down.
I mean to say, Ae..
Why?
He almost drowned today.
But he acts as if nothing happened.
It's good that he's fine.
Isn't it?
Ae..
Are you all right?
Ae..
Are you okay?
Ae..
Ae..
Ae..
What are you doing out here?
You don't smoke!
I'm starting right now!
Take it easy..
Welcome to the man's world...
Ter..
Are you thinking, What I'm thinking?
What the heck are you talking about?
Puak...
I think Ae is dead.
Bullshit!
If he's dead, who's in the tent then?
Damn, haven't you watched THE SIXTH SENSE?
Why?
The ghost does not know that he is already dead.
Idiot!
You spoiled it for me!
Haven't seen it yet!
It's my turn...
Or did he come back to take revenge on you, Ter?
He drowned saving your life.
Idiot!
Don't be ridiculous!
I think he's back because...
you cursed him to die!
But I thought you said he's alive!
Didn't you?
I was only kidding!
Hehehe!
Do you really think he's dead?
Don't know, maybe I'm confused.
That's right.
You think too much.
I'm going to pee then.
Go pee far away from the tent.
Chin's foot is more than enough to make me sick.
Hold on..
I"ll go too.
Ter, why don't you go with Ae then?
Looks like, you're sweating a lot.
Are you okay?
Not feeling cold anymore?
Hmm..
Okay, that's good.
Corpse!
Damn it..
Damn it..
What's wrong with you, Ter?
Ae is dead!
I said, Ae is dead!
What are you talking about?
There he is, on his way back.
What are you doing, Ter?
Believe me, Ae is dead.
I saw his corpse.
Are you kidding me?
That's not funny!
Its true!
I saw his corpse floating out there.
Crazy..
Ter, don't let him in!
What is wrong with you people?
Don't tease him.
It's so cold outside.
Let him in.
We cannot let him in!
Why is he doing this to us?
He's still our friend, isn't he?
But he's dead!
You're a ghost.
Not our friend!
Ae..
Please leave us alone.
You're already dead!
Ae..
Has he left?
Puak, why don't you take a look?
What!
Why me?
I think he's gone.
Shit!
Where's my glasses?
Is Ae dead?
Maybe...
Oh shit!
How do we get down?
How did we get up here so high?
Who's that?
Who's there?
Tell me who are you?
Hey it's me, Puak.
Shit!
You scared the hell out of me!
What are you afraid of?
Here's your glasses.
Why can't I find it earlier?
You scared the shit out of me!
Is that you, Ter?
Chin, Puak..
Hurry !
Ae's body!
What should we do now?
Why don't we get out of here first!
We'll inform the authorities to pick up his body later.
We're not taking his body with us, right?
Ae, forgive me...
Wait...
What are you waiting for?
Lets' go.
Ae!
Why are you calling for him?
Stop calling for him!
I'm calling for him to look at his body.
Only then will he realise, he is dead.
Ae!
You are already dead! Ae, please look...
This is your body!
Look!
Ter...
Ter..
Look at it..
So.. are we humans or ghosts?
Damn!
Same twisted story like THE OTHERS!
Shit!
You spoilt it again!
Why do you have to worry?
We are all dead!
I've tried to tell all of you.
But you kept running away from me, scared...
So I let you see them for yourselves.
So?
Are we still friends?
I guess so..
Yes...
Hello Pim, just woke up?
Can we talk?
Are you with your boyfriend?
No.
I'm alone.
So when will you take your boyfrind to meet us?
Are you afraid I'll take him away from you?
Anything I can do for you?
Pim, we have a special flight tomorrow.
Remember Prince Albert and his princess?
They booked our airlines, for their honeymoon last year?
They have requested the same team of flight staff.
They'd like our airlines to take them to Phuket again.
Yes, I remember...
The Last Flight
I do not understand either.
Why ask for the same team of flight staff,
When only the Princess is going to Phuket.
Rumours have it that she's fallen out of favour.
And the Prince has a new flame.
Really?
But I've made other arragements.
Can't you find a replacement.
Hey Pim, the boss said it must be you.
Nobody else.
Because you"ve served them very well before.
I've just convinced Tui to join you too.
Yes, ok then.
I Understand..
Where's Tui?
Why isn't he here yet?
Pim, I'm afraid you have to go alone.
Why ?
What happened to Tui?
Tui's brother, Ter was found drowned at Chiangmai last night.
I can't find others to go with you.
Really?
Your Highness,
May I humbly introduce myself as Pim Wongpoom.
May I have the honour of being your personal flight attendant on Flight 224.
Beverage will be served shortly, your highness.
Your highness, would you care for a coffee or tea?
Excuse me, your highness.
Would you care for coffee or tea?
Coffee or tea, your highness?
Coffee.
Sorry...
A fresh cup of coffee for you, your highness.
It doesn't matter.
Just bring me lunch.
Of course.
Just a moment, your highness.
Wait.
How's your arm?
It is fine, your highness.
I see you have a Virnistan ring too.
Can you take it off, so I can have a closer look at it?
In my country..
if a woman has an affair with a married man...
Do you know what the punishment is?
She'll get arrested.
Then undressed in public.
Then stoned to death by the villagers.
And before she dies...
She has to get down on her knees...
And beg for forgiveness from the wife of the man she slept with.
Your highness...
Your lunch, your highness.
I won't eat this kind of food.
But your highness,
This is what the royal household has asked to be served.
I insist.
But we have nothing else available to serve you.
How about your food?
Sorry?
I much prefer to have your food.
May I?
Certainly, your highness.
Remark:
Princess has an allergy to shrimp.
What a spoilt Princess!
Your highness...
Captain, would you like something for lunch?
- No, thank you.
- Allright.
Would you care for some water, your highness?
Phuket International Airport, 22 hours later
Yesterday, Princess Sophia of Virnistan passed away at 9pm in a hotel room at Phuket.
Aged 34, cause of death is still unknown.
Spokesman for the royal household has requested for the late Princess Sophia,
to be flown back to Virnistan within the next 15 hours.
Golden Star Airlines is preparing a special flight to fly the late princess.
Miss Pim, they want us to send the princess back within 15 hours.
To honour Her Royal Highness, we've made special arrangements to accomodate her in the plane's cabin.
Miss Pim...
Your duty is to look after the princess's body.
Nobody else is allowed into the cabin.
Yes, captain.
And after this flight, you'll have to attend an investigation.
I understand...
Captain.
Yes, Miss Pim?
Captain, could you please come out here?
What's the matter?
Well...
Miss Pim, what is it?
Nothing.., Captain.
Miss Pim, this is not the time for games.
I'm sorry.
Dinner, Captain.
Thanks.
What is it Miss Pim?
Captain are you playing tricks?
Where's the body of the princess?
What are you talking about?
Have you gone mad?
Where's the body of the princess?
She's nowhere to be found!
What nonsense are you talking about!
I'm hanging up the phone...
Captain..
Captain..
Captain!
Captain!
Please land the plane right now!
Captain!
Land the plane!
Open the door!
Open the door!
Let me go!
Pim!
Let me out of here!
Have you gone mad?
The princess body has disappeared!
Stop this nonsense!
Let me go!
No!
Let me go!
Pim, when we land.
You will be disciplined.
Captain, please...
Please, leave me alone...
I beg you.
I made a mistake.
I won't do it again.
I'll leave him, I promise.

Loneliness
I'm so lonely
From Puak:
"A lonely girl desperately seeking a rich man.
Good looks is a must."
Puak, you're so cruel.
I hope you drown at Chiangmai.
Then, you"ll be all alone.
Just like me.
Haha.
Puak :
You"re foul mouthed.
Take care!
They'll be coming for the rents.
They were here.
Almost broke down my front door!
Have a nice camping trip.
May I know you?
Just want to be your friend.
Do I know you?
Not right now, later, maybe...?
A you a girl or a guy?
A guy.
Sorry.
The number you"ve just dialled is not available.
Please try again later.
Hello :)
New message... 0
Hi, its me.
What are you doing?
Enjoying the night at the balcony.
And you?
Lying down.
All alone...
Do you have any MSN account?
Sorry, I have no room for a computer.
My place is so crammed.
Too bad...
If you"re bored we could chat on MSN.
I am not bored...
Are you?
No.
Just lonely.
Have been confined in my room for quite a while.
Me too.
Have been alone for a 100 days.
Are you sick or something?
No..
Just unlucky.
The taxi I was in, was involved in an accident.
My leg has been in a cast for more than 3 months.
Cheer up!
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Gone to bed yet?
No, not sleepy right now.
May I have your photo?
Why don't we swap photos.
Ok?
No problem.
Why don't you send yours first.
Not as pretty as you would have imagined...
Not as handsome as you expected...
Cheater!
That's my photo.
Look again.
I'm by your side.
Phone number search.
Sorry.
The number you've just dialled has been disconnected.
Son of Princess Sophia of Virnistan passed away at Phuket.
Causes still unknown.
It is 100 days since the funeral.
Rumours have it that he took his own life.
It is also rumoured that she left her cell phone in his coffin.
In case her son feels lonely
Or wants to get in touch with her.
Me too.
Have been alone for a 100 days.
Why are you afraid?
Don't put down the phone or you"ll be sorry.
I'm passing by your apartment.
Can I meet you?
No, please...
My boyfriend will be upset.
That's a lie!
He's not there.
You"re all alone...
I'm at the entrance of your apartment.
Coming up...
I'm here...
From Oh...
Ton, I want to break up with you.
I have a new boyfriend...
Hey undertaker!
Are you running from us?
Let me handle this!
Let's go!
Hurry up!
Where are you going?
Let's take a ride!
I think we're over reacting.
Huh, what did you say?
Don't you think it's a bit excessive.
The way you"re treating him.
What's that Pink?
I can't hear you.
It's what you"re doing...
Please.
Stop...
Don't hurt me...
My father is sick in the hospital.
I have to see him.
Because of you all of us are suspended from school.
I...
I did not wish for that to happen.
I just wanted my notebook back.
That's just an excuse.
Only a thief will open other's bag without permission.
And why didn't you mind your own business?
Why did you report to the teachers about the drugs?
I didn't know they were there.
You didn't know?
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.
I think, it would be better if you quit the school tommorrow.
I don't want to see your ugly face anymore!
Don't let me see you again!
What are we going to do with him?
Undertaker!
You are a discard, understand?
A discard!
Rubbish should be burnt!
You'd better disappear from the face of this earth!
Move out of school...
Or you"ll be burnt alive!
Understand?
Get out of our sight!
Stand up!
Is this your bicycle?
Why don't you go after it!
Should we push him out?
Look at him!
He's scared out of his wits!
Shit!
He almost fell out!
The Deadly Charm
I"ve got 7.
Mine's 9.
I lose.
I lose again.
What's the bet this time?
This is really boring.
Think positive.
You're lucky with cards!
Let's see how I fare this time.
Hey!
What kind of a card is that?
Hmm.
That's a Joker... you idiot.
Diew, if Ngeed dies...
Will your father be able to help us again?
Hey Pink, why do you say that?
I think he's just fine.
And he"ll quit school for sure.
And we should all quit the drugs.
My dad got mad at me for getting suspended.
If Ngeed didn't stumble on it, nobody would've known about the drugs.
Maybe he's better of dead.
Speaking of him...
Saw his bike on my way home yesterday.
His bike is still there.
But no signs of him...
What the hell...
Are you looking for trouble, undertaker?
The last beating wasn't enough for you?
Haven't you learnt your lesson?
Enough!
Stop it!
He's had enough!
Mind your own business, Pink!
You"re nothing but trash.
All of you deserve to die.
Yo, keep still!
Why the hell are you laughing?
No!
No!
No!
Not me!
No!
Not me!
What happened?
Diew, what should we do?
Let's get out of here!
Hurry up!
Get out of here!
What are we going to do?
The hospital!
Hurry up!
Where's the nearest hospital?
There's a clinic near my place.
Go there!
Alright.
Alright..
Yo!
Ping!
Is this it?
No, next lane.
Yes turn into this lane.
Yo!
Yo! Get her out.
Hurry!
Yo!
Yo!
What do we tell Yo's parents?
Let's go to the police, there's a dead body down there!
But she's our friend!
What..
What the hell..
What the hell is going on?
Something's not right...
Did you see Yo's face when she opened the book?
And Ngeed was in a state of shock before he fell.
I saw...
I saw what he was doing...
What if someone sees us here...?
Good.
Make it more exiting!
But, what if, it's the teacher?
Great.
Make it doubly exciting!
What's that noise?
Just ignore it.
Stop and listen!
Hell!
Who is chanting his prayers here?
Ball, I'm not in the mood anymore.
Who is that?
Look into my eyes!
Are you telling me, Ngeed practised black magic?
Is he planning his revenge on us?
His father in an undertaker.
It's resonable for him to practise black magic.
Or maybe...
Maybe what, Ed?
He was performing the rituals of the Deadly Charm.
To perform the rituals of The Deadly Charm, you need a photo of someone who died with his eyes open.
Anybody who looks into the eye will be found dead.
There's something written on this photo.
"I am watching you.." Something like that?
I am watching you...
What are you looking at?
I didn't mean to do it.
I'm sorry...
How does it look, to be burnt alive?
What you have told us.
Is beyond imagination...
They're just unbelieveable...
Are you saying these books killed your friends?
I got hold of your parents.
They're on their way.
Please stay in the room.
Make yourself comfortable.
We"ll be right back.
Hungry?
You want something to eat?
Pink.
Look at me, Pink.
Aren't you part of the gang?
Aren't we your friends, Pink?
We're waiting for you Pink.
Don't leave us Pink.
Give me your hand Pink.
Come with us.
Don't you like me anymore?
It's your turn now.
No, I was not involved in this.
To perform the rituals of The Deadly Charm, you need a photo of someone who died with his eyes open.
I have never hurt you.
I was not involved.
Right, you just stood still and didn't do anything...
And this is what I want you to see.
Look at it!
- No I won't.
Please...
I have never hurt you.
I was not involved.
You cannot run away from your guilt!
Look at it!
This will end right here!
Look at it!
Look at it!
Emergency!
Emergency!
A policeman has been shot.
Get him!
Be careful, he's got a gun!
Miss, please stay here, don't...
You don't have to worry.
They won't get to me.
They cannot take me.
I am watching you...!
- Hey are you asleep yet?
- No, what is it?
Have you heard this before:
"Don't sleep at the outer fringe if you're in the woods at night."
- And why not?
- Tia once told me that..
He slept on the outer fringe while in the woods one night.
And late at night...
He heard footsteps approaching closer and closer towards him.
Then he felt a touch on his leg.
Frightened, he opened his eyes slowly.
And what did he see?
..
A beautiful woman...
Is the ghost cute?
She was just standing there..
Of course...
Hey let me finish the story, ok?
Tia just said that she was a woman.
With black, beautiful, flowing hair, covering her face...
Pale skin...
Sitting at his feet..
So what did he do?
He didn't know what to do..
He just closed his eyes tight until it was dawn.
In the morning he went to ask the local people there.
They said, a woman had drowned in a river close to where he was camped.
And the location where Tia once slept...
Is where you are sleeping right now, Chin.
- What the hell!
- I'm having goose pimples right now..
Shit!
Why tell a ghost story in the middle of the night!
Wait a minute..
You don't believe that bullshit, do you?
Why must ghosts always be females, with long hair, covering their faces?
Evey horror movies I've watched have similar ghosts...
Have you seen the film Shutter?
Shit!
I haven't.
Please don't spoil it for me!
Really..
You've not watched Shutter?
At the end, the ghost was sitting on the lead actor's shoulders.
Shit!
You spoilt it for me!
It's true.
That is why he always have neck pains.
Seriously,
I don't believe ghost exists.
I've camped here before.
Slept alone...
And nothing happened.
Right...
There's nothing to worry Chin.
Ghost or no ghost is besides the point.
I'm about to pee in my pants right this moment.
Here's a thought.
What if...
One of us dies all of a sudden..
Will you be scared?
If its you, of course I won't be frightened
But I'll be really scared if...
I have to die.
Come to think of it, amongst the four of us...
Chin will be the scariest ghost.
Why?
Look at his face.
His looks is already so scary while still alive!
What about you?
So handsome huh?
-What's going on?
Ter, Puak move aside, I want to sleep in the middle.
Hey, are you really scared?
You aren't scared, so go sleep on the outside.
I'm not scared, just too lazy to move.
Ter..
Ter..
You're not scared right?
Let me sleep here, please...
I won't be scared if you die, but I'm scared of real ghosts.
Let me sleep in the middle please...
Don't push me, go away!
Hey stop arguing.
Lets's sleep.
I'm sleepy now.
See, Ae is sleepy now.
Go back to your place.
And if I die, I"ll come back,
And haunt the one in the middle first!
Sure...
I hope you die soon!
The Man In The Middle
We have to go this way.
It"ll lead us to the campground.
Could be there by dusk.
Chin, no need to use the compass.
The river flows only one way.
Yeah look.
Just follow the river.
There's no other way.
Is there?
I'm just being cautious.
That's why I brought the compass.
Never mind.
Just put it away.
I am the king of the world.
Puak, are you crazy or something?
Jack Dawson...
Have you watched TITANIC?
He was on the ship shouting,
"I am the king of the world"
Do you want our boat to sink too?
Like the Titanic?
Of course not!
I just want to be Jack.
Chin, don't tell me you don't know,
That the Titanic sank !
?
I have never watched it yet.
Haven't watched TITANIC?
Did you know, at the end, Rose was on Jack's neck.
SHUTTER copied this scene.
Really?
True...
Titanic was released more than 10 years ago.
Damn, copycat Thai movies!
Does your village has a movie rental store?
Hey, here comes the fun!
What a thrill!
Be careful!
Puak, sit down!
- Chin, Puak.
Are you ok?
- Ok, and you ?
Where is Ter?
Ter!
Ter!
Ter!
He's not a good swimmer!
Over there!
Damn!
Ter!
Ter!
Ter!
Help!
Ter!
Help, Help!
Ter!
Ter, don't struggle!
What happened to them!
?
Where are they?
Ter!
Be careful.
Sit down.
Sit down.
I'm okay...
Where's Ae?
Ae!
Where are you!
?
Do you think he's alright?
Yes, I think he's safe.
Don't worry.
You're the one who's worried!
Else why are you crying?
Ae's still alive.
If he dies...
Then it's time to cry.
But we looked for him everywhere...
Don't worry about him.
Tomorrow, we"ll ask for help, from the local people here.
Why don't we take a rest.
We have a very long day tommorrow.
I'm going to bed.
Ter...
Let's go.
Ter?
What's the matter Ter?
Why didn't you sleep in the same position?
Same position?
Last night I slept on Ae's side.
I should be sleeping on the fringe.
C'mon..
Don't make a fuss.
Just go to sleep.
Ter, are you thinking about what Ae said last night..?
What are you babbling about?
He said if he dies, he'd haunt the one who's sleeping in the middle.
C'mon..
Ae is still alive.
He's not dead!
You're talking rubbish!
We'll find him tomorrow, let's sleep.
If you're not afraid, could you sleep in the middle?
Damn you Chin!
Your feet are horrible!
I didn't smell anything.
Take your feet out of my face!
Put your nose away from my feet then.
Shh..
Did you hear that?
What's that?
What's that noise?
Sounds like footsteps approching our tent.
Who's that?
Ae, is that you?
Ae.
Ae..
Ae!
I thought you drowned!
Ae, how are you?
Chin, get him a towel.
Are you feeling okay?
Any injuries?
How did you get back here?
I'm so cold...
Let me wipe you.
Why don't you change your clothes.
It's all wet.
We searched for you for quite a while!
I'm so glad you're fine.
Yes, he looks fine.
Can't find any injuries.
This is great!
You're one lucky guy!
Hey!
Where're you going?
- Smoke.
- I'll keep you company.
Thought you want to smoke?
Let me have one.
Don't you think it's strange?
- What's strange?
- Hush...
Keep your voice down.
I mean to say, Ae..
Why?
He almost drowned today.
But he acts as if nothing happened.
It's good that he's fine.
Isn't it?
Ae..
Are you all right?
Ae..
Are you okay?
Ae..
Ae..
Ae..
What are you doing out here?
You don't smoke!
I'm starting right now!
Take it easy..
Welcome to the man's world...
Ter..
Are you thinking, What I'm thinking?
What the heck are you talking about?
Puak...
I think Ae is dead.
Bullshit!
If he's dead, who's in the tent then?
Damn, haven't you watched THE SIXTH SENSE?
Why?
The ghost does not know that he is already dead.
Idiot!
You spoiled it for me!
Haven't seen it yet!
It's my turn...
Or did he come back to take revenge on you, Ter?
He drowned saving your life.
Idiot!
Don't be ridiculous!
I think he's back because...
you cursed him to die!
But I thought you said he's alive!
Didn't you?
I was only kidding!
Hehehe!
Do you really think he's dead?
Don't know, maybe I'm confused.
That's right.
You think too much.
I'm going to pee then.
Go pee far away from the tent.
Chin's foot is more than enough to make me sick.
Hold on..
I"ll go too.
Ter, why don't you go with Ae then?
Looks like, you're sweating a lot.
Are you okay?
Not feeling cold anymore?
Hmm..
Okay, that's good.
Corpse!
Damn it..
Damn it..
What's wrong with you, Ter?
Ae is dead!
I said, Ae is dead!
What are you talking about?
There he is, on his way back.
What are you doing, Ter?
Believe me, Ae is dead.
I saw his corpse.
Are you kidding me?
That's not funny!
Its true!
I saw his corpse floating out there.
Crazy..
Ter, don't let him in!
What is wrong with you people?
Don't tease him.
It's so cold outside.
Let him in.
We cannot let him in!
Why is he doing this to us?
He's still our friend, isn't he?
But he's dead!
You're a ghost.
Not our friend!
Ae..
Please leave us alone.
You're already dead!
Ae..
Has he left?
Puak, why don't you take a look?
What!
Why me?
I think he's gone.
Shit!
Where's my glasses?
Is Ae dead?
Maybe...
Oh shit!
How do we get down?
How did we get up here so high?
Who's that?
Who's there?
Tell me who are you?
Hey it's me, Puak.
Shit!
You scared the hell out of me!
What are you afraid of?
Here's your glasses.
Why can't I find it earlier?
You scared the shit out of me!
Is that you, Ter?
Chin, Puak..
Hurry !
Ae's body!
What should we do now?
Why don't we get out of here first!
We'll inform the authorities to pick up his body later.
We're not taking his body with us, right?
Ae, forgive me...
Wait...
What are you waiting for?
Lets' go.
Ae!
Why are you calling for him?
Stop calling for him!
I'm calling for him to look at his body.
Only then will he realise, he is dead.
Ae!
You are already dead! Ae, please look...
This is your body!
Look!
Ter...
Ter..
Look at it..
So.. are we humans or ghosts?
Damn!
Same twisted story like THE OTHERS!
Shit!
You spoilt it again!
Why do you have to worry?
We are all dead!
I've tried to tell all of you.
But you kept running away from me, scared...
So I let you see them for yourselves.
So?
Are we still friends?
I guess so..
Yes...
Hello Pim, just woke up?
Can we talk?
Are you with your boyfriend?
No.
I'm alone.
So when will you take your boyfrind to meet us?
Are you afraid I'll take him away from you?
Anything I can do for you?
Pim, we have a special flight tomorrow.
Remember Prince Albert and his princess?
They booked our airlines, for their honeymoon last year?
They have requested the same team of flight staff.
They'd like our airlines to take them to Phuket again.
Yes, I remember...
The Last Flight
I do not understand either.
Why ask for the same team of flight staff,
When only the Princess is going to Phuket.
Rumours have it that she's fallen out of favour.
And the Prince has a new flame.
Really?
But I've made other arragements.
Can't you find a replacement.
Hey Pim, the boss said it must be you.
Nobody else.
Because you"ve served them very well before.
I've just convinced Tui to join you too.
Yes, ok then.
I Understand..
Where's Tui?
Why isn't he here yet?
Pim, I'm afraid you have to go alone.
Why ?
What happened to Tui?
Tui's brother, Ter was found drowned at Chiangmai last night.
I can't find others to go with you.
Really?
Your Highness,
May I humbly introduce myself as Pim Wongpoom.
May I have the honour of being your personal flight attendant on Flight 224.
Beverage will be served shortly, your highness.
Your highness, would you care for a coffee or tea?
Excuse me, your highness.
Would you care for coffee or tea?
Coffee or tea, your highness?
Coffee.
Sorry...
A fresh cup of coffee for you, your highness.
It doesn't matter.
Just bring me lunch.
Of course.
Just a moment, your highness.
Wait.
How's your arm?
It is fine, your highness.
I see you have a Virnistan ring too.
Can you take it off, so I can have a closer look at it?
In my country..
if a woman has an affair with a married man...
Do you know what the punishment is?
She'll get arrested.
Then undressed in public.
Then stoned to death by the villagers.
And before she dies...
She has to get down on her knees...
And beg for forgiveness from the wife of the man she slept with.
Your highness...
Your lunch, your highness.
I won't eat this kind of food.
But your highness,
This is what the royal household has asked to be served.
I insist.
But we have nothing else available to serve you.
How about your food?
Sorry?
I much prefer to have your food.
May I?
Certainly, your highness.
Remark:
Princess has an allergy to shrimp.
What a spoilt Princess!
Your highness...
Captain, would you like something for lunch?
- No, thank you.
- Allright.
Would you care for some water, your highness?
Phuket International Airport, 22 hours later
Yesterday, Princess Sophia of Virnistan passed away at 9pm in a hotel room at Phuket.
Aged 34, cause of death is still unknown.
Spokesman for the royal household has requested for the late Princess Sophia,
to be flown back to Virnistan within the next 15 hours.
Golden Star Airlines is preparing a special flight to fly the late princess.
Miss Pim, they want us to send the princess back within 15 hours.
To honour Her Royal Highness, we've made special arrangements to accomodate her in the plane's cabin.
Miss Pim...
Your duty is to look after the princess's body.
Nobody else is allowed into the cabin.
Yes, captain.
And after this flight, you'll have to attend an investigation.
I understand...
Captain.
Yes, Miss Pim?
Captain, could you please come out here?
What's the matter?
Well...
Miss Pim, what is it?
Nothing.., Captain.
Miss Pim, this is not the time for games.
I'm sorry.
Dinner, Captain.
Thanks.
What is it Miss Pim?
Captain are you playing tricks?
Where's the body of the princess?
What are you talking about?
Have you gone mad?
Where's the body of the princess?
She's nowhere to be found!
What nonsense are you talking about!
I'm hanging up the phone...
Captain..
Captain..
Captain!
Captain!
Please land the plane right now!
Captain!
Land the plane!
Open the door!
Open the door!
Let me go!
Pim!
Let me out of here!
Have you gone mad?
The princess body has disappeared!
Stop this nonsense!
Let me go!
No!
Let me go!
Pim, when we land.
You will be disciplined.
Captain, please...
Please, leave me alone...
I beg you.
I made a mistake.
I won't do it again.
I'll leave him, I promise.
(Man) I think he's the best thing on the BBC at the moment, so I'm really looking forward to seeing him tonight.
(Man) He's the best and funniest thing about Mock The Week.
I Iove him on Mock The Week.
I think he's brilliant.
(Man) I would Iike to say that I think Frankie BoyIe is an incredibly funny man.
He is fucking hilarious.
- He's obnoxious and hilarious.
- And he's a funny bastard.
(Man) If he's good on Mock The Week, he has to be good live.
- He swears a Iot.
- Yeah, and he's Scottish.
(MC) Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage the blackest man in show business, Mr Frankie BoyIe!
(Cheering and whistling)
well, hello, Hackney.
(Cheering and whistling)
I had a wee look round Hackney today.
Looks like a fucking holding pen for the Jeremy kyle show.
How are you doing, little fella?
You've made a fucking effort.
Looks like someone shaved a monkey and kicked it through Top Man.
You've gone for it with the hair here, haven't you?
You look like a moderately powerful Pokemon.
Why is he a giant version of you?
You're like fucking Russian dolls there.
How you doing, big fella?
How's life been since you played Mongo in the blazing saddles movie?
- What d'you do, big man?
- IT.
IT.
And you said that in a sort of, "And my soul is dying
"every time I sit in front of the computer screen."
What about you, Frodo?
What's your story?
Don't know why I called you Frodo.
Cos you look like you've had your ring destroyed.
I don't know.
- What d'you do, man?
- Photographer.
- You're a what?
- Photographer.
You're a photographer.
You're a trainee paedophiIe, sir.
- We got Scottish people?
- (A few people) Yay!
(Laughs) I Iove that cheer Scottish people do when they think there's a Iot more Scottish people in.
"Yay!
Ooh, we're surrounded."
- Where are yous from, Scottish people?
- (A few people) GIasgow.
- Same fucking...
- (Man) PaisIey.
Oh, paisley.
He's topped you in Shit Town Top Trumps there.
Sorry, we've had a higher bid.
What's brought you down from paisley?
- (Man) Drugs.
- A raft made from turnips?
although I quite liked your answer - "Drugs."
I suspect that's your answer to a Iot of questions.
"What time is it?" "Drugs!"
- (Man) Fife.
- Fife?
Who's from Fife?
- (Man) The kingdom of Fife.
- (Laughs)
- Whereabouts in Fife are you from?
- KirkcaIdy.
KirkcaIdy.
I'II have to explain this to them now.
basically, KirkcaIdy...
The town's pride took a bit of a knock recently, when they found out that the people of Ethiopia were holding a rock concert for them.
- So, what are you doing in London?
- Working.
"Working." There's a dour Scottish answer.
You're just going to bleed the information out gradually, aren't you?
You're a fucking human riddle from KirkcaIdy.
My first is in "windmill" but not in "canal".
"I work, but what do I work at?
Guess again."
- What d'you work at?
- I'm a consultant.
consultant.
D'you want to go any deeper into the explanation
- or are we just...
- Management consulting.
Management consulting.
What are they managing?
Not very much.
Are they managing to find you quite an annoying cunt?
Is that how you've managed to stay in the business so long?
Just by giving one-word answers?
"What should we do about the staff?" "More."
"More staff?" "Maybe."
What about you?
A hat.
Not everyone can carry off a hat in the front row of a comedy club.
Why are you in disguise tonight?
Is there a particular reason?
- What do you do for a living?
- I'm a fundraiser.
- You're a fundraiser.
For charity?
- Yeah.
Rather than just...yourself.
"I'd Iike you to sponsor me because I'm fucking skint."
- What's the charity?
- It's for disabled children.
disabled children.
I'm going to have to be pretty good to get any laughs out of that, aren't I?
(Laughs)
I used to work as a support worker with the disabled, but then I kind of worked out that if I couldn't get them to wipe their own arse
I was kind of pissing against the wind trying to get them to bake fairy cakes.
Is that too much?
This will be a Iong fucking show.
How are you doing, fella?
Are you gay or d'you just like the look?
- What's your story?
What d'you do?
- Event manager.
You're an event manager.
D'you hire shit celebrities for your events?
Not that I'm touting for work or anything.
Who's the shittiest celebrity you've ever hired?
- I don't hire celebrities.
- (Man) Gordon Ramsay.
Sorry, are we holding a seance here?
What the fuck was that?
Don't you just keep chipping in as if you're part of something, OK?
We're making fun of this guy just now.
You see Amy Winehouse in the paper this week?
Fucking hell, man.
She looks like a campaign poster for neglected horses.
She got done for assault.
Kicked out at some guy that tried to put a saddle on her.
ellen MacArthur, right?
How many times is that woman gonna have to go round the world before she realises that she's a fucking lesbian?
There's lots of celebrities who are straight and you just can't believe it.
Like Gareth Gates.
The first time I saw him I thought, "That's not a stammer, that's a gagging reflex."
Did anyone see that thing the other week where Jordan came out and said that she's only had ten lovers?
Does anyone else think she just ran out of fingers?
Ann Widdecombe says that she's a virgin for religious reasons.
The reason being that God made her incredibly fucking ugly.
Nothing like John Prescott.
John Prescott, you're talking about a guy who's so fat he can't wear a belt and a tie on the same day or he'II turn into sausages.
There's a difference between being a bulimic and just liking to eat so much that you puke.
people give Jamie oliver a hard time, don't they?
I think he's done really well for someone with Iow-IeveI Down's Syndrome.
The secret ingredient in a Iot of those recipes is saliva.
We're quite tolerant of fucking mutant celebrities, aren't we?
David CouIthard, with that big, fucking...jaw thing.
D'you reckon when he goes down on his wife it feels like she's being rescued by a dolphin?
Who's the new racing driver?
Lewis hamilton.
Lewis hamilton has a brother who has cerebral palsy.
That must be the most one-sided sibling rivalry in history.
(Laughter)
"I won a Grand Prix today.
What did you do?"
"I drank from a fucking cup, Lewis, OK?"
The show doesn't sink any lower than that.
Oh, no, wait a minute.
It does.
Quite often.
tell you what I think they should do in Big Brother this year.
On eviction night, when someone gets sent out, the people inside, instead of hearing screaming or booing or whatever, they should just hear complete silence.
And then a single gunshot.
(whistling)
Just when they start to think it was all a psychological test, we throw the corpse out of a helicopter into the garden.
There was a story after the Iast Big Brother that people in India were burning an effigy of Jade Goody.
And they weren't.
It turned out they were barbecuing a pig.
(Laughter)
Richard Gere sparked a riot in delhi by kissing ShiIpa Shetty.
Say if there's a riot in delhi, how do you know?
millions of people in the street, stuff burning, screaming.
could be a riot, could be a wedding.
The result is the same. 800 dead.
(Laughter)
I liked that tour that Prince charles took camilla on in India last year.
Proper, rural India, as well.
You know, half the people who turned up were going, "Diana's really let herself go."
Does anyone else think that camilla is almost exactly what Diana would have looked like if she'd survived the crash?
(Groaning)
That's not even sick.
The sick thing's that memorial fountain they built to her that's shaped like a fucking racetrack.
(Laughter)
I thought it was sad they had a pop concert to commemorate Diana.
I mean, she doesn't have much to do with pop music, does she?
They should have done something that celebrated what was really great about her life, by staging a gang-bang in a minefield.
What was the Queen celebrating?
Her 60th wedding anniversary.
After 60 years as a German married to a Greek, she must have an arse like a broken cat-fIap.
They turned me down for the royal Variety this year.
D'you remember, years ago, a guy broke into Buckingham palace?
And they said, "It's OK, he just sat on the Queen's bed."
But it's not Iike they would have told us if he'd shagged her.
You can't really say that on News At Ten, can you?
Bong. "A tramp has fucked the Queen."
I've not talked to this side yet.
Your faces are going, "And please don't."
What's this, son?
Is this your dad or is he grooming you?
What's the story?
- What d'you do, man?
- I work in customer services.
You work in customer services.
Is that a polite way of saying "call centre"?
You've got a job they literally couldn't get an Indian to fucking do.
- And what about you, fella?
- White van man.
You're a white van man.
You just define yourself by that?
By the borrowed fucking van that you drive.
What are you doing with your white van?
deliver cash-and-carry food and stuff.
You deliver cash-and-carry food.
That sounds utterly souI-destroying.
What d'you do to liven things up at lunch time?
D'you stick on a DVD of Steve Davis talking about his favourite carpet samples?
It's...
It's gonna go like that, though.
It's gonna go van driver, fucking call centre...
We're going to get down to him and he'II be a one-Iegged juggIer who sucked off Prince philip.
- What's your story, fella?
- I'm a journalist.
You're a journalist?
- Who are you journaling for?
- The FT.
- The financial Times?
- That's the one.
What the fuck are you doing at one of my shows?
This is for scum.
What about you, big man, what do you do?
- Stockbroker.
- Stockbroker?
You evil cunt.
(applause)
Do you invest in ethical stocks or is it largely...
Iandmines to somalia?
- Wherever there's money.
- I invest in Iandmines to somalia.
But I also invest in painkillers and plastic knees.
So, the SomaIians stand in the landmines but then they take the painkillers, they have their knees replaced.
essentially, I'm giving the SomaIians the gift of surprise.
What's the most evil thing you've ever traded in?
Weapons.
- Weapons.
What sort of weapons?
- Guns.
Guns?
And who did you buy them for?
Cos, d'you know what, if it was a bank job I'II look the other way.
- Was it Mark Thatcher?
- No.
D'you ever think of getting a gun and blowing your own fucking head off?
I've got to that stage in scotland now where people recognise me.
But never where from.
I got followed by two guys in glasgow who thought that I was the wee bear from Bo' SeIecta.
Oh, yeah, clap it up, fuckers.
You wait years for that ProcIaimers thing to go away.
(Laughter)
I used to like that. "You look like one of the proclaimers."
One of the proclaimers?
They're twins, you daft cunt.
I used to have a big beard, but any time the beard gets to a certain length people start shouting, "paedophile" at me.
I don't know why I was doing that for the "paedophile".
Why do paedophiIes always have beards and glasses?
What is it about that look that children find so sexy?
D'you remember that stuff last year with the paedophile schooIteachers?
That's got to be creepy.
You get your homework back and he's drawn a cock on it.
Looking forward to trying to get those jokes onto the next series of Mock The Fucking Week.
(Laughs)
It's always quite funny, actually...
You're on telly and you say something, you just know it's never going in.
I did a show recently where I was on a sofa, getting interviewed with Macy Gray.
The fucking dream team right there.
And the interviewer said, "Have you ever been a groupie?"
And Macy Gray, I suppose quite bizarrely, said, "Yes.
For the actor, clive Owen.
"And the basketball player, michael Jordan."
And the interviewer said, "well, I hope that was on different nights."
And I said, "At the very least, I hope they were at opposite ends."
Macy Gray doesn't have a sense of humour.
I did... (Laughs) I did a morning cookery show
I made a total arse of, as well.
It was ten in the morning and it was live.
And it was the day of the glasgow airport attack.
And the presenter said, "Oh, you do topical stuff, don't you?"
I said, "Yeah.
Like today, we don't know if that was terrorists
"or just Richard Hammond turning up late for check-in."
Whisking eggs for 20 minutes with a studio full of people who fucking hated me.
(chuckles)
Who else have I met?
Oh, I met a guy, Duncan Bannatyne, from Dragons' Den.
The Scottish guy from Dragons' Den.
He's worth, Iike, 100 million or something, so I tried to take the piss a bit.
I goes, "Where are you from in scotland?"
He goes, "CIydebank."
I said, "I bet you've not been back there since you made your 100 million."
He went, "On the contrary, Frankie.
"I was there yesterday, receiving a Scot of the Year award."
What a tremendous fucking cunt he is.
(whistling)
(Cheering)
Scot of the Year award.
Who would you even be competing against?
The only award I've ever been nominated for was a Scottish BAFTA.
A Scottish BAFTA.
It's like hearing that the animals have their own fucking olympics.
I always hate those awards ceremonies celebrities have for brave children.
You've probably organised a few of these yourself.
The celebrities are trying to get publicity for themselves, aren't they?
So they'II drag up some wee guy with leukaemia or something.
They'II go, "Oh, look at him.
still smiling.
Keeps laughing."
Course he keeps laughing.
He's off his tits on fucking morphine.
You could show him Saving Private Ryan and he'd piss himself.
"Aye, he's had a brilliant night out.
"He hasn't laughed this much since SchindIer's List."
By the way, I just noticed the other day, the word "cancer" is on predictive text.
Who the fuck is texting people the news that they've got cancer?
"I've got cancer.
Laugh out loud."
I'II tell you what else is on there - "rape".
Who the fuck is using that facility?
"Better tell my mum that I won't be home for dinner.
"'Sorry, Mum.
Gone out raping."'
(Laughs)
I liked the way that I mentioned rape and that guy left.
"I knew I had something to do tonight."
(Laughs)
You ever heard that thing at women's seIf-defence classes?
They say, "Don't shout 'rape'.
Shout 'fire'."
Cos people will come if it's a fire but they might be frightened if it's a rape.
Must be quite confusing for the rapist.
- "Fire!
Fire!" - "I'm going as quick as I can here!"
hello.
A group of fucking whoIesome-Iooking children.
How are you doing?
Speccy one, you look like their leader.
What d'you guys do?
Do you all fucking ride around investigating mysteries on your bikes or something?
- What do you do, little fella?
- We're at college.
You're at college?
Is it a real college or one of these things that used to be a fucking swimming pool?
- A real college.
- What are you studying?
Er...history.
Maybe history.
That's as focused an idea as you have on your college programme.
Have you recently discovered marijuana, by any chance?
Cos your pal beside you has definitely discovered marijuana, haven't you, fella?
How are you doing?
What's life like if you look like a fucking good-Iooking surfer?
Because obviously, I've always just dragged myself around
like the fucking elephant Man.
What the fuck is it like?
What do you do, man?
I'm a student, going to uni.
Ah, right, so it's not all good, is it?
You might look beautiful, but you sound like the elephant Man.
(Mimicking) "I'm going to uni at the minute, thank you."
"I hope you won't judge me on that."
Is the wee one like your mascot or something?
"Yeah, we got him since our dog died and..."
"To be honest, he's been slightly disappointing.
But fuck it.
"His mum died, so we've got to do something."
What do you do, little fella?
tell me your mum's alive.
Thank fuck for that.
Just your dad that's dead, and fuck him.
What's your goal in life, little fella?
Erm...
Dunno.
That is the least ambition I've ever heard in any statement.
You took about three minutes to say, "I don't know."
"hopefully, one day, Frankie, I can grow gills and walk backwards into the sea."
D'you worry about the future, Frodo?
You should.
You should particularly worry about the next couple of minutes, which I'm going to make quite difficult for you.
(applause, cheering)
Do you not worry about young women getting bigger?
Say like an 18-year-oId girl now can be, what, six foot one, six foot two.
See, by the time you're 60, you trying to shag an 18-year-oId girl will be like a wee terrier attacking a giraffe.
By the time you're 60, the only way you'II be able to satisfy an 18-year-oId girl will be if an 18-year-oId guy uses you as a strap-on.
I'm not even into young women.
Even if I couId get an 18 year old to suck my cock she'd be fucking texting someone while she was doing it.
How do you spell "Ahh haw haw"?
"feels like he's got cancer."
I feel sorry for young people, man.
AII these stupid subjects they make them study.
Sports science?
Sport and science are two different things.
That's why Stephen Hawking - brilliant scientist... always last picked for the football team.
although he is a very good dribbler.
How are you doing, big fella?
You look fairly normal for one of my shows.
The rest of it's like the fucking cantina scene from Star Wars.
- What do you do, man?
- I'm a physio.
You're a physio?
Did you meet your good lady in your professional capacity?
- No.
- No?
How did you meet?
We actually went to the same gym together.
You went to the same gym together.
You sickening pair of fuckers.
"Yes, look at us both with our beautiful fucking bodies.
"We met in the gym.
Maybe if you went down the gym occasionally, Frankie,
"you could get a fucking woman like this.
"But no, unless a woman crawls in your fucking window
"while you're looking at porn, you're not gonna get a fucking woman like this."
I've realised that I've just unleashed some hidden bitterness there.
Mr Moustache, sir, where are you from?
- Croydon.
- Where?
- Croydon.
- Croydon?
I didn't realise they were making porn movies in Croydon.
It's like a pornographic version of one of the chuckle Brothers there.
"To me!" "To you!"
See Gordon Brown's announced his big new thing.
Says he wants to make children stay at school till they're 18.
That's just not living in the modern world, is it?
1 7-year-oIds having to go to school.
Who's going to pick their kids up from primary?
Looks terrible, Brown, doesn't he?
He looks like a sad face that somebody's drawn onto their scrotum.
Says he wants to bring in super-Asbos.
That sounds too cool, doesn't it?
Teenagers will want those.
They should call them Gaybos or Bender Badges.
He still wants to bring in ID cards with retina scans and 49 items of information.
ID cards won't stop your identity being stolen.
It just means that once it's stolen, you're fucked.
"I've left my wallet in the hotel.
"I'm gonna need new eyeballs and a finger transplant."
And that was too much but the rape was OK.
That seems interesting.
(Laughs) Interesting to see where your line is in this audience.
tell you what I saw the other day - a petition against ID cards.
"Yes, the Government wants to hold too much personal information on us.
"We're gonna send them a list of our names and addresses."
(Laughter)
D'you know, Brown has said that we need a national debate about whether Margaret Thatcher gets a state funeral.
The only debate most people are having is whether or not she needs to be dead before we bury her.
(applause, cheering)
(whistling)
Give her a Viking funeral in a scaIe-modeI of the BeIgrano.
D'you know, Brown has seriously said...
He said he wants listening devices put into lampposts to fight terrorism.
Is that how terrorists work?
Is it?
"Come over here.
We'II discuss our evil plans in this brightly lit area."
D'you reckon George Bush actually knows who Gordon Brown is?
He probably thinks Tony blair's put on weight and had a fucking stroke.
Bush says when he retires he's gonna make his living from speaking.
(chuckles)
play to your strengths, eh, George?
That's like Abu Hamza having a career doing shadow puppets.
Did anybody see that survey they did in America?
Said that Osama bin Laden is now more famous than michael Jackson.
And you think, "Yeah, but he puts a Iot less effort into his videos, doesn't he?"
Good old michael Jackson.
He's got to live out the life of a Scooby Doo villain.
Hanging around an abandoned funfair, wearing a plastic face.
"Those pesky kids!"
The British Army have got a big recruiting drive on in scotland at the minute.
Cos that's what you need if you're fighting an unwinnable war in the desert.
More ginger people.
Was that a wee boo from a ginger there?
I'II get the house lights put up and you'II fry like a fucking vampire.
I watched the footage of Saddam being executed.
And it really made me think, you know.
It made me think, "Is there nothing on the internet that I won't masturbate to?"
(Laughter and groaning)
I mean, not just the fact that they hung him, but they put it on YouTube.
That was disgusting.
I only gave it two stars.
It's got to bring it home to you as a great dictator when your death gets less hits than a fat Korean boy bodypopping.
would anybody else like to see hostages in videos being a bit cheekier?
Some guy who's about to get his head chopped off with a sword turning round and going, "Short back and sides, please, big man."
The Americans want to build a big tower on the site of September 1 1th.
Freedom Tower, they were gonna call it.
But now, apparently, they're worried and they're looking at ways of trying to make it terrorist-proof.
I think they should have just built a giant fucking mosque.
No one's gonna fly into that, are they?
Or even better, a runway.
How galling would it be to hijack a plane and then come in and make a fucking textbook landing?
They've got Barack Obama standing for president now.
Pretty much the worst name that you could have in American politics, Obama.
halfway between "Osama" and...
"a bomber".
He might as well be called muslim O'Gun-Bomb.
There's a Iot of scaremongering in politics.
Did you see that thing recently?
They said North Korea have missiles that can hit America.
The bit of America that their missiles can hit is alaska.
Who's gonna nuke the fucking Eskimos?
You could take out one of their cities with a three-bar fire and a bag of salt.
I'II tell you a classic piece of scaremongering.
That thing where they check your shoes at the airport cos of that guy, the shoe-bomber.
He wasn't even a terrorist, was he?
He was just like a mad fucknugget.
His plan was to put explosives in his shoes and then set fire to his shoes.
As an act of terrorism, that's one step up from clutching a stick of dynamite between your arse cheeks and eating a curry.
Did you see that guy they jailed the other month?
Osama bin London.
Is that the stage it's got to - fucking tribute acts?
And the Sun, without irony, described this guy as Abu Hamza's right-hand man.
See, people think the middle East is a very complex question, don't they?
I've got an analogy that I think sums it up quite well.
If you imagine that palestine is a big cake.
It's one big cake.
well, that cake is being punched to pieces by a very angry Jew.
The Jewish leader, ariel Sharon, is still in a coma.
people say that ariel Sharon achieved nothing, but actually, he's just won weightwatcher of the Year.
(Laughter and groaning)
well done to him.
How are you doing, fella?
What's your story?
well, that was just a sudden mime, yeah?
"My story is about this, Frankie.
"That's how I got this girl.
Look at this."
- What do you do, man?
- Graphic designer.
You're a graphic designer!
surprisingly camp job for a straight man.
And what have you been graphically designing this week?
- Corporate events.
- Corporate events?
CD-ROMS.
Is the whole audience tonight... a sort of evil night out?
Fucking Darth Vader's up the back.
(Deep voice) "well, I knew not to sit at the front.
"I knew he would pick on me."
Did you all just get a bus together, paid for by fucking former Nazis hiding in chile or something?
"Come on, it'II be great.
We need a laugh after a hard day of killing children."
And what do you design for these corporations, man?
CD-ROMS and sort of the screens for that.
CD-ROMS about the promotional business materials?
D'you ever go home and just think,
"I couId stick my head in the oven and make the world a...
"much better place"?
What do you do, pal?
- I work at a livestock market.
- You work at a livestock market?
Have you quantum-Ieaped here from 1892?
"Ziggy says there's a 90 per cent chance
"we shouldn't sit down the front, he'II take the piss."
What a wonderfully Dickensian job you've got.
So, what do you do with the livestock after you've fucked it?
Fantastic.
Have you ever killed anything?
No.
Not there.
"Not yet." That's a fucking...sinister answer.
That's generally not the way you want to respond to that question on a date, by the way.
"What are your ambitions?" "well, I've not killed anything yet."
(Laughs)
So, what else has been happening?
They found that wee lassie, Shannon Matthews.
Just goes to show you what I always say - the ugly ones always turn up alive.
Did you see her mum?
The two weeks that she spent living in a drawer under a bed was probably the happiest time of her fucking life.
They found that children's TV presenter, Mark Speight.
apparently, his suicide note was amazing.
He'd done it all in seashells and glitter.
(chuckles)
Scottish people aren't that friendly, are they?
- I once saw an english guy in...
- (Woman) Yes, we are, you liar.
"Yes, we are, you liar"?
Can you not see how you're undermining your own argument there?
"I think we're a bit unfriendly." "Shut up, you cunt!"
I once saw an english guy in glasgow, trying to order a pint of lager and lime.
And the barman went, "We don't do cocktails."
They've got a good thing at Scottish football games now, at Hampden, where you're not allowed to bring food into the ground.
And they actually search you when you're going in to make sure you've not got food on you.
It's nice to see we've got our fucking priorities right, isn't it?
"What's this, sir?
A knife?
I hope you weren't planning on making sandwiches."
Now you've got a Scottish guy who's the number one British tennis player.
I've not checked my Nostradamus, but isn't that one of the Harbingers of the apocalypse?
The only time I'd previously seen a Scottish guy playing tennis, it was someone playing charades, attempting to mime the word "homosexual".
So, what do you do, paisley fella?
Has he passed out from drugs already?
"It was a fucking great show.
I OD'd after ten minutes."
"Spent two hours in casualty being punched in the heart.
"What a fucking weekend."
- Where are you, fella?
- (Man calls out)
Hey.
Oh, and you're a fucking scary-Iooking motherfucker.
(Woman) Ah, come on.
Yeah, I know he's probably nice to you.
But he is one terrifying fucking dude, man.
What you doing down here?
I do special effects for computer games and shit like that.
You do special effects for computer games and shit like that?
Look at what you could have made of your life!
You could be a guy who looks like he's fucking just jumped out of Grand Theft Auto... snared himself some fucking beautiful woman in a cool job, man!
If you weren't so busy sucking the devil's fucking cock...
Saw a great thing recently, said scientists are gonna start treating alcoholism with LSD.
That's gonna make tramps very different people.
"Any spare change, pal?
I've got a unicorn to feed."
apparently, scientists have come up with a condom for premature ejaculation.
basically, it's got an anaesthetic in the lining and it makes you numb.
You can last for longer.
Or...you can wear it inside-out and you don't have to wake anybody up.
(whistling)
Viagra's overrated, isn't it?
Viagra takes half an hour to have any effect.
I often find that in that time the woman has managed to wriggle free.
Science isn't all progress, is it?
What was wrong with train toilet doors that just locked?
Remember that?
Instead of this fucking muItipIe-choice system.
See, now, if anything goes wrong, you're gonna be sitting there while the whole fucking toilet wall... slowly slides away.
And you're unveiled like a fucking prize on a quiz show!
"For 500 points, you could win a shitting woman."
(Laughter)
They're building the world's biggest Super collider in switzerland.
It's quite exciting.
They're trying to work out the building blocks of protons.
They're trying to re-create the conditions of the Big Bang.
I think it wouId be good if, when we work that out, the whole of our reality dissolved and a big sign came up that said "level Two".
Science isn't all progress, man.
Did you see the Mars probe?
Yeah, that's what our society needs - more pictures of fuck-aII.
well, we've had a probe which has successfully crash-Ianded onto Mars.
To me, it's not successful if it's crashed.
That's a bit like saying that you've swum the channel because your corpse gets washed up on a beach.
Have you heard that science thing that the human female has exactly the same pheromone scent as an orang-utan female?
D'you know that?
It was news to me.
I'II never wear a blindfold again.
They told me she was a Geordie.
Ever heard that science thing that if you put a frog into boiling water it will jump out?
But if you put it into cold water, you heat the water up, the frog won't realise.
And it will die.
Or to put it another way, scientists have got a Iot of fucking time on their hands.
"shall we have a go at curing cancer?"
"No.
I'm gonna see how many fruit pastilles it takes to choke a kestrel."
tell you the TV show I'd love to see.
CSI glasgow.
"well, we've done some preliminary tests
"and it looks like the intruder definitely did a jobbie on the carpets."
"We're looking for a young man with a poor diet
"because the jobbie's got a Wham bar and an old 50 pence stuck in it."
Some guy will try to draw a chalk outline round the jobbie.
"I knew I should have stuck to making corporate CD-ROMS."
I always say that if I had to explain glasgow to a stranger,
I'd say that if I had to pick a city in the world where I couId depend on a member of the public to punch a man who was on fire... to punch a flaming man to the ground.
We should get a photo of that blown up and use it as the welcome sign at Scottish airports.
And underneath, we should have the words
"scotland welcomes careful drivers."
I mean, the naivety of aI-Qaeda trying to bring religious war to glasgow.
We're 400 years ahead of you guys.
You don't even have a football team.
There's a fallacy, isn't there, that that baggage-handIer prevented hundreds of people from being horribly burned?
These were Scottish people who were flying to Spain.
people say it's good they didn't hit the fuel depot.
I think it's good they didn't hit the queue coming out of duty free.
would have gone up like fucking Hiroshima.
One of the guys was so badly burned that his mobile phone melted into his body.
I thought that as part of his punishment they should have changed his ringtone to Disco Inferno.
Yous looking forward to the olympics in London?
(Man) No!
You're really not looking forward to the olympics.
Were you touched up by a relay team?
In many ways, I think London is a bit of a strange choice for the olympics.
A city where any black man who starts running gets shot dead by the police.
That guy they shot in the Tube...
clearly, it was horrendous and everything, but if the policeman who'd done it had just been a bit quicker-thinking, he could have had a bit of a laugh with it.
He could have stood up and gone, "Any more tickets, please?"
They say the olympics is gonna rekindIe english national pride.
I mean, come on.
For 9.2 billion, you could have written
"Fuck off, Germany" onto the moon.
I Iike the logo.
I wouldn't have thought of throwing a paraplegic off a car park.
It's good they're holding the olympics in the East End of London, isn't it?
Means the athletes will have to use extra skill to work out which of the gunshots they heard was the starting pistol.
glasgow, of course, has got the commonwealth Games.
Be good to finally see an international athletics event where the crowd fall a drugs test.
The East End of glasgow's already like an olympic village.
Lots of people who struggle to speak english, wandering about in tracksuits.
I'm looking forward to our opening ceremony.
Seeing them lighting that torch from a smouldering Ford Focus.
Did you see Gordon Brown when the torch came through London with the Chinese and they got to Number 10 and barged Gordon Brown out the way?
He's the only Scottish guy in the world that would have stood for it.
Any other Scottish guy would have opened the door to Number 10 in his pants, looked at the ambassador with the torch and gone, "What the fuck's this, pal?
I ordered chicken in black bean sauce."
AIistair darling, I can't trust him, either.
I can't trust anyone whose hair and eyebrows don't match.
I keep wondering what his pubes look like.
I wouldn't be surprised if he opened his files and it was a fucking bunch of daffodils.
He looks tired, as well, darling.
But then, he does have to commute in from Tracy island.
They talk about the economy being fucked and how there's going to be food prices going up.
We're OK.
How bad would food prices have to get before we couldn't shop at LidI?
I once did my entire weekly shop at LidI in exchange for an amulet made from cats' teeth.
No matter how much we hate politicians, we always hate local politicians more, don't we?
See that guy in New York that shot the district councillor?
Over here, he'd have been a fucking local hero.
people would have come up to him as he came out the offices with a rifle, going, "Excuse me, mate, did you mention the wheelie bins?"
scotland always has the grimmest local stories.
Did you see that head found on a beach in Arbroath?
They found a head on a beach and it was children that found it.
See, the terrible thing was there'II have definitely been a point when they thought that was someone buried up to their neck in the sand.
And then, the next day, all the limbs got washed ashore in a suitcase.
The people of Arbroath were in shock.
They'd never seen a suitcase before.
D'you remember years ago, when they were making Braveheart?
Everyone said, "Ah, it's ridiculous, mel Gibson playing a Scottish guy.
"That's not gonna be very convincing."
And look at him now.
An alcoholic racist.
The most Scottish thing I've ever seen,
I was going through a town called Bathgate at night and there was a guy pissing against the front door.
Like that.
He then took out his keys and went inside.
Looking for people to chat to.
There's nothing wrong with that.
How are you doing, fella, in the check shirt, second row?
How are you doing?
- OK, thank you.
- What do you do?
- Recruitment.
- Recruitment.
A one-word answer that tells me fuck-aII.
You could be working for some sort of call centre.
You could be a mercenary trying to overthrow equatorial Guinea.
- Who are you recruiting, man?
- (mumbles)
Pumas?
You're recruiting pumas?
What the fuck could you need those for?
- Who are you recruiting?
- Procurement staff.
Procurement staff.
Right, anybody any the wiser here?
I actually slightly knew more when I thought it was pumas.
You put your hand up.
"Yeah, think I can tell you what procurement's all about, Frankie.
"Throw me the ball."
- What's procurement, pal?
- You buy stuff.
You buy stuff.
I knew that, you daft cunt.
I didn't know what they were buying.
- What have you bought this week?
- I don't do it.
I provide...
You don't do it?
So, when I asked you, "What do you do?"
you decided to step into some kind of fucking fantasy life.
"What do I do, Frankie?
well, have you read Dr Zhivago?
"I'm Dr Zhivago."
What do you do?
You fancy telling us?
See, if you don't tell me anything, I won't fucking move along.
I'II get a stool out here and talk to you all night, Iike fucking val Doonican.
You just tell me what you do, I make a joke about how it's a shit thing to be doing, we all get on with our lives.
Sorry, have I ruined the magic for anybody here?
So, what's your role?
I'm the middle man between the client and the candidate.
Right.
You're a middle man.
Another thing that tells us almost nothing.
I'm surprised that you're persevering with words.
Soon you're just going to yell out a formula.
What's the biggest thing you've ever bought?
A car.
A car.
I meant for your work, you daft bastard.
This has now sort of devolved into an episode of Trisha, hasn't it?
How are you doing, fella?
What do you do?
Estate agent.
You're an estate agent.
Ha ha-ha ha-ha ha!
Oh, yeah.
Fucking boot's on the other foot now, motherfucker.
You're calling us and we're not returning your fucking calls.
And you, good lady, what do you do?
clearly, you'II be leaving him soon, when the money dries up.
I work in fashion.
You work in fashion?
What are you doing in fashion?
- Product development.
- Product development.
still not telling me much.
Are you working on Ann Summers in Dundee, developing a crotchless sheIIsuit?
(Laughs)
- What you working on this week?
- Burberry.
I work for Burberry.
Burberry?
So, you're both involved in two things that are just going out of fashion.
It's all fucked.
We've got some old fuckers in tonight.
A sign that it's been a mild winter, some of these faces.
Tom Cruise has got a fucking creepy marriage going on, hasn't he?
I reckon if you went round to their house for dinner, she'd have written "Get help" in the peas.
Catherine Zeta-Jones, she lives in LA now but she has bottles of air imported from wales.
When I want my house to smell like wales, I just kick my dog until it farts.
- Any welsh people in?
- (A few people) Yes.
Are you worried about the foot-and-mouth crisis?
It's a Iot harder to fuck them when they're burning, isn't it?
I thought it was weird the Beckhams went to LA, the home of stalkers.
And they were always worried about being kidnapped.
And she'd be the perfect kidnap victim, as well.
Imagine how cheap it wouId be to start sending her body parts back through the post.
"Send them a finger.
Fuck it, fax it."
What does he see in her?
It must be like fucking a xylophone.
How far do you think he could kick her?
The Spice girls getting back together - did we need that?
The only way I want to see Geri halliwell draped in a Union Jack again will be if she dies in battle.
Did you see the concerts?
It looked like the panel from Loose Women having a fucking singsong.
Wayne Rooney, he gets paid a ridiculous amount of money, as well, man.
He'd be happy with a tyre on a rope.
How old is he, Rooney, 23?
They don't usually live that long.
I know some people laughed there cos they think I'm still saying he's a monkey.
I'm actually trying to imply that he has Down's Syndrome.
(Laughter and groaning)
I'd hate you to go away with the wrong idea.
How the fuck did he manage to get married?
probably just because "I do" sounds quite a Iot like "Ooh-ooh!"
Got these environmental problems now.
apparently, in 20 years' time,
Norwich will be completely underwater.
The locals are delighted because they'II finally get a chance to use their webbed feet and hands.
I Iike storms, I Iike lightning.
What I Iike to do during a storm is fuck my girlfriend and pretend that we're taking part in the conception of the Antichrist.
Oh, she hates that joke.
especially since we had the baby.
A Iot of stuff's bad for the environment.
4x4s are just too big, aren't they?
I mean, often now, when I'm out dogging...
I find that I have to stand on someone's shoulders just to get my balls onto the windshield.
Now you know where you recognise me from.
(chuckles)
Ryanair are getting a hard time from the environmental lobby cos they've introduced a $7 flight to New York.
although, as always with Ryanair, it does land slightly outside New York.
In dublin.
Was it Ryanair?
No, BA last year sacked a stewardess for coming into work wearing a crucifix.
Or wearing a cross.
Crucifix, she'd have come into work like that.
"Your safety exits are here."
There must have been more to it.
She was probably winding up the Jewish passengers.
"Did you pack these bags yourself, madam?
"And why did you murder Jesus?"
The catholic Church have got a great thing at the minute.
They say they don't want sex education in schools because it's like giving the kids pornography.
As opposed to the traditional catholic method of educating them of actually fucking them.
Sex education at my school was a muttered warning about the janitor.
The catholic Church has just reaffirmed their position on abortion.
They don't support abortion, even in cases of rape.
Which just seems like, "What?"
"What's that, son?
You'd Iike to see a picture of your daddy?
"I'm afraid it's actually more of an artist's impression."
"You have his cold, dead eyes."
The Church of england brought out prayers for dealing with the stress of modern life.
The first one was a prayer you say on the train in the morning if you can't find a seat.
I always find that if I pray loudly enough to allah...
I get the fucking carriage to myself.
Did you see that bishop up north who said that the floods were God's judgement on homosexuals?
If that was true, Brighton would be like fucking atlantis by now.
I'm all for gays, man.
I'm all for gay adoption.
Gay men would make brilliant dads.
They already know where all the best parks are.
They already know how to put talcum powder onto a sore bottom.
I'd have loved to have had a gay dad.
D'you remember that stuff at school?
"My dad'II batter your dad." "My dad could batter your dad."
"Listen, my dad'II shag your dad."
"And your dad'II enjoy it."
The bible says that a man who sleeps with another man should be stoned.
It definitely helps.
That's all I'm saying.
How are you doing, big, jolly chap with the beard?
How's tricks, man?
What do you do?
- I work for Hackney council.
- You work for Hackney council.
And that's why you're laughing.
Cos there's nothing you can do that's shit enough to get you sacked.
(whistling)
"What shall we do with the parks this year?"
"Oh, I don't know.
Pave over them?" "Promotion, motherfucker."
- hello.
How are you doing, little fella?
- Fine.
- Are you a student of some sort?
- No, I work.
- You work.
What d'you work at?
- I'm a packaging art worker.
- You're a packaging art worker?
- Yeah, mobile phone boxes.
mobile phone boxes?
Exciting stuff.
And what art have you drawn onto a mobile phone this week?
I've done some motorola phones.
motorola phones.
D'you ever think of drawing on a big tumour onto the person that's fucking trying to use the phone?
"Sorry, can't get you.
I'm in a tunnel and I've got cancer of the head."
And is this your good lady?
She looks like she could rip you apart
like a fucking chicken wing.
Does he touch the sides?
(Groaning)
When he does, do you vibrate and your nose lights up?
She's not that happy about this.
I'm quite a grumpy bastard.
Cos I drink Red bull to do the shows.
It's good they finally managed to can anxiety, isn't it?
It's good there's a drink that gives me the resting heart rate of a serial killer.
ejaculating into a school sock.
(Groaning)
I don't drink.
My best mate actually gave up the same time as me.
He said it was cos he could never imagine anything worse than waking up in the morning with less money than you thought you had and a really sore head.
I said, "It could be worse.
You could wake up
"with much more money than you thought you had and a really sore arse."
You see, Scottish people can just be dour, negative bastards.
John Logie Baird invented the TV and when people came up to congratulate him, he went, "Aye, but there's fuck-aII on."
It's the weather, man.
The weather wears us down emotionally.
It's terrible.
You'II have noticed if you've been up, not a Iot of Scottish people choose to have wind chimes in their house.
Cos it wouId be like having fucking tinnitus.
The winter is a tremendously difficult time of year for Scottish men to get laid cos Scottish women wear so many clothes.
It's fucking difficult to get at them.
You know how, in the movies, a young man's rite of passage is the first time he manages to get a bra strap undone?
In scotland, it's the first time you get a fucking button off on her duffle coat.
"Oh, just another two to go.
"Then I've got my hands on that fleece."
It's layers.
It's fucking layers.
Having a gang-bang in scotland's like playing Pass The parcel.
When I was at school, I couId never get girls' bras undone.
I just couldn't work it out.
And then eventually, I realised that these girls were wearing a different type of bra from my gran.
If you don't like that, you're gonna fucking hate this next bit.
The oldest woman ever to give birth gave birth last year.
She was 63.
I should imagine, at 63, the baby didn't have to force its way out.
It spent the Iast three months bungee-jumping.
Every time she went for a shit, it had to brace itself.
(Laughs)
Can you imagine what having a baby must have done to the state of a 63-year-oId's fanny?
absolutely nothing at all.
She's gonna need long arms to breast-feed that little fucker.
I Iove old people, I do.
But I hate it when they're always boasting about what they did in the war.
"Come on, Granddad, we're trying to have Christmas dinner here.
"Nobody gives a fuck how many Jews you killed."
I Iike those adverts that are aimed at old people, for, what is it, funeral expenses?
They always start off,
(english accent) "If you're one of those people our age..."
Then, for some reason, it always ends up offering them a fucking radio alarm clock.
Of all things.
(english accent) "One morning, that alarm will go off
"and you won't hear it."
AII insurance is a con, man.
health insurance?
D'you really want to have your own TV to watch while you're dying?
D'you want to spend your last day on earth watching Diagnosis Murder... only to find out that it's a two-parter?
I'm trying to think if I have any cheerful jokes at all.
Oh, yes.
As a man, never get a brazilian.
Because when you get a hard-on you look like a sundial at noon.
Have you ever gone to a fancy dress party, fucked someone dressed as a ghost and later found out that it was their muslim next-door neighbour?
I visit the mound of stones they buried her under every halloween.
halloween, ladies and gentlemen.
halloween.
A wonderful time of year for the agoraphobic paedophiIe.
(Laughter and groaning)
"They're being delivered to the door.
"In little costumes."
How many dead hookers can you fit in a garage?
Another two, if I move my bike.
See, I think a Iot of this stuff with offensiveness in comedy, it comes from the fact that we're talking about big stereotypes and generalisations.
They're not always true, are they?
So, I've got a friend does a routine about,
"Don't you hate it when your partner comes to bed and they're cold?
"They try and get heat off you."
And I always think, well, what if you're a necrophiliac?
Maybe you love it when they're cold.
"Oh, that's brilliant.
You're freezing.
"Don't move a fucking muscle.
"I want it to be realistic.
I'm groping your arse cheeks with a car-jack."
Any questions so far, Hackney?
"No, Frankie, we turned up with questions,
"largely about rape and cerebral palsy...
"but to be honest, you seem to have cleared most of that up for us.
"Go ahead with the jokes."
(Man) What's your view on Austrian parenting?
What's my view on Austrian parenting?
(Laughs)
(Laughter and applause)
D'you know, I don't know what's going on in Austria.
It's gone, very suddenly, very sexy and kidnappy, hasn't it?
D'you know, hallmark have had to bring out a card in Austria that says, "congratulations on escaping from your underground sex hell."
I'd quite like to see the Austrian version of Grand Designs.
(applause)
(english accent) "Josef is building a sex dungeon under the garage,
"but, with three weeks to go, the concrete still hasn't arrived."
Have you not found it quite interesting during the European Championships to see how many of the players who go down the tunnel come back out again?
And d'you know what?
The best thing is that when that's in the papers, people in the West Country are reading that like it was fucking hello!
magazine.
"Oh, he's got manacIes in the bathtub.
Nice touch."
I'm only kidding.
I Iove the West Country.
We were in bristol on tour.
Everybody in bristol is just fucking hilarious.
There's a guy in a train station, trying to buy a sandwich.
And the woman goes, "That'II be $3, please."
And he goes, "I'm not paying $3 for that."
And she says, "well, it's $3, you know.
Take it or leave it."
And he walked off.
And as he got to the door, he turned round and he went... (West Country accent) "well, I'II have the Iast laugh, right?
Cos I ain't even hungry."
(chuckles)
almost topped by the restaurant we went to in bristol, where on the toilet wall someone had drawn a massive cock and along the shaft they'd written, "Bon appetit."
(chuckles)
Anything else?
(Man) Have you ever been to Specsavers?
(applause)
Yes, I went there to pick up a prescription for your mum.
She's slightly cock-eyed... since I put my cock in both her eyes.
(Laughter and applause)
See, if you start attracting an audience of schoolchildren, you get schoolchildren insults.
I'm like the fucking Pied Piper of Hackney or something.
Anything else?
(Woman) What were you Iike as a teenager?
What was I Iike as a teenager?
It's difficult to tell because I locked myself into the bedroom and turned it into a sort of masturbation furnace.
I don't know what I was like, but I was certainly generating enough energy to power Vienna.
One last one?
(Man) Ever licked a lady's arsehole?
Wait, that...
That sounded...
Wait a minute.
That sounded like it had some good value in it.
AII I heard were the words "lady's" and "arsehoIe".
My ears pricked up there and I thought,
"Great, we're gonna get something here." What is it, fella?
- Have you ever licked a lady's arsehole?
- Have I ever licked a lady's arsehole?
No.
Why?
What does the rest of your evening involve?
See, I've never really understood how you get into, Iike, kinky sex at all.
Cos there must be a point where you bring it up in conversation, mustn't there?
"darling, er...you know that mug tree that we've got in the kitchen?
"Yeah, that's the one.
"I'd Iike to stick it up your arse tonight."
I'd actually be more frightened that they'd say yes.
"Yes, why not?
Get the BreviIIe sandwich-maker and the lava lamp out.
"Let's make a fucking night of it."
Ever licked a lady's arsehole yourself, sir?
I... (Drowned out by laughter)
What...what did that gesture mean?
"well, about this many."
Have you?
No.
Thinking about paying for it.
You're thinking about paying for it?
Haven't you seen the welsh ladies at the back?
I mean, I'm not guaranteeing that you're gonna survive.
But at Ieast you get to do it for free.
Any other questions
- by people who are not schizophrenics?
- (Man) How long's a piece of string?
"How long's a piece of string?"
(Woman) Wanker!
Don't start fucking heckIing each other.
I don't know.
I reckon if I had about two feet of it
I couId choke you to death.
(Man) Ever licked a man's arsehole?
What?
Have I ever licked a man's arsehole?
Yes.
strangely, as a straight man, er...
I've never licked a woman's arsehole but regularly lick a man's arsehole.
Because I used to be a taster for dog food and it's the only way I couId get the taste out of my mouth.
I always used to know when Christmas was coming round because his arsehole would start to taste of cranberry.
One final one?
(Man) will you sing a ProcIaimers song?
Leaving aside the fact that I've already got the proclaimers thing out of the way earlier, no, I will not sing a fucking ProcIaimers song.
unless...you allow him to lick your arsehole.
(chuckles)
It's not really the way I imagined this section of the show going, to be honest. (Laughs)
See, political correctness has changed everything, hasn't it?
I mean, people forget that even political correctness itself used to be called "spastic gay talk".
(Laughter)
apparently, at Christmas now, we're not supposed to say "fairy lights" any more because it might be homophobic.
apparently, now we've got to call them "poof Ianterns".
It's not politically correct to talk about women who wear veils.
I don't give a fuck if they wear a veil or not.
It's when you see them as tourists taking photos of each other.
What's the fucking point?
"could you take that one again?
I blinked."
They had a woman in a veil doing channel 4's Christmas message last year.
Not great for the deaf viewers.
Though, apparently, if you were deaf there was a button you could press and get sign language by Abu Hamza... who's not brilliant at sign language because his hook makes everything sound like a question.
I had a woman in, in a veil, the other night and she found that quite funny.
Or annoying or surprising.
It was impossible to tell, really.
(chuckles)
tell you what I hate most in the world - children In Need.
Make the children sit through that pile of shit, then ask them if they still need a ventilator that badly.
Charity doesn't work.
Because we want it to work won't make it fucking work.
You might want to give money to people in Africa but that money takes no account of cultural difference, takes no account of the reality of those people's lives.
If you give a man a fish, he'II eat for a day.
If you give him a fishing rod, he'II break it up for firewood.
Or swap it for a fish.
Don't bother.
Don't send your children's toys to Africa.
Can you imagine how depressing it must be to receive a Tamagotchi that's gonna outlive you?
"I am dying.
please take this.
It was my grandfather's."
tell you what sums TV up to me, right?
There was a TV company wanted to do a pilot where you had to spend a night in a haunted house with John leslie.
It's like a DIY show with Fred West.
John leslie?
If you felt cold breath on your neck you'd be praying it was a fucking ghost.
This is the stuff we actually get to hear about.
I keep expecting a pilot to turn up somewhere that's Stephen Hawking fighting Christopher Reeve on celebrity Robot Wars.
It's so patronising, telly, isn't it?
Fucking things like gladiators aren't even programmes.
It's just a distraction - distract you from the war, distract you from the economy.
Instead of those shows, they should just have a guy come on, get a bunch of keys out and go, "Look at the shiny, shiny.
"GIadiators has been cancelled.
Look at the shiny, shiny.
"And finally on News At Ten, look at the shiny, shiny!"
D'you ever watch TV and think, "This would be a Iot more entertaining
"if I'd recently sustained a massive head injury"?
I watched a show the other day for the first time.
I'd not seen it, right?
You Are What You Eat.
Which works.
I mean, one look at that woman's face,
I can't eat for about three fucking days.
But there was a bit in the episode - it might happen every week - she gets a fucking trestIe table out in front of the fat fucker and loads it up with ice cream and burgers and chocolate bars.
And they've got to pretend that they think that this is a bad thing.
She's actually just laid out their dream fucking buffet.
"Oh, I know, it's terrible.
could you give me 15 minutes on my own here?"
I saw a show the other week, a how-to-seII-your-house kind of thing, and they said if someone's coming round to view the house, remember to open your curtains and tidy up.
well, thanks for that.
I'd been planning on redecorating using diarrhoea pills and stencils.
Then shaving the word "welcome" into my fucking dog's back.
That's a joke, clearly.
I don't have a dog.
Having pets is fucking tragic.
Having a pet is just basically saying, "I have tried to find love
"among my own species.
"I have fucking failed.
"I've had to fall back on the less judgemental world of animals."
Is there anything sadder than seeing someone with a dog picking up dog shit?
I suppose maybe someone without a dog.
(chuckles)
Vet.
That's a job I'd Iike to have.
You can kill the fucking thing, they've still got to pay you.
"Aye, I fucking killed it. $200, please." You can tell them that you're gonna kill it.
"I'm gonna kill it.
We're going to get RoIf Harris in to film the whole thing
"like a fucking snuff video.
"Get your cheque book ready."
I think it's sad that we can provide homes for homeless dogs, we can't do that for homeless people.
I think we should have a show called Tramp Rescue.
(english accent) "Do you enjoy long walks and drinking heavily?"
"Perhaps you could provide a home for Kenny.
"We don't like to put a healthy tramp down."
- (Man) What's your greatest fear?
- What is my greatest fear?
It's someone saving up a question from the clearly delineated question part of the show... throwing it in at the end, when I'm trying to get some fucking momentum going.
I'm actually...
I'm terrified of flying.
There's nowhere I want to go to in the world so much that I'm willing to be fired towards it at 700 miles an hour in a tin can full of other people's farts.
D'you know the thing of the crash position on planes?
You know that?
Where you go like that?
That's actually there so that when you crash, your teeth stay with your body and they can identify you from the teeth.
I reckon if you timed it just right on impact you could probably spit your teeth into someone else's lap.
"That'II fucking show them.
"They'II think that six-year-oId boy had a hell of a fucking life."
(chuckles)
Can I ask you a question?
How long is too long to text back to someone?
My wife still thinks that I died on September 1 1th.
It's a good trick for getting out of a relationship, that.
I picked it up off my dad, shortly before his untimely death aboard the challenger space shuttle.
(Laughs)
They're trying to make health this big issue now.
The Government want to bring in compulsory dance classes for fat children.
They're not gonna have the concentration for that, are they?
"Everybody do the mashed potato."
"Ooh, mashed potato!"
children are fat because we lie to them about vegetables but we don't go far enough.
"Eat your spinach.
It'II make you strong."
"These will help you see in the dark."
"You've left your sprouts behind.
You won't be shitting laser beams tomorrow."
"Don't you want to project the bat signal out of your Jap's eye?"
Fuck knows where that bit came from.
I'd love to project the bat signal out of my Jap's eye.
Suppose Batman would be quite annoyed when he turned up.
"What seems to be the trouble?" I've had too many sprouts, Batman!"
"Can I ask you something?
Have you ever licked a woman's arsehole?"
They did a report on Scottish mortality the other week.
And it's basically even worse than we thought.
If you live to 100 in scotland, the Queen doesn't send you a telegram, she comes round to your house and does a handstand with a sparkler up her arse.
people say there's no such thing as a good way to die, don't they?
Those are people who've never heard the phrase "Drug-fueIIed-sex heart attack".
They did a health report, said that scotland is the worst small country in the world.
The terrible thing about it was that our slogan at the time was "The best small country in the world".
So we were like one of those kids at school who tried to come up with his own nickname.
"Hey, guys, you can call me T-Dog."
"Oh, we'II be calling you Cunty Chops."
One of the side-effects of the smoking ban in scotland is that every pub, no matter how shit, now has tables and chairs outside it.
basically, glasgow looks like Paris after a nuclear war.
The smoking ban - it's all come too late for poor old Roy castle, hasn't it?
(Groaning)
Roy castle's gonna be spinning in his grave now.
Trying to beat the world record for spinning in his grave.
held by OJ Simpson's wife.
apparently, scotland has the best mental health record in Europe.
I think that's cos in scotland you really have to go that extra 10% to be judged mental.
"Sorry, son, we didn't realise you were a schizophrenic.
"We just thought you were a bit of a character."
I used to work with schizophrenics in an asylum.
I was like a companion to the fuckers.
Yeah, so I'd take them out for a drink or I'd play cards with them.
I won quite a bit of money.
It was good.
One day, I took this old lady out for lunch and she was a lovely old lady, but a serious schizoid.
And she said, "Frankie, what's madness?
Because we're sitting here having lunch.
"That couple are sitting over there having lunch.
"What's schizophrenia?
What's madness?"
And I said, "Yes, but yesterday you said that hitler was travelling through time
"to try and steal your liver."
She went, "Yeah.
Swings and roundabouts."
There's stuff I don't understand in life.
There's stuff I don't understand about sex.
Like nudie calendars.
Who's wanking, going, "I can't believe it's Pancake Tuesday"?
I actually lost my virginity to my mother's best friend.
It was my father.
It was the only time he ever told me he loved me.
(Laughter and groaning)
My favourite thing I saw this year was an article in one of the women's magazines on valentine's, entitled How To tell What's Going Through The Man In Your Life's Mind
while He's Choosing Your Present.
And it was a surprisingly long article... which at no point mentioned the words, "This'II do."
"A giant TobIerone.
She'II fucking love this!"
I've been reading a Iot of these magazines.
They're getting more and more like sex manuals, aren't they?
AII these articles about how to be better in bed.
It's all aimed at men.
This thing's going, "Why not surprise your partner
"by having a romantic bath together?
"Add to the atmosphere with scented candles.
"After her orgasm, remember to hold your partner
"as this may be when she feels most vulnerable."
I don't know why I'm looking at you here, particularly!
Just got sucked in there.
Not a brilliant choice of words in the circumstances but...
I mean, there's no balance.
There's nothing telling women how to give men the sort of sex they really want.
I'd love to see an article in Marie claire or something going, "Why not surprise your partner
"by skipping foreplay altogether?"
"Add to the atmosphere...
by swallowing.
"After his orgasm, remember to phone yourself a taxi."
(whistling)
You know how men go, "Oh, women don't know how to wank us off"?
Don't know why I turned that into a fucking AI JoIson number.
(As AI JoIson) "They don't know how to wank us off, Mammy."
"Mammy".
I wish I hadn't said that.
Women are actually better with their hands than men.
admittedly, if you get a woman who doesn't know what she's doing, it can be a bit like having someone with Parkinson's Disease trying to unblock a sink.
What's a guy who doesn't know what he's doing with his hands like?
It's like a hungry child wearing oven gloves, trying to get beetroot out of jar.
There's stuff you can't say in bed at all, isn't there?
I've just found this out recently, to my fucking cost, but you know the thing when you're having sex and you sort of know that you're not gonna come?
And you kind of know that they're not going to come, either.
well, you're not allowed to go, "Let's just call it a draw."
So, I've got kids now.
I've got a wee baby.
He's seven months.
I'm starting to get a bit fucking sick of him, to be honest.
I went to the birth and it really does bring home the wonder,
I suppose the miracle, that is contraception.
seriously, Frodo, smash your testicles to pieces... because watching a birth is like the deleted scenes from platoon.
I'm only kidding.
I've got a daughter, as well.
If you ever get the chance to have kids, have kids.
Cos people say it's tiring and it's not.
If you don't live with the mother.
I've moved to London.
She'II have to cry fucking loudly to wake me up.
Kids are a brilliant way of meeting women.
They're great sort of conversation starters, especially if you get them little, cute tops that say stuff like "Future DJ", that kind of thing.
My daughter's four.
I've got her a lovely little pink top that says, "My mummy's dead."
(Laughs)
This is true.
I was sitting having breakfast with my daughter a couple of weeks ago and she goes, "Daddy, what's the best thing in the world?"
I didn't even have to think about it.
"darling, you're the best thing in the world.
"I didn't even have to think about it.
It's definitely you."
And she sat there for a bit and then she went, "For me, it's sausages."
It's been an absolute pleasure talking to youse.
Take care of yourselves.
And black Power, motherfuckers!
Go back, go back.
That is God and a surgeon working in harmony.
Here comes the Schwarma girl.
Hey.
Here you guys go.
Be careful, it's really hot.
I don't want to... for you to burn your tongue on it.
Wow, 29 orders this month.
One more, and you'll get a free baba ghanoush.
Oh...
I'm reaching in my pocket for money, not for...
Hey, do you have change?
Oh, she's...
Did you get it?
Fellas...
Oh, boy.
What are you guys doing?
Or have you forgotten about Big Mike's pol on "Mammary cam"?
I don't know what you're talking about, Chuck.
He doesn't know what I'm talking about?
That's so weird.
So, you didn't actually just remove the offending video from the camcorder and then hand it to Lester, who is now hiding it behind his back?
What?
Wow!
My feelings are hurt.
Charles, after all these years, where's the trust, my friend?
In Jeff's sweaty palms, along with the amateur consumer porn.
Look...
No, you look...
Hey, Chuck?
Uh, can I talk to you for a sec?
Move.
Awesome...
to see you, Devon.
Yeah, yeah.
What's up?
All right.
So, what's on your mind?
Chuck, I was, I was hoping to talk to you about Ellie.
Yeah?
Yeah, yeah, of course.
Well, you know, ever since, um, ever since we've been dating, I've come to think of you as that little brother I never had.
Don't you have two younger brothers?
Indeed.
Indeed.
But you seem like someone who can offer sage wisdom in confusing times, and this is one of those times I am really confused, bro.
I don't know how to put this into words, really.
That's a bug.
What?
What?
Spider, I hate those fuzzy little bastards...
Oh, no.
I think, uh, no, you got him.
He was like...
and then poof!
Gone.
Can you excuse me for just one second?
I think I just saw a kid climbing into an oven over in Home Appliances.
Chuck!
Chuck, I need you to drop some knowledge, bro.
Keep moving, Bartowksi.
Nothing to see here.
Not even if I had the time.
You're getting sloppy, Casey.
I understand that you have some perverse desire to listen to everybody, but you really need to be more careful when hiding your bugs.
What are you lip-smacking about, Bartowski?
I just found this on one of our product displays, and not very well hidden, I might add.
Normally, I'm a fan of your craftsmanship, if not your methods.
Look, all I'm saying is that something like this discovered by someone less in the know than me could spell trouble.
You worry about that supercomputer in your brain.
Let me worry about the spy stuff, huh?
Don't you have a hard drive you can go fix?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
There's best buddy of mine.
Yeah.
What's up?
Okay, saw an Infinity Ward mail in the trash, and I'm guessing that means you got a pre-release demo of the next Call of Duty game?
Ah...
Yeah, but the last time I lent you a game sampler, it ended up all over the Internet.
So this one's gonna stay in my locker, and you can play it when you get some adult supervision.
Adult super...?
Chuck, I'm almost at the age where I should get my prostate checked annually.
Okay?
Surely I could be trusted with an advance copy of the next greatest video game on the planet.
Have you seen Awesome?
Over by the Home Theater Room.
(muttering):
I think that's really.
?
?
defrosting himself, as it turns out.
So, uh, what, uh, what's going on?
This is one of those rare moments when things are not kosher, Chuck.
Oh, man.
This is harder than I thought.
Uh-huh.
Go...
Go on.
I'm listening.
Right.
Well...
I've been thinking a lot about the way things are between me and your sister.
And you're the man in...
in Ellie's family, so I was wondering...
Can I have your permission...
Can I marry Ellie?
Wow.
That-That's quite...
quite a rock you got there.
Is that a yes?
Dude...
Yes!
Yes!
Sorry!
I just...
You kind of--- waah!
You know, you pulled the blang just right in...
Yes, you have my blessing.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I mean, it's been in my family for years.
This was my great-grandmother's.
(chuckles) Ah, you think she'll like it?
Like it?
She'll, she'll love it.
I, um, I'm just not sure she'll be able to lift her hand anymore.
Oh, one other thing.
Ellie is a bloodhound when it comes to these kind of things.
If I keep this in the apartment, she will smell diamond.
Can you hold onto this, just for a day or so, man?
I mean, just till I figure out how to pop the question?
I don't think it's actually a good idea...
Oh, thank you!
Thank you so much, bro.
Hey, pretty soon, I'm going to mean that literally.
There you go.
All right...
We have a problem.
What do you mean?
Chuck found that in the Buy More.
We have a problem.
BECKMAN:
The bug Chuck found is a GLG-20, one of the most advanced counter-espionage listening devices in the CIA arsenal.
This is a CIA design?
Figures.
The GLG-20 is a low-power transmitter.
In order to avoid detection, it has a maximum range of about 20 yards.
Which means there's probably a receiver hidden somewhere inside the Buy More.
GRAHAM:
We believe it's recently become a favorite of the FULCRUM agents.
So, you're telling us the secret government cabal that abducted
Bryce Larkin and came within a hair of figuring out that Chuck's the Intersect is now skulking around the Buy More?
We need you to locate that receiver, and find the person who planted it.
BECKMAN:
You have 48 hours.
If you cannot identify the enemy operative in that time, we will have no choice but to relocate Chuck to a secure government holding facility.
GRAHAM:
Bartowski's time as a civilian may be coming to an en
For their own safety, his family may never see him again.

When are these young ladies going to learn?
If they don't want someone taking a picture of their private business, put some drawers on.
Hey, uh, you think we should make a run for it?
You don't run from the cops.
It makes you look guilty, or shot in the back.
We are guilty.
Shh!
Bring me down and I will cut you.
So, no locks broken?
No alarms set off?
Nope.
It's clean.
Must be an inside job.
Thought of that.
You really think any of these dummies can mastermind all this?
It's almost always someone close to the operation.
When I find out who robbed my store and stole my fish,
I'm gonna break my foot off in his behind.
(whispers):
Oh, my God...
Shh!
Hi.
Hey.
What's with the police presence outside?
They robbed the Buy More, man.
They took everything.
They took everything?
Everything.
Oh, please, God, no.
Please be there.
Oh, my God...
The ring.
They took Ellie's ring.
Oh, my God.
(panting):
Oh, oh...
Oh!
Oh!
Hey...
Chuckles, what's up?
Dude, I figured out how I'm gonna pop the Q.
The Q?
What Q?
What's a Q?
You know, the Q, the big Q you only ask once in a lifetime.
Can't say right now...
Mom.
Is that your mom?
Tell her that I love that kittens-playing-with-the-yarn sweater that she knitted me.
You got it, babe.
I'm going to do it while we're skydiving.
Really?
Do you think, uh...
Do you think that's a good idea?
Not the first time we've been in the mile-high club, buddy.
If you know what I mean.
Yeah, uh...
Listen: skydiving is a little, it's a little risky.
Don't you think?
I mean, you could drop the ring.
Whoa.
Hot call, dude.
Hate to lose my great-granny's ring.
She gave it to me right before she passed.
You know?
She knew Ellie was the one before I did.
Great, great, okay, so... just, you know, let me know when you figure something else out.
Okay.
But, Devon, um... take your time.
You got it, brother.
(thuds) Oh...
Detective Conway here is convinced that this is an inside job.
And we intend to get to the bottom of this.
Bartowski, get over here.
You're a suspect, too.
You all are!
When that pig talks to you, look him in the eye and say nothing.
Zip it.
Nothing?
Come on, that's incredibly rude, Jeffrey.
Dead men tell no tales.
Stop it.
Quit messing around.
Bartowski, where's Casey?
Don't you two usually carpool together?
Yes.
Yes, sir, we absolutely do.
But, uh... not today.
Why don't you go find out why his ass is so tardy.
Someone might find that suspicious.
Sure, I can-I can do that.
CASEY:
What?
Where are you?
Big Mike's looking for you.
Yeah, well, he's going to be looking for both of us.
Now get down here, we need you.
No, no, no, no.
Listen to me.
I need you, okay?
Someone cleaned out the Buy More last night.
They took everything;
they took my sister's ring, the one she's supposed to wear forever, even though she doesn't know it yet.
Awesome is supposed to propose to her, he trusted me and now it's gone.
Save it for your coffee klatch, Bartowski.
Get down here.
We got bigger fish to fry.
You robbed the Buy More?
SARAH:
We had no choice, Chuck.
CHUCK:
No choice?
Are you out of your mind?
Do you have any idea what's going on at the store right now?
That bug you found, it isn't one of ours.
What bug?
Who, ours?
SARAH:
The one you found yesterday.
Casey only installed EM-50s.
The one you found was a GLG-20.
It requires a secondary recording device nearby to collect the data.
What are you talking about?
Someone is spying on us.
What?
!
Okay, listen carefully-- the bug you found was not ours.
It belongs to an enemy agent, probably Fulcrum, and they planted it in the Buy More.
Why?
Looking for the Intersect.
They're looking for you.
We found a total of 29 bugs just like it, but we still haven't found the receiver.
CHUCK:
Okay.
Okay, well, wow.
Uh, extreme...
extreme measures, but, uh, decisive action had to be taken.
Good luck schlepping all this stuff back to the Buy More.
Uh, I'm going to get back there right now and pretend like I don't know anything.
Got any good tips for beating a polygraph?
Chuck, wait.
What?
Ch...?
Oh, duh, yeah...
(chuckles)
Can I get my sister's ring back?
You guys are pretty damn thorough.
You should be more concerned about not making it to her wedding.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Hold on.
He can't hear it like that.
He won't process it.
How do you give a man a life sentence just for being a good guy?
Okay, how about I give it a try, gently?
No, I don't want to hear your version of it and neither does he.
It's a job.
How come you always got to get your lady feelings involved...?
It has nothing to do...
Agent Walker, Major Casey.
You might want to take a look at this.
This is a surveillance tape taken during the robbery.
CASEY:
There's nothing there.
Bad guy disabled the security system.
Wait.
CHUCK:
Hey, that's Jeff and Lester.
And they are apparently drunk.
It appears they've mistakenly turned the camera back on.
Hang on a second-- who's that?
SARAH:
That's the spy.
He's the spy who spies on spies.
CHUCK:
Why would a Fulcrum agent try to steal Big Mike's fish?
CASEY:
Those two dilweeds interrupted an actual robbery in progress.
The receiver's in the fish.
Marlin, actually.
Technically, it's a marlin.
Marlin.
You would call it a marlin, right?
Yeah.
Look.
See, there you go-- done.
My job here is done.
So now I'm sure you super-agents can figure out where the two drunken pinheads stashed the fish-- marlin, four-foot marlin.
I'm going to stick around here and try and find my sister's ring.
Hey, Chuck?
Chuck, no ring came up in our inventory.
What do you mean no ring came up in your inventory?
You guys robbed the Buy More, didn't you?
What happened to Awesome's great-grandmother's ring?
We kind of have some bigger- picture concerns right now.
What could be possibly be bigger than me ruining the chances of my sister getting married?
The receiver may contain information indicating that you're the Intersect.
Say it.
Say what you're not saying.
If we don't locate the receiver in the next 24 hours...
You'll be stored in an underground bunker for so long you'll forget what fresh air smells like.
LESTER JEFFREY:
One, two, three, four.
I declare a thumb war!
Oh!
Come on, Jeffrey.
Jeff, Lester, we got to talk, it's important.
Yeah, see, this is your problem, Charlie.
Why is your time more valuable than mine?
Oh!
He is taking him over the top!
All right.
Ow!
My thumb!
Hey.
Let's go.
(fake coughing):
Narc.
Narc, Narc.
Narc.
Narc.
JEFFREY:
Easy on the shirt, Narc.
Where's the fish?
Fish?
What fish?
Okay, we can do this the easy way or the hard way.
Easy way is I shove his foot up your ass.
What's the hard way?
I use my foot.
CHUCK:
Look, we've seen the surveillance footage, guys.
Okay?
We know you were here last night.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, no, you two geniuses thought you were turning the cameras off, but, instead, you turned them back on.
We won't say anything to Big Mike, I promise.
Okay.
Come on, wh-what's happening?
Charles, would you give us a few minutes, please?
Chuck...?
It was his idea.
What?
!
The whole reason we snuck in was to get your alcoholic ass another drink-- you were getting the shakes.
Not cool.
It's a disease.
You're a disease, and you've diseased us all-- me, Chuck, this guy.
C-Calm down.
Calm down.
Okay.
Look, Jeff, I totally understand your plight.
We sympathize with you, okay?
And we don't judge.
Just tell us what exactly happened?
We were across the street at Bennigan's and I got cut off again...
Jeff.
If you're going to tell the story, please...
don't butcher it.
We were at Benni's, enjoying the deep-fried sampler, and we decided to come back to the store for a nightcap in boss man's private stash.
It's off.
(groans)
Rock and roll.
We have the store to ourselves.
We should take off all our clothes.
Don't make me uncomfortable to be alone with you.
Go get it.
Bingo.
Yes.
No.
No, no, no.
Jeffrey!
It's a wasted mission now.
It's a wasted mission.
We've gotta do something exciting while we're here, man.
We can burn it down.
I was thinking more along the lines of a... fishing expedition.
And that, friends... is the story of the missing marlin.
And where is the marlin now?
I'm afraid I'm going to need a little compensation.
(cries out)
At Chuck's!
We took it to Chuck's pad!
What?
My apartment?
Why?
We didn't want to get busted with Big Mike's fish.
LESTER:
I'm going to need lotion.
SARAH:
We're pursuing the receiver.
We've got the location, and it shouldn't be long before recovery.
Stay with the receiver.
In the meantime we've decided to extract Chuck.
What?
But we don't know he's in danger.
There's a chance the identity of the Intersect has been compromised.
We have to err on the side of caution.
You promised we had 48 hours.
You know the game, Agent Walker.
The order has gone out.
Chuck is coming in.
Come on.
Chuck, you're looking for a marlin.
Hey, hey, whoa.
Whoa, stop, stop.
I seriously doubt that these geniuses had time to reupholster the couch.
It's got to be here somewhere.
Chuck?
Hey, sis.
John.
Hi.
What are you two up to?
What's going on with the apartment?
I'll clean it up later.
Right now, we're looking for something.
What is it?
Look, I-I promise you whatever you want to talk about is not as important as what we're looking for right now.
Okay.
What are you looking for?
A stuffed fish.
A fish?
Marlin, actually, about four feet long.
Got a spear-like nose.
And a mouth.
Yeah.
Okay, Chuck, I get it.
Besides, if anything really important were going on, you have plenty of people in your life you can talk to about it.
Hey, Ellie, wait.
What?
Oh!
I love you.
Just in case.
Just in case of what?
Uh....
Just-just in case I can't find the fish.
I suppose you haven't talked to Morgan.
No.
Why?
Because he left here last night with a four-foot long marlin.
He's mine.
And you know nothing about the stolen merchandise?
No, sir.
Officer.
Detective.
Where's my fish, Grimes?
Mr. Tucker, please.
The merchandise is insured.
That fish cost me 200 bucks on eBay.
Wait, you bought that fish?
That will be all, Mr. Grimes.
What did you use for bait, PayPal?
CONWAY:
Grimes, out!
All right.
Yes, sir.
You cracked, didn't you?
LESTER:
You are so weak.
JEFFREY:
You are so weak, man.
How am I weak, dude?
I didn't say anything.
In fact, I told...
How am I supposed to believe that?
Bartowski!
You're up.
I got the scraggly troll.
I-I did not rob the store.
Did I ask you that?
Already he's talking about stolen goods.
You might as well come out and admit you did it.
Please.
Let me handle the investigation.
Now, Mr. Bartowski, we believe this was an inside job.
None of these other imbeciles could even tie their shoes without Bartowski's say-so.
If there's a ringleader, you're looking at him.
Where's my fish, Bartowski?
!
Okay, start talking.
From the beginning.
Okay.
Um...
I was born a Cesarean section.
And I always felt like I was robbed of that headlong voyage through the uterine canal.
Where's the marlin, moron?
Ah, the elusive fish.
Sure.
That's a tale for the ages.
Start talking or I'll pull each and every one of these hairs out of your face, one at a time, starting with this one.
(groans)
Torture?
Hey, if you're trying to get me to talk, you are using the wrong tactic, brother.
Really?
What's the right tactic?
My own personal kryptonite:
Grape soda.
On the rocks, please.
Conway.
Excuse me, I have to take this.
I got this.
Ah.
You don't want to talk, Bartowski?
We'll just have to turn the heat up on you.
Mm-hmm.
There we go.
Ah.
Proper.
So, it all started with "The Next Call of Duty" game...
Now, I don't really consider it stealing, since I see Chuck and I as being life partners and therefore, community property.
Using my own personal entrance,
I went into Chuck's room to play the game.
Yessss!
And when I reached into the bag, I discovered a...
I found a, uh...
I can't go on.
This is just getting a little personal.
All right, new tactic:
You finish the story or I put your head through the wall.
Okay, someone wasn't hugged enough as a child.
Ugh.
That's horrible.
It's better on the rocks, that's why I told you to...
Anyway, there I was... staring at the most horrific object the world has ever seen.
Noooooo!
What?
Morgan, you scared me to death!
What is wrong with you?
No, no, no, no, no...
no, it's Chuck.
Well, what is it?
What happened?
We've lost him, Ell.
We've lost him forever.
You better sit down.
Um...
I don't know how to say this.
He's gone.
Morgan, what are you talking about?
I'm talking about this.
Chuck's going to propose to Sarah.
And that's pretty much the whole story.
More or less.
Ellie and I bonded over the fact that, you know, he didn't include us in this life decision.
But, hey, who cares, you know, he's got you now, so...
What does that have to do with the fish?
F-Fish?
Who cares about the fish?
John, Chuck's getting married!
Pitas are here.
Hey.
Hey.
You've had 29 deliveries, so I dropped in your free baba ganoush.
Really?
29 deliveries.
Uh-huh.
29 bugs.
Wait a second.
Oh, lunch!
Thank you.
Ooh!
Hey, buddy.
I-I smell falafel.
Yeah, of course you do.
What do you got?
I got the chick...
I'm just going to, let me just have a...
No, no.
You're going to finish the story.
Back to the story.
Ooh!
Come on.
"Boobies."
Jackpot.
Gotcha!
Good thing Jeff and Lester are pervs.
I can see you're sweating it.
So... you ready to tell us what happened here last night?
I'm telling you guys, I have no idea.
Fine.
There's other ways to make you talk.
Time to send you back to gen pop.
He sung like a canary!
Thanks for the info, Chuck.
John Casey!
You're next!
One sec.
What?
Can't fit the police into your social schedule?
Get in here now, or you and I are taking a trip downtown!
If you have a second, Mr. Casey, we'd appreciate it.
LESTER:
I can't believe you told Casey you put the marlin in Chuck's room.
What?
Don't worry.
I moved it into the freezer at the Wienerlicious.
Wow, I'm impressed with you.
Thank you.
Bye.
What?
Where you going?
Where you going?
Where you going, Lizzie?
Lizzie?
Where's she going?
Can I help you?
Yeah.
I was wondering if I could get something out of your freezer.
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.
It's company policy.
The kitchen is usually off- limits for non-employees.
Okay, then I'll have to use my special pass...
You're no hot dog maker.
Bring it on, pita girl.
We're closed!
We're closed!
Where's the fish?
We need to talk.
It's an emergency.
Oh, listen, no, hey, hey, hey, Chuck, Chuck, it's okay, man, I know about you and Sarah.
Man, and how she's more than just your girlfriend.
What?
Morgan, stay.
But I...
Sta... stay!
Hello.
After careful consideration of all potential proposals,
I have made a decision.
Oh, let me guess:
Naked 2K run?
Dinner, Chuck.
Romantic, candlelit dinner, just the two of us.
The coup de grâce...
Wow.
Good.
molten lava cake with a two-carat diamond ring filling.
Ellie will really love that.
Look, Devon, just-just promise me that you'll take care of my sister if anything were to happen.
What's gonna happen?
Oh, hey, cake hits the oven in two hours.
Don't be late.
What am I gonna do?
Do nothing.
You haven't given Sarah the ring yet.
Dude, there's plenty of time to call this whole thing off.
Sarah?
Ring?
Yeah, the ring you got Sarah.
The one I kind of took out of your locker.
You mean... the ring that Awesome got for Ellie.
Oh, thank God, man.
Are you kidding?
I thought I lost you, pal!
Morgan... where is the ring?
It's kind of complicated but...
It's in the freezer at the Wienerlicious.
I put it in Big Mike's marlin and I...
I was gonna put it back.
Ow!
Slide it to me.
Now!
Hey!
Hi, S...
No...
No, no!
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no!
(distant):
Help!
Sarah?
Lizzie's the mole.
She got the receiver, Chuck.
Oh, my God, Sarah, it's over.
They're gonna stick me in some tiny cell with no windows.
Okay, Chuck, I need you to focus.
We can get Lizzie if you can get me out of here.
How?
I keep a backup piece in the jar of horseradish sauce.
Horseradish?
Who-Who-Who puts horseradish on hot dogs?
Chuck!
Got it.
Right.
Hide it someplace nobody would look-- good.
Great.
Okay.
Oh!
Whoa.
I got it.
Okay.
Okay, now shoot the lock.
Um, look, Sarah,
I've never really fired a gun before, okay?
And I've actually done this on purpose to avoid any unpleasant side effects like shooting myself or others.
Just shoot the lock or I will shoot you when I get out of here!
(gasping):
Okay.
Get back.
Ready?
Ready?
Get back.
One...
Two...
Take the safety off first.
One, one sec...
just a little problem.
CONWAY:
Bartowski, Big Mike told me I'd find you here.
Drop the gun, Bartowski!
Now!
No, no, no, no need to shoot.
It's not my gun, it's not my gun-- my girlfriend is locked in the freezer, and if you let her out she can explain everything.
Okay, let's go.
She's right...
Come on, move.
Okay, okay.
Just look in...
Nice try.
Go, go, go!
Look in the freezer, please!
Just look in the freezer.
She's right there.
You're taking this thing a little seriously.
What kind of cop are you?
Where's Big Mike's fish?
What are you now, huh?
Big Man's personal Gestapo?
Come on, you can't break me, fool.
At the Wienerlicious.
SARAH:
Help!
Sarah.
Stand back.
The delivery girl is the mole.
The detective took Chuck.
Where are you, Chuck?
I need the ring.
This is not awesome.
MAN:
And the package, HQ.
This is Long Shore.
You're not a cop.
We've identified the enemy agent.
She was posing as a Pita Parlour delivery girl.
Code name Lizzie.
BECKMAN:
So she escaped with the receiver?
Yes, but she made a phone call.
We're currently tracing the cell signature, and we can triangulate her location.
We just need more time.
GRAHAM:
As soon as you locate her, take her out.
Uh, one of us needs to go and get Chuck out of police custody.
He was arrested just...
BECKMAN:
The Intersect is no longer your concern, Agent Walker.
I...
I don't understand.
BECKMAN:
Detective Conway is CIA.
GRAHAM:
Chuck is on his way to the extraction point right now.
We've decided to transfer him to lockdown immediately.
Is there a problem?
Uh, no.
No.
I just thought I would handle his transfer.
Forget about Chuck, Agent Walker.
Focus on catching that FULCRUM agent.
We're on it.
We, meaning,
I go get Lizzie while you find Chuck.
Well, don't make me change my mind.
So... this is it, huh?
Going to get my own padded cell.
Do I get a bed, or is my whole room kind of like a bed?
It's not as bad as it sounds.
The underground complex where you will be living has state-of-the-art security and amenities.
You'll even be allowed outside to visit controlled locations.
Hold on.
I-I...
I can't leave without telling Ellie something, a reason for going.
What should I say?
Nothing.
It's safer for them if you just... disappear.
CONWAY:
Asset is ready for extraction.
Send in the chopper.
Long Shore!
Is there a problem, Agent Walker?
Sarah, thank God you're here.
Listen, I-I don't...
I don't want to go yet.
I...
It's okay, Chuck.
Agent Casey is tracking the FULCRUM mole.
He should have her in custody soon, so we can hold off on the Chuck transfer for the time being.
If there was a change in the operation,
I would have been contacted.
I have my orders.
We don't have to do this.
This is a judgment call.
Okay, we can just hold Chuck here until we know for sure.
His cover was blown.
He's gone.
No.
I will take full responsibility.
Chuck is my asset;
he's my guy.
Just...
Just give us more time, please.
CHUCK:
I'd appreciate it.
I really would.
Please don't do this.
CONWAY:
Okay.
You've got one minute.
One minute.
I'm not ready, Sarah.
I'm not ready to disappear.
No.
I know, I know.
I need you to talk to Ellie and to Morgan and my friends, and-and- and-and tell 'em...
I don't know.
I...
Look, if I'm supposed to be dead, just say something that will make it okay, that will make 'em feel all right.
Just make sure they know how much I love 'em.
You can do that, right?
Course you can.
You're Sarah.
You can do anything.
And, hey, there's a silver lining to this, too, you know, 'cause we're not working together anymore, which means, we can go on a date.
You can come by my cell, and we can hang out, and you can tell me who the president is.
And maybe, uh maybe we can see how we really feel.
Time's up.
Good-bye, Sarah.
Chuck?
I'll save you later.
(gunshot) Oh!
Oh!
Chuck, get down.
(gunshot)
Go, go, go!
I listened to the receiver.
BOTH:
She knows.
Do you know how many agents are looking for Bryce Larkin?
And all this time, the Intersect was here.
Wait till I tell my superiors that.
Okay, look, what if I surrender, and you run?
I mean, I'm going in a cell anyway.
What's the difference?
Torture.
Okay, no surrender.
I only have one question, Chuck.
Who's the ring for?
She has Ellie's engagement ring?
Try to distract her.
What?
!
How?
Chuck, I'm not gonna to go away.
Okay... okay, look, look, look.
You really...
You really want to take me in?
You're going to have to sweeten the deal a little bit for me.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Uh, look.
Look, the CIA-- they're offering me a nice padded cell, real cush.
Can you beat that?
I'm a guy who enjoys a... a good steam.
Can you do...?
Can you do maybe a steam room or something?
I don't think you're really in a position to bargain, Chuck.
I have two guns.
What do you have?
Me.
Don't break the ring.
Whoa!
Oh!
Oh!
Hey!
Bartowski, get out of the way.
There's really some serious spy fighting going on.
CASEY:
Get down, Bartowski.
Sarah!
(grunts)
I had a feeling that girl was dirty.
Norman.
The power of positive thinking.
This was an amazing night.
As it always is with...
But, sometimes, I know life isn't always awesome.
What I'm trying to say is that, when things get rough,
I want to face them together, the good times and the bad..
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Ladies' feminine products.
That's not good.
That's not good.
Are you, uh...
Are you sure tAre yo
Are you sure that Lizzie didn't have the ring on her?
When they took her away, all she had was the receiver.
Oh, then it's got to be here somewhere.
You know, Chuck, if we can't find it, we can just replace it.
Look, look, look, it-it was Awesome's great-granny's ring, and it's going to be my sister's, okay?
Even if its covered in coffee grounds and miscellaneous DNA.
I have a ring, I have the blessing of your brother.
Will you do me the honor of becoming my wife,
Eleanor Faye Bartowski?
CAPTAIN:
Ooh.
Almost woke her up.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Ah!
Hey!
Oh, I found it!
Let's go.
I'm so sorry... but it might be a little dirty.
Way to go, Chuck.
I always knew you could handle my family jewels.
So to speak.
Uh, when she's sleeping really hard like that, sometimes, if you pinch her nose, it'll wake...
Right.
I'm going to...
Oh, okay.
Mission accomplished.
I can't believe we pulled it off.
That'll make one hell of a story at their wedding.
Which I'm never allowed to talk about under fear of death-- understood.
I have other material.
You want to?
What, spy?
You?
She looks so happy.
Yeah, she does.
I couldn't leave them yet.
You don't have to worry about that.
You're safe.
Yeah, safe for now, though.
Right.
I mean... they keep getting closer.
Eventually, they're going to figure out who I am.
Don't you think you should go in and congratulate Ellie?
You want to come in with me?
Oh, it's family time.
I know.
Well, good night.
CHUCK (laughing):
Hey!
Hey, buddy.
Yeah.
Hmm.
We can only keep him here for so long.
You realize that, don't you?
I love you, sweetie.
I love you.
I'm sorry I had to keep it a secret for a little while.
Oh, boy.
Wait.
Go back, go back, go back.
That is God and a surgeon working in harmony.
Here comes the schwarma girl.
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Here you guys go.
Be careful, it's hot.
I don't want for you to burn your tongue on it.
LESTER:
Uh...
- Wow, 29 orders this month.
One more and you'll get a free baba ghanoush.
I'm reaching in my pocket for money, not for...
Hey, do you have change?
Oh, she's...
Did you get it?
- Fellas.
- Oh, boy.
What are you guys doing?
Or have you forgotten about Big Mike's policy on Mammary Cam?
I don't know what you're talking about, Chuck.
He doesn't know?
So you didn't remove the offending video from the camcorder and hand it to Lester, who's now hiding it behind his back?
What?
Wow, my feelings are hurt.
Charles, after all these years, where's the trust, my friend?
In Jeff's sweaty palms, along with the amateur consumer porn.
LESTER:
Look...
- Hey, Chuck?
Uh, can I talk to you for a sec?
Move.
Awesome to see you, Devon.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
What's up?
- All right.
- So, what's on your mind?
- Chuck, I was...
- I was hoping to talk to you about Ellie.
- Yeah?
Yeah, yeah, of course.
Well, you know, ever since, um, we've been dating I've come to think of you as that little brother I never had.
- Don't you have two younger brothers?
- Indeed.
Indeed.
But you seem like someone who can offer sage wisdom in confusing times and this is one of those times I am really confused, bro.
I don't know how to put this into words.
- That's a bug.
- What?
What?
Spider?
I hate those fuzzy bastards.
I think, uh, no, you got him.
He was like:
"Rrr," and then: "Boo!" Gone.
Can you excuse me?
I think I Just saw a kid crawling into an oven over in Home Appliances.
Chuck.
Chuck, I need you to drop some knowledge, bro.
Keep moving, Bartowksi.
Nothing to see here.
Not even if I had the time.
You're getting sloppy, Casey.
I understand you have some perverse desire to listen to everybody.
But you really need to be careful hiding your bugs.
What are you lip-smacking about?
I Just found this on one of our product displays and not very well hidden, I might add.
Normally, I'm a fan of your craftsmanship, if not your methods.
Look, all I'm saying is that something discovered by someone could spell trouble.
You worry about that supercomputer.
Let me worry about the spy stuff, huh?
Don't you have a hard drive you can go fix?
[MUTTERING]
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
There's best buddy of mine.
Yeah.
What's up?
Okay, saw an Infinity Ward mail in the trash and that means you got a pre-release demo of the next "Call of Duty" game?
Ah.
Yeah, but the last time I lent you a game sampler it ended up all over the Internet.
This one's gonna stay in my locker.
You can play it when you get some adult supervision.
Adult sup...?
I'm at the age where I should get my prostate checked annually.
I could be trusted with an advance copy of the next greatest game on the planet.
- Have you seen Awesome?
- Over by the Home Theater Room.
I think...
That's...
Really.
[CHUCK SIGHS]
Hey.
Hey.
Sorry about that.
False alarm.
It turned out, anyway, the kid did not end up defrosting himself as it turns out.
So, uh, what, uh...
What's going on?
This is one of those rare moments when things are not kosher, Chuck.
Oh, man.
This is harder than I thought.
Uh-huh.
Go...
Go on.
I'm listening.
Right.
Well, I've been thinking a lot about the way things are between me and your sister.
And you're the man in Ellie's family, so I was wondering can I have your permission?
Can I marry Ellie?
Wow, that...
That's quite...
Quite a rock you got there.
- Is that a yes?
Dude?
- Yes.
Yes.
Sorry.
I Ju...
You kind of...
Wah!
You know, you pulled the...
Blang, Just right in...
- Yes, you have my blessing.
- Thank you.
Thank...
It's been in my family for years.
This was my great-grandmother's.
- Ha, ha.
Uh, you think she'll like it?
- Like it?
She'Il...
She'll love it.
I'm Just not sure she'll be able to lift her hand anymore.
Oh, one other thing.
Ellie is a bloodhound.
If I keep this in the apartment, she will smell diamond.
Can you hold onto this for a day or so?
Till I figure out how to pop the question.
- I don't think it's actually a good idea...
- Oh, thank you.
Oh, ho-ho!
Thank you so much, bro.
Hey, pretty soon I'm gonna mean that literally.
- There you go.
- All right.
[SIGHS]
[SPEAKING IN GERMAN]
- We have a problem.
- What do you mean?
Chuck found that in the Buy More.
We have a problem.
The bug Chuck found is a GLG-20, one of the most advanced counter-espionage listening devices in the CIA arsenal.
- This is a CIA design?
- Ha.
Figures.
The GLG-20 uses a low-power transmitter, in order to avoid detection.
It has a maximum range of about 20 yards.
Which means there's probably a receiver hidden somewhere inside the Buy More.
We believe it's recently become a favorite of the Fulcrum agents.
So you're telling us the secret government cabal that abducted Bryce Larkin and came within a hair of figuring out that Chuck's the Intersect is now skulking around the Buy More?
We need you to locate that receiver, and find the person who planted it.
BECKMAN:
You have 48 hours.
If you cannot identify the enemy operative in that time we will have no choice but to relocate Chuck to a secure government holding facility.
GRAHAM:
Bartowski's time as a civilian may be coming to an end.
For their own safety, his family may never see him again.
MIKE:
When are these ladies gonna learn?
They don't want someone taking a picture of their business, put some drawers on.
[SIGHS]
[GASPS, YELLS]
[WHIMPERS]
[CHATTER OVER POLICE RADIO]
- Hey, think we should make a run for it?
- You don't run from the cops.
- You look guilty or shot in the back.
- We are guilty.
Shh!
Bring me down and I will cut you.
- So no locks broken?
No alarms set off?
- Nope.
It's clean.
- Must be an inside Job.
- Thought of that.
You think any of these dummies can mastermind all this?
It's almost always someone close to the operation.
When I find out who robbed my store and stole my fish I'm gonna break my foot off in his behind.
- [WHISPERS] Oh, my God.
- Shh.
Hey.
CHUCK:
Hey.
What's with the, uh, police presence outside?
They robbed the Buy More, man.
They took everything.
- They took everything?
- Everything.
Oh, please, God, no.
Please be there.
Please be there.
Oh, God.
The ring.
They took Ellie's ring.
Oh, my God.
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
[WHIMPERS]
Oh!
Oh!
- Hey.
DEVON:
Chuckles, what's up?
Listen, dude, I figured out how I'm gonna pop the Q.
The Q?
What...
What Q?
What's a Q?
You know, the Q, the big Q you only ask once in a lifetime.
Can't say right now, Mom.
Is that your mom?
Tell her that I love that kittens playing with the yarn sweater that she knitted.
You got it, babe.
Ha-ha-ha.
- I'm gonna do it while we're skydiving.
- Really?
Do you think, uh...
Do you think that's a good idea?
Not the first time in the mile-high club, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, uh...
Listen, skydiving is a little...
A little risky.
- Don't you think?
You could drop the ring.
- Whoa, hot call, dude.
Hate to lose my great-granny's ring.
She gave it to me right before she passed.
You know?
She knew Ellie was the one before I did.
Great, great, okay so...
Just let me know when you figure something else out.
- Okay.
- But, Devon, um...
- Take your time.
- You got it, brother.
[SIGHS]
[GROANS]
Detective Conway here is convinced that this is an inside Job.
And we intend to get to the bottom of this.
Bartowski, get over here!
You're a suspect too.
You all are.
When that pig talks to you, look him in the eye and say nothing.
- Zip it.
- Nothing?
Come on, that's incredibly rude, Jeffrey.
- Dead men tell no tales.
- Ha.
Stop it.
Quit messing around.
Bartowski, where's Casey?
Don't you two usually carpool together?
Yes.
Yes, sir, we absolutely do.
But, uh, not today.
Why don't you go find out why his ass is so tardy?
Someone might find that suspicious.
Sure, I can...
I can do that.
I'll Just...
I Just have to make...
[LINE RINGING]
CASEY:
What?
- Where are you?
Mike's looking for you.
He's gonna be looking for both of us.
Now get down here.
No.
Listen to me.
I need you, okay?
Someone cleaned out the Buy More.
They took everything, my sister's ring the one she's supposed to wear forever.
Awesome is supposed to propose to her, he trusted me and now it's gone.
Save it for your coffee klatch, Bartowski.
Get down here.
We got bigger fish to fry.
You robbed the Buy More?
SARAH:
We had no choice.
CHUCK:
No choice?
Out of your mind?
Do you have any idea what's going on at the store?
That bug you found, it isn't one of ours.
- What bug?
Who ours?
SARAH:
The one you found yesterday.
Casey only installed EM-50's.
The one you found was a GLG-20.
It requires a secondary recording device nearby to collect the data.
- What are you talking about?
- Someone is spying on us.
- What?
- Okay, the bug you found was not ours.
It belongs to an enemy agent, probably Fulcrum.
They planted it in the Buy More.
- Why?
CASEY:
They're looking for the Intersect.
They're looking for you.
We found a total of 29 bugs Just like it, but we still haven't found the receiver.
Okay.
Okay, well, wow.
Uh, extreme...
Extreme measures, but, uh, decisive action had to be taken.
Good luck schlepping all this stuff back to the Buy More.
Uh, I'm gonna get back there and pretend I don't know.
Got any good tips for beating a polygraph?
SARAH:
Chuck, wait.
- What?
Oh, duh, yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.
Can I get my sister's ring back?
You guys are damn thorough.
You should be concerned about not making...
Can I talk to you for a second?
Hold on.
He can't hear it like that.
He won't process it.
How do you give a man a life sentence Just for being a good guy?
Okay, how about I give it a try, gently?
No, I don't wanna to hear your version of it and neither does he.
It's a Job.
How come you gotta get your lady feelings...?
- It has nothing to do...
- Agent Walker, major Casey you might wanna take a look at this.
[METAL DETECTOR SQUEALING]
This is a surveillance tape taken during the robbery.
There's nothing there.
Bad guy disabled the security.
Wait.
CHUCK:
Hey, that's Jeff and Lester.
- It's off.
CHUCK:
And they are apparently drunk.
It appears they've mistakenly turned the camera back on.
- Hang on a second, who's that?
SARAH:
That's the spy.
Who's the spy who spies on spies?
Why would a Fulcrum agent want Big Mike's marlin?
Those two dilweeds interrupted an actual robbery in progress.
- The receiver's in the fish.
- Marlin, actually.
- You would call it a marlin, right?
Yeah.
- Look.
[CHUCK LAUGHS]
See?
There you go.
Done.
My Job here is done.
So now I'm sure you super-agents can figure out where the two drunken pinheads stashed the fish.
Marlin.
Four-foot marlin.
I'm gonna stick around here and find my ring.
Hey, Chuck?
Chuck, no ring came up in our inventory.
What do you mean, "No ring came up in your inventory"?
You robbed the Buy More, didn't you?
What happened to Awesome's ring?
We have some bigger-picture concerns right now.
What could be possibly be bigger than me ruining the chances of my sister getting married?
The receiver may contain information indicating that you're the Intersect.
Say it.
Say what you're not saying.
If we don't locate the receiver in the next 24 hours...
You'll be stored in an bunker for so long you'll forget what fresh air smells like.
See?
That was very gentle.
JEFF AND LESTER:
One, two, three, four.
I declare a thumb war!
[EMPLO YEES SHOUTING]
Oh!
Come on, Jeffrey.
Jeff, Lester, we gotta talk, it's important.
Here's your problem, Charlie.
Why's your time more valuable than mine?
Oh, he is taking him over the top.
- All right.
Okay.
LESTER:
Oh, my thumb.
[LESTER GROANS]
- Narc.
- Narc, narc.
ALL [COUGHING]:
Narc.
Narc.
Narc.
- Easy on the shirt, narc.
- Where's the fish?
Fish?
What fish?
Okay, we can do this the easy or the hard way.
Easy way is I shove his foot up your ass.
- What's the hard way?
- I use my foot.
CHUCK:
We've seen the surveillance footage, guys.
Okay?
- We know you were here.
- Yeah, right.
Yeah, you two geniuses thought you were turning the cameras off but instead, you turned them back on.
We won't say anything to Big Mike, I promise.
Okay.
Whoa, what's happening?
Charles, would you give us a few minutes, please?
Chuck?
- It was his idea.
- What?
!
The whole reason we snuck in was to get your ass another drink.
- You were getting the shakes.
- Not cool.
It's a disease.
You're a disease and you've diseased us all.
Me, Chuck, this guy.
- Calm down.
Calm down.
- Okay.
Look, Jeff, I totally understand your plight.
We sympathize with you, okay?
And we don't Judge.
Just tell us, what exactly happened?
We were across the street at Bennigan's and I got cut off again...
Jeff.
Ha, ha.
If you're gonna tell the story, please, don't butcher it.
We were at Benni's, enjoying the deep-fried sampler and we decided to come back to the store for a nightcap in the boss man 's private stash.
It's off.
Rock 'n' roll.
We have the store to ourselves.
We should take off all our clothes.
Don't make me uncomfortable to be alone with you.
- Go get it.
- Bingo.
LESTER:
Yes.
JEFF:
No.
- No, no, no.
- Jeffrey.
This is a wasted mission now.
It's a wasted mission.
We've gotta do something exciting, man.
We can burn it down.
I was thinking more along the lines of a fishing expedition.
And that, friends, is the story of the missing marlin.
And where is the marlin now?
Ah, I'm afraid I'm going to need a little compensation.
- At Chuck's.
We took it to Chuck's pad.
- What?
My apartment?
Why?
We didn't want to get busted with Big Mike's fish.
LESTER:
I'm gonna need lotion.
SARAH:
We're pursuing the receiver.
We've the location and it shouldn't be long before recovery.
Stay with the receiver.
In the meantime, we've decided to extract Chuck.
What?
But we don't know he's in danger.
There's a chance the identity of the Intersect has been compromised.
We have to err on the side of caution.
But you promised we had 48 hours.
You know the game, Agent Walker.
The order has gone out.
Chuck is coming in.
Come on.
Chuck, you're looking for a marlin.
Hey, hey, whoa!
Whoa, stop, stop.
I seriously doubt that these geniuses had time to re-upholster the couch.
Well, it's gotta be here somewhere.
Chuck?
- Hey, sis.
- John.
- Hi.
- What are you two up to?
- What's going on?
- I'll clean it up later.
- We're looking for something.
- What is it?
Whatever you want to talk about is not as important as what we're looking for.
Okay.
What are you looking for?
- A stuffed fish.
- A fish?
Marlin, about four feet long, got a spear-like nose.
- And a mouth.
- Yeah.
Okay, Chuck, I get it.
Besides, if anything really important were going on you have people in your life you can talk to about it.
- Hey, Ellie, wait.
ELLIE:
What?
Oh.
I love you.
Just in case.
Just in case of what?
Uh...
Just in...
Just in case I can't find the fish.
I suppose you haven't talked to Morgan.
No.
Why?
Because he left here last night with a four-foot long marlin.
He's mine.
And you know nothing about the stolen merchandise?
- No, sir.
Officer.
Detective.
- Where's my fish, Grimes?
- Mr. Tucker, please.
- The merchandise is insured.
That fish cost me 200 bucks on eBay.
Wait, you bought that fish?
Ha-ha-ha!
- That will be all, Mr. Grimes.
- What did you do for bait, PayPal?
CONWAY:
Grimes, out.
- All right.
Yes, sir.
- You cracked, didn't you?
LESTER:
You are so weak.
So weak.
How am I weak?
I didn't say anything.
- How am I to believe that?
- Bartowski!
You're up.
You go.
I got the scraggly troll.
L...
I did not rob the store.
Did I ask you that?
Already he's talking about stolen goods.
- Might as well admit you did it.
- Please.
Let me handle the investigation.
Now, Mr. Bartowski we believe this was an inside Job.
None of these imbeciles could tie shoes without Bartowski's say-so.
If there's a ringleader, you're looking at him.
Where's my fish, Bartowski?
Okay, start talking.
- From the beginning.
- Okay.
Um, I was born a cesarean section.
I always felt robbed of that headlong voyage through the uterine canal.
Where's the marlin, moron?
Ah, the elusive fish.
Sure.
That's a tale for the ages.
Start talking, or I'll pull each one of these hairs out of your face one at a time, starting with this one.
[MORGAN GROANS]
Torture?
If you're trying to get me to talk, you are using the wrong tactic, brother.
Really?
What's the right tactic?
My own personal kryptonite:
Grape soda.
On the rocks, please.
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
Conway.
- Excuse me, I have to take this.
- I got this.
Ah.
[DOOR OPENS]
[DOOR CLOSES]
You don't wanna talk, Bartowski?
We'll Just have to turn the heat up on you.
[MIKE CHUCKLES]
[DOOR OPENS]
[DOOR CLOSES]
MORGAN:
Mm, mm.
There we go.
Ahh.
Proper.
So it all started with the next "Call of Duty" game.
MORGAN:
I don 't really consider it stealing since I see Chuck and I more as life partners, and therefore community property.
Using my own personal entrance I went into Chuck's room to play the game.
Yes.
And when I reached into the bag, I discovered...
I found a...
I can't go on.
- This is Just getting a little personal.
- All right, new tactic.
Finish the story or I put your head through the wall.
Okay, someone wasn't hugged enough as a child.
Ugh.
- That's horrible.
- It's better on the rocks, that's why I...
Anyway, there I was staring at the most horrific object the world has ever seen.
No!
What?
Morgan?
You scared me to death.
What is wrong with you?
No, no, no.
No, it's Chuck.
- What is it?
What happened?
- We've lost him, EII.
We've lost him forever.
L...
You better sit down.
Um...
I don't know how to say this.
He's gone.
Morgan, what are you talking about?
I'm talking about this.
Chuck's gonna propose to Sarah.
MORGAN:
That's pretty much the whole story.
More or less.
Ellie and I bonded over the fact that he didn't include us in this life decision.
But, hey, who cares, you know?
He's got you now, so...
What does that have to do with the fish?
Fish?
Who cares about the fish, John?
Chuck's getting married.
LESTER:
Pitas are here.
Hey, hey.
Hey.
Hey.
LIZZIE:
You had 29 deliveries so I dropped in your free baba ghanoush.
- Really?
Twenty-nine deliveries, 29 bugs.
Wait a second.
Oh, lunch.
JEFF:
Thank you.
- Hey, buddy.
- I smell falafel.
- Of course you do.
Come on.
- Come on.
- I'm Just gonna finish...
You're gonna finish the story.
MORGAN:
Back to the story.
Whoa!
"Boobies."
Jackpot.
[TYPING]
CHUCK:
Got you.
Good thing Jeff and Lester are pervs.
[WHIMPERS]
I can see you're sweating it.
So you ready to tell us what happened here last night?
I'm telling you, guys, I have no idea.
Fine.
There's other ways to make you talk.
Time to send you back to gen pop.
He sung like a canary.
Thanks for the info, Chuck.
- John Casey, you're next.
- One sec.
What, can't fit the police into your social schedule?
Get in here now or you and I are taking a trip downtown.
You have a second, Mr. Casey?
We'd appreciate it.
LESTER:
I can't believe you told Casey you put the marlin in Chuck's room.
What?
Don't worry, I moved it to the freezer at the Wienerlicious.
- Wow.
I'm impressed.
MORGAN:
Thank you.
- Bye.
LESTER:
Whoa.
Where you going?
Where you going?
Where you going, Lizzie?
Lizzie?
Where is she going?
[DOOR CHIMES RING]
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.
I was wondering if I could get something out of your freezer.
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.
It's a company policy.
The kitchen is usually off-limits for non-employees.
Okay, then I'll have to use my special pass.
[BOTH GRUNT]
You're not a hot-dog maker.
Bring it on, pita girl.
[BOTH GRUNTING]
[BO YS CHATTERING]
BOTH:
We're closed!
Where's the fish?
- We need to talk.
It's an emergency.
- Listen, no.
Hey.
Chuck.
Chuck, it's okay, man.
I know about you and Sarah.
Man, and how she's more than Just your girlfriend.
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
What?
Morgan, stay.
Aah!
Stay.
- Hello.
- After careful consideration of all potential proposals, I have made a decision.
Oh.
Let me guess.
Naked 2-K run?
Dinner, Chuck.
Romantic, candlelit dinner.
- Just the two of us.
- Wow, good.
The coup de grâce:
Molten lava cake with a two-carat diamond ring filling.
Ellie will really love that.
Devon, Just promise me you'll take care of my sister if anything were to happen.
What's gonna happen?
Oh, hey.
Cake hits the oven in two hours.
Don't be late.
What am I gonna do?
MORGAN:
You can do nothing.
You didn't give Sarah the ring yet.
Dude, there's time to call this whole thing off.
Sarah, ring?
Yeah, the ring you got Sarah.
The one I kind of took out of your locker.
You mean the ring that Awesome got for Ellie.
Oh, thank God, man.
Are you kidding?
- I thought I lost you, pal.
L...
- Morgan where is the ring?
It's kind of complicated, but...
In the freezer at Wienerlicious.
I put it in Big Mike's marlin.
Was gonna put it back.
Ow.
LIZZIE:
Slide it to me.
Now.
Hey.
No, no, no.
No, no, no!
[BANGING ON DOOR]
SARAH:
Help!
Help me!
Sarah?
Lizzie's the mole.
She got the receiver, Chuck.
Sarah, it's over.
They're gonna stick me in some cell.
Okay, Chuck, I need you to focus.
We can get Lizzie if you can get me out.
- How?
- I keep a backup piece in the Jar of horseradish sauce.
- Who puts horseradish on hot dogs?
- Chuck.
Got it, right.
Hide it someplace nobody would look.
Good.
Right.
Okay.
Oh!
Oh!
I got it.
Okay.
Okay, now shoot the lock.
Um, look, Sarah, I've never really fired a gun and I've actually done this on purpose to avoid shooting myself or others.
Just shoot the lock, or I will shoot you when I get out of here.
Okay.
Get back.
Ready?
Get back.
One two...
[CLICKS]
Take the safety off first.
One...
One sec...
Just a little problem.
CONWAY:
Bartowski.
Big Mike told me I'd find you here.
- Drop the gun now!
CHUCK:
No, no, no.
No need to shoot.
That's not my gun.
My girlfriend is in the freezer.
Let her out she can explain.
- Let's go.
- She's right...
Okay.
Okay.
- Come on, move.
- Just look in the freezer.
CONWAY:
Nice try.
Please, Just look in the freezer.
She's right there.
Aren't you taking this a little seriously?
Where is Big Mike's fish?
What are you now, huh?
Big man's personal gestapo?
Come on.
You can't break me, fool.
At the Wienerlicious.
[GASPS]
[SIGHS]
SARAH:
Help!
[BANGING ON DOOR]
- Casey.
- Sarah.
Stand back.
The delivery girl is the mole.
The detective took Chuck.
Where are you, Chuck?
I need the ring.
This is not awesome.
I have the package, HQ.
This is Long Shore.
You're not a cop.
We've identified the enemy agent.
She was posing as a Pita Parlor delivery girl.
SARAH:
Code name:
Lizzie.
BECKMAN:
So she escaped with the receiver?
Yes, but she made a call.
We're tracing the cell signature and we can triangulate her location.
- We Just need more time.
- As soon as you locate her, take her out.
Uh, one of us needs to get Chuck out of police custody.
- He was arrested Just...
- The Intersect is no longer your concern.
L...
I don't understand.
BECKMAN:
Detective Conway is CIA.
Chuck is on his way to the extraction point right now.
We've decided to transfer him to lockdown immediately.
Is there a problem?
Uh, no.
No.
I Just thought I would handle his transfer.
Forget about Chuck, Agent Walker.
Focus on catching that Fulcrum agent.
We're on it.
We, meaning I go get Lizzie while you find Chuck.
Well, don't make me change my mind.
So this is it, huh?
Gonna get my own padded cell.
Do I get a bed, or is my whole room kind of like a bed?
It's not as bad as it sounds.
The underground complex you'll live in has state-of-the-art security and amenities.
You'll even be allowed outside to visit controlled locations.
I can't leave without telling Ellie, a reason for going.
What should I say?
Nothing.
It's safer for them if you Just disappear.
LONG SHORE [OVER RADIO]:
The package is ready for extraction.
Send in the chopper.
SARAH:
Long Shore!
- Is there a problem?
- Thank God you're here.
I don't wanna go yet.
I ca...
Agent Casey is tracking the Fulcrum mole he should have her in custody soon, so we can hold off on the Chuck transfer.
If there was a change, I would have been contacted.
- I have my orders.
- We don't have to.
This is a Judgment call.
We can hold Chuck here until we know for sure.
- His cover was blown, he's gone.
- No.
I will take full responsibility.
Chuck is my asset.
He's my guy.
Just give us more time, please.
I'd appreciate it.
I really would.
Please don't do this.
LONG SHORE:
Okay, you got one minute.
One minute.
- Sarah, I'm not ready to disappear.
- No, I know.
I need you to talk to Ellie and to Morgan and my friends and tell them...
I don't know.
Look, if I'm supposed to be dead, Just say something that will make it okay, that will make them feel all right.
Just make sure they know how much I love them.
You can do that, right?
Of course you can.
You're Sarah.
You can do anything.
Hey, there's a silver lining to this too, you know?
Because we're not working together anymore, so we can go on a date.
You can come by my cell and we can hang out.
And you can tell me who the president is.
And maybe, uh...
Maybe we can see how we really feel.
Time's up.
Goodbye, Sarah.
Chuck?
I'll save you later.
[GUNSHOT]
- Oh!
- Get down.
[CHUCK YELLING]
LIZZIE:
I listened to the receiver.
BOTH:
She knows.
Do you know how many agents are looking for Bryce Larkin?
And all this time, the Intersect was here.
Wait until my superiors find out.
Look, what if I surrender and you run?
I'll be in the cell.
What's the difference?
- Torture.
- Okay, no surrender.
I only have one question, Chuck.
Who's the ring for?
- She has Ellie's ring.
- Chuck, distract her.
What?
How?
Aah!
- Chuck, I'm not gonna go away.
- Okay.
Okay, look, look, look.
You really wanna take me in?
You're gonna have to sweeten the deal a little for me.
Hey, hey, hey, uh, look.
Look, the CIA, they're offering me a nice, padded cell real cush.
Can you beat that?
I'm a guy who enjoys a good steam.
Can you do...?
Can you do maybe a steam room?
I don't think you're really in a position to bargain, Chuck.
I have two guns.
What do you have?
Me.
Don't break the ring!
[BOTH GRUNTING]
CASEY:
Hey!
Bartowski, get out of the way.
CHUCK:
There's really serious spy fighting going on.
CASEY:
Get down, Chuck.
[BOTH SCREAMING]
Sarah!
[CRASH]
CHUCK:
Oh!
- I had a feeling that girl was dirty.
[CHUCKLES]
Norman.
The power of positive thinking.
This was an amazing night as it always is with...
But sometimes, I know life isn't always awesome.
What I'm trying to say is that when things get rough I wanna face them together the good times and the bad.
Oh, oh, oh!
Ladies' feminine products.
That's not good, that's not good.
Are you...?
Are you sure that Lizzie didn't have the ring on her?
When they took her away, all she had was the receiver.
- Then it's gotta be here.
- You know Chuck, if we can't find it, we can Just replace it.
It was Awesome's great-granny's ring and it's gonna be my sister's.
Even if it's covered in coffee grounds and miscellaneous DNA.
I have a ring and I have the blessing of your brother.
Would you do me the honor of being my wife, Eleanor Faye Bartowski?
[SNORES]
[GAGGING]
Ah!
Hey!
Ha-ha-ha!
I found it!
CHUCK:
Let's go.
I'm so sorry.
It might be a little dirty.
Wait to go, Chuck.
I always knew you could handle my family Jewels.
So to speak.
[SIGHS]
Uh, when she's sleeping really hard like that sometimes if you pinch her nose it'll wake...
Right.
I'm gonna...
Oh, okay.
Mission accomplished.
I can't believe you pulled it off.
Well, it'll make one hell of a story at their wedding.
Which I'm never allowed to talk about under fear of death.
Understood.
I have other material.
You wanna?
What, spy?
You?
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
- She looks so happy.
- Yeah, she does.
I couldn't leave them yet.
You don't have to worry about that.
You're safe.
Yeah, safe for now, though.
Right.
I mean, they keep getting closer.
Eventually, they're gonna figure out who I am.
Don't you think you should go in and congratulate Ellie?
You wanna come in with me?
Oh, it's family time.
I know.
Well, good night.
[DOOR OPENS]
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
We can only keep him here for so long.
You realize that, don't you?
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]

Oh, boy.
Wait.
Go back, go back, go back.
That is God and a surgeon working in harmony.
Here comes the schwarma girl.
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Here you guys go.
Be careful, it's hot.
I don't want for you to burn your tongue on it.
- Uh...
- Wow, 29 orders this month.
One more and you'll get a free baba ghanoush.
I'm reaching in my pocket for money, not for...
Hey, do you have change?
Oh, she's...
Did you get it?
- Fellas.
- Oh, boy.
What are you guys doing?
Or have you forgotten about Big Mike's policy on Mammary Cam?
I don't know what you're talking about, Chuck.
He doesn't know?
So you didn't remove the offending video from the camcorder and hand it to Lester, who's now hiding it behind his back?
What?
Wow, my feelings are hurt.
Charles, after all these years, where's the trust, my friend?
In Jeff's sweaty palms, along with the amateur consumer porn.
- Look...
- Hey, Chuck?
Uh, can I talk to you for a sec?
Move.
Awesome to see you, Devon.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
What's up?
- All right.
- So, what's on your mind?
- Chuck, I was...
- I was hoping to talk to you about Ellie.
- Yeah?
Yeah, yeah, of course.
Well, you know, ever since, um, we've been dating I've come to think of you as that little brother I never had.
- Don't you have two younger brothers?
- Indeed.
Indeed.
But you seem like someone who can offer sage wisdom in confusing times and this is one of those times I am really confused, bro.
I don't know how to put this into words.
- That's a bug.
- What?
What?
Spider?
I hate those fuzzy bastards.
I think, uh, no, you got him.
He was like:
"Rrr," and then: "Boo!" Gone.
Can you excuse me?
I think I just saw a kid crawling into an oven over in Home Appliances.
Chuck.
Chuck, I need you to drop some knowledge, bro.
Keep moving, Bartowksi.
Nothing to see here.
Not even if I had the time.
You're getting sloppy, Casey.
I understand you have some perverse desire to listen to everybody.
But you really need to be careful hiding your bugs.
What are you lip-smacking about?
I just found this on one of our product displays and not very well hidden, I might add.
Normally, I'm a fan of your craftsmanship, if not your methods.
Look, all I'm saying is that something discovered by someone could spell trouble.
You worry about that supercomputer.
Let me worry about the spy stuff, huh?
Don't you have a hard drive you can go fix?
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
There's best buddy of mine.
Yeah.
What's up?
Okay, saw an Infinity Ward mail in the trash and that means you got a pre-release demo of the next "Call of Duty" game?
Ah.
Yeah, but the last time I lent you a game sampler it ended up all over the Internet.
This one's gonna stay in my locker.
You can play it when you get some adult supervision.
Adult sup...?
I'm at the age where I should get my prostate checked annually.
I could be trusted with an advance copy of the next greatest game on the planet.
- Have you seen Awesome?
- Over by the Home Theater Room.
I think...
That's...
Really.
Hey.
Hey.
Sorry about that.
False alarm.
It turned out, anyway, the kid did not end up defrosting himself as it turns out.
So, uh, what, uh...
What's going on?
This is one of those rare moments when things are not kosher, Chuck.
Oh, man.
This is harder than I thought.
Uh-huh.
Go...
Go on.
I'm listening.
Right.
Well, I've been thinking a lot about the way things are between me and your sister.
And you're the man in Ellie's family, so I was wondering can I have your permission?
Can I marry Ellie?
Wow, that...
That's quite...
Quite a rock you got there.
- Is that a yes?
Dude?
- Yes.
Yes.
Sorry.
I ju...
You kind of...
Wah!
You know, you pulled the...
Blang, just right in...
- Yes, you have my blessing.
- Thank you.
Thank...
It's been in my family for years.
This was my great-grandmother's.
- Ha, ha.
Uh, you think she'll like it?
- Like it?
She'll...
She'll love it.
I'm just not sure she'll be able to lift her hand anymore.
Oh, one other thing.
Ellie is a bloodhound.
If I keep this in the apartment, she will smell diamond.
Can you hold onto this for a day or so?
Till I figure out how to pop the question.
- I don't think it's actually a good idea...
- Oh, thank you.
Oh, ho-ho!
Thank you so much, bro.
Hey, pretty soon I'm gonna mean that literally.
- There you go.
- All right.
- We have a problem.
- What do you mean?
Chuck found that in the Buy More.
We have a problem.
The bug Chuck found is a GLG-20, one of the most advanced counter-espionage listening devices in the CIA arsenal.
- This is a CIA design?
- Ha.
Figures.
The GLG-20 uses a low-power transmitter, in order to avoid detection.
It has a maximum range of about 20 yards.
Which means there's probably a receiver hidden somewhere inside the Buy More.
We believe it's recently become a favorite of the Fulcrum agents.
So you're telling us the secret government cabal that abducted Bryce Larkin and came within a hair of figuring out that Chuck's the Intersect is now skulking around the Buy More?
We need you to locate that receiver, and find the person who planted it.
You have 48 hours.
If you cannot identify the enemy operative in that time we will have no choice but to relocate Chuck to a secure government holding facility.
Bartowski's time as a civilian may be coming to an end.
For their own safety, his family may never see him again.
When are these ladies gonna learn?
They don't want someone taking a picture of their business, put some drawers on.
- Hey, think we should make a run for it?
- You don't run from the cops.
- You look guilty or shot in the back.
- We are guilty.
Shh!
Bring me down and I will cut you.
- So no locks broken?
No alarms set off?
- Nope.
It's clean.
- Must be an inside job.
- Thought of that.
You think any of these dummies can mastermind all this?
It's almost always someone close to the operation.
When I find out who robbed my store and stole my fish I'm gonna break my foot off in his behind.
- Oh, my God.
- Shh.
Hey.
Hey.
What's with the, uh, police presence outside?
They robbed the Buy More, man.
They took everything.
- They took everything?
- Everything.
Oh, please, God, no.
Please be there.
Please be there.
Oh, God.
The ring.
They took Ellie's ring.
Oh, my God.
Oh!
Oh!
- Hey.
- Chuckles, what's up?
Listen, dude, I figured out how I'm gonna pop the Q.
The Q?
What...
What Q?
What's a Q?
You know, the Q, the big Q you only ask once in a lifetime.
Can't say right now, Mom.
Is that your mom?
Tell her that I love that kittens playing with the yarn sweater that she knitted.
You got it, babe.
Ha-ha-ha.
- I'm gonna do it while we're skydiving.
- Really?
Do you think, uh...
Do you think that's a good idea?
Not the first time in the mile-high club, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, uh...
Listen, skydiving is a little...
A little risky.
- Don't you think?
You could drop the ring.
- Whoa, hot call, dude.
Hate to lose my great-granny's ring.
She gave it to me right before she passed.
You know?
She knew Ellie was the one before I did.
Great, great, okay so...
Just let me know when you figure something else out.
- Okay.
- But, Devon, um...
- Take your time.
- You got it, brother.
Detective Conway here is convinced that this is an inside job.
And we intend to get to the bottom of this.
Bartowski, get over here!
You're a suspect too.
You all are.
When that pig talks to you, look him in the eye and say nothing.
- Zip it.
- Nothing?
Come on, that's incredibly rude, Jeffrey.
- Dead men tell no tales.
- Ha.
Stop it.
Quit messing around.
Bartowski, where's Casey?
Don't you two usually carpool together?
Yes.
Yes, sir, we absolutely do.
But, uh, not today.
Why don't you go find out why his ass is so tardy?
Someone might find that suspicious.
Sure, I can...
I can do that.
I'll just...
I just have to make...
What?
- Where are you?
Mike's looking for you.
He's gonna be looking for both of us.
Now get down here.
No.
Listen to me.
I need you, okay?
Someone cleaned out the Buy More.
They took everything, my sister's ring the one she's supposed to wear forever.
Awesome is supposed to propose to her, he trusted me and now it's gone.
Save it for your coffee klatch, Bartowski.
Get down here.
We got bigger fish to fry.
You robbed the Buy More?
We had no choice.
No choice?
Out of your mind?
Do you have any idea what's going on at the store?
That bug you found, it isn't one of ours.
- What bug?
Who ours?
The one you found yesterday.
Casey only installed EM-50's.
The one you found was a GLG-20.
It requires a secondary recording device nearby to collect the data.
- What are you talking about?
- Someone is spying on us.
- What?
- Okay, the bug you found was not ours.
It belongs to an enemy agent, probably Fulcrum.
They planted it in the Buy More.
- Why?
- They're looking for the Intersect.
They're looking for you.
We found a total of 29 bugs just like it, but we still haven't found the receiver.
Okay.
Okay, well, wow.
Uh, extreme...
Extreme measures, but, uh, decisive action had to be taken.
Good luck schlepping all this stuff back to the Buy More.
Uh, I'm gonna get back there and pretend I don't know.
Got any good tips for beating a polygraph?
Chuck, wait.
- What?
Oh, duh, yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.
Can I get my sister's ring back?
You guys are damn thorough.
You should be concerned about not making...
Can I talk to you for a second?
Hold on.
He can't hear it like that.
He won't process it.
How do you give a man a life sentence just for being a good guy?
Okay, how about I give it a try, gently?
No, I don't wanna to hear your version of it and neither does he.
It's a job.
How come you gotta get your lady feelings...?
- It has nothing to do...
- Agent Walker, Major Casey you might wanna take a look at this.
This is a surveillance tape taken during the robbery.
There's nothing there.
Bad guy disabled the security.
Wait.
Hey, that's Jeff and Lester.
- It's off.
And they are apparently drunk.
It appears they've mistakenly turned the camera back on.
- Hang on a second, who's that?
That's the spy.
Who's the spy who spies on spies?
Why would a Fulcrum agent want Big Mike's marlin?
Those two dilweeds interrupted an actual robbery in progress.
- The receiver's in the fish.
- Marlin, actually.
- You would call it a marlin, right?
Yeah.
- Look.
See?
There you go.
Done.
My job here is done.
So now I'm sure you super-agents can figure out where the two drunken pinheads stashed the fish.
Marlin.
Four-foot marlin.
I'm gonna stick around here and find my ring.
Hey, Chuck?
Chuck, no ring came up in our inventory.
What do you mean, "No ring came up in your inventory"?
You robbed the Buy More, didn't you?
What happened to Awesome's ring?
We have some bigger-picture concerns right now.
What could be possibly be bigger than me ruining the chances of my sister getting married?
The receiver may contain information indicating that you're the Intersect.
Say it.
Say what you're not saying.
If we don't locate the receiver in the next 24 hours...
You'll be stored in an bunker for so long you'll forget what fresh air smells like.
See?
That was very gentle.
One, two, three, four.
I declare a thumb war!
Oh!
Come on, Jeffrey.
Jeff, Lester, we gotta talk, it's important.
Here's your problem, Charlie.
Why's your time more valuable than mine?
Oh, he is taking him over the top.
- All right.
Okay.
Oh, my thumb.
- Narc.
- Narc, narc.
Narc.
Narc.
Narc.
- Easy on the shirt, narc.
- Where's the fish?
Fish?
What fish?
Okay, we can do this the easy or the hard way.
Easy way is I shove his foot up your ass.
- What's the hard way?
- I use my foot.
We've seen the surveillance footage, guys.
Okay?
- We know you were here.
- Yeah, right.
Yeah, you two geniuses thought you were turning the cameras off but instead, you turned them back on.
We won't say anything to Big Mike, I promise.
Okay.
Whoa, what's happening?
Charles, would you give us a few minutes, please?
Chuck?
- It was his idea.
- What?
!
The whole reason we snuck in was to get your ass another drink.
- You were getting the shakes.
- Not cool.
It's a disease.
You're a disease and you've diseased us all.
Me, Chuck, this guy.
- Calm down.
Calm down.
- Okay.
Look, Jeff, I totally understand your plight.
We sympathize with you, okay?
And we don't judge.
Just tell us, what exactly happened?
We were across the street at Bennigan's and I got cut off again...
Jeff.
Ha, ha.
If you're gonna tell the story, please, don't butcher it.
We were at Benni's, enjoying the deep-fried sampler and we decided to come back to the store for a nightcap in the boss man's private stash.
It's off.
Rock 'n' roll.
We have the store to ourselves.
We should take off all our clothes.
Don't make me uncomfortable to be alone with you.
- Go get it.
- Bingo.
Yes.
No.
- No, no, no.
- Jeffrey.
This is a wasted mission now.
It's a wasted mission.
We've gotta do something exciting, man.
We can burn it down.
I was thinking more along the lines of a fishing expedition.
And that, friends, is the story of the missing marlin.
And where is the marlin now?
Ah, I'm afraid I'm going to need a little compensation.
- At Chuck's.
We took it to Chuck's pad.
- What?
My apartment?
Why?
We didn't want to get busted with Big Mike's fish.
I'm gonna need lotion.
We're pursuing the receiver.
We've the location and it shouldn't be long before recovery.
Stay with the receiver.
In the meantime, we've decided to extract Chuck.
What?
But we don't know he's in danger.
There's a chance the identity of the Intersect has been compromised.
We have to err on the side of caution.
But you promised we had 48 hours.
You know the game, Agent Walker.
The order has gone out.
Chuck is coming in.
Come on.
Chuck, you're looking for a marlin.
Hey, hey, whoa!
Whoa, stop, stop.
I seriously doubt that these geniuses had time to re-upholster the couch.
Well, it's gotta be here somewhere.
Chuck?
- Hey, sis.
- John.
- Hi.
- What are you two up to?
- What's going on?
- I'll clean it up later.
- We're looking for something.
- What is it?
Whatever you want to talk about is not as important as what we're looking for.
Okay.
What are you looking for?
- A stuffed fish.
- A fish?
Marlin, about four feet long, got a spear-like nose.
- And a mouth.
- Yeah.
Okay, Chuck, I get it.
Besides, if anything really important were going on you have people in your life you can talk to about it.
- Hey, Ellie, wait.
What?
Oh.
I love you.
Just in case.
Just in case of what?
Uh...
Just in...
Just in case I can't find the fish.
I suppose you haven't talked to Morgan.
No.
Why?
Because he left here last night with a four-foot long marlin.
He's mine.
And you know nothing about the stolen merchandise?
- No, sir.
Officer.
Detective.
- Where's my fish, Grimes?
- Mr. Tucker, please.
- The merchandise is insured.
That fish cost me 200 bucks on eBay.
Wait, you bought that fish?
Ha-ha-ha!
- That will be all, Mr. Grimes.
- What did you do for bait, PayPal?
Grimes, out.
- All right.
Yes, sir.
- You cracked, didn't you?
You are so weak.
So weak.
How am I weak?
I didn't say anything.
- How am I to believe that?
- Bartowski!
You're up.
You go.
I got the scraggly troll.
L...
I did not rob the store.
Did I ask you that?
Already he's talking about stolen goods.
- Might as well admit you did it.
- Please.
Let me handle the investigation.
Now, Mr. Bartowski we believe this was an inside job.
None of these imbeciles could tie shoes without Bartowski's say-so.
If there's a ringleader, you're looking at him.
Where's my fish, Bartowski?
Okay, start talking.
- From the beginning.
- Okay.
Um, I was born a cesarean section.
I always felt robbed of that headlong voyage through the uterine canal.
Where's the marlin, moron?
Ah, the elusive fish.
Sure.
That's a tale for the ages.
Start talking, or I'll pull each one of these hairs out of your face one at a time, starting with this one.
Torture?
If you're trying to get me to talk, you are using the wrong tactic, brother.
Really?
What's the right tactic?
My own personal kryptonite:
Grape soda.
On the rocks, please.
Conway.
- Excuse me, I have to take this.
- I got this.
Ah.
You don't wanna talk, Bartowski?
We'll just have to turn the heat up on you.
Mm, mm.
There we go.
Ahh.
Proper.
So it all started with the next "Call of Duty" game.
I don't really consider it stealing since I see Chuck and I more as life partners, and therefore community property.
Using my own personal entrance I went into Chuck's room to play the game.
Yes.
And when I reached into the bag, I discovered...
I found a...
I can't go on.
- This is just getting a little personal.
- All right, new tactic.
Finish the story or I put your head through the wall.
Okay, someone wasn't hugged enough as a child.
Ugh.
- That's horrible.
- It's better on the rocks, that's why I...
Anyway, there I was staring at the most horrific object the world has ever seen.
No!
What?
Morgan?
You scared me to death.
What is wrong with you?
No, no, no.
No, it's Chuck.
- What is it?
What happened?
- We've lost him, Ell.
We've lost him forever.
L...
You better sit down.
Um...
I don't know how to say this.
He's gone.
Morgan, what are you talking about?
I'm talking about this.
Chuck's gonna propose to Sarah.
That's pretty much the whole story.
More or less.
Ellie and I bonded over the fact that he didn't include us in this life decision.
But, hey, who cares, you know?
He's got you now, so...
What does that have to do with the fish?
Fish?
Who cares about the fish, John?
Chuck's getting married.
Pitas are here.
Hey, hey.
Hey.
Hey.
You had 29 deliveries so I dropped in your free baba ghanoush.
- Really?
Twenty-nine deliveries, 29 bugs.
Wait a second.
Oh, lunch.
Thank you.
- Hey, buddy.
- I smell falafel.
- Of course you do.
Come on.
- Come on.
- I'm just gonna finish...
You're gonna finish the story.
Back to the story.
Whoa!
"Boobies. "
Jackpot.
Got you.
Good thing Jeff and Lester are pervs.
I can see you're sweating it.
So you ready to tell us what happened here last night?
I'm telling you, guys, I have no idea.
Fine.
There's other ways to make you talk.
Time to send you back to gen pop.
He sung like a canary.
Thanks for the info, Chuck.
- John Casey, you're next.
- One sec.
What, can't fit the police into your social schedule?
Get in here now or you and I are taking a trip downtown.
You have a second, Mr. Casey?
We'd appreciate it.
I can't believe you told Casey you put the marlin in Chuck's room.
What?
Don't worry, I moved it to the freezer at the Wienerlicious.
- Wow.
I'm impressed.
Thank you.
- Bye.
Whoa.
Where you going?
Where you going?
Where you going, Lizzie?
Lizzie?
Where is she going?
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.
I was wondering if I could get something out of your freezer.
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.
It's a company policy.
The kitchen is usually off-limits for non-employees.
Okay, then I'll have to use my special pass.
You're not a hot-dog maker.
Bring it on, pita girl.
We're closed!
Where's the fish?
- We need to talk.
It's an emergency.
- Listen, no.
Hey.
Chuck.
Chuck, it's okay, man.
I know about you and Sarah.
Man, and how she's more than just your girlfriend.
What?
Morgan, stay.
Aah!
Stay.
- Hello.
- After careful consideration of all potential proposals, I have made a decision.
Oh.
Let me guess.
Naked 2-K run?
Dinner, Chuck.
Romantic, candlelit dinner.
- Just the two of us.
- Wow, good.
The coup de grâce:
Molten lava cake with a two-carat diamond ring filling.
Ellie will really love that.
Devon, just promise me you'll take care of my sister if anything were to happen.
What's gonna happen?
Oh, hey.
Cake hits the oven in two hours.
Don't be late.
What am I gonna do?
You can do nothing.
You didn't give Sarah the ring yet.
Dude, there's time to call this whole thing off.
Sarah, ring?
Yeah, the ring you got Sarah.
The one I kind of took out of your locker.
You mean the ring that Awesome got for Ellie.
Oh, thank God, man.
Are you kidding?
- I thought I lost you, pal.
L...
- Morgan where is the ring?
It's kind of complicated, but...
In the freezer at Wienerlicious.
I put it in Big Mike's marlin.
Was gonna put it back.
Ow.
Slide it to me.
Now.
Hey.
No, no, no.
No, no, no!
Help!
Help me!
Sarah?
Lizzie's the mole.
She got the receiver, Chuck.
Sarah, it's over.
They're gonna stick me in some cell.
Okay, Chuck, I need you to focus.
We can get Lizzie if you can get me out.
- How?
- I keep a backup piece in the jar of horseradish sauce.
- Who puts horseradish on hot dogs?
- Chuck.
Got it, right.
Hide it someplace nobody would look.
Good.
Right.
Okay.
Oh!
Oh!
I got it.
Okay.
Okay, now shoot the lock.
Um, look, Sarah, I've never really fired a gun and I've actually done this on purpose to avoid shooting myself or others.
Just shoot the lock, or I will shoot you when I get out of here.
Okay.
Get back.
Ready?
Get back.
One two...
Take the safety off first.
One...
One sec...
Just a little problem.
Bartowski.
Big Mike told me I'd find you here.
- Drop the gun now!
No, no, no.
No need to shoot.
That's not my gun.
My girlfriend is in the freezer.
Let her out she can explain.
- Let's go.
- She's right...
Okay.
Okay.
- Come on, move.
- Just look in the freezer.
Nice try.
Please, just look in the freezer.
She's right there.
Aren't you taking this a little seriously?
Where is Big Mike's fish?
What are you now, huh?
Big man's personal gestapo?
Come on.
You can't break me, fool.
At the Wienerlicious.
Help!
- Casey.
- Sarah.
Stand back.
The delivery girl is the mole.
The detective took Chuck.
Where are you, Chuck?
I need the ring.
This is not awesome.
I have the package, HQ.
This is Long Shore.
You're not a cop.
We've identified the enemy agent.
She was posing as a Pita Parlor delivery girl.
Code name:
Lizzie.
So she escaped with the receiver?
Yes, but she made a call.
We're tracing the cell signature and we can triangulate her location.
- We just need more time.
- As soon as you locate her, take her out.
Uh, one of us needs to get Chuck out of police custody.
- He was arrested just...
- The Intersect is no longer your concern.
L...
I don't understand.
Detective Conway is CIA.
Chuck is on his way to the extraction point right now.
We've decided to transfer him to lockdown immediately.
Is there a problem?
Uh, no.
No.
I just thought I would handle his transfer.
Forget about Chuck, Agent Walker.
Focus on catching that Fulcrum agent.
We're on it.
We, meaning I go get Lizzie while you find Chuck.
Well, don't make me change my mind.
So this is it, huh?
Gonna get my own padded cell.
Do I get a bed, or is my whole room kind of like a bed?
It's not as bad as it sounds.
The underground complex you'll live in has state-of-the-art security and amenities.
You'll even be allowed outside to visit controlled locations.
I can't leave without telling Ellie, a reason for going.
What should I say?
Nothing.
It's safer for them if you just disappear.
The package is ready for extraction.
Send in the chopper.
Long Shore!
- Is there a problem?
- Thank God you're here.
I don't wanna go yet.
I ca...
Agent Casey is tracking the Fulcrum mole he should have her in custody soon, so we can hold off on the Chuck transfer.
If there was a change, I would have been contacted.
- I have my orders.
- We don't have to.
This is a judgment call.
We can hold Chuck here until we know for sure.
- His cover was blown, he's gone.
- No.
I will take full responsibility.
Chuck is my asset.
He's my guy.
Just give us more time, please.
I'd appreciate it.
I really would.
Please don't do this.
Okay, you got one minute.
One minute.
- Sarah, I'm not ready to disappear.
- No, I know.
I need you to talk to Ellie and to Morgan and my friends and tell them...
I don't know.
Look, if I'm supposed to be dead, just say something that will make it okay, that will make them feel all right.
Just make sure they know how much I love them.
You can do that, right?
Of course you can.
You're Sarah.
You can do anything.
Hey, there's a silver lining to this too, you know?
Because we're not working together anymore, so we can go on a date.
You can come by my cell and we can hang out.
And you can tell me who the president is.
And maybe, uh...
Maybe we can see how we really feel.
Time's up.
Goodbye, Sarah.
Chuck?
I'll save you later.
- Oh!
- Get down.
I listened to the receiver.
She knows.
Do you know how many agents are looking for Bryce Larkin?
And all this time, the Intersect was here.
Wait until my superiors find out.
Look, what if I surrender and you run?
I'll be in the cell.
What's the difference?
- Torture.
- Okay, no surrender.
I only have one question, Chuck.
Who's the ring for?
- She has Ellie's ring.
- Chuck, distract her.
What?
How?
Aah!
- Chuck, I'm not gonna go away.
- Okay.
Okay, look, look, look.
You really wanna take me in?
You're gonna have to sweeten the deal a little for me.
Hey, hey, hey, uh, look.
Look, the CIA, they're offering me a nice, padded cell real cush.
Can you beat that?
I'm a guy who enjoys a good steam.
Can you do...?
Can you do maybe a steam room?
I don't think you're really in a position to bargain, Chuck.
I have two guns.
What do you have?
Me.
Don't break the ring!
Hey!
Bartowski, get out of the way.
There's really serious spy fighting going on.
Get down, Chuck.
Sarah!
Oh!
- I had a feeling that girl was dirty.
Norman.
The power of positive thinking.
This was an amazing night as it always is with...
But sometimes, I know life isn't always awesome.
What I'm trying to say is that when things get rough I wanna face them together the good times and the bad.
Oh, oh, oh!
Ladies' feminine products.
That's not good, that's not good.
Are you...?
Are you sure that Lizzie didn't have the ring on her?
When they took her away, all she had was the receiver.
- Then it's gotta be here.
- You know Chuck, if we can't find it, we can just replace it.
It was Awesome's great-granny's ring and it's gonna be my sister's.
Even if it's covered in coffee grounds and miscellaneous DNA.
I have a ring and I have the blessing of your brother.
Would you do me the honor of being my wife, Eleanor Faye Bartowski?
Ah!
Hey!
Ha-ha-ha!
I found it!
Let's go.
I'm so sorry.
It might be a little dirty.
Wait to go, Chuck.
I always knew you could handle my family jewels.
So to speak.
Uh, when she's sleeping really hard like that sometimes if you pinch her nose it'll wake...
Right.
I'm gonna...
Oh, okay.
Mission accomplished.
I can't believe you pulled it off.
Well, it'll make one hell of a story at their wedding.
Which I'm never allowed to talk about under fear of death.
Understood.
I have other material.
You wanna?
What, spy?
You?
- She looks so happy.
- Yeah, she does.
I couldn't leave them yet.
You don't have to worry about that.
You're safe.
Yeah, safe for now, though.
Right.
I mean, they keep getting closer.
Eventually, they're gonna figure out who I am.
Don't you think you should go in and congratulate Ellie?
You wanna come in with me?
Oh, it's family time.
I know.
Well, good night.
We can only keep him here for so long.
You realize that, don't you?

Hey.
Here you guys go.
Be careful, it's really hot.
I don't want to... for you to burn your tongue on it.
Wow, 29 orders this month.
One more, and you'll get a free baba ghanoush.
Oh...
I'm reaching in my pocket for money, not for...
Hey, do you have change?
Oh, she's...
Did you get it?
Fellas...
Oh, boy.
What are you guys doing?
Or have you forgotten about Big Mike's pol on "Mammary cam"?
I don't know what you're talking about, Chuck.
He doesn't know what I'm talking about?
That's so weird.
So, you didn't actually just remove the offending video from the camcorder and then hand it to Lester, who is now hiding it behind his back?
What?
Wow!
My feelings are hurt.
Charles, after all these years, where's the trust, my friend?
In Jeff's sweaty palms, along with the amateur consumer porn.
Look...
No, you look...
Hey, Chuck?
Uh, can I talk to you for a sec?
Move.
Awesome...
to see you, Devon.
Yeah, yeah.
What's up?
All right.
So, what's on your mind?
Chuck, I was, I was hoping to talk to you about Ellie.
Yeah?
Yeah, yeah, of course.
Well, you know, ever since, um, ever since we've been dating, I've come to think of you as that little brother I never had.
Don't you have two younger brothers?
Indeed.
Indeed.
But you seem like someone who can offer sage wisdom in confusing times, and this is one of those times I am really confused, bro.
I don't know how to put this into words, really.
That's a bug.
What?
What?
Spider, I hate those fuzzy little bastards...
Oh, no.
I think, uh, no, you got him.
He was like...
and then poof!
Gone.
Can you excuse me for just one second?
I think I just saw a kid climbing into an oven over in Home Appliances.
Chuck!
Chuck, I need you to drop some knowledge, bro.
Keep moving, Bartowksi.
Nothing to see here.
Not even if I had the time.
You're getting sloppy, Casey.
I understand that you have some perverse desire to listen to everybody, but you really need to be more careful when hiding your bugs.
What are you lip-smacking about, Bartowski?
I just found this on one of our product displays, and not very well hidden, I might add.
Normally, I'm a fan of your craftsmanship, if not your methods.
Look, all I'm saying is that something like this discovered by someone less in the know than me could spell trouble.
You worry about that supercomputer in your brain.
Let me worry about the spy stuff, huh?
Don't you have a hard drive you can go fix?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
There's best buddy of mine.
Yeah.
What's up?
Okay, saw an Infinity Ward mail in the trash, and I'm guessing that means you got a pre-release demo of the next Call of Duty game?
Ah...
Yeah, but the last time I lent you a game sampler, it ended up all over the Internet.
So this one's gonna stay in my locker, and you can play it when you get some adult supervision.
Adult super...?
Chuck, I'm almost at the age where I should get my prostate checked annually.
Okay?
Surely I could be trusted with an advance copy of the next greatest video game on the planet.
Have you seen Awesome?
Over by the Home Theater Room.
(muttering):
I think that's really.
?
?
defrosting himself, as it turns out.
So, uh, what, uh, what's going on?
This is one of those rare moments when things are not kosher, Chuck.
Oh, man.
This is harder than I thought.
Uh-huh.
Go...
Go on.
I'm listening.
Right.
Well...
I've been thinking a lot about the way things are between me and your sister.
And you're the man in...
in Ellie's family, so I was wondering...
Can I have your permission...
Can I marry Ellie?
Wow.
That-That's quite...
quite a rock you got there.
Is that a yes?
Dude...
Yes!
Yes!
Sorry!
I just...
You kind of--- waah!
You know, you pulled the blang just right in...
Yes, you have my blessing.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I mean, it's been in my family for years.
This was my great-grandmother's.
(chuckles) Ah, you think she'll like it?
Like it?
She'll, she'll love it.
I, um, I'm just not sure she'll be able to lift her hand anymore.
Oh, one other thing.
Ellie is a bloodhound when it comes to these kind of things.
If I keep this in the apartment, she will smell diamond.
Can you hold onto this, just for a day or so, man?
I mean, just till I figure out how to pop the question?
I don't think it's actually a good idea...
Oh, thank you!
Thank you so much, bro.
Hey, pretty soon, I'm going to mean that literally.
There you go.
All right...
We have a problem.
What do you mean?
Chuck found that in the Buy More.
We have a problem.
BECKMAN:
The bug Chuck found is a GLG-20, one of the most advanced counter-espionage listening devices in the CIA arsenal.
This is a CIA design?
Figures.
The GLG-20 is a low-power transmitter.
In order to avoid detection, it has a maximum range of about 20 yards.
Which means there's probably a receiver hidden somewhere inside the Buy More.
GRAHAM:
We believe it's recently become a favorite of the FULCRUM agents.
So, you're telling us the secret government cabal that abducted
Bryce Larkin and came within a hair of figuring out that Chuck's the Intersect is now skulking around the Buy More?
We need you to locate that receiver, and find the person who planted it.
BECKMAN:
You have 48 hours.
If you cannot identify the enemy operative in that time, we will have no choice but to relocate Chuck to a secure government holding facility.
GRAHAM:
Bartowski's time as a civilian may be coming to an en
For their own safety, his family may never see him again.

When are these young ladies going to learn?
If they don't want someone taking a picture of their private business, put some drawers on.
Hey, uh, you think we should make a run for it?
You don't run from the cops.
It makes you look guilty, or shot in the back.
We are guilty.
Shh!
Bring me down and I will cut you.
So, no locks broken?
No alarms set off?
Nope.
It's clean.
Must be an inside job.
Thought of that.
You really think any of these dummies can mastermind all this?
It's almost always someone close to the operation.
When I find out who robbed my store and stole my fish,
I'm gonna break my foot off in his behind.
(whispers):
Oh, my God...
Shh!
Hi.
Hey.
What's with the police presence outside?
They robbed the Buy More, man.
They took everything.
They took everything?
Everything.
Oh, please, God, no.
Please be there.
Oh, my God...
The ring.
They took Ellie's ring.
Oh, my God.
(panting):
Oh, oh...
Oh!
Oh!
Hey...
Chuckles, what's up?
Dude, I figured out how I'm gonna pop the Q.
The Q?
What Q?
What's a Q?
You know, the Q, the big Q you only ask once in a lifetime.
Can't say right now...
Mom.
Is that your mom?
Tell her that I love that kittens-playing-with-the-yarn sweater that she knitted me.
You got it, babe.
I'm going to do it while we're skydiving.
Really?
Do you think, uh...
Do you think that's a good idea?
Not the first time we've been in the mile-high club, buddy.
If you know what I mean.
Yeah, uh...
Listen: skydiving is a little, it's a little risky.
Don't you think?
I mean, you could drop the ring.
Whoa.
Hot call, dude.
Hate to lose my great-granny's ring.
She gave it to me right before she passed.
You know?
She knew Ellie was the one before I did.
Great, great, okay, so... just, you know, let me know when you figure something else out.
Okay.
But, Devon, um... take your time.
You got it, brother.
(thuds) Oh...
Detective Conway here is convinced that this is an inside job.
And we intend to get to the bottom of this.
Bartowski, get over here.
You're a suspect, too.
You all are!
When that pig talks to you, look him in the eye and say nothing.
Zip it.
Nothing?
Come on, that's incredibly rude, Jeffrey.
Dead men tell no tales.
Stop it.
Quit messing around.
Bartowski, where's Casey?
Don't you two usually carpool together?
Yes.
Yes, sir, we absolutely do.
But, uh... not today.
Why don't you go find out why his ass is so tardy.
Someone might find that suspicious.
Sure, I can-I can do that.
CASEY:
What?
Where are you?
Big Mike's looking for you.
Yeah, well, he's going to be looking for both of us.
Now get down here, we need you.
No, no, no, no.
Listen to me.
I need you, okay?
Someone cleaned out the Buy More last night.
They took everything;
they took my sister's ring, the one she's supposed to wear forever, even though she doesn't know it yet.
Awesome is supposed to propose to her, he trusted me and now it's gone.
Save it for your coffee klatch, Bartowski.
Get down here.
We got bigger fish to fry.
You robbed the Buy More?
SARAH:
We had no choice, Chuck.
CHUCK:
No choice?
Are you out of your mind?
Do you have any idea what's going on at the store right now?
That bug you found, it isn't one of ours.
What bug?
Who, ours?
SARAH:
The one you found yesterday.
Casey only installed EM-50s.
The one you found was a GLG-20.
It requires a secondary recording device nearby to collect the data.
What are you talking about?
Someone is spying on us.
What?
!
Okay, listen carefully-- the bug you found was not ours.
It belongs to an enemy agent, probably Fulcrum, and they planted it in the Buy More.
Why?
Looking for the Intersect.
They're looking for you.
We found a total of 29 bugs just like it, but we still haven't found the receiver.
CHUCK:
Okay.
Okay, well, wow.
Uh, extreme...
extreme measures, but, uh, decisive action had to be taken.
Good luck schlepping all this stuff back to the Buy More.
Uh, I'm going to get back there right now and pretend like I don't know anything.
Got any good tips for beating a polygraph?
Chuck, wait.
What?
Ch...?
Oh, duh, yeah...
(chuckles)
Can I get my sister's ring back?
You guys are pretty damn thorough.
You should be more concerned about not making it to her wedding.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Hold on.
He can't hear it like that.
He won't process it.
How do you give a man a life sentence just for being a good guy?
Okay, how about I give it a try, gently?
No, I don't want to hear your version of it and neither does he.
It's a job.
How come you always got to get your lady feelings involved...?
It has nothing to do...
Agent Walker, Major Casey.
You might want to take a look at this.
This is a surveillance tape taken during the robbery.
CASEY:
There's nothing there.
Bad guy disabled the security system.
Wait.
CHUCK:
Hey, that's Jeff and Lester.
And they are apparently drunk.
It appears they've mistakenly turned the camera back on.
Hang on a second-- who's that?
SARAH:
That's the spy.
He's the spy who spies on spies.
CHUCK:
Why would a Fulcrum agent try to steal Big Mike's fish?
CASEY:
Those two dilweeds interrupted an actual robbery in progress.
The receiver's in the fish.
Marlin, actually.
Technically, it's a marlin.
Marlin.
You would call it a marlin, right?
Yeah.
Look.
See, there you go-- done.
My job here is done.
So now I'm sure you super-agents can figure out where the two drunken pinheads stashed the fish-- marlin, four-foot marlin.
I'm going to stick around here and try and find my sister's ring.
Hey, Chuck?
Chuck, no ring came up in our inventory.
What do you mean no ring came up in your inventory?
You guys robbed the Buy More, didn't you?
What happened to Awesome's great-grandmother's ring?
We kind of have some bigger- picture concerns right now.
What could be possibly be bigger than me ruining the chances of my sister getting married?
The receiver may contain information indicating that you're the Intersect.
Say it.
Say what you're not saying.
If we don't locate the receiver in the next 24 hours...
You'll be stored in an underground bunker for so long you'll forget what fresh air smells like.
LESTER JEFFREY:
One, two, three, four.
I declare a thumb war!
Oh!
Come on, Jeffrey.
Jeff, Lester, we got to talk, it's important.
Yeah, see, this is your problem, Charlie.
Why is your time more valuable than mine?
Oh!
He is taking him over the top!
All right.
Ow!
My thumb!
Hey.
Let's go.
(fake coughing):
Narc.
Narc, Narc.
Narc.
Narc.
JEFFREY:
Easy on the shirt, Narc.
Where's the fish?
Fish?
What fish?
Okay, we can do this the easy way or the hard way.
Easy way is I shove his foot up your ass.
What's the hard way?
I use my foot.
CHUCK:
Look, we've seen the surveillance footage, guys.
Okay?
We know you were here last night.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, no, you two geniuses thought you were turning the cameras off, but, instead, you turned them back on.
We won't say anything to Big Mike, I promise.
Okay.
Come on, wh-what's happening?
Charles, would you give us a few minutes, please?
Chuck...?
It was his idea.
What?
!
The whole reason we snuck in was to get your alcoholic ass another drink-- you were getting the shakes.
Not cool.
It's a disease.
You're a disease, and you've diseased us all-- me, Chuck, this guy.
C-Calm down.
Calm down.
Okay.
Look, Jeff, I totally understand your plight.
We sympathize with you, okay?
And we don't judge.
Just tell us what exactly happened?
We were across the street at Bennigan's and I got cut off again...
Jeff.
If you're going to tell the story, please...
don't butcher it.
We were at Benni's, enjoying the deep-fried sampler, and we decided to come back to the store for a nightcap in boss man's private stash.
It's off.
(groans)
Rock and roll.
We have the store to ourselves.
We should take off all our clothes.
Don't make me uncomfortable to be alone with you.
Go get it.
Bingo.
Yes.
No.
No, no, no.
Jeffrey!
It's a wasted mission now.
It's a wasted mission.
We've gotta do something exciting while we're here, man.
We can burn it down.
I was thinking more along the lines of a... fishing expedition.
And that, friends... is the story of the missing marlin.
And where is the marlin now?
I'm afraid I'm going to need a little compensation.
(cries out)
At Chuck's!
We took it to Chuck's pad!
What?
My apartment?
Why?
We didn't want to get busted with Big Mike's fish.
LESTER:
I'm going to need lotion.
SARAH:
We're pursuing the receiver.
We've got the location, and it shouldn't be long before recovery.
Stay with the receiver.
In the meantime we've decided to extract Chuck.
What?
But we don't know he's in danger.
There's a chance the identity of the Intersect has been compromised.
We have to err on the side of caution.
You promised we had 48 hours.
You know the game, Agent Walker.
The order has gone out.
Chuck is coming in.
Come on.
Chuck, you're looking for a marlin.
Hey, hey, whoa.
Whoa, stop, stop.
I seriously doubt that these geniuses had time to reupholster the couch.
It's got to be here somewhere.
Chuck?
Hey, sis.
John.
Hi.
What are you two up to?
What's going on with the apartment?
I'll clean it up later.
Right now, we're looking for something.
What is it?
Look, I-I promise you whatever you want to talk about is not as important as what we're looking for right now.
Okay.
What are you looking for?
A stuffed fish.
A fish?
Marlin, actually, about four feet long.
Got a spear-like nose.
And a mouth.
Yeah.
Okay, Chuck, I get it.
Besides, if anything really important were going on, you have plenty of people in your life you can talk to about it.
Hey, Ellie, wait.
What?
Oh!
I love you.
Just in case.
Just in case of what?
Uh....
Just-just in case I can't find the fish.
I suppose you haven't talked to Morgan.
No.
Why?
Because he left here last night with a four-foot long marlin.
He's mine.
And you know nothing about the stolen merchandise?
No, sir.
Officer.
Detective.
Where's my fish, Grimes?
Mr. Tucker, please.
The merchandise is insured.
That fish cost me 200 bucks on eBay.
Wait, you bought that fish?
That will be all, Mr. Grimes.
What did you use for bait, PayPal?
CONWAY:
Grimes, out!
All right.
Yes, sir.
You cracked, didn't you?
LESTER:
You are so weak.
JEFFREY:
You are so weak, man.
How am I weak, dude?
I didn't say anything.
In fact, I told...
How am I supposed to believe that?
Bartowski!
You're up.
I got the scraggly troll.
I-I did not rob the store.
Did I ask you that?
Already he's talking about stolen goods.
You might as well come out and admit you did it.
Please.
Let me handle the investigation.
Now, Mr. Bartowski, we believe this was an inside job.
None of these other imbeciles could even tie their shoes without Bartowski's say-so.
If there's a ringleader, you're looking at him.
Where's my fish, Bartowski?
!
Okay, start talking.
From the beginning.
Okay.
Um...
I was born a Cesarean section.
And I always felt like I was robbed of that headlong voyage through the uterine canal.
Where's the marlin, moron?
Ah, the elusive fish.
Sure.
That's a tale for the ages.
Start talking or I'll pull each and every one of these hairs out of your face, one at a time, starting with this one.
(groans)
Torture?
Hey, if you're trying to get me to talk, you are using the wrong tactic, brother.
Really?
What's the right tactic?
My own personal kryptonite:
Grape soda.
On the rocks, please.
Conway.
Excuse me, I have to take this.
I got this.
Ah.
You don't want to talk, Bartowski?
We'll just have to turn the heat up on you.
Mm-hmm.
There we go.
Ah.
Proper.
So, it all started with "The Next Call of Duty" game...
Now, I don't really consider it stealing, since I see Chuck and I as being life partners and therefore, community property.
Using my own personal entrance,
I went into Chuck's room to play the game.
Yessss!
And when I reached into the bag, I discovered a...
I found a, uh...
I can't go on.
This is just getting a little personal.
All right, new tactic:
You finish the story or I put your head through the wall.
Okay, someone wasn't hugged enough as a child.
Ugh.
That's horrible.
It's better on the rocks, that's why I told you to...
Anyway, there I was... staring at the most horrific object the world has ever seen.
Noooooo!
What?
Morgan, you scared me to death!
What is wrong with you?
No, no, no, no, no...
no, it's Chuck.
Well, what is it?
What happened?
We've lost him, Ell.
We've lost him forever.
You better sit down.
Um...
I don't know how to say this.
He's gone.
Morgan, what are you talking about?
I'm talking about this.
Chuck's going to propose to Sarah.
And that's pretty much the whole story.
More or less.
Ellie and I bonded over the fact that, you know, he didn't include us in this life decision.
But, hey, who cares, you know, he's got you now, so...
What does that have to do with the fish?
F-Fish?
Who cares about the fish?
John, Chuck's getting married!
Pitas are here.
Hey.
Hey.
You've had 29 deliveries, so I dropped in your free baba ganoush.
Really?
29 deliveries.
Uh-huh.
29 bugs.
Wait a second.
Oh, lunch!
Thank you.
Ooh!
Hey, buddy.
I-I smell falafel.
Yeah, of course you do.
What do you got?
I got the chick...
I'm just going to, let me just have a...
No, no.
You're going to finish the story.
Back to the story.
Ooh!
Come on.
"Boobies."
Jackpot.
Gotcha!
Good thing Jeff and Lester are pervs.
I can see you're sweating it.
So... you ready to tell us what happened here last night?
I'm telling you guys, I have no idea.
Fine.
There's other ways to make you talk.
Time to send you back to gen pop.
He sung like a canary!
Thanks for the info, Chuck.
John Casey!
You're next!
One sec.
What?
Can't fit the police into your social schedule?
Get in here now, or you and I are taking a trip downtown!
If you have a second, Mr. Casey, we'd appreciate it.
LESTER:
I can't believe you told Casey you put the marlin in Chuck's room.
What?
Don't worry.
I moved it into the freezer at the Wienerlicious.
Wow, I'm impressed with you.
Thank you.
Bye.
What?
Where you going?
Where you going?
Where you going, Lizzie?
Lizzie?
Where's she going?
Can I help you?
Yeah.
I was wondering if I could get something out of your freezer.
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.
It's company policy.
The kitchen is usually off- limits for non-employees.
Okay, then I'll have to use my special pass...
You're no hot dog maker.
Bring it on, pita girl.
We're closed!
We're closed!
Where's the fish?
We need to talk.
It's an emergency.
Oh, listen, no, hey, hey, hey, Chuck, Chuck, it's okay, man, I know about you and Sarah.
Man, and how she's more than just your girlfriend.
What?
Morgan, stay.
But I...
Sta... stay!
Hello.
After careful consideration of all potential proposals,
I have made a decision.
Oh, let me guess:
Naked 2K run?
Dinner, Chuck.
Romantic, candlelit dinner, just the two of us.
The coup de grâce...
Wow.
Good.
molten lava cake with a two-carat diamond ring filling.
Ellie will really love that.
Look, Devon, just-just promise me that you'll take care of my sister if anything were to happen.
What's gonna happen?
Oh, hey, cake hits the oven in two hours.
Don't be late.
What am I gonna do?
Do nothing.
You haven't given Sarah the ring yet.
Dude, there's plenty of time to call this whole thing off.
Sarah?
Ring?
Yeah, the ring you got Sarah.
The one I kind of took out of your locker.
You mean... the ring that Awesome got for Ellie.
Oh, thank God, man.
Are you kidding?
I thought I lost you, pal!
Morgan... where is the ring?
It's kind of complicated but...
It's in the freezer at the Wienerlicious.
I put it in Big Mike's marlin and I...
I was gonna put it back.
Ow!
Slide it to me.
Now!
Hey!
Hi, S...
No...
No, no!
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no!
(distant):
Help!
Sarah?
Lizzie's the mole.
She got the receiver, Chuck.
Oh, my God, Sarah, it's over.
They're gonna stick me in some tiny cell with no windows.
Okay, Chuck, I need you to focus.
We can get Lizzie if you can get me out of here.
How?
I keep a backup piece in the jar of horseradish sauce.
Horseradish?
Who-Who-Who puts horseradish on hot dogs?
Chuck!
Got it.
Right.
Hide it someplace nobody would look-- good.
Great.
Okay.
Oh!
Whoa.
I got it.
Okay.
Okay, now shoot the lock.
Um, look, Sarah,
I've never really fired a gun before, okay?
And I've actually done this on purpose to avoid any unpleasant side effects like shooting myself or others.
Just shoot the lock or I will shoot you when I get out of here!
(gasping):
Okay.
Get back.
Ready?
Ready?
Get back.
One...
Two...
Take the safety off first.
One, one sec...
just a little problem.
CONWAY:
Bartowski, Big Mike told me I'd find you here.
Drop the gun, Bartowski!
Now!
No, no, no, no need to shoot.
It's not my gun, it's not my gun-- my girlfriend is locked in the freezer, and if you let her out she can explain everything.
Okay, let's go.
She's right...
Come on, move.
Okay, okay.
Just look in...
Nice try.
Go, go, go!
Look in the freezer, please!
Just look in the freezer.
She's right there.
You're taking this thing a little seriously.
What kind of cop are you?
Where's Big Mike's fish?
What are you now, huh?
Big Man's personal Gestapo?
Come on, you can't break me, fool.
At the Wienerlicious.
SARAH:
Help!
Sarah.
Stand back.
The delivery girl is the mole.
The detective took Chuck.
Where are you, Chuck?
I need the ring.
This is not awesome.
MAN:
And the package, HQ.
This is Long Shore.
You're not a cop.
We've identified the enemy agent.
She was posing as a Pita Parlour delivery girl.
Code name Lizzie.
BECKMAN:
So she escaped with the receiver?
Yes, but she made a phone call.
We're currently tracing the cell signature, and we can triangulate her location.
We just need more time.
GRAHAM:
As soon as you locate her, take her out.
Uh, one of us needs to go and get Chuck out of police custody.
He was arrested just...
BECKMAN:
The Intersect is no longer your concern, Agent Walker.
I...
I don't understand.
BECKMAN:
Detective Conway is CIA.
GRAHAM:
Chuck is on his way to the extraction point right now.
We've decided to transfer him to lockdown immediately.
Is there a problem?
Uh, no.
No.
I just thought I would handle his transfer.
Forget about Chuck, Agent Walker.
Focus on catching that FULCRUM agent.
We're on it.
We, meaning,
I go get Lizzie while you find Chuck.
Well, don't make me change my mind.
So... this is it, huh?
Going to get my own padded cell.
Do I get a bed, or is my whole room kind of like a bed?
It's not as bad as it sounds.
The underground complex where you will be living has state-of-the-art security and amenities.
You'll even be allowed outside to visit controlled locations.
Hold on.
I-I...
I can't leave without telling Ellie something, a reason for going.
What should I say?
Nothing.
It's safer for them if you just... disappear.
CONWAY:
Asset is ready for extraction.
Send in the chopper.
Long Shore!
Is there a problem, Agent Walker?
Sarah, thank God you're here.
Listen, I-I don't...
I don't want to go yet.
I...
It's okay, Chuck.
Agent Casey is tracking the FULCRUM mole.
He should have her in custody soon, so we can hold off on the Chuck transfer for the time being.
If there was a change in the operation,
I would have been contacted.
I have my orders.
We don't have to do this.
This is a judgment call.
Okay, we can just hold Chuck here until we know for sure.
His cover was blown.
He's gone.
No.
I will take full responsibility.
Chuck is my asset;
he's my guy.
Just...
Just give us more time, please.
CHUCK:
I'd appreciate it.
I really would.
Please don't do this.
CONWAY:
Okay.
You've got one minute.
One minute.
I'm not ready, Sarah.
I'm not ready to disappear.
No.
I know, I know.
I need you to talk to Ellie and to Morgan and my friends, and-and- and-and tell 'em...
I don't know.
I...
Look, if I'm supposed to be dead, just say something that will make it okay, that will make 'em feel all right.
Just make sure they know how much I love 'em.
You can do that, right?
Course you can.
You're Sarah.
You can do anything.
And, hey, there's a silver lining to this, too, you know, 'cause we're not working together anymore, which means, we can go on a date.
You can come by my cell, and we can hang out, and you can tell me who the president is.
And maybe, uh maybe we can see how we really feel.
Time's up.
Good-bye, Sarah.
Chuck?
I'll save you later.
(gunshot) Oh!
Oh!
Chuck, get down.
(gunshot)
Go, go, go!
I listened to the receiver.
BOTH:
She knows.
Do you know how many agents are looking for Bryce Larkin?
And all this time, the Intersect was here.
Wait till I tell my superiors that.
Okay, look, what if I surrender, and you run?
I mean, I'm going in a cell anyway.
What's the difference?
Torture.
Okay, no surrender.
I only have one question, Chuck.
Who's the ring for?
She has Ellie's engagement ring?
Try to distract her.
What?
!
How?
Chuck, I'm not gonna to go away.
Okay... okay, look, look, look.
You really...
You really want to take me in?
You're going to have to sweeten the deal a little bit for me.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Uh, look.
Look, the CIA-- they're offering me a nice padded cell, real cush.
Can you beat that?
I'm a guy who enjoys a... a good steam.
Can you do...?
Can you do maybe a steam room or something?
I don't think you're really in a position to bargain, Chuck.
I have two guns.
What do you have?
Me.
Don't break the ring.
Whoa!
Oh!
Oh!
Hey!
Bartowski, get out of the way.
There's really some serious spy fighting going on.
CASEY:
Get down, Bartowski.
Sarah!
(grunts)
I had a feeling that girl was dirty.
Norman.
The power of positive thinking.
This was an amazing night.
As it always is with...
But, sometimes, I know life isn't always awesome.
What I'm trying to say is that, when things get rough,
I want to face them together, the good times and the bad..
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Ladies' feminine products.
That's not good.
That's not good.
Are you, uh...
Are you sure tAre yo
Are you sure that Lizzie didn't have the ring on her?
When they took her away, all she had was the receiver.
Oh, then it's got to be here somewhere.
You know, Chuck, if we can't find it, we can just replace it.
Look, look, look, it-it was Awesome's great-granny's ring, and it's going to be my sister's, okay?
Even if its covered in coffee grounds and miscellaneous DNA.
I have a ring, I have the blessing of your brother.
Will you do me the honor of becoming my wife,
Eleanor Faye Bartowski?
CAPTAIN:
Ooh.
Almost woke her up.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Ah!
Hey!
Oh, I found it!
Let's go.
I'm so sorry... but it might be a little dirty.
Way to go, Chuck.
I always knew you could handle my family jewels.
So to speak.
Uh, when she's sleeping really hard like that, sometimes, if you pinch her nose, it'll wake...
Right.
I'm going to...
Oh, okay.
Mission accomplished.
I can't believe we pulled it off.
That'll make one hell of a story at their wedding.
Which I'm never allowed to talk about under fear of death-- understood.
I have other material.
You want to?
What, spy?
You?
She looks so happy.
Yeah, she does.
I couldn't leave them yet.
You don't have to worry about that.
You're safe.
Yeah, safe for now, though.
Right.
I mean... they keep getting closer.
Eventually, they're going to figure out who I am.
Don't you think you should go in and congratulate Ellie?
You want to come in with me?
Oh, it's family time.
I know.
Well, good night.
CHUCK (laughing):
Hey!
Hey, buddy.
Yeah.
Hmm.
We can only keep him here for so long.
You realize that, don't you?
I love you, sweetie.
I love you.
I'm sorry I had to keep it a secret for a little while.
Oh, boy.
Wait.
Go back, go back, go back.
That is God and a surgeon working in harmony.
Here comes the schwarma girl.
-Hey.
-Hey, hey, hey.
Here you guys go.
Be careful, it's hot.
I don't want for you to burn your tongue on it.
Uh--
-Wow, 29 orders this month.
One more and you'll get a free baba ghanoush.
I'm reaching in my pocket for money, not for--
Hey, do you have change?
Oh, she's-
- Did you get it?
-Fellas.
-Oh, boy.
What are you guys doing?
Or have you forgotten about Big Mike's policy on Mammary Cam?
I don't know what you're talking about, Chuck.
He doesn't know?
So you didn't remove the offending video from the camcorder and hand it to Lester, who's now hiding it behind his back?
What?
Wow, my feelings are hurt.
Charles, after all these years, where's the trust, my friend?
In Jeff's sweaty palms, along with the amateur consumer porn.
Look--
-Hey, Chuck?
Uh, can I talk to you for a sec?
Move.
Awesome to see you, Devon.
-Yeah.
Yeah.
What's up?
-All right.
-So, what's on your mind?
-Chuck, I was--
-I was hoping to talk to you about Ellie.
-Yeah?
Yeah, yeah, of course.
Well, you know, ever since, um, we've been dating I've come to think of you as that little brother I never had.
-Don't you have two younger brothers?
-Indeed.
Indeed.
But you seem like someone who can offer sage wisdom in confusing times and this is one of those times I am really confused, bro.
I don't know how to put this into words.
-That's a bug.
-What?
What?
Spider?
I hate those fuzzy bastards.
I think, uh, no, you got him.
He was like: "Rrr," and then: "Boo!" Gone.
Can you excuse me?
I think I just saw a kid crawling into an oven over in Home Appliances.
Chuck.
Chuck, I need you to drop some knowledge, bro.
Keep moving, Bartowski.
Nothing to see here.
Not even if I had the time.
You're getting sloppy, Casey.
I understand you have some perverse desire to listen to everybody.
But you really need to be careful hiding your bugs.
What are you lip-smacking about?
I just found this on one of our product displays and not very well hidden, I might add.
Normally, I'm a fan of your craftsmanship, if not your methods.
Look, all I'm saying is that something discovered by someone could spell trouble.
You worry about that supercomputer.
Let me worry about the spy stuff, huh?
Don't you have a hard drive you can go fix?
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
There's best buddy of mine.
Yeah.
What's up?
Okay, saw an Infinity Ward mail in the trash and that means you got a pre-release demo of the next "Call of Duty" game?
Ah.
Yeah, but the last time I lent you a game sampler it ended up all over the Internet.
This one's gonna stay in my locker.
You can play it when you get some adult supervision.
Adult sup--?
I'm at the age where I should get my prostate checked annually.
I could be trusted with an advance copy of the next greatest game on the planet.
-Have you seen Awesome?
-Over by the Home Theater Room.
I think-
- That's-
- Really.
Hey.
Hey.
Sorry about that.
False alarm.
It turned out, anyway, the kid did not end up defrosting himself as it turns out.
So, uh, what, uh-- What's going on?
This is one of those rare moments when things are not kosher, Chuck.
Oh, man.
This is harder than I thought.
Uh-huh.
Go-
- Go on.
I'm listening.
Right.
Well, I've been thinking a lot about the way things are between me and your sister.
And you're the man in Ellie's family, so I was wondering can I have your permission?
Can I marry Ellie?
Wow, that-
- That's quite-- Quite a rock you got there.
-Is that a yes?
Dude?
-Yes.
Yes.
Sorry.
I ju-
- You kind of-
- Wah!
You know, you pulled the-
- Blang, just right in--
-Yes, you have my blessing.
-Thank you.
Thank--
It's been in my family for years.
This was my great-grandmother's.
-Ha, ha.
Uh, you think she'll like it?
-Like it?
She'll-
- She'll love it.
I'm just not sure she'll be able to lift her hand anymore.
Oh, one other thing.
Ellie is a bloodhound.
If I keep this in the apartment, she will smell diamond.
Can you hold onto this just for a day or so?
Till I figure out how to pop the question.
-I don't think it's actually a good idea--
-Oh, thank you.
Oh, ho-ho!
Thank you so much, bro.
Hey, pretty soon I'm gonna mean that literally.
-There you go.
-All right.
-We have a problem.
-What do you mean?
Chuck found that in the Buy More.
We have a problem.
The bug Chuck found is a GLG-20, one of the most advanced counter-espionage listening devices in the CIA arsenal.
-This is a CIA design?
-Ha.
Figures.
The GLG-20 uses a low-power transmitter, in order to avoid detection.
It has a maximum range of about 20 yards.
Which means there's probably a receiver hidden somewhere inside the Buy More.
We believe it's recently become a favorite of the Fulcrum agents.
So you're telling us the secret government cabal that abducted Bryce Larkin and came within a hair of figuring out that Chuck's the Intersect is now skulking around the Buy More?
We need you to locate that receiver, and find the person who planted it.
You have 48 hours.
If you cannot identify the enemy operative in that time we will have no choice but to relocate Chuck to a secure government holding facility.
Bartowski's time as a civilian may be coming to an end.
For their own safety, his family may never see him again.
When are these ladies gonna learn?
If they don't want someone taking a picture of their business, put some drawers on.
-Hey, think we should make a run for it?
-You don't run from the cops.
-Makes you look guilty or shot in the back.
-We are guilty.
Shh!
Bring me down and I will cut you.
-So no locks broken?
No alarms set off?
-Nope.
It's clean.
-Must be an inside job.
-Thought of that.
You think any of these dummies can mastermind all this?
It's almost always someone close to the operation.
When I find out who robbed my store and stole my fish I'm gonna break my foot off in his behind.
Oh, my God.
-Shh.
Hey.
Hey.
What's with the, uh, police presence outside?
They robbed the Buy More, man.
They took everything.
-They took everything?
-Everything.
Oh, please, God, no.
Please be there.
Please be there.
Oh, God.
The ring.
They took Ellie's ring.
Oh, my God.
Oh!
Oh!
Hey.
-Chuckles, what's up?
Listen, dude, I figured out how I'm gonna pop the Q.
The Q?
What-
- What Q?
What's a Q?
You know, the Q, the big Q you only ask once in a lifetime.
Can't say right now, Mom.
Is that your mom?
Tell her that I love that kittens playing with the yarn sweater that she knitted.
You got it, babe.
Ha-ha-ha.
-I'm gonna do it while we're skydiving.
-Really?
Do you think, uh-- Do you think that's a good idea?
Not the first time in the mile-high club, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, uh--
Listen, skydiving is a little-- A little risky.
-Don't you think?
You could drop the ring.
-Whoa, hot call, dude.
Hate to lose my great-granny's ring.
She gave it to me right before she passed.
You know?
She knew Ellie was the one before I did.
Great, great, okay so--
Just let me know when you figure something else out.
-Okay.
-But, Devon, um....
-Take your time.
-You got it, brother.
Detective Conway here is convinced that this is an inside job.
And we intend to get to the bottom of this.
Bartowski, get over here!
You're a suspect too.
You all are.
When that pig talks to you, look him in the eye and say nothing.
-Zip it.
-Nothing?
Come on, that's incredibly rude, Jeffrey.
-Dead men tell no tales.
-Ha.
Stop it.
Quit messing around.
Bartowski, where's Casey?
Don't you two usually carpool together?
Yes.
Yes, sir, we absolutely do.
But, uh, not today.
Why don't you go find out why his ass is so tardy?
Someone might find that suspicious.
Sure, I can-
- I can do that.
I'll just-
- I just have to make--
What?
-Where are you?
Mike's looking for you.
He's gonna be looking for both of us.
Now get down here.
No.
Listen to me.
I need you, okay?
Someone cleaned out the Buy More.
They took everything, my sister's ring the one she's supposed to wear forever.
Awesome is supposed to propose to her, he trusted me and now it's gone.
Save it for your coffee klatch, Bartowski.
Get down here.
We got bigger fish to fry.
You robbed the Buy More?
We had no choice.
-No choice?
You out of your mind?
Do you have any idea what's going on at the store?
That bug you found, it isn't one of ours.
What bug?
Who ours?
-The one you found yesterday.
Casey only installed EM-50's.
The one you found was a GLG-20.
It requires a secondary recording device nearby to collect the data.
-What are you talking about?
-Someone is spying on us.
-What?
-Okay, the bug you found was not ours.
It belongs to an enemy agent, probably Fulcrum.
They planted it in the Buy More.
Why?
-They're looking for the Intersect.
They're looking for you.
We found a total of 29 bugs just like it, but we still haven't found the receiver.
Okay.
Okay, well, wow.
Uh, extreme--
Extreme measures, but, uh, decisive action had to be taken.
Good luck schlepping all this stuff back to the Buy More.
Uh, I'm gonna get back there and pretend I don't know.
Got any good tips for beating a polygraph?
Chuck, wait.
-What?
Oh, duh, yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.
Can I get my sister's ring back?
You guys are damn thorough.
You should be concerned about not making--
Can I talk to you for a second?
Hold on.
He can't hear it like that.
He won't process it.
How do you give a man a life sentence just for being a good guy?
Okay, how about I give it a try, gently?
No, I don't wanna to hear your version of it and neither does he.
It's a job.
How come you gotta get your lady feelings--?
-It has nothing to do--
-Agent Walker, Major Casey you might wanna take a look at this.
This is a surveillance tape taken during the robbery.
There's nothing there.
Bad guy disabled the security.
Wait.
Hey, that's Jeff and Lester.
It's off.
-And they are apparently drunk.
It appears they've mistakenly turned the camera back on.
Hang on a second, who's that?
-That's the spy.
Who's the spy who spies on spies?
Why would a Fulcrum agent want Big Mike's marlin?
Those two dilweeds interrupted an actual robbery in progress.
-The receiver's in the fish.
-Marlin, actually.
-You would call it a marlin, right?
Yeah.
-Look.
See?
There you go.
Done.
My job here is done.
So now I'm sure you super-agents can figure out where the two drunken pinheads stashed the fish.
Marlin.
Four-foot marlin.
I'm gonna stick around here and find my ring.
Hey, Chuck?
Chuck, no ring came up in our inventory.
What do you mean, "No ring came up in your inventory"?
You guys robbed the Buy More, didn't you?
What happened to Awesome's ring?
We have some bigger-picture concerns right now.
What could be possibly be bigger than me ruining the chances of my sister getting married?
The receiver may contain information indicating that you're the Intersect.
Say it.
Say what you're not saying.
If we don't locate the receiver in the next 24 hours....
You'll be stored in an bunker for so long you'll forget what fresh air smells like.
See?
That was very gentle.
One, two, three, four.
I declare a thumb war!
Oh!
Come on, Jeffrey.
Jeff, Lester, we gotta talk, it's important.
Here's your problem, Charlie.
Why is your time more valuable than mine?
Oh, he is taking him over the top.
All right.
Okay.
-Oh, my thumb.
-Narc.
-Narc, narc.
Narc.
Narc.
Narc.
-Easy on the shirt, narc.
-Where's the fish?
Fish?
What fish?
Okay, we can do this the easy or the hard way.
Easy way is I shove his foot up your ass.
-What's the hard way?
-I use my foot.
We've seen the surveillance footage, guys.
Okay?
-We know you were here.
-Yeah, right.
Yeah, you two geniuses thought you were turning the cameras off but instead, you turned them back on.
We won't say anything to Big Mike, I promise.
Okay.
Whoa, what's happening?
Charles, would you give us a few minutes, please?
Chuck?
-It was his idea.
-What?
!
The whole reason we snuck in was to get your ass another drink.
-You were getting the shakes.
-Not cool.
It's a disease.
You're a disease and you've diseased us all.
Me, Chuck, this guy.
-Calm down.
Calm down.
-Okay.
Look, Jeff, I totally understand your plight.
We sympathize with you, okay?
And we don't judge.
Just tell us, what exactly happened?
We were across the street at Bennigan's and I got cut off again--
Jeff.
Ha, ha.
If you're gonna tell the story, please, don't butcher it.
We were at Benni's, enjoying the deep-fried sampler and we decided to come back to the store for a nightcap in the boss man's private stash.
It's off.
Rock 'n roll.
We have the store to ourselves.
We should take off all our clothes.
Don't make me uncomfortable to be alone with you.
-Go get it.
-Bingo.
Yes.
-No.
-No, no, no.
-Jeffrey.
This is a wasted mission now.
It's a wasted mission.
We've gotta do something exciting, man.
We can burn it down.
I was thinking more along the lines of a fishing expedition.
And that, friends, is the story of the missing marlin.
And where is the marlin now?
Ah, I'm afraid I'm going to need a little compensation.
-At Chuck's.
We took it to Chuck's pad.
-What?
My apartment?
Why?
We didn't want to get busted with Big Mike's fish.
I'm gonna need lotion.
We're pursuing the receiver.
We've the location and it shouldn't be long before recovery.
Stay with the receiver.
In the meantime, we've decided to extract Chuck.
What?
But we don't know he's in danger.
There's a chance the identity of the Intersect has been compromised.
We have to err on the side of caution.
But you promised we had 48 hours.
You know the game, Agent Walker.
The order has gone out.
Chuck is coming in.
Come on.
Chuck, you're looking for a marlin.
Hey, hey, whoa!
Whoa, stop, stop.
I seriously doubt that these geniuses had time to re-upholster the couch.
Well, it's gotta be here somewhere.
Chuck?
-Hey, sis.
-John.
-Hi.
-What are you two up to?
-What's going on?
-I'll clean it up later.
-We're looking for something.
-What is it?
Whatever you want to talk about is not as important as what we're looking for.
Okay.
What are you looking for?
-A stuffed fish.
-A fish?
Marlin, about four feet long, got a spear-like nose.
-And a mouth.
-Yeah.
Okay, Chuck, I get it.
Besides, if anything really important were going on you have people in your life you can talk to about it.
Hey, Ellie, wait.
-What?
Oh.
I love you.
Just in case.
Just in case of what?
Uh....
Just in-- Just in case I can't find the fish.
I suppose you haven't talked to Morgan.
No.
Why?
Because he left here last night with a four-foot long marlin.
He's mine.
And you know nothing about the stolen merchandise?
-No, sir.
Officer.
Detective.
-Where's my fish, Grimes?
-Mr.
Tucker, please.
-The merchandise is insured.
That fish cost me 200 bucks on eBay.
Wait, you bought that fish?
Ha-ha-ha!
-That will be all, Mr. Grimes.
-What did you do for bait, PayPal?
Grimes, out.
-All right.
Yes, sir.
You cracked, didn't you?
-You are so weak.
So weak.
How am I weak?
I didn't say anything.
-How am I to believe that?
-Bartowski!
You're up.
You go.
I got the scraggly troll.
I-
- I did not rob the store.
Did I ask you that?
Already he's talking about stolen goods.
-Might as well admit you did it.
-Please.
Let me handle the investigation.
Now, Mr. Bartowski we believe this was an inside job.
None of these imbeciles could tie shoes without Bartowski's say-so.
If there's a ringleader, you're looking at him.
Where's my fish, Bartowski?
Okay, start talking.
-From the beginning.
-Okay.
Um, I was born a cesarean section.
I always felt robbed of that headlong voyage through the uterine canal.
Where's the marlin, moron?
Ah, the elusive fish.
Sure.
That's a tale for the ages.
Start talking, or I'll pull each one of these hairs out of your face one at a time, starting with this one.
Torture?
If you're trying to get me to talk, you are using the wrong tactic, brother.
Really?
What's the right tactic?
My own personal kryptonite: grape soda.
On the rocks, please.
Conway.
-Excuse me, I have to take this.
-I got this.
Ah.
You don't wanna talk, Bartowski?
We'll just have to turn the heat up on you.
Mm, mm.
There we go.
Ahh.
Proper.
So it all started with the next "Call of Duty" game.
I don't really consider it stealing since I see Chuck and I more as life partners, and therefore community property.
Using my own personal entrance I went into Chuck's room to play the game.
Yes.
And when I reached into the bag, I discovered....
I found a....
I can't go on.
-This is just getting a little personal.
-All right, new tactic.
Finish the story or I put your head through the wall.
Okay, someone wasn't hugged enough as a child.
Ugh.
-That's horrible.
-It's better on the rocks, that's why I....
Anyway, there I was staring at the most horrific object the world has ever seen.
No!
What?
Morgan?
You scared me to death.
What is wrong with you?
No, no, no.
No, it's Chuck.
-What is it?
What happened?
-We've lost him, Ell.
We've lost him forever.
I-
- You better sit down.
Um....
I don't know how to say this.
He's gone.
Morgan, what are you talking about?
I'm talking about this.
Chuck's gonna propose to Sarah.
That's pretty much the whole story.
More or less.
Ellie and I bonded over the fact that he didn't include us in this life decision.
But, hey, who cares, you know?
He's got you now, so....
What does that have to do with the fish?
Fish?
Who cares about the fish, John?
Chuck's getting married.
Pitas are here.
Hey, hey.
Hey.
Hey.
You had 29 deliveries so I dropped in...
-...your free baba ghanoush.
-Really?
Twenty-nine deliveries, 29 bugs.
Wait a second.
Oh, lunch.
Thank you.
-Hey, buddy.
-I smell falafel.
-Of course you do.
Come on.
-Come on.
-I'm just gonna finish--
You're gonna finish the story.
Back to the story.
Whoa!
"Boobies."
Jackpot.
Got you.
Good thing Jeff and Lester are pervs.
I can see you're sweating it.
So you ready to tell us what happened here last night?
I'm telling you, guys, I have no idea.
Fine.
There's other ways to make you talk.
Time to send you back to gen pop.
He sung like a canary.
Thanks for the info, Chuck.
-John Casey, you're next.
-One sec.
What, can't fit the police into your social schedule?
Get in here now or you and I are taking a trip downtown.
You have a second, Mr. Casey?
We'd appreciate it.
I can't believe you told Casey you put the marlin in Chuck's room.
What?
Don't worry, I moved it to the freezer at the WienerIicious.
Wow.
I'm impressed.
Thank you.
Bye.
-Whoa.
Where you going?
Where you going?
Where you going, Lizzie?
Lizzie?
Where is she going?
-Can I help you?
-Yeah.
I was wondering if I could get something out of your freezer.
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.
It's a company policy.
The kitchen is usually off-limits for non-employees.
Okay, then I'll have to use my special pass.
You're not a hot-dog maker.
Bring it on, pita girl.
We're closed!
Where's the fish?
-We need to talk.
It's an emergency.
-Listen, no.
Hey.
Chuck.
Chuck, it's okay, man.
I know about you and Sarah.
Man, and how she's more than just your girlfriend.
What?
Morgan, stay.
Aah!
Stay.
-Hello.
-After careful consideration of all potential proposals, I have made a decision.
Oh.
Let me guess.
Naked 2-K run?
Dinner, Chuck.
Romantic, candlelit dinner.
-Just the two of us.
-Wow, good.
The coup de grâce:
Molten lava cake with a two-carat diamond ring filling.
Ellie will really love that.
Devon, just promise me you'll take care of my sister if anything were to happen.
What's gonna happen?
Oh, hey.
Cake hits the oven in two hours.
Don't be late.
What am I gonna do?
You can do nothing.
You haven't given Sarah the ring yet.
Dude, there's time to call this whole thing off.
Sarah, ring?
Yeah, the ring you got Sarah.
The one I kind of took out of your locker.
You mean the ring that Awesome got for Ellie.
Oh, thank God, man.
Are you kidding?
-I thought I lost you, pal.
I--
-Morgan where is the ring?
It's kind of complicated, but--
It's in the freezer at Wienerlicious.
I put it in Big Mike's marlin.
I was gonna put it back.
Ow.
Slide it to me.
Now.
Hey.
No, no, no.
No, no, no!
Help!
Help me!
Sarah?
Lizzie's the mole.
She got the receiver, Chuck.
Sarah, it's over.
They're gonna stick me in some cell.
Okay, Chuck, I need you to focus.
We can get Lizzie if you can get me out.
-How?
-I keep a backup piece in the jar of horseradish sauce.
-Who puts horseradish on hot dogs?
-Chuck.
Got it, right.
Hide it someplace nobody would look.
Good.
Right.
Okay.
Oh!
Oh!
I got it.
Okay.
Okay, now shoot the lock.
Um, look, Sarah, I've never really fired a gun and I've actually done this on purpose to avoid shooting myself or others.
Just shoot the lock, or I will shoot you when I get out of here.
Okay.
Get back.
Ready?
Get back.
One two....
Take the safety off first.
One-
- One sec-
- Just a little problem.
Bartowski.
Big Mike told me I'd find you here.
Drop the gun now!
-No, no, no.
No need to shoot.
That's not my gun.
My girlfriend is in the freezer.
Let her out...
-...she can explain.
-Let's go.
-She's right-
- Okay.
Okay.
-Come on, move.
Just look in the freezer.
-Nice try.
Please, just look in the freezer.
She's right there.
Aren't you taking this a little seriously?
Where is Big Mike's fish?
What are you now, huh?
Big man's personal gestapo?
Come on.
You can't break me, fool.
At the Wienerlicious.
Help!
-Casey.
-Sarah.
Stand back.
The delivery girl is the mole.
The detective took Chuck.
Where are you, Chuck?
I need the ring.
This is not awesome.
I have the package, HQ.
This is Long Shore.
You're not a cop.
We've identified the enemy agent.
She was posing as a Pita Parlor delivery girl.
Code name:
Lizzie.
So she escaped with the receiver?
Yes, but she made a call.
We're tracing the cell signature and we can triangulate her location.
-We just need more time.
-As soon as you locate her, take her out.
Uh, one of us needs to get Chuck out of police custody.
-He was arrested just--
-The Intersect is no longer your concern.
I-
- I don't understand.
Detective Conway is CIA.
Chuck is on his way to the extraction point right now.
We've decided to transfer him to lockdown immediately.
Is there a problem?
Uh, no.
No.
I just thought I would handle his transfer.
Forget about Chuck, Agent Walker.
Focus on catching that Fulcrum agent.
We're on it.
We, meaning I go get Lizzie while you find Chuck.
Well, don't make me change my mind.
So this is it, huh?
Gonna get my own padded cell.
Do I get a bed, or is my whole room kind of like a bed?
It's not as bad as it sounds.
The underground complex where you'll live has state-of-the-art security and amenities.
You'll even be allowed outside to visit controlled locations.
I can't leave without telling Ellie something, a reason for going.
What should I say?
Nothing.
It's safer for them if you just disappear.
The package is ready for extraction.
Send in the chopper.
Long Shore!
-Is there a problem?
-Thank God you're here.
I don't wanna go yet.
I ca--
Agent Casey is tracking the Fulcrum mole and he should have her in custody soon, so we can hold off on the Chuck transfer.
If there was a change, I would have been contacted.
-I have my orders.
-We don't have to.
This is a judgment call.
We can hold Chuck here until we know for sure.
-His cover was blown, he's gone.
-No.
I will take full responsibility.
Chuck is my asset.
He's my guy.
Just give us more time, please.
I'd appreciate it.
I really would.
Please don't do this.
Okay, you got one minute.
One minute.
-Sarah, I'm not ready to disappear.
-No, I know.
I need you to talk to Ellie and to Morgan and my friends and tell them....
I don't know.
Look, if I'm supposed to be dead, just say something that will make it okay, that will make them feel all right.
Just make sure they know how much I love them.
You can do that, right?
Of course you can.
You're Sarah.
You can do anything.
Hey, there's a silver lining to this too, you know?
Because we're not working together anymore which means we can go on a date.
You can come by my cell and we can hang out.
And you can tell me who the president is.
And maybe, uh....
Maybe we can see how we really feel.
Time's up.
Goodbye, Sarah.
Chuck?
I'll save you later.
-Oh!
-Get down.
I listened to the receiver.
She knows.
Do you know how many agents are looking for Bryce Larkin?
And all this time, the Intersect was here.
Wait until my superiors find out.
Look, what if I surrender and you run?
I'm going in the cell.
What's the difference?
-Torture.
-Okay, no surrender.
I only have one question, Chuck.
Who's the ring for?
-She has Ellie's ring.
-Chuck, distract her.
What?
How?
Aah!
-Chuck, I'm not gonna go away.
-Okay.
Okay, look, look, look.
You really wanna take me in?
You're gonna have to sweeten the deal a little for me.
Hey, hey, hey, uh, look.
Look, the CIA, they're offering me a nice, padded cell real cush.
Can you beat that?
I'm a guy who enjoys a good steam.
Can you do--?
Can you do maybe a steam room?
I don't think you're really in a position to bargain, Chuck.
I have two guns.
What do you have?
Me.
Don't break the ring!
Hey!
Bartowski, get out of the way.
There's really serious spy fighting going on.
Get down, Chuck.
Sarah!
Oh!
-I had a feeling that girl was dirty.
Norman.
The power of positive thinking.
This was an amazing night as it always is with....
But sometimes, I know life isn't always awesome.
What I'm trying to say is that when things get rough I wanna face them together the good times and the bad.
Oh, oh, oh!
Ladies' feminine products.
That's not good, that's not good.
Are you--?
Are you sure that Lizzie didn't have the ring on her?
When they took her away, all she had was the receiver.
-Then it's gotta be here.
-You know Chuck, if we can't find it, we can just replace it.
Look, it was Awesome's great-granny's ring and it's gonna be my sister's.
Even if it's covered in coffee grounds and miscellaneous DNA.
I have a ring and I have the blessing of your brother.
Would you do me the honor of becoming my wife, Eleanor Faye Bartowski?
Ah!
Hey!
Ha-ha-ha!
I found it!
Let's go.
I'm so sorry.
It might be a little dirty.
Wait to go, Chuck. I always knew you could handle my family jewels.
So to speak.
Uh, when she's sleeping really hard like that sometimes if you pinch her nose it'll wake--
Right.
I'm gonna-
- Oh, okay.
Mission accomplished.
I can't believe you pulled it off.
Well, it'll make one hell of a story at their wedding.
Which I'm never allowed to talk about under fear of death.
Understood.
I have other material.
You wanna?
What, spy?
You?
-She looks so happy.
-Yeah, she does.
I couldn't leave them yet.
You don't have to worry about that.
You're safe.
Yeah, safe for now, though.
Right.
I mean, they keep getting closer.
Eventually, they're gonna figure out who I am.
Don't you think you should go in and congratulate Ellie?
You wanna come in with me?
Oh, it's family time.
I know.
Well, good night.
We can only keep him here for so long.
You realize that, don't you?
Go back, go back.
That is God and a surgeon working in harmony.
Here comes the Schwarma girl.
Hey.
Here you guys go.
Be careful, it's really hot.
I don't want to... for you to burn your tongue on it.
Wow, 29 orders this month.
One more, and you'll get a free baba ghanoush.
Oh...
I'm reaching in my pocket for money, not for...
Hey, do you have change?
Oh, she's...
Did you get it?
Fellas...
Oh, boy.
What are you guys doing?
Or have you forgotten about Big Mike's pol on "mammary cam"?
I don't know what you're talking about, Chuck.
He doesn't know what I'm talking about?
That's so weird.
So, you didn't actually just remove the offending video from the camcorder and then hand it to Lester, who is now hiding it behind his back?
What?
Wow!
My feelings are hurt.
Charles, after all these years, where's the trust, my friend?
In Jeff's sweaty palms, along with the amateur consumer porn.
Look...
No, you look...
Hey, Chuck?
Uh, can I talk to you for a sec?
Move.
Awesome...
to see you, Devon.
Yeah, yeah.
What's up?
All right.
So, what's on your mind?
Chuck, I was, I was hoping to talk to you about Ellie.
Yeah?
Yeah, yeah, of course.
Well, you know, ever since, um, ever since we've been dating, I've come to think of you as that little brother I never had.
Don't you have two younger brothers?
Indeed.
Indeed.
But you seem like someone who can offer sage wisdom in confusing times, and this is one of those times I am really confused, bro.
I don't know how to put this into words, really.
That's a bug.
What?
What?
Spider, I hate those fuzzy little bastards...
Oh, no.
I think, uh, no, you got him.
He was like...
and then poof!
Gone.
Can you excuse me for just one second?
I think I just saw a kid climbing into an oven over in Home Appliances.
Chuck!
Chuck, I need you to drop some knowledge, bro.
Keep moving, Bartowksi.
Nothing to see here.
Not even if I had the time.
You're getting sloppy, Casey.
I understand that you have some perverse desire to listen to everybody, but you really need to be more careful when hiding your bugs.
What are you lip-smacking about, Bartowski?
I just found this on one of our product displays, and not very well hidden, I might add.
Normally, I'm a fan of your craftsmanship, if not your methods.
Look, all I'm saying is that something like this discovered by someone less in the know than me could spell trouble.
You worry about that supercomputer in your brain.
Let me worry about the spy stuff, huh?
Don't you have a hard drive you can go fix?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
There's best buddy of mine.
Yeah.
What's up?
Okay, saw an Infinity Ward mail in the trash, and I'm guessing that means you got a pre-release demo of the next Call of Duty game?
Ah...
Yeah, but the last time I lent you a game sampler, it ended up all over the Internet.
So this one's gonna stay in my locker, and you can play it when you get some adult supervision.
Adult super...?
Chuck, I'm almost at the age where I should get my prostate checked annually.
Okay?
Surely I could be trusted with an advance copy of the next greatest video game on the planet.
Have you seen Awesome?
Over by the Home Theater Room.
(muttering):
I think that's really.
?
?
defrosting himself, as it turns out.
So, uh, what, uh, what's going on?
This is one of those rare moments when things are not kosher, Chuck.
Oh, man.
This is harder than I thought.
Uh-huh.
Go...
Go on.
I'm listening.
Right.
Well...
I've been thinking a lot about the way things are between me and your sister.
And you're the man in...
in Ellie's family, so I was wondering...
Can I have your permission...
Can I marry Ellie?
Wow.
That-That's quite...
quite a rock you got there.
Is that a yes?
Dude...
Yes!
Yes!
Sorry!
I just...
You kind of--- waah!
You know, you pulled the blang just right in...
Yes, you have my blessing.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I mean, it's been in my family for years.
This was my great-grandmother's.
(chuckles) Ah, you think she'll like it?
Like it?
She'll, she'll love it.
I, um, I'm just not sure she'll be able to lift her hand anymore.
Oh, one other thing.
Ellie is a bloodhound when it comes to these kind of things.
If I keep this in the apartment, she will smell diamond.
Can you hold onto this, just for a day or so, man?
I mean, just till I figure out how to pop the question?
I don't think it's actually a good idea...
Oh, thank you!
Thank you so much, bro.
Hey, pretty soon, I'm going to mean that literally.
There you go.
All right...
We have a problem.
What do you mean?
Chuck found that in the Buy More.
We have a problem.
BECKMAN:
The bug Chuck found is a GLG-20, one of the most advanced counter-espionage listening devices in the CIA arsenal.
This is a CIA design?
Figures.
The GLG-20 is a low-power transmitter.
In order to avoid detection, it has a maximum range of about 20 yards.
Which means there's probably a receiver hidden somewhere inside the Buy More.
GRAHAM:
We believe it's recently become a favorite of the FULCRUM agents.
So, you're telling us the secret government cabal that abducted
Bryce Larkin and came within a hair of figuring out that Chuck's the Intersect is now skulking around the Buy More?
We need you to locate that receiver, and find the person who planted it.
BECKMAN:
You have 48 hours.
If you cannot identify the enemy operative in that time, we will have no choice but to relocate Chuck to a secure government holding facility.
GRAHAM:
Bartowski's time as a civilian may be coming to an en
For their own safety, his family may never see him again.

When are these young ladies going to learn?
If they don't want someone taking a picture of their private business, put some drawers on.
Hey, uh, you think we should make a run for it?
You don't run from the cops.
It makes you look guilty, or shot in the back.
We are guilty.
Shh!
Bring me down and I will cut you.
So, no locks broken?
No alarms set off?
Nope.
It's clean.
Must be an inside job.
Thought of that.
You really think any of these dummies can mastermind all this?
It's almost always someone close to the operation.
When I find out who robbed my store and stole my fish,
I'm gonna break my foot off in his behind.
(whispers):
Oh, my God...
Shh!
Hi.
Hey.
What's with the police presence outside?
They robbed the Buy More, man.
They took everything.
They took everything?
Everything.
Oh, please, God, no.
Please be there.
Oh, my God...
The ring.
They took Ellie's ring.
Oh, my God.
(panting):
Oh, oh...
Oh!
Oh!
Hey...
Chuckles, what's up?
Dude, I figured out how I'm gonna pop the Q.
The Q?
What Q?
What's a Q?
You know, the Q, the big Q you only ask once in a lifetime.
Can't say right now...
Mom.
Is that your mom?
Tell her that I love that kittens-playing-with-the-yarn sweater that she knitted me.
You got it, babe.
I'm going to do it while we're skydiving.
Really?
Do you think, uh...
Do you think that's a good idea?
Not the first time we've been in the mile-high club, buddy.
If you know what I mean.
Yeah, uh...
Listen: skydiving is a little, it's a little risky.
Don't you think?
I mean, you could drop the ring.
Whoa.
Hot call, dude.
Hate to lose my great-granny's ring.
She gave it to me right before she passed.
You know?
She knew Ellie was the one before I did.
Great, great, okay, so... just, you know, let me know when you figure something else out.
Okay.
But, Devon, um... take your time.
You got it, brother.
(thuds) Oh...
Detective Conway here is convinced that this is an inside job.
And we intend to get to the bottom of this.
Bartowski, get over here.
You're a suspect, too.
You all are!
When that pig talks to you, look him in the eye and say nothing.
Zip it.
Nothing?
Come on, that's incredibly rude, Jeffrey.
Dead men tell no tales.
Stop it.
Quit messing around.
Bartowski, where's Casey?
Don't you two usually carpool together?
Yes.
Yes, sir, we absolutely do.
But, uh... not today.
Why don't you go find out why his ass is so tardy.
Someone might find that suspicious.
Sure, I can-I can do that.
CASEY:
What?
Where are you?
Big Mike's looking for you.
Yeah, well, he's going to be looking for both of us.
Now get down here, we need you.
No, no, no, no.
Listen to me.
I need you, okay?
Someone cleaned out the Buy More last night.
They took everything;
they took my sister's ring, the one she's supposed to wear forever, even though she doesn't know it yet.
Awesome is supposed to propose to her, he trusted me and now it's gone.
Save it for your coffee klatch, Bartowski.
Get down here.
We got bigger fish to fry.
You robbed the Buy More?
SARAH:
We had no choice, Chuck.
CHUCK:
No choice?
Are you out of your mind?
Do you have any idea what's going on at the store right now?
That bug you found, it isn't one of ours.
What bug?
Who, ours?
SARAH:
The one you found yesterday.
Casey only installed EM-50s.
The one you found was a GLG-20.
It requires a secondary recording device nearby to collect the data.
What are you talking about?
Someone is spying on us.
What?
!
Okay, listen carefully-- the bug you found was not ours.
It belongs to an enemy agent, probably Fulcrum, and they planted it in the Buy More.
Why?
Looking for the Intersect.
They're looking for you.
We found a total of 29 bugs just like it, but we still haven't found the receiver.
CHUCK:
Okay.
Okay, well, wow.
Uh, extreme...
extreme measures, but, uh, decisive action had to be taken.
Good luck schlepping all this stuff back to the Buy More.
Uh, I'm going to get back there right now and pretend like I don't know anything.
Got any good tips for beating a polygraph?
Chuck, wait.
What?
Ch...?
Oh, duh, yeah...
(chuckles)
Can I get my sister's ring back?
You guys are pretty damn thorough.
You should be more concerned about not making it to her wedding.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Hold on.
He can't hear it like that.
He won't process it.
How do you give a man a life sentence just for being a good guy?
Okay, how about I give it a try, gently?
No, I don't want to hear your version of it and neither does he.
It's a job.
How come you always got to get your lady feelings involved...?
It has nothing to do...
Agent Walker, Major Casey.
You might want to take a look at this.
This is a surveillance tape taken during the robbery.
CASEY:
There's nothing there.
Bad guy disabled the security system.
Wait.
CHUCK:
Hey, that's Jeff and Lester.
And they are apparently drunk.
It appears they've mistakenly turned the camera back on.
Hang on a second-- who's that?
SARAH:
That's the spy.
He's the spy who spies on spies.
CHUCK:
Why would a Fulcrum agent try to steal Big Mike's fish?
CASEY:
Those two dilweeds interrupted an actual robbery in progress.
The receiver's in the fish.
Marlin, actually.
Technically, it's a marlin.
Marlin.
You would call it a marlin, right?
Yeah.
Look.
See, there you go-- done.
My job here is done.
So now I'm sure you super-agents can figure out where the two drunken pinheads stashed the fish-- marlin, four-foot marlin.
I'm going to stick around here and try and find my sister's ring.
Hey, Chuck?
Chuck, no ring came up in our inventory.
What do you mean no ring came up in your inventory?
You guys robbed the Buy More, didn't you?
What happened to Awesome's great-grandmother's ring?
We kind of have some bigger- picture concerns right now.
What could be possibly be bigger than me ruining the chances of my sister getting married?
The receiver may contain information indicating that you're the Intersect.
Say it.
Say what you're not saying.
If we don't locate the receiver in the next 24 hours...
You'll be stored in an underground bunker for so long you'll forget what fresh air smells like.
LESTER JEFFREY:
One, two, three, four.
I declare a thumb war!
Oh!
Come on, Jeffrey.
Jeff, Lester, we got to talk, it's important.
Yeah, see, this is your problem, Charlie.
Why is your time more valuable than mine?
Oh!
He is taking him over the top!
All right.
Ow!
My thumb!
Hey.
Let's go.
(fake coughing):
Narc.
Narc, Narc.
Narc.
Narc.
JEFFREY:
Easy on the shirt, Narc.
Where's the fish?
Fish?
What fish?
Okay, we can do this the easy way or the hard way.
Easy way is I shove his foot up your ass.
What's the hard way?
I use my foot.
CHUCK:
Look, we've seen the surveillance footage, guys.
Okay?
We know you were here last night.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, no, you two geniuses thought you were turning the cameras off, but, instead, you turned them back on.
We won't say anything to Big Mike, I promise.
Okay.
Come on, wh-what's happening?
Charles, would you give us a few minutes, please?
Chuck...?
It was his idea.
What?
!
The whole reason we snuck in was to get your alcoholic ass another drink-- you were getting the shakes.
Not cool.
It's a disease.
You're a disease, and you've diseased us all-- me, Chuck, this guy.
C-Calm down.
Calm down.
Okay.
Look, Jeff, I totally understand your plight.
We sympathize with you, okay?
And we don't judge.
Just tell us what exactly happened?
We were across the street at Bennigan's and I got cut off again...
Jeff.
If you're going to tell the story, please...
don't butcher it.
We were at Benni's, enjoying the deep-fried sampler, and we decided to come back to the store for a nightcap in boss man's private stash.
It's off.
(groans)
Rock and roll.
We have the store to ourselves.
We should take off all our clothes.
Don't make me uncomfortable to be alone with you.
Go get it.
Bingo.
Yes.
No.
No, no, no.
Jeffrey!
It's a wasted mission now.
It's a wasted mission.
We've gotta do something exciting while we're here, man.
We can burn it down.
I was thinking more along the lines of a... fishing expedition.
And that, friends... is the story of the missing marlin.
And where is the marlin now?
I'm afraid I'm going to need a little compensation.
(cries out)
At Chuck's!
We took it to Chuck's pad!
What?
My apartment?
Why?
We didn't want to get busted with Big Mike's fish.
LESTER:
I'm going to need lotion.
SARAH:
We're pursuing the receiver.
We've got the location, and it shouldn't be long before recovery.
Stay with the receiver.
In the meantime we've decided to extract Chuck.
What?
But we don't know he's in danger.
There's a chance the identity of the Intersect has been compromised.
We have to err on the side of caution.
You promised we had 48 hours.
You know the game, Agent Walker.
The order has gone out.
Chuck is coming in.
Come on.
Chuck, you're looking for a marlin.
Hey, hey, whoa.
Whoa, stop, stop.
I seriously doubt that these geniuses had time to reupholster the couch.
It's got to be here somewhere.
Chuck?
Hey, sis.
John.
Hi.
What are you two up to?
What's going on with the apartment?
I'll clean it up later.
Right now, we're looking for something.
What is it?
Look, I-I promise you whatever you want to talk about is not as important as what we're looking for right now.
Okay.
What are you looking for?
A stuffed fish.
A fish?
Marlin, actually, about four feet long.
Got a spear-like nose.
And a mouth.
Yeah.
Okay, Chuck, I get it.
Besides, if anything really important were going on, you have plenty of people in your life you can talk to about it.
Hey, Ellie, wait.
What?
Oh!
I love you.
Just in case.
Just in case of what?
Uh....
Just-just in case I can't find the fish.
I suppose you haven't talked to Morgan.
No.
Why?
Because he left here last night with a four-foot long marlin.
He's mine.
And you know nothing about the stolen merchandise?
No, sir.
Officer.
Detective.
Where's my fish, Grimes?
Mr. Tucker, please.
The merchandise is insured.
That fish cost me 200 bucks on eBay.
Wait, you bought that fish?
That will be all, Mr. Grimes.
What did you use for bait, PayPal?
CONWAY:
Grimes, out!
All right.
Yes, sir.
You cracked, didn't you?
LESTER:
You are so weak.
JEFFREY:
You are so weak, man.
How am I weak, dude?
I didn't say anything.
In fact, I told...
How am I supposed to believe that?
Bartowski!
You're up.
I got the scraggly troll.
I-I did not rob the store.
Did I ask you that?
Already he's talking about stolen goods.
You might as well come out and admit you did it.
Please.
Let me handle the investigation.
Now, Mr. Bartowski, we believe this was an inside job.
None of these other imbeciles could even tie their shoes without Bartowski's say-so.
If there's a ringleader, you're looking at him.
Where's my fish, Bartowski?
!
Okay, start talking.
From the beginning.
Okay.
Um...
I was born a Cesarean section.
And I always felt like I was robbed of that headlong voyage through the uterine canal.
Where's the marlin, moron?
Ah, the elusive fish.
Sure.
That's a tale for the ages.
Start talking or I'll pull each and every one of these hairs out of your face, one at a time, starting with this one.
(groans)
Torture?
Hey, if you're trying to get me to talk, you are using the wrong tactic, brother.
Really?
What's the right tactic?
My own personal kryptonite:
Grape soda.
On the rocks, please.
Conway.
Excuse me, I have to take this.
I got this.
Ah.
You don't want to talk, Bartowski?
We'll just have to turn the heat up on you.
Mm-hmm.
There we go.
Ah.
Proper.
So, it all started with "The Next Call of Duty" game...
Now, I don't really consider it stealing, since I see Chuck and I as being life partners and therefore, community property.
Using my own personal entrance,
I went into Chuck's room to play the game.
Yessss!
And when I reached into the bag, I discovered a...
I found a, uh...
I can't go on.
This is just getting a little personal.
All right, new tactic:
You finish the story or I put your head through the wall.
Okay, someone wasn't hugged enough as a child.
Ugh.
That's horrible.
It's better on the rocks, that's why I told you to...
Anyway, there I was... staring at the most horrific object the world has ever seen.
Noooooo!
What?
Morgan, you scared me to death!
What is wrong with you?
No, no, no, no, no...
no, it's Chuck.
Well, what is it?
What happened?
We've lost him, Ell.
We've lost him forever.
You better sit down.
Um...
I don't know how to say this.
He's gone.
Morgan, what are you talking about?
I'm talking about this.
Chuck's going to propose to Sarah.
And that's pretty much the whole story.
More or less.
Ellie and I bonded over the fact that, you know, he didn't include us in this life decision.
But, hey, who cares, you know, he's got you now, so...
What does that have to do with the fish?
F-Fish?
Who cares about the fish?
John, Chuck's getting married!
Pitas are here.
Hey.
Hey.
You've had 29 deliveries, so I dropped in your free baba ganoush.
Really?
29 deliveries.
Uh-huh.
29 bugs.
Wait a second.
Oh, lunch!
Thank you.
Ooh!
Hey, buddy.
I-I smell falafel.
Yeah, of course you do.
What do you got?
I got the chick...
I'm just going to, let me just have a...
No, no.
You're going to finish the story.
Back to the story.
Ooh!
Come on.
"Boobies."
Jackpot.
Gotcha!
Good thing Jeff and Lester are pervs.
I can see you're sweating it.
So... you ready to tell us what happened here last night?
I'm telling you guys, I have no idea.
Fine.
There's other ways to make you talk.
Time to send you back to gen pop.
He sung like a canary!
Thanks for the info, Chuck.
John Casey!
You're next!
One sec.
What?
Can't fit the police into your social schedule?
Get in here now, or you and I are taking a trip downtown!
If you have a second, Mr. Casey, we'd appreciate it.
LESTER:
I can't believe you told Casey you put the marlin in Chuck's room.
What?
Don't worry.
I moved it into the freezer at the Wienerlicious.
Wow, I'm impressed with you.
Thank you.
Bye.
What?
Where you going?
Where you going?
Where you going, Lizzie?
Lizzie?
Where's she going?
Can I help you?
Yeah.
I was wondering if I could get something out of your freezer.
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.
It's company policy.
The kitchen is usually off- limits for non-employees.
Okay, then I'll have to use my special pass...
You're no hot dog maker.
Bring it on, pita girl.
We're closed!
We're closed!
Where's the fish?
We need to talk.
It's an emergency.
Oh, listen, no, hey, hey, hey, Chuck, Chuck, it's okay, man, I know about you and Sarah.
Man, and how she's more than just your girlfriend.
What?
Morgan, stay.
But I...
Sta... stay!
Hello.
After careful consideration of all potential proposals,
I have made a decision.
Oh, let me guess:
Naked 2K run?
Dinner, Chuck.
Romantic, candlelit dinner, just the two of us.
The coup de grâce...
Wow.
Good.
molten lava cake with a two-carat diamond ring filling.
Ellie will really love that.
Look, Devon, just-just promise me that you'll take care of my sister if anything were to happen.
What's gonna happen?
Oh, hey, cake hits the oven in two hours.
Don't be late.
What am I gonna do?
Do nothing.
You haven't given Sarah the ring yet.
Dude, there's plenty of time to call this whole thing off.
Sarah?
Ring?
Yeah, the ring you got Sarah.
The one I kind of took out of your locker.
You mean... the ring that Awesome got for Ellie.
Oh, thank God, man.
Are you kidding?
I thought I lost you, pal!
Morgan... where is the ring?
It's kind of complicated but...
It's in the freezer at the Wienerlicious.
I put it in Big Mike's marlin and I...
I was gonna put it back.
Ow!
Slide it to me.
Now!
Hey!
Hi, S...
No...
No, no!
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no!
(distant):
Help!
Sarah?
Lizzie's the mole.
She got the receiver, Chuck.
Oh, my God, Sarah, it's over.
They're gonna stick me in some tiny cell with no windows.
Okay, Chuck, I need you to focus.
We can get Lizzie if you can get me out of here.
How?
I keep a backup piece in the jar of horseradish sauce.
Horseradish?
Who-Who-Who puts horseradish on hot dogs?
Chuck!
Got it.
Right.
Hide it someplace nobody would look-- good.
Great.
Okay.
Oh!
Whoa.
I got it.
Okay.
Okay, now shoot the lock.
Um, look, Sarah,
I've never really fired a gun before, okay?
And I've actually done this on purpose to avoid any unpleasant side effects like shooting myself or others.
Just shoot the lock or I will shoot you when I get out of here!
(gasping):
Okay.
Get back.
Ready?
Ready?
Get back.
One...
Two...
Take the safety off first.
One, one sec...
just a little problem.
CONWAY:
Bartowski, Big Mike told me I'd find you here.
Drop the gun, Bartowski!
Now!
No, no, no, no need to shoot.
It's not my gun, it's not my gun-- my girlfriend is locked in the freezer, and if you let her out she can explain everything.
Okay, let's go.
She's right...
Come on, move.
Okay, okay.
Just look in...
Nice try.
Go, go, go!
Look in the freezer, please!
Just look in the freezer.
She's right there.
You're taking this thing a little seriously.
What kind of cop are you?
Where's Big Mike's fish?
What are you now, huh?
Big Man's personal Gestapo?
Come on, you can't break me, fool.
At the Wienerlicious.
SARAH:
Help!
Sarah.
Stand back.
The delivery girl is the mole.
The detective took Chuck.
Where are you, Chuck?
I need the ring.
This is not awesome.
MAN:
And the package, HQ.
This is Long Shore.
You're not a cop.
We've identified the enemy agent.
She was posing as a Pita Parlour delivery girl.
Code name Lizzie.
BECKMAN:
So she escaped with the receiver?
Yes, but she made a phone call.
We're currently tracing the cell signature, and we can triangulate her location.
We just need more time.
GRAHAM:
As soon as you locate her, take her out.
Uh, one of us needs to go and get Chuck out of police custody.
He was arrested just...
BECKMAN:
The Intersect is no longer your concern, Agent Walker.
I...
I don't understand.
BECKMAN:
Detective Conway is CIA.
GRAHAM:
Chuck is on his way to the extraction point right now.
We've decided to transfer him to lockdown immediately.
Is there a problem?
Uh, no.
No.
I just thought I would handle his transfer.
Forget about Chuck, Agent Walker.
Focus on catching that FULCRUM agent.
We're on it.
We, meaning,
I go get Lizzie while you find Chuck.
Well, don't make me change my mind.
So... this is it, huh?
Going to get my own padded cell.
Do I get a bed, or is my whole room kind of like a bed?
It's not as bad as it sounds.
The underground complex where you will be living has state-of-the-art security and amenities.
You'll even be allowed outside to visit controlled locations.
Hold on.
I-I...
I can't leave without telling Ellie something, a reason for going.
What should I say?
Nothing.
It's safer for them if you just... disappear.
CONWAY:
Asset is ready for extraction.
Send in the chopper.
Long Shore!
Is there a problem, Agent Walker?
Sarah, thank God you're here.
Listen, I-I don't...
I don't want to go yet.
I...
It's okay, Chuck.
Agent Casey is tracking the FULCRUM mole.
He should have her in custody soon, so we can hold off on the Chuck transfer for the time being.
If there was a change in the operation,
I would have been contacted.
I have my orders.
We don't have to do this.
This is a judgment call.
Okay, we can just hold Chuck here until we know for sure.
His cover was blown.
He's gone.
No.
I will take full responsibility.
Chuck is my asset;
he's my guy.
Just...
Just give us more time, please.
CHUCK:
I'd appreciate it.
I really would.
Please don't do this.
CONWAY:
Okay.
You've got one minute.
One minute.
I'm not ready, Sarah.
I'm not ready to disappear.
No.
I know, I know.
I need you to talk to Ellie and to Morgan and my friends, and-and- and-and tell 'em...
I don't know.
I...
Look, if I'm supposed to be dead, just say something that will make it okay, that will make 'em feel all right.
Just make sure they know how much I love 'em.
You can do that, right?
Course you can.
You're Sarah.
You can do anything.
And, hey, there's a silver lining to this, too, you know, 'cause we're not working together anymore, which means, we can go on a date.
You can come by my cell, and we can hang out, and you can tell me who the president is.
And maybe, uh maybe we can see how we really feel.
Time's up.
Good-bye, Sarah.
Chuck?
I'll save you later.
(gunshot) Oh!
Oh!
Chuck, get down.
(gunshot)
Go, go, go!
I listened to the receiver.
BOTH:
She knows.
Do you know how many agents are looking for Bryce Larkin?
And all this time, the Intersect was here.
Wait till I tell my superiors that.
Okay, look, what if I surrender, and you run?
I mean, I'm going in a cell anyway.
What's the difference?
Torture.
Okay, no surrender.
I only have one question, Chuck.
Who's the ring for?
She has Ellie's engagement ring?
Try to distract her.
What?
!
How?
Chuck, I'm not gonna to go away.
Okay... okay, look, look, look.
You really...
You really want to take me in?
You're going to have to sweeten the deal a little bit for me.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Uh, look.
Look, the CIA-- they're offering me a nice padded cell, real cush.
Can you beat that?
I'm a guy who enjoys a... a good steam.
Can you do...?
Can you do maybe a steam room or something?
I don't think you're really in a position to bargain, Chuck.
I have two guns.
What do you have?
Me.
Don't break the ring.
Whoa!
Oh!
Oh!
Hey!
Bartowski, get out of the way.
There's really some serious spy fighting going on.
CASEY:
Get down, Bartowski.
Sarah!
(grunts)
I had a feeling that girl was dirty.
Norman.
The power of positive thinking.
This was an amazing night.
As it always is with...
But, sometimes, I know life isn't always awesome.
What I'm trying to say is that, when things get rough,
I want to face them together, the good times and the bad..
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Ladies' feminine products.
That's not good.
That's not good.
Are you, uh...
Are you sure tAre yo
Are you sure that Lizzie didn't have the ring on her?
When they took her away, all she had was the receiver.
Oh, then it's got to be here somewhere.
You know, Chuck, if we can't find it, we can just replace it.
Look, look, look, it-it was Awesome's great-granny's ring, and it's going to be my sister's, okay?
Even if its covered in coffee grounds and miscellaneous DNA.
I have a ring, I have the blessing of your brother.
Will you do me the honor of becoming my wife,
Eleanor Faye Bartowski?
CAPTAIN:
Ooh.
Almost woke her up.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Ah!
Hey!
Oh, I found it!
Let's go.
I'm so sorry... but it might be a little dirty.
Way to go, Chuck.
I always knew you could handle my family jewels.
So to speak.
Uh, when she's sleeping really hard like that, sometimes, if you pinch her nose, it'll wake...
Right.
I'm going to...
Oh, okay.
Mission accomplished.
I can't believe we pulled it off.
That'll make one hell of a story at their wedding.
Which I'm never allowed to talk about under fear of death-- understood.
I have other material.
You want to?
What, spy?
You?
She looks so happy.
Yeah, she does.
I couldn't leave them yet.
You don't have to worry about that.
You're safe.
Yeah, safe for now, though.
Right.
I mean... they keep getting closer.
Eventually, they're going to figure out who I am.
Don't you think you should go in and congratulate Ellie?
You want to come in with me?
Oh, it's family time.
I know.
Well, good night.
CHUCK (laughing):
Hey!
Hey, buddy.
Yeah.
Hmm.
We can only keep him here for so long.
You realize that, don't you?
I love you, sweetie.
I love you.
I'm sorry I had to keep it a secret for a little while.
Oh, boy.
Wait.
Go back, go back, go back.
That is God and a surgeon working in harmony.
Here comes the schwarma girl.
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Here you guys go.
Be careful, it's hot.
I don't want for you to burn your tongue on it.
Uh...
- Wow, 29 orders this month.
One more and you'll get a free baba ghanoush.
I'm reaching in my pocket for money, not for...
Hey, do you have change?
Oh, she's...
Did you get it?
- Fellas.
- Oh, boy.
What are you guys doing?
Or have you forgotten about Big Mike's policy on Mammary Cam?
I don't know what you're talking about, Chuck.
He doesn't know?
So you didn't remove the offending video from the camcorder and hand it to Lester, who's now hiding it behind his back?
What?
Wow, my feelings are hurt.
Charles, after all these years, where's the trust, my friend?
In Jeff's sweaty palms, along with the amateur consumer porn.
Look...
- Hey, Chuck?
Uh, can I talk to you for a sec?
Move.
Awesome to see you, Devon.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
What's up?
- All right.
- So, what's on your mind?
- Chuck, I was...
- I was hoping to talk to you about Ellie.
- Yeah?
Yeah, yeah, of course.
Well, you know, ever since, um, we've been dating I've come to think of you as that little brother I never had.
- Don't you have two younger brothers?
- Indeed.
Indeed.
But you seem like someone who can offer sage wisdom in confusing times and this is one of those times I am really confused, bro.
I don't know how to put this into words.
- That's a bug.
- What?
What?
Spider?
I hate those fuzzy bastards.
I think, uh, no, you got him.
He was like:
"Rrr," and then: "Boo!" Gone.
Can you excuse me?
I think I Just saw a kid crawling into an oven over in Home Appliances.
Chuck.
Chuck, I need you to drop some knowledge, bro.
Keep moving, Bartowksi.
Nothing to see here.
Not even if I had the time.
You're getting sloppy, Casey.
I understand you have some perverse desire to listen to everybody.
But you really need to be careful hiding your bugs.
What are you lip-smacking about?
I Just found this on one of our product displays and not very well hidden, I might add.
Normally, I'm a fan of your craftsmanship, if not your methods.
Look, all I'm saying is that something discovered by someone could spell trouble.
You worry about that supercomputer.
Let me worry about the spy stuff, huh?
Don't you have a hard drive you can go fix?
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
There's best buddy of mine.
Yeah.
What's up?
Okay, saw an Infinity Ward mail in the trash and that means you got a pre-release demo of the next "Call of Duty" game?
Ah.
Yeah, but the last time I lent you a game sampler it ended up all over the Internet.
This one's gonna stay in my locker.
You can play it when you get some adult supervision.
Adult sup...?
I'm at the age where I should get my prostate checked annually.
I could be trusted with an advance copy of the next greatest game on the planet.
- Have you seen Awesome?
- Over by the Home Theater Room.
I think...
That's...
Really.
Hey.
Hey.
Sorry about that.
False alarm.
It turned out, anyway, the kid did not end up defrosting himself as it turns out.
So, uh, what, uh...
What's going on?
This is one of those rare moments when things are not kosher, Chuck.
Oh, man.
This is harder than I thought.
Uh-huh.
Go...
Go on.
I'm listening.
Right.
Well, I've been thinking a lot about the way things are between me and your sister.
And you're the man in Ellie's family, so I was wondering can I have your permission?
Can I marry Ellie?
Wow, that...
That's quite...
Quite a rock you got there.
- Is that a yes?
Dude?
- Yes.
Yes.
Sorry.
I Ju...
You kind of...
Wah!
You know, you pulled the...
Blang, Just right in...
- Yes, you have my blessing.
- Thank you.
Thank...
It's been in my family for years.
This was my great-grandmother's.
- Ha, ha.
Uh, you think she'll like it?
- Like it?
She'Il...
She'll love it.
I'm Just not sure she'll be able to lift her hand anymore.
Oh, one other thing.
Ellie is a bloodhound.
If I keep this in the apartment, she will smell diamond.
Can you hold onto this for a day or so?
Till I figure out how to pop the question.
- I don't think it's actually a good idea...
- Oh, thank you.
Oh, ho-ho!
Thank you so much, bro.
Hey, pretty soon I'm gonna mean that literally.
- There you go.
- All right.
- We have a problem.
- What do you mean?
Chuck found that in the Buy More.
We have a problem.
The bug Chuck found is a GLG-20, one of the most advanced counter-espionage listening devices in the CIA arsenal.
- This is a CIA design?
- Ha.
Figures.
The GLG-20 uses a low-power transmitter, in order to avoid detection.
It has a maximum range of about 20 yards.
Which means there's probably a receiver hidden somewhere inside the Buy More.
We believe it's recently become a favorite of the Fulcrum agents.
So you're telling us the secret government cabal that abducted Bryce Larkin and came within a hair of figuring out that Chuck's the Intersect is now skulking around the Buy More?
We need you to locate that receiver, and find the person who planted it.
You have 48 hours.
If you cannot identify the enemy operative in that time we will have no choice but to relocate Chuck to a secure government holding facility.
Bartowski's time as a civilian may be coming to an end.
For their own safety, his family may never see him again.
When are these ladies gonna learn?
They don't want someone taking a picture of their business, put some drawers on.
- Hey, think we should make a run for it?
- You don't run from the cops.
- You look guilty or shot in the back.
- We are guilty.
Shh!
Bring me down and I will cut you.
- So no locks broken?
No alarms set off?
- Nope.
It's clean.
- Must be an inside Job.
- Thought of that.
You think any of these dummies can mastermind all this?
It's almost always someone close to the operation.
When I find out who robbed my store and stole my fish I'm gonna break my foot off in his behind.
- Oh, my God.
- Shh.
Hey.
Hey.
What's with the, uh, police presence outside?
They robbed the Buy More, man.
They took everything.
- They took everything?
- Everything.
Oh, please, God, no.
Please be there.
Please be there.
Oh, God.
The ring.
They took Ellie's ring.
Oh, my God.
Oh!
Oh!
- Hey.
Chuckles, what's up?
Listen, dude, I figured out how I'm gonna pop the Q.
The Q?
What...
What Q?
What's a Q?
You know, the Q, the big Q you only ask once in a lifetime.
Can't say right now, Mom.
Is that your mom?
Tell her that I love that kittens playing with the yarn sweater that she knitted.
You got it, babe.
Ha-ha-ha.
- I'm gonna do it while we're skydiving.
- Really?
Do you think, uh...
Do you think that's a good idea?
Not the first time in the mile-high club, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, uh...
Listen, skydiving is a little...
A little risky.
- Don't you think?
You could drop the ring.
- Whoa, hot call, dude.
Hate to lose my great-granny's ring.
She gave it to me right before she passed.
You know?
She knew Ellie was the one before I did.
Great, great, okay so...
Just let me know when you figure something else out.
- Okay.
- But, Devon, um...
- Take your time.
- You got it, brother.
Detective Conway here is convinced that this is an inside Job.
And we intend to get to the bottom of this.
Bartowski, get over here!
You're a suspect too.
You all are.
When that pig talks to you, look him in the eye and say nothing.
- Zip it.
- Nothing?
Come on, that's incredibly rude, Jeffrey.
- Dead men tell no tales.
- Ha.
Stop it.
Quit messing around.
Bartowski, where's Casey?
Don't you two usually carpool together?
Yes.
Yes, sir, we absolutely do.
But, uh, not today.
Why don't you go find out why his ass is so tardy?
Someone might find that suspicious.
Sure, I can...
I can do that.
I'll Just...
I Just have to make...
What?
- Where are you?
Mike's looking for you.
He's gonna be looking for both of us.
Now get down here.
No.
Listen to me.
I need you, okay?
Someone cleaned out the Buy More.
They took everything, my sister's ring the one she's supposed to wear forever.
Awesome is supposed to propose to her, he trusted me and now it's gone.
Save it for your coffee klatch, Bartowski.
Get down here.
We got bigger fish to fry.
You robbed the Buy More?
We had no choice.
No choice?
Out of your mind?
Do you have any idea what's going on at the store?
That bug you found, it isn't one of ours.
- What bug?
Who ours?
The one you found yesterday.
Casey only installed EM-50's.
The one you found was a GLG-20.
It requires a secondary recording device nearby to collect the data.
- What are you talking about?
- Someone is spying on us.
- What?
- Okay, the bug you found was not ours.
It belongs to an enemy agent, probably Fulcrum.
They planted it in the Buy More.
- Why?
They're looking for the Intersect.
They're looking for you.
We found a total of 29 bugs Just like it, but we still haven't found the receiver.
Okay.
Okay, well, wow.
Uh, extreme...
Extreme measures, but, uh, decisive action had to be taken.
Good luck schlepping all this stuff back to the Buy More.
Uh, I'm gonna get back there and pretend I don't know.
Got any good tips for beating a polygraph?
Chuck, wait.
- What?
Oh, duh, yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.
Can I get my sister's ring back?
You guys are damn thorough.
You should be concerned about not making...
Can I talk to you for a second?
Hold on.
He can't hear it like that.
He won't process it.
How do you give a man a life sentence Just for being a good guy?
Okay, how about I give it a try, gently?
No, I don't wanna to hear your version of it and neither does he.
It's a Job.
How come you gotta get your lady feelings...?
- It has nothing to do...
- Agent Walker, major Casey you might wanna take a look at this.
This is a surveillance tape taken during the robbery.
There's nothing there.
Bad guy disabled the security.
Wait.
Hey, that's Jeff and Lester.
- It's off.
And they are apparently drunk.
It appears they've mistakenly turned the camera back on.
- Hang on a second, who's that?
That's the spy.
Who's the spy who spies on spies?
Why would a Fulcrum agent want Big Mike's marlin?
Those two dilweeds interrupted an actual robbery in progress.
- The receiver's in the fish.
- Marlin, actually.
- You would call it a marlin, right?
Yeah.
- Look.
See?
There you go.
Done.
My Job here is done.
So now I'm sure you super-agents can figure out where the two drunken pinheads stashed the fish.
Marlin.
Four-foot marlin.
I'm gonna stick around here and find my ring.
Hey, Chuck?
Chuck, no ring came up in our inventory.
What do you mean, "No ring came up in your inventory"?
You robbed the Buy More, didn't you?
What happened to Awesome's ring?
We have some bigger-picture concerns right now.
What could be possibly be bigger than me ruining the chances of my sister getting married?
The receiver may contain information indicating that you're the Intersect.
Say it.
Say what you're not saying.
If we don't locate the receiver in the next 24 hours...
You'll be stored in an bunker for so long you'll forget what fresh air smells like.
See?
That was very gentle.
One, two, three, four.
I declare a thumb war!
Oh!
Come on, Jeffrey.
Jeff, Lester, we gotta talk, it's important.
Here's your problem, Charlie.
Why's your time more valuable than mine?
Oh, he is taking him over the top.
- All right.
Okay.
Oh, my thumb.
- Narc.
- Narc, narc.
Narc.
Narc.
Narc.
- Easy on the shirt, narc.
- Where's the fish?
Fish?
What fish?
Okay, we can do this the easy or the hard way.
Easy way is I shove his foot up your ass.
- What's the hard way?
- I use my foot.
We've seen the surveillance footage, guys.
Okay?
- We know you were here.
- Yeah, right.
Yeah, you two geniuses thought you were turning the cameras off but instead, you turned them back on.
We won't say anything to Big Mike, I promise.
Okay.
Whoa, what's happening?
Charles, would you give us a few minutes, please?
Chuck?
- It was his idea.
- What?
!
The whole reason we snuck in was to get your ass another drink.
- You were getting the shakes.
- Not cool.
It's a disease.
You're a disease and you've diseased us all.
Me, Chuck, this guy.
- Calm down.
Calm down.
- Okay.
Look, Jeff, I totally understand your plight.
We sympathize with you, okay?
And we don't Judge.
Just tell us, what exactly happened?
We were across the street at Bennigan's and I got cut off again...
Jeff.
Ha, ha.
If you're gonna tell the story, please, don't butcher it.
We were at Benni's, enjoying the deep-fried sampler and we decided to come back to the store for a nightcap in the boss man's private stash.
It's off.
Rock 'n' roll.
We have the store to ourselves.
We should take off all our clothes.
Don't make me uncomfortable to be alone with you.
- Go get it.
- Bingo.
Yes.
No.
- No, no, no.
- Jeffrey.
This is a wasted mission now.
It's a wasted mission.
We've gotta do something exciting, man.
We can burn it down.
I was thinking more along the lines of a fishing expedition.
And that, friends, is the story of the missing marlin.
And where is the marlin now?
Ah, I'm afraid I'm going to need a little compensation.
- At Chuck's.
We took it to Chuck's pad.
- What?
My apartment?
Why?
We didn't want to get busted with Big Mike's fish.
I'm gonna need lotion.
We're pursuing the receiver.
We've the location and it shouldn't be long before recovery.
Stay with the receiver.
In the meantime, we've decided to extract Chuck.
What?
But we don't know he's in danger.
There's a chance the identity of the Intersect has been compromised.
We have to err on the side of caution.
But you promised we had 48 hours.
You know the game, Agent Walker.
The order has gone out.
Chuck is coming in.
Come on.
Chuck, you're looking for a marlin.
Hey, hey, whoa!
Whoa, stop, stop.
I seriously doubt that these geniuses had time to re-upholster the couch.
Well, it's gotta be here somewhere.
Chuck?
- Hey, sis.
- John.
- Hi.
- What are you two up to?
- What's going on?
- I'll clean it up later.
- We're looking for something.
- What is it?
Whatever you want to talk about is not as important as what we're looking for.
Okay.
What are you looking for?
- A stuffed fish.
- A fish?
Marlin, about four feet long, got a spear-like nose.
- And a mouth.
- Yeah.
Okay, Chuck, I get it.
Besides, if anything really important were going on you have people in your life you can talk to about it.
- Hey, Ellie, wait.
What?
Oh.
I love you.
Just in case.
Just in case of what?
Uh...
Just in...
Just in case I can't find the fish.
I suppose you haven't talked to Morgan.
No.
Why?
Because he left here last night with a four-foot long marlin.
He's mine.
And you know nothing about the stolen merchandise?
- No, sir.
Officer.
Detective.
- Where's my fish, Grimes?
- Mr. Tucker, please.
- The merchandise is insured.
That fish cost me 200 bucks on eBay.
Wait, you bought that fish?
Ha-ha-ha!
- That will be all, Mr. Grimes.
- What did you do for bait, PayPal?
Grimes, out.
- All right.
Yes, sir.
- You cracked, didn't you?
You are so weak.
So weak.
How am I weak?
I didn't say anything.
- How am I to believe that?
- Bartowski!
You're up.
You go.
I got the scraggly troll.
L...
I did not rob the store.
Did I ask you that?
Already he's talking about stolen goods.
- Might as well admit you did it.
- Please.
Let me handle the investigation.
Now, Mr. Bartowski we believe this was an inside Job.
None of these imbeciles could tie shoes without Bartowski's say-so.
If there's a ringleader, you're looking at him.
Where's my fish, Bartowski?
Okay, start talking.
- From the beginning.
- Okay.
Um, I was born a cesarean section.
I always felt robbed of that headlong voyage through the uterine canal.
Where's the marlin, moron?
Ah, the elusive fish.
Sure.
That's a tale for the ages.
Start talking, or I'll pull each one of these hairs out of your face one at a time, starting with this one.
Torture?
If you're trying to get me to talk, you are using the wrong tactic, brother.
Really?
What's the right tactic?
My own personal kryptonite:
Grape soda.
On the rocks, please.
Conway.
- Excuse me, I have to take this.
- I got this.
Ah.
You don't wanna talk, Bartowski?
We'll Just have to turn the heat up on you.
Mm, mm.
There we go.
Ahh.
Proper.
So it all started with the next "Call of Duty" game.
I don't really consider it stealing since I see Chuck and I more as life partners, and therefore community property.
Using my own personal entrance I went into Chuck's room to play the game.
Yes.
And when I reached into the bag, I discovered...
I found a...
I can't go on.
- This is Just getting a little personal.
- All right, new tactic.
Finish the story or I put your head through the wall.
Okay, someone wasn't hugged enough as a child.
Ugh.
- That's horrible.
- It's better on the rocks, that's why I...
Anyway, there I was staring at the most horrific object the world has ever seen.
No!
What?
Morgan?
You scared me to death.
What is wrong with you?
No, no, no.
No, it's Chuck.
- What is it?
What happened?
- We've lost him, EII.
We've lost him forever.
L...
You better sit down.
Um...
I don't know how to say this.
He's gone.
Morgan, what are you talking about?
I'm talking about this.
Chuck's gonna propose to Sarah.
That's pretty much the whole story.
More or less.
Ellie and I bonded over the fact that he didn't include us in this life decision.
But, hey, who cares, you know?
He's got you now, so...
What does that have to do with the fish?
Fish?
Who cares about the fish, John?
Chuck's getting married.
Pitas are here.
Hey, hey.
Hey.
Hey.
You had 29 deliveries so I dropped in your free baba ghanoush.
- Really?
Twenty-nine deliveries, 29 bugs.
Wait a second.
Oh, lunch.
Thank you.
- Hey, buddy.
- I smell falafel.
- Of course you do.
Come on.
- Come on.
- I'm Just gonna finish...
You're gonna finish the story.
Back to the story.
Whoa!
"Boobies. "
Jackpot.
Got you.
Good thing Jeff and Lester are pervs.
I can see you're sweating it.
So you ready to tell us what happened here last night?
I'm telling you, guys, I have no idea.
Fine.
There's other ways to make you talk.
Time to send you back to gen pop.
He sung like a canary.
Thanks for the info, Chuck.
- John Casey, you're next.
- One sec.
What, can't fit the police into your social schedule?
Get in here now or you and I are taking a trip downtown.
You have a second, Mr. Casey?
We'd appreciate it.
I can't believe you told Casey you put the marlin in Chuck's room.
What?
Don't worry, I moved it to the freezer at the Wienerlicious.
- Wow.
I'm impressed.
Thank you.
- Bye.
Whoa.
Where you going?
Where you going?
Where you going, Lizzie?
Lizzie?
Where is she going?
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.
I was wondering if I could get something out of your freezer.
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.
It's a company policy.
The kitchen is usually off-limits for non-employees.
Okay, then I'll have to use my special pass.
You're not a hot-dog maker.
Bring it on, pita girl.
We're closed!
Where's the fish?
- We need to talk.
It's an emergency.
- Listen, no.
Hey.
Chuck.
Chuck, it's okay, man.
I know about you and Sarah.
Man, and how she's more than Just your girlfriend.
What?
Morgan, stay.
Aah!
Stay.
- Hello.
- After careful consideration of all potential proposals, I have made a decision.
Oh.
Let me guess.
Naked 2-K run?
Dinner, Chuck.
Romantic, candlelit dinner.
- Just the two of us.
- Wow, good.
The coup de grâce:
Molten lava cake with a two-carat diamond ring filling.
Ellie will really love that.
Devon, Just promise me you'll take care of my sister if anything were to happen.
What's gonna happen?
Oh, hey.
Cake hits the oven in two hours.
Don't be late.
What am I gonna do?
You can do nothing.
You didn't give Sarah the ring yet.
Dude, there's time to call this whole thing off.
Sarah, ring?
Yeah, the ring you got Sarah.
The one I kind of took out of your locker.
You mean the ring that Awesome got for Ellie.
Oh, thank God, man.
Are you kidding?
- I thought I lost you, pal.
L...
- Morgan where is the ring?
It's kind of complicated, but...
In the freezer at Wienerlicious.
I put it in Big Mike's marlin.
Was gonna put it back.
Ow.
Slide it to me.
Now.
Hey.
No, no, no.
No, no, no!
Help!
Help me!
Sarah?
Lizzie's the mole.
She got the receiver, Chuck.
Sarah, it's over.
They're gonna stick me in some cell.
Okay, Chuck, I need you to focus.
We can get Lizzie if you can get me out.
- How?
- I keep a backup piece in the Jar of horseradish sauce.
- Who puts horseradish on hot dogs?
- Chuck.
Got it, right.
Hide it someplace nobody would look.
Good.
Right.
Okay.
Oh!
Oh!
I got it.
Okay.
Okay, now shoot the lock.
Um, look, Sarah, I've never really fired a gun and I've actually done this on purpose to avoid shooting myself or others.
Just shoot the lock, or I will shoot you when I get out of here.
Okay.
Get back.
Ready?
Get back.
One two...
Take the safety off first.
One...
One sec...
Just a little problem.
Bartowski.
Big Mike told me I'd find you here.
- Drop the gun now!
No, no, no.
No need to shoot.
That's not my gun.
My girlfriend is in the freezer.
Let her out she can explain.
- Let's go.
- She's right...
Okay.
Okay.
- Come on, move.
- Just look in the freezer.
Nice try.
Please, Just look in the freezer.
She's right there.
Aren't you taking this a little seriously?
Where is Big Mike's fish?
What are you now, huh?
Big man's personal gestapo?
Come on.
You can't break me, fool.
At the Wienerlicious.
Help!
- Casey.
- Sarah.
Stand back.
The delivery girl is the mole.
The detective took Chuck.
Where are you, Chuck?
I need the ring.
This is not awesome.
I have the package, HQ.
This is Long Shore.
You're not a cop.
We've identified the enemy agent.
She was posing as a Pita Parlor delivery girl.
Code name:
Lizzie.
So she escaped with the receiver?
Yes, but she made a call.
We're tracing the cell signature and we can triangulate her location.
- We Just need more time.
- As soon as you locate her, take her out.
Uh, one of us needs to get Chuck out of police custody.
- He was arrested Just...
- The Intersect is no longer your concern.
L...
I don't understand.
Detective Conway is CIA.
Chuck is on his way to the extraction point right now.
We've decided to transfer him to lockdown immediately.
Is there a problem?
Uh, no.
No.
I Just thought I would handle his transfer.
Forget about Chuck, Agent Walker.
Focus on catching that Fulcrum agent.
We're on it.
We, meaning I go get Lizzie while you find Chuck.
Well, don't make me change my mind.
So this is it, huh?
Gonna get my own padded cell.
Do I get a bed, or is my whole room kind of like a bed?
It's not as bad as it sounds.
The underground complex you'll live in has state-of-the-art security and amenities.
You'll even be allowed outside to visit controlled locations.
I can't leave without telling Ellie, a reason for going.
What should I say?
Nothing.
It's safer for them if you Just disappear.
The package is ready for extraction.
Send in the chopper.
Long Shore!
- Is there a problem?
- Thank God you're here.
I don't wanna go yet.
I ca...
Agent Casey is tracking the Fulcrum mole he should have her in custody soon, so we can hold off on the Chuck transfer.
If there was a change, I would have been contacted.
- I have my orders.
- We don't have to.
This is a Judgment call.
We can hold Chuck here until we know for sure.
- His cover was blown, he's gone.
- No.
I will take full responsibility.
Chuck is my asset.
He's my guy.
Just give us more time, please.
I'd appreciate it.
I really would.
Please don't do this.
Okay, you got one minute.
One minute.
- Sarah, I'm not ready to disappear.
- No, I know.
I need you to talk to Ellie and to Morgan and my friends and tell them...
I don't know.
Look, if I'm supposed to be dead, Just say something that will make it okay, that will make them feel all right.
Just make sure they know how much I love them.
You can do that, right?
Of course you can.
You're Sarah.
You can do anything.
Hey, there's a silver lining to this too, you know?
Because we're not working together anymore, so we can go on a date.
You can come by my cell and we can hang out.
And you can tell me who the president is.
And maybe, uh...
Maybe we can see how we really feel.
Time's up.
Goodbye, Sarah.
Chuck?
I'll save you later.
- Oh!
- Get down.
I listened to the receiver.
She knows.
Do you know how many agents are looking for Bryce Larkin?
And all this time, the Intersect was here.
Wait until my superiors find out.
Look, what if I surrender and you run?
I'll be in the cell.
What's the difference?
- Torture.
- Okay, no surrender.
I only have one question, Chuck.
Who's the ring for?
- She has Ellie's ring.
- Chuck, distract her.
What?
How?
Aah!
- Chuck, I'm not gonna go away.
- Okay.
Okay, look, look, look.
You really wanna take me in?
You're gonna have to sweeten the deal a little for me.
Hey, hey, hey, uh, look.
Look, the CIA, they're offering me a nice, padded cell real cush.
Can you beat that?
I'm a guy who enjoys a good steam.
Can you do...?
Can you do maybe a steam room?
I don't think you're really in a position to bargain, Chuck.
I have two guns.
What do you have?
Me.
Don't break the ring!
Hey!
Bartowski, get out of the way.
There's really serious spy fighting going on.
Get down, Chuck.
Sarah!
Oh!
- I had a feeling that girl was dirty.
Norman.
The power of positive thinking.
This was an amazing night as it always is with...
But sometimes, I know life isn't always awesome.
What I'm trying to say is that when things get rough I wanna face them together the good times and the bad.
Oh, oh, oh!
Ladies' feminine products.
That's not good, that's not good.
Are you...?
Are you sure that Lizzie didn't have the ring on her?
When they took her away, all she had was the receiver.
- Then it's gotta be here.
- You know Chuck, if we can't find it, we can Just replace it.
It was Awesome's great-granny's ring and it's gonna be my sister's.
Even if it's covered in coffee grounds and miscellaneous DNA.
I have a ring and I have the blessing of your brother.
Would you do me the honor of being my wife, Eleanor Faye Bartowski?
Ah!
Hey!
Ha-ha-ha!
I found it!
Let's go.
I'm so sorry.
It might be a little dirty.
Wait to go, Chuck.
I always knew you could handle my family Jewels.
So to speak.
Uh, when she's sleeping really hard like that sometimes if you pinch her nose it'll wake...
Right.
I'm gonna...
Oh, okay.
Mission accomplished.
I can't believe you pulled it off.
Well, it'll make one hell of a story at their wedding.
Which I'm never allowed to talk about under fear of death.
Understood.
I have other material.
You wanna?
What, spy?
You?
- She looks so happy.
- Yeah, she does.
I couldn't leave them yet.
You don't have to worry about that.
You're safe.
Yeah, safe for now, though.
Right.
I mean, they keep getting closer.
Eventually, they're gonna figure out who I am.
Don't you think you should go in and congratulate Ellie?
You wanna come in with me?
Oh, it's family time.
I know.
Well, good night.
We can only keep him here for so long.
You realize that, don't you?

Gilbert gottfried, cloris leachman, jon lovitz, norm MacDonald,

Brian posehn, and Jeffrey Ross with special appearances by Lewis black,

The comedy central roast of Bob saget.
And now please welcome your roastmaster, John stamos.
- Thank you.
Tonight we're here to pay tribute to an actor, an author, director, humanitarian, and incomparable showbiz whore.
I'm talking, of course, about Bob saget.
Now, if you younger viewers are tuning in to watch Uncle Jesse help Danny Tanner find a tender way to solve one of Michelle's problems, go fuck yourself.
So the good news is, we're here to bust saget's balls.
The bad news is, it's yet another show starring Bob saget, which means it won't be funny, and it'll go on for fucking ever.
Now, let's take a look back at what Bob thought made people laugh.
- You're now about to witness the strength of Bob saget.
Bob saget.
- Bob the comic, ladies!
Let's bring him back out!
- ♪ Bob saget, bitch, you better ask someone ♪
- ♪ who you rolling with?
- ♪ Bob, Bob saget

♪ nobody does it better - ♪ who you rolling with?
- Hey.

♪ and a trigger finger itchier than chicken pox ♪
- Come on, grandpa.
We want to watch Terrance and Phillip.
- No, we're gonna watch the Bob saget show.
- Hello and welcome to America's funniest home videos.
Gee, my name is granny, and I'm falling on my Fanny.
- This guy sucks!
- Yeah, he's almost as bad as that guy on full house.
- You are full house daddy-dad?
- I was the full house daddy-dad.
The girls just mean so much to me.
- It's cool, cool, cool.
- And now we're gonna do what daddy always does.
Suck dick for coke.
- I seen him!
- Little bitch Kimmy gibbler.
I feel bad I banged her.
- You know how that feels, Mr. t.
- So they're all fucking each other, right?
All of a sudden, the kid can't take it.
Diarrhea starts squirting out of his ass.
It's like a hemorrhaging shit ass.
- You know what an ass shot of America's favorite dad is going for these days?
What the fuck happened to Mr. Tanner?
What the fuck?
- ♪ 'Cause I'm a pimp, they see me rolling through ♪
- Oh my God.
- Hot 19-year-olds or 20-year-olds are attracted to you.
- Why don't you show me your room, baby?
- Did you just get cock blocked by Bob saget?
- You don't exploit that, obviously, in your personal life.
- I have met- ♪ Bob saget
- thanks a lot.
Good night, boys.
Excuse me.
I've got to go to my nuclear physics class.
Oh, you know what?
I got to go on.
I'm sorry.
I got people to entertain.
- Who the fuck was that guy?
- ♪ The illest motherfucker in a cardigan sweater ♪
- Night, Michelle.
- Please welcome our guest of honor, the luckiest man and the worst entertainer in the history of show business, he's a huge asshole and one of my best friends,
Bob saget!
- Hey, call me.
- Bob, I was with you for 192 episodes of full house, and I can honestly say you don't have a funny bone in your body, unless, of course, you count the one time you sat on Dave coulier's cock.
And by "sat on," I mean hungrily backed into.
And by "one time," I mean eight seasons.
You know, the whole time Bob and I were doing full house, he was also hosting America's funniest home videos.
He did that show for so long, he can't get a boner unless a six-year-old boy whacks his balls with a wiffle bat.
What a tough gig that must've been, huh?
His entire job consisted of saying,
"take a look at this,"
which is what he used to say to Mary-Kate Olsen in her dressing room.
Bob's last hbo special was called that ain't right.
Should have been called that ain't watchable.
That was the most pathetic piece of shit I ever seen.
And need I remind you, I did eight seasons of full house.
Bob, you're an undeniable success, deserving of the millions of dollars you lost in the divorce.
Bob, you are a class act.
And you've been there for me through the good times and bad, and I'm so flattered that you asked me to be the roastmaster this evening.
I think this is gonna be a great night for you.
I hope you have the time of your life, buddy.
- Thank you.
- Enough of this sappy shit.
Let's get on this with this train wreck, shall we?
He's back again making his annual disappearance.
Please welcome the unknown comic, one of my favorites, Greg giraldo.
- Thank you.
Thank you, everybody.
John stamos.
Isn't he/she great?
John played the bongos in a beach boys video wearing a pink tank top.
That couldn't have been any gayer if George Michael was on your lap stuffing crystal meth up your ass with Rupert Everett's fist.
You're on er now, John.
Congratulations.
You're like susie essman's vagina.
You're almost useless, but somehow you keep working.
John was married to my favorite supermodel,
Rebecca romijn O'Connell.
Jesus.
Holy.
John, you--
John, you lost your wife to the fat kid from stand by me.
Holy shit.
Look at you, you greasy Greek bastard.
I look at you and I wonder, how can there be an energy crisis?
We shouldn't be drilling in Alaska.
We should be wringing out your family's pillowcases.
Norm MacDonald is here, one of the funniest people ever.
Norm's got a giant gambling problem.
He's dropped more coin in a casino than Michael j.
Fox at a parking meter.
It's a fucking roast.
Groany-groan-groan.
Brian posehn, look at him, that giant fucking ghoul.
We've all seen you shirtless on the Sarah silverman show.
It's hard to believe you could be so out of shape considering how often the townspeople must chase you around with torches.
The great cloris leachman, of course, is here.
Cloris leachman, yup.
Cloris is so old she lost her virginity to a druid.
What are you doing here, cloris?
You're the only person with any talent.
You won an Oscar and nine emmys.
When it comes to winning awards, you've been more voracious than jon lovitz at an all the dick you can eat buffet.
Jon lovitz, you fucking gay weeble.
Come on, jon, there hasn't been a more effeminate Jew in the closet since Anne Frank.
Susie essman, look at you.
You're a mess.
You're like screech with tits.
I guess cloris leachman is here to make you seem fuckable.
Gilbert gottfried's here.
Gilbert recently had a baby.
Who would fuck you?
You have the sex appeal of a school bus fire.
Which brings me to the man of the hour,
Bob saget, everybody, huh?
Bob saget.
Bob--
Bob, you are a genital wart on the cock of American culture.
Seriously, who gives a shit about Bob saget?
With your long neck, pointy beak, and granny glasses, you're like the viasic pickle stork.
Except instead of delivering babies, you're not funny.
You're like my seven-year-old son.
You think cursing is hilarious, and you're not surprised your dick is the same size it was in the first grade.
And where the hell are the Olsen twins?
The olsens are like tom green's testicles.
They look the same, but one is fake and empty inside, and the other one's been licked by heath ledger.
He'd be cool with it, fuckers.
I read an interview where you referred to yourself as an artist.
Are you fucking kidding me?
As an artist?
You used the phrase, "as an artist"?
You are a vortex of artistic compromise.
Charlie sheen watches you and feels good about himself.
You-- you are an artist in the same way cloris leachman is moist.
You're not an artist, Bob, and stop enjoying your ironic hipness that's going on with you these days.
You're not cool.
Stop trying to be hip.
At one point in your act, you actually say,
"who's your daddy?
Say my name.
Look me in the eye.
True that."
Holy fuck.
I couldn't cringe any harder if I watched my mom in a bukakke video.
I'm done being mean, Bob.
I've met you a bunch of times.
You've always been hilarious and super cool, and everybody that knows you loves and respects you.
Nobody ever has a bad thing to say about you, and that's particularly surprising, because you're Jewish, and you're obnoxious people.
Thanks a lot for letting me do this.
Thank you.
- Greg giraldo.
Our next roaster brought Saturday night live to a whole new level of funny by leaving the show.
Tonight he's debuting a character he's been working on:
Sweaty guy with no jokes.
Ladies and gentlemen, please tolerate jon lovitz.
- Thank you.
Say, how funny was the new guy, Geraldo Rivera?
Yes.
I tell you, that's the first time I've been roasted by an illegal alien.
You know, Bob's a good friend of mine.
He's probably one of my best friends, and there's been a rumor going around Los Angeles for the last 50 years that Bob is gay.
And he's not gay.
You know, he's got a beautiful wife, beautiful girlfriend.
So I'd like to sing some songs now to kill the rumor that he's gay.
And this first song is called Bob saget isn't gay and hopefully will kill the rumors that he is, which he is not.
♪ Bob saget isn't gay ♪
♪ the sky isn't blue ♪
♪ grass isn't green, and I'm not a Jew ♪
No, I'm kidding.
Of course he's not gay.
But did you know that Bob's a gourmet chef, and he's always in his kitchen cooking up something, so I wrote a song about it.
It's called Bob saget likes it in his kitchen.
♪ Oh, Mr. Bob saget likes it in his kitchen ♪
♪ likes it in his kitchen, likes it in his kitchen ♪
♪ Mr. Bob saget likes it in his kitchen ♪
♪ kitchen, of course
♪ is code for butt hey, it's Bob's code.
I just cracked it.
Now, on a serious note, I knew Bob's father.
He's a wonderful man named Ben saget.
Ben saget was so proud of his son's success, he wrote a book about it.
The book is a loving tribute from a father to his son.
It's called, my son the the fag by Ben saget.
"I knew Bob was gay when he was five.
"We were Jewish, but Bob was so gay
"he used to run away to church.
"He'd beg the priest, 'let me stay, and I'll do anything.'
"and then he'd say, 'can you blow out the candles?
'
"and Bob would say, 'I don't know.
"Can you light your dick on fire?
'
"Bob's so gay, his asshole is no longer a hole but a smile."
- Oh, man.
- "Bob's so gay, when he plays cards,
"a full house is two dicks in the mouth
"and three in the butt.
"My son Bob is so gay,
"he wanted to rename his show, 1 vs. 100
"to stick it in my jellyfish ass till it bleeds,
"catch the drippings in a cup,
"pour them back into me intravenously vs. 100."
I'd read you more, but it starts to get gross.
Good-bye, everybody!
Good-bye!
- For your safety, please avert your eyes and welcome the pork roastmaster general
Jeffrey Ross.
Wow, give it up for chachi.
Ladies, I spoke to flavor flav.
He said you can be on the show.
They're still here from last year's roast.
Wow.
I know this is a big night, because cloris leachman put her teeth in.
Wow, what a legend.
Shakespeare did her in the park.
You look great, babe, not a day over dead.
She come her in a limo or a time machine?
Wow, doesn't Lisa lampanelli look fant-- oh, that's Jeff garlin.
Sorry.
Norm MacDonald's so stoned he thinks he's at a roast for Bob seger.
I love you, norm.
Wow, you never come out, norm.
You're like the j.D. Salinger of dick jokes.
Ugh.
Of course, Bob saget directed norm MacDonald's movie, dirty work.
Yeah.
A move that transformed norm MacDonald into a star...
Bucks employee.
- Did you say something after "star"?
- What's the over-under tonight?
What's gonna happen, norm?
- No, I wanted to read something funny, so I'm reading marmaduke.
Oh, my God.
This is what happens when you book a dais off craigslist.
Jon lovitz, great job tonight.
Jon lovitz is single out there, ladies, if you're single.
Yeah.
They paired him up with a couch and a bottle of hand lotion.
Yeah.
That's a three-way for him.
And Dave coulier, in case you think we forgot about you, we did.
Oh.
But, ladies and gentlemen, I'm here today because I only roast the ones I love, and I love Bob saget.
I love him--
I love him like a perverted Uncle who pays for lunch and then follows me into the men's room.
Bob saget is a sick bastard.
He has two daughters in college and three girlfriends in high school.
Bob saget's girlfriend is so young, r.
Kelly wouldn't pee on her.
Most comics dream of performing in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Bob saget dreams of performing in Hannah Montana.
Full house should've been called Blackjack, 'cause he hit on the olsens when they were eight.
He didn't stop till they were 21.
Is it true you used to give Mary-Kate acting lessons?
He'd tell her, "act like this never happened."
She'd be like, "you got it, dude."
Actually, Mary-Kate and Ashley were supposed to be here tonight, but they heard there was gonna be food.
And although Bob saget is not an insult comic,
I am insulted when people call him a comic.
But if some of us use dirty words as a crutch, then Bob saget must be a quadriplegic.
- But here's one four-letter word
I know he's never heard:
Haha.
Bob, in case you haven't figured it out yet, this isn't a roast.
It's an intervention.
You can keep doing drugs, but please stop doing comedy.
Please.
The people have spoken.
And, Bob, you may have noticed
I didn't use any curse words tonight, 'cause I didn't want to compete with the master.
Out of all the comics I know, you have the filthiest mouth and the kindest heart, and I knew there was no way I could top you.
But in honor of the late, great George carlin,
I would like to leave you all with another seven words you can never hear on television:
And the emmy goes to Bob saget.
That's all I got to say, 'cause that's the punch line.
Bob saget.
It doesn't even need a setup.
Bob, did you really need a roast?
Your career wasn't enough of one?
Full house.
Are you kidding me?
What the fuck was that about?
I think it's based on what passes through the brain of a comatose child molester.
It was like watching a stroke in slow motion.
America's funniest home videos.
Were they, Bob?
Were they really the funniest?
How'd you do it, Bob?
How the fuck did you do it?
Why did you do it?
To make me feel better about my career, which at that point was in the dumpsters--
I played pisshole clubs across the country-- so I can feel better about myself, so I could think, "well, things are shitty,
"but at least I'm not saget.
"I'm just a stripper.
At least I'm not a whore."
Well, I got to go.
All the best, Bob.
And, stamos, you are so gay.
I tried to get our next roaster's autograph.
Then I realized she wasn't gene Simmons.
Please welcome the least attractive cast member on curb your enthusiasm, susie essman.
- Thank you, pretty boy.
I had no idea, John, you had such a sharp tongue.
That must really hurt saget's ass.
You know, Bob, I was talking about your career the other day, and out of nowhere, a fat lady started singing.
It was so weird.
Most of you don't know that Bob is the complete opposite of his image.
His image, by the way, is funny.
Jeff, my darling husband-- not in real life.
But you know, you know I love you.
People are always fascinated by Jeff, and they're always asking me, "is Jeff really fat?"
No, the camera adds 465 pounds.
Doesn't matter.
You're funny.
Doesn't matter if you're a fat fuck, 'cause you're funny, right?
That's all that really matters.
Lot of funny here.
This dais is graced with many, many fine comedians and Bob saget.
- What do you get when you cross Gilbert gottfried with Jim Norton?
I don't know, but you wouldn't want to fuck it.
Greg giraldo:
The reason vaginal dryness was invented.
Stamos, you're doable, but I wouldn't, because you're one of those narcissistic good-looking boys, like the kind of guy who calls out his own name when he's cumming.
Let's face it.
The only one who's getting screwed tonight is Bob saget.
Bob is one of those people who every time you see him on TV, you think, "whose dick did he suck to get that gig?"
You know?
Bob spends more times on his knees after a big audition than Mary-Kate does after a big meal.
Bob will do anything for money.
That's why he's always getting into cars on Santa Monica boulevard.
And for years, I thought he just needed a ride.
You know, I'm such an innocent.
You know, and I met your girlfriend.
She's lovely.
And one good thing we know is at least she's not a star fucker.
The reason I'm here is because it was a challenge to me.
I love to putter in the kitchen, and this was an opportunity I couldn't pass up, because I've baked a cake, I've fried a chicken, and this is the first time I had a chance
to roast an asshole.
So I figured I would just show up and do it.
And you know, I just got a text message from my self-respect, and it said I have to leave.
So good night, everybody.
Thank you.
- We're lucky to have our next comic, Brian.
After the roast, he's got to get back to the cabin in the woods to skin some teenagers.
To avoid startling the creature, please no flash photography for Brian posehn.
- Keep it going for John stamos.
Wow, John.
If you and I were at a party, our cocks would have nothing to talk about.
Your dick has a more impressive resume than you do.
You know what?
I don't even know Bob saget.
I've met him twice.
I'm only here because Lisa lampanelli finally got murdered by one of her black boyfriends.
That's right.
Norm MacDonald is here.
He does an amazing Burt Reynolds impression.
And by that, I mean he's not in movies anymore either.
Jodie sweetin's in the crowd.
Remember her?
Yeah.
I can't point her out, but she's the full house girl that isn't a crazy Christian or a vagina on a stick.
So, uh--
Jodie sweetin, by the way, hosted this terrible cable show called pants-off dance-off.
Yeah.
Which is how I used to watch full house.
That's right.
Yeah, how about Jeffrey Ross, my buddy?
Yeah, yeah.
Jeff wants to be an old comic so bad that he's having his balls lowered.
Cloris leachman, look at you.
You're older than the dirt you sleep in.
Ah, that's so mean.
Susie, I know what it's like to be called ugly like you.
I do.
I--my whole life.
Don't take it personally, though, 'cause if you were a chick, I would totally fuck you.
Seriously, I came here to honor Bob saget.
Yeah.
That's right.
Bob has done a lot for this country.
For eight seasons, half an hour a week, full house kept pedophiles off the street.
In fact, three of them were on the show.
Bob, I love how you reinvented yourself as this dirty comic, you know?
But it worked a few times, and now no one cares.
You're like the boy who cried, "cunt."
- But, Bob, you've been a big influence on me, man.
When Sarah silverman asked me to play a gay guy on TV,
I didn't want to.
But then I thought, "hey, if saget can do it..."
Bob, in all seriousness, and I mean this deeply,
I hope horrible things happen to you tonight and for the rest of your pitiful life.
I'm kidding, buddy.
Congratulations, and have a good night.
Thanks, you guys.
- Our next roaster has never been to a roast, but in 1620, she was almost burned as a witch.
Her first std was the plague.
Please welcome cloris leachman!
- I am not here to roast Bob saget.
I'm here to fuck John stamos.
Stamos, you shouldn't talk so much.
Your mouth is canceling out all the hard work your ass is doing.
If you play your cards right, I'll do something no woman has ever done to you:
Put you in the movies.
Does any one of you actually know who I am?
I was on the Mary Tyler Moore show.
Total slut, by the way.
She taught me everything I know.
Here's something you don't know about Mary.
When she had an orgasm, she threw her hat in the air.
I don't know who any of you people is.
Maybe that's 'cause I watch TV and go to the movies and read the trades.
I have vibrators older than most of you.
The difference is, my vibrators still work.
They do.
You, the fat one.
Not you, the ugly fat one.
Yeah, your name is Jeff Ross?
- Yeah.
- I just want to thank you for doing the jokes my father used to tell me when I was seven.
I'm sure this is the first time you've ever made a woman happy.
None of this dirty joke stuff is shocking to me.
I mean, during the golden era of comedy,
I broke my ankle when I tripped over
Milton berle's cock.
Which one of you fellas is susie essman?
Normie MacDonald.
I've never met you before, but I want you to know
I'm carrying mace.
Norm can't stay much longer.
He has to get his suit back to his father's coffin.
I'm an academy award winner.
For the love of God, will someone please punch me in the face so I can see some stars?
I can't believe I shaved for this.
I mean, what am I even doing here?
Who cares about Bob saget?
I was giving reach arounds to Jack Benny before you were born.
And that man had timing.
I was actually offered a role on full house.
I turned it down, 'cause I wanted to focus on comedy.
I'm glad I got out of sitcoms before you killed them.
You didn't just kill sitcoms.
You raped them and left them for dead in a ditch...
Just like I did with Gavin macleod in 1975.
And then again in 1978, that bald bitch.
Bob, dearest,
I've seen some of your work.
And you're not an actor.
Not one of you is.
I was classically trained in live theater.
I improvised.
No script, no director.
Just me and the donkey.
Five sold out shows a night for six years till the donkey died of exhaustion.
Then I was finally ready for Hollywood.
What have you nothings done?
"My YouTube video has 400 hits."
Fuck a donkey, then talk to me.
Now, get up here, stamos.
Let's see what you got.
You're very funny.
- You.
Our next roaster used to be on Saturday night live.
Now he just watches it, well, up until last week when a hooker stole his TV.
Please welcome the incoherent norm MacDonald.
- Yeah, I want to start with John stamos, our esteemed roastmaster.
John--well, John has a reputation for being a bit of a swinger.
Did you know instead of an umbilical cord,
John was born with a bungee cord?
And cloris leachman is here.
Cloris?
Cloris, if people say you're over the hill, don't believe them.
Why, you'll never be over the hill, not in the car you drive.
Greg giraldo is here.
He has the grace of a swan, the wisdom of an owl, and the eye of an eagle.
Ladies and gentleman, this man is for the birds.
Susie essman, of course, is famous for being a vegetarian.
Hey, she may be a vegetarian, but she's still full of bologna in my book.
I--
Gilbert gottfried, one of my best friends.
I love Gilbert.
When you go to the men's room later, you'll see a sign that says, "gentlemen,"
pay no heed.
Go right in.
There's no room that says "scoundrel" on it.
But now we come to Bob saget, and that's why we're all here.
Bob.
Bob, you have a lot of well wishers here tonight, and a lot of them would like to throw you down one-- a well.
They want to murder you in a well.
Seems a little harsh, but-- apparently, they want to murder you in a well, it says here on this card.
No, but Bob has a beautiful face like a flower-- yeah, a cauliflower.
No offense, but your face looks like a cauliflower.
Now, I heard you have hair on your chest, Bob.
And, well, let me tell you something.
That isn't your only resemblance to rin tin tin.
- You're a fucking dogface.
How can you not get that?
No, there are times when Bob has something on his mind:
When he wears a hat.
But no thoughts at all.
Just a hat.
And Bob isn't the biggest sports fan.
I don't think I'm telling any tales out of school.
I took him to a--
I took him to a ball game, and he came toting a double-barreled shotgun.
Do you remember that?
I said, "what the 'h' is that for?"
Bob said, "I heard the lions were playing the tigers."
Do you remember that?
- Yeah.
- No, he's a good guy.
He's a good guy.
He's never bought Christmas seals.
He told me he wouldn't know what to feed them.
This concludes the joke--
In all seriousness, Bob was the first comedian that I ever saw perform when I was a boy live, and I loved him.
But one thing that bonds us as comedians is, we're bitter and jealous, and we hate everyone else that has any success.
But Bob honestly has never had an unkind word for anybody, and I love him, and I hope everybody else does, so I just wanted to say that.
Thank you.
- Norm MacDonald.
We're very lucky to have our next roaster.
He's a legend.
The executive who bought full house to network television:
Sol Schwartz.
- I remember the day that they came to me with the full house pitch.
It was the last day my assistant jaclyn blew me.
I remember it clearly.
And in walked in the full house people.
And they pitched their little show, their dream show, their classic.
And I said, "it's a yes,
"but I want it to star three schmucks
"I've never heard of.
'Cause I want to prove that time slot is everything."
Let me tell you something, John stamos.
You are the most talented actor that I have ever come across.
You are wonderful.
You're delightful.
You're a dream!
You're fantastic.
No one has ever touched your talent.
It is remarkable.
You are the best performer I have ever seen.
No one in the world has ever come close to the magic that you bring to the stage, to the screen.
My balls are clapping.
You are truly God's favorite actor, John stamos.
Oh, by the way, I've already read tomorrow's variety.
I get it early.
You've been replaced on er by Jerry O'Connell.
It's true.
Let's talk about a true mensch, my pride and joy, who I discovered 25 years ago,
Bob saget.
I'm not--
Yes.
I think you're more than just the sitcom dad or the guy who hosts that video show.
You're really one of the shittiest comics
I've ever seen.
The other day, I-- after all these years, I'd never met the Olsen twins.
He introduced me to them.
I said to him, "how do I tell them apart?"
He says, "Ashley swallows."
What's my character's name again?
Saul Schwartz.
Bob--he called him sol.
John stamos is so not Jewish.
"Please welcome sol Schwartz."
The truth is, Bob, we've worked together for many, many years, and I'm starting to think I have Alzheimer's, because I can't remember a single funny thing you ever said.
All right, I'm not fucking around.
I said to them before the show--
I said, "I want to say something nice about him now,"
and I swear, on the screen, it says, "sincere moment."
What a sincere moment.
No, what I want to say to you is, we never hang out.
I'd like to.
We see each other.
We're always happy to see each other.
I've always liked you.
And I remember when we first met, you asked me if I knew how dry my grandma's vagina was.
Those were the first thing-- - really?
- I was opening for you in the '80s, and that's the first thing you said to me, and I knew that I liked you from that moment on.
Isn't that a fantastic-- you ever met somebody--
"hey, do you know how dry your grandma's vagina is?"
That's fucking great!
You know he's a great person.
But I think the world of you.
And for me, it was an honor to be here tonight.
Thanks.
- We're roasting Bob saget?
I heard that Bob saget calls his balls the Olsen twins.
And that's actually--
I know for a fact that's not true, because he calls them Michelle.
Greg giraldo, it's like I don't--
I think he's hispanic.
He's, like, nine different things.
He's, like, nine different nationalities.
Or maybe eight.
I don't know.
Is gay a nationality?
Norm, Jim Norton, Greg giraldo-- why don't they just-- they should've done the roast at the racetrack, you know, where norm works.
Oh, who's the, like, really pretty little girl from full house?
Oh, um,
John stamos.
He's hosting it.
That should be good.
I wish so much that I could be at the roast in person, but I, um-- just after everything I've been through lately,
I really need to be around people that can make me laugh.
I got Bob's mother to tape something.
And I just got it, so let's look at it.
- Bobby, what a son.
I was proud of you when you were bar mitzvahed, and when you got married and had those wonderful children.
And all those millions you made on full house and America's home videos.
And oh, if I had to do it over again,
I'd probably get an abortion.
God, I know that's Bob's mother, and it was so sweet of her to do that, but I just hate that.
I hate when people use words like "abortion"
just for a laugh.
You know what I mean?
It's cheap.
It's like--it's lazy comics just getting a laugh with shock value, especially when it comes to susie essman's cunt.
- Many comics on this dais have worked holes in the wall.
Our next roaster just sucked a cock through one.
You can see him on the Internet sensation, one guy, two cups, and a baby.
It's the Uncle fester of unfunny, Jim Norton.
- Oh, thank you.
How about a nice hand for John stamos?
Isn't he terrific?
This is, honest to God, the biggest collection of non-celebrities I've ever seen in an audience.
You know you have a shit crowd when Alonzo bodden is "the big get."
Winner of last comic standing season three 25 minutes before they did last comic standing season four.
Your head looks like one of Shaq's balls.
And Sarah silverman was terrific.
I know she's having a hard time, but don't feel bad.
Sarah's fucked so many comedians, she has a little light over her bed so they know when they have two minutes left.
And Brian posehn, I'm so happy you're here.
Your face always looks like you just saw the ark of the covenant.
Bob, how many people turned down comedy central before they finally settled on you?
I mean, not to be a dick, but like, you know, on the fucking comic scale of importance, you're two notches below Blair's cousin geri on the facts of life.
Jeff garlin, how fat a man do you intend on being?
Fuck enthusiasm.
Curb your appetite.
Norm MacDonald, God bless you.
Watching your set was like watching Henry Fonda pick blueberries.
- Is that-- now, wait a minute.
- What's that?
Oh, he wants to say something.
- No, I just think it would be-- why, I don't think there's a person in here that would not love to watch Henry Fonda pick blueberries.
You raise a good point, norm.
Jon lovitz, it's gotten to a point where I almost feel like success has a restraining order on you.
God bless cloris leachman.
You were terrific tonight.
Terrific.
She costarred in young Frankenstein.
Wonderful.
Although back then, she worked under a different name:
Peter boyle.
I don't mean to be a little blue here, but cloris leachman's pussy is so dry, that when I tickled the lips, it coughed on me.
Life sucks.
Pryor's dead.
Carlin's dead.
Saget?
Healthy as a mule.
Bob, you're a great guy, and I'm honored to have been here with you, and you're a friend, and I thank you so much.
And it really is it out of love that we shit on each other.
Thank you guys so much.
The great Bob saget.
We all know that, but once in a while you got to kiss up to him, because he plays the guitar well.
And in case you have a bar mitzvah or a private party, you need somebody in the garden to stroll along with the dirty words and his little guitar pick.
I'm not gonna lie to you, Bob.
You have no talent.
Get a harmonica, put it on your ass, and try to come up with a tune.
John stamos, I can't believe it.
You are the mc of a guy that's going nowhere.
And John, I'm a friend.
Your case comes up Friday.
She was only 11, 11 years old.
You kept pulling on the dress.
You don't need that, John.
Get yourself a day job in Greece.
Live there.
Clean apples.
Do something.
Run around looking for zorba.
Bob, do yourself a favor.
Go to Israel, and get picked off.
Get the Hamas to knock you off.
It's all over.
In the meantime, I'm going back to my estate, and we need a guy to clean the lawn.
So I'll give you a buzz, okay?
Take care of yourself.
Our next roaster never opens his eyes, because he can't bear to watch the audience walk out.
Here to scream obscenities in a screeching voice that never gets old,
Gilbert gottfried.
- Thank you, John.
Boy, is he funny or what?
How can you follow John stamos?
And they say greeks aren't funny.
And they say greeks smell bad.
And they say their women are fat and hairy.
But enough about John and his sisters.
Now, a lot of you are saying,
"why did we pick Bob saget?
"Why should we pick Bob saget,
"who raped and killed a girl in 1990?
"Should we even waste two seconds on Bob saget, who raped and killed a girl in 1990?"
Well, first of all, it's not true.
It's not true that Bob saget raped and killed a girl in 1990.
So if you have any proof that Bob saget raped and killed a girl in 1990, stop gossiping, and go right to the police with it.
Jim Norton is a pervert.
He's a necrophiliac.
Last night, he fucked norm MacDonald and his career.
- And cloris leachman.
Cloris leachman is so old that her tits are labeled,
"whites only" and "colored."
Her tits are a shameful time in this country's history.
When I saw a great man like nipsey Russell pushed away from one of her tits, it was wrong.
Now, I watched Bob saget's hbo special in high-def, because in order to enjoy it, you have to be either high or deaf.
But his career's totally insignificant.
I googled "Bob saget,"
and it came back, "why?"
Now I'd like to do an old joke.
John stamos walks into a bar.
The bartender says,
"we have a drink named after you."
John stamos says,
"you have a drink named secret fag?"
Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen walk into a bar.
They say to the bartender, "give us two ass hurts."
The bartender says,
"how do you make an ass hurt?"
The Olsen twins say, "well, Bob saget
"hands you a chocolate milk that he just made,
"and you wake up three hours later lying on your stomach."
And lastly,
Bob saget walks into a bar, and he says to the bartender,
"give me the Bob saget."
The bartender says, "what's a Bob saget?"
And he says, "you give me one shot,
"I suck it for eight years, then you give me $100 million."
God bless you all.
Don't use drugs.
- Well, it's been a great night of comedy.
But all good things must come to an end, which means it's time for our guest of honor.
I can't believe that after spending so many years begging him to shut up, I'm now gonna ask him to speak.
It takes a big man to sit up here and take all this.
And I'll tell you two guys that are laughing the hardest tonight:
Our fathers.
Please welcome the great Bob saget.
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.
What a night.
Thank you, John.
This is the longest John stamos has gone without putting his cock in a desperate actress.
Yeah.
You know, they say the measure of a man is judged by the company he keeps.
I'm fucked.
Greg giraldo, you should be a bigger star.
You should be much bigger.
You have more talent in your little finger-- oh, sorry.
That's your dick.
Jeff garlin is a very funny fuck.
I'm sorry.
Last minute changes.
I apologize.
Jeff garlin is a very fat fuck.
Jeff's so fat...
His last comedy special was shot in imax.
Norm MacDonald, norm, you're the funniest man I know, because these are the other people that I know.
Norm is such a horrible gambler, he bet that jon lovitz would be funny tonight.
Okay, now I'd like to say a few words about susie's vagina.
I don't want to say that her vagina is foul, but it has a beak and feathers.
In fact, her vagina got a job last year as the monster in cloverfield.
Jeff Ross, Jeff, we're buddies...
- Yeah!
- But I've always wanted to tell you this.
You look like they took the friars club and beat you in the face with it.
If you looked any more like a horse, norm MacDonald would lose ten grand on you.
Brian posehn.
Am I saying it right?
Is it bri-an?
Look at that face.
Did any other lesbians survive the fire?
Which brings us to jon lovitz.
Jon, your act is like masturbation.
You're the only one who enjoys it, and you should be arrested for doing it in public.
But I love you, John stamos.
Cloris leachman, it's truly an honor to have you here.
Cloris was very hard to get for this roast, because she communicates by telegraph.
Gilbert gottfried.
Gilbert.
Gilbert.
Why are you always squinting?
Seriously, it's like you're staring at an eclipse.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's your career.
Look at you.
That's the face of a pedophile.
What better way to lure a kid into a van than to use the parrot voice from Aladdin?
Jim Norton, you look like something that just got burned off stamos's cock.
You are the most repugnant creature
I have ever seen.
You look like a mongoloid fucked an iguana.
And then there's my good friend John stamos.
He's so handsome.
Even his dick has a great hairline.
During full house, John's dick had a mullet.
In the '80s, there were two things every actress wanted to be on:
The love boat and John stamos's cock.
Neither help your career, but at least the love boat didn't try to fuck you in the ass.
That would have been exciting and new.
I love you, Jesse.
This, honestly, has been quite a night.
I was concerned, because it's hard to make fun of my friends and the people I love, but luckily, none of them are here.
And it's really--truly, it's really great to be honored and to be part of a hit show, and I know this is gonna be a hit show, because I'm on it, and we're gonna edit out jon lovitz.
'Cause that's what I do.
I star in monster TV shows, and I cut out the lame parts, you talentless, white motherfuckers.
So in summation, and I mean this to all of you from the bottom of my heart, fuck you all, and suck my $100 million cock.
Good night, and thank you.
Nice one, mate.
Thanks.
Not long now.
Got any ketchup?
Wanker!
What do you expect, babe?
"Have a nice day?"
Starving!
Can't take you away, can I?
We better get going, honey.
Come on, Lorrie!
For Chrissakes we haven't got all day!
Give that here.
We took the wrong turn!
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.
- It's you fault, Jack.
- What's the fucking point?
!
- Where's the broucher?
- Ed's got it.
So how the hell we're supposed to know where we're going?
!
Shit!
Come on, Lorrie!
It's got to be around here somewhere.
Are you alright?
You're a bit quiet?
Why do we always have to go away with your friends?
Come on, they're your friends too!
Shit!
I can't see anything.
Shit, look!
It's a cat, probably belongs to the owner or something.
We're gonna have to tell 'em.
Take it.
- No!
- Take the fucking cat.
- Put it in a bag.
- You're kidding!
Put it in a bag, Ed.
We'll put it in a boot and we'll throw it tomorrow.
- Hey, Hannah!
- Hey Jill.
Here you go, Schumacher.
- You took ages.
- Lorrie.
- How are you?
- Alright.
Yo Ed, can you get any signal?
Nothing.
Who you are you trying to call anyway?
My mom.
She just want to hear that everyone is safe.
Child!
Do you want to carry your bag, Lorrie?
No!
Hey, it's open!
Hello?
- H-hey!
- Oh yes!
Hey Lorrie, give us a kiss.
Perverts!
- Interesting.
- What is it?
To leave your house like this.
Everyone leaves their door open out here.
What's that smells?
- Smells like ...
- Gourmet!
Is it for us?
No!
It's for the cat.
- Fuck you!
- What are we waiting for?
Jesus, Matt.
Give us a chance to unpack first.
Pretty little thing.
It's so peaceful.
- Not now, Jack!
- When?
Jack, give me a chance to unpack!
I'll go take a cold shower then!
You two coming?
Not yet.
Give us aminute!
And what do you want?
- Not a good idea.
- Why not?
Hello?
Your girlfriend is in the next room!
Is this from you?
- Whenever have I given any flowers before?
- True.
Perhaps you have a secret admirer.
By the way..
Did you take the music box?
What music box?
Lorrie...
It is delicious!
- So what is it?
- What?
- Stinking kidney!
No thanks!
She's vegetarian.
Oh yes.
Sorry I forgot.
Say, everyone brought walking boots?
No.
Why?
- That's the plan.
- No.
That was your plan.
- I'm..
I'm allergic to exercise.
Not with your right hand, man!
Oh my God!
- Eurgh!
It sticks to the wine!
- Who wants to play Cluedo?
The old kid is back to play with a dildo?
- What about "Guess Who"?
- What's that?
- The name of the game.
- Someone has to describe the person in the room..
and the others have to guess who it is.
Could get nasty.
- First of all..
I should say this person is .. attractive.
- You've given that away.
That's me!
- Shut up, Ed.
- And .. they know it.
It can be withdrawn.
You're self-obsessed.
- Oh, here we go ..
They wallow in their own self-pity..
and blame others for their misfortune.
Please, not me!
Is it?
- Go on.
- They're morbid ..
and aggressive.
And they only care about themselves.
- Okay!
Twist the knife any further and I'll scream!
- It's Lorrie?
!
Actually..
It's Jack!
Bollocks!
- Come on Jack.
You do fancy this.
This place is weird.
What do you mean?
It's common belief ..
that any place that has witness death ..
becomes immediately haunted.
That was your arse, man.
It's fucking supernatural.
I'm telling you, this place is dark, man.
There's two things that would account for a haunted house.
First thing you gotta do is look up the basement.
Why?
To listen.
For what?
If it's haunted ..
You'll hear the sound of the dead .. breathing.
That's.. scientifically impossible, Matt.
Is it?
So, what do the dead sound like?
- Like Matt, without his puffer!
Yeah, that's right.
So what's the second one?
It's message from the other world.
Things get moved around.
You know, like a poltergeist.
- What's happened?
- The power's down.
- Who's there?
- It's me.
I'll to find for some candles.
We could be in luck here.
- Hello mister.
- Oh, hye!
The leopard bra ..
- You naughty little midget!
-You love me like that.
- Come here then, pretty tiger..
Naughty little girl, you.
- What?
- We can't, sweetheart.
- Why not?
- We just can't leave the others in the dark..
- Oh God!
Fuck the others!
Later, babe.
Alright?
Promise?
Promise.
Well, I'll hold to that promise, mister.
I sure bloody hope so.
- What the ..
- "Help Me"?
Did you hear that
Where's Jack?
Bastard!
Suckers!
You'll pay for that.
I really don't.
This is the third time this month!
Excuse me, but who exactly are you?
Oh, I'm Ms. Obadiah, dear.
This is my house.
Blackstock farm.
We spoke on the telephone, remember?
Of course.
By the way, that pie was delicious.
It's nothing, we do that for all our guests.
Your certainly made us feel welcomed.
By the way, any of you seen Sam?
- Who's Sam?
- My cat.
- No, no. haven't seen him.
Right?
Well, anyway..
If you do see him, you let me know.
Won't you?
You are a naughty boy!
Easy, tiger ..
Fuck you, Jack!
Your face!
I don't know what this is, but it is really delicious!
It's tongue.
What do you think of Lorrie?
What do you mean by "What do you think about Lorrie"?
You know..
- I get it.
You fancy her, don't you?
- No!
Bollocks!
Forget it, Matt.
She's out of your league.
What was that?
What was what?
That noise ..
Listen.
That!
It came from outside.
There's someone out there.
Who?
Why the fuck should I know?
- Where are you going?
- I'm going out there.
Do you think that's wise?
Jesus, Matt.
Grow some fucking balls.
Hello?
Does anyone there?
Hello?
Hello?
Are you okay?
Hello?
Lorrie?
Come on, we're going to get you home.
Should we wake her?
Well, she can't be alone, that's for sure.
Well, I'll stay with her.
Are you sure?
I'm sure!
She'll sleep with me and I'll ..
I won't ruin your weekend.
What's going on out there?
I don't know.
Oh, what is that smell?
It smells like death!
It's a kidney, dear.
You could do with some fattening up.
You're skin and bones.
I'm quiet happy with my figure, thank you.
- Me too.
- Im my opinion..
..men like it with meat in their bones
No, thanks.
I'm vegetarian.
- Oh dear ..
Never mind.
What's happened to your arms, dear?
I caught some brambles.
Oh, dear.
I'll fix you something for that scratches.
- OK guys, what's that?
- Why don't we go for a walk?
- We should go and get supplies.
- I'll drive.
- No, we'll go.
Stop!
What?
I said stop the car..
Now!
Feotus?
What?
- It's a good word.
- It's sick!
What's sick about feotus, Jack?
You alright, Lorrie?
- No...
I think I'm going ot be sick!
See no evil.
- You see anything?
- Nothing.
- Ow!
- What is it?
It's prickly, that's all.
Wait here, I'll get Band-aid from the car.
I'll be waiting
- Who is it?
- It's me.
Come in.
- You Okay ?
- Not really..
What's wrong?
Why'd you say that?
I didn't talk in my sleep, did I?
- No.
- Thank God.
- Guarda , Lorrie.
Puoi fidarti di me.
I won't tell a living soul.
Thanks , Matt.
You're a sweetheart.
- Ed?
That's how you wanna play it, is it?
What'd she do with the cat?
She's playing the game, huh?
- Hannah?
Babe?
Hannah?
What sort of stuff?
That's awful!
Jesus!
- Hannah!
Hannah!
Hannah!
Hannah!
Hannah!
Hannah?
Oh God!
Oh fuck!
Argh!
The fuck is that?
They should be back by now.
They're probably out shagging!
Alright, what is it that you wanna do?
I don't know about you, but I;m going for a walk.
Come on, slowhead!
What could possibly be the problem now, Matthew?
I thought we're go for a stroll, not a fucking route march!
Do you want to go back, Matt?
No, just give me five minutes, alright?
I'll go and chill out over here.
Do you want me to wait with you?
Leave him, Lorrie.
We'll pick him on our way back.
I got him!
- Who?
Ed?
- Yeah!
Hello, you're through to Ed.
can't take your call right now, so..
please leave your name and a brief message after the tone..
and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.
- Ed, where the hell are you?
We got signal but we're in the middle of nowhere.
Call me when you get this.
It smells delicious.
What is it?
Soup, dear.
My farmhouse special.
Careful!
You'll burn yourself.
- Want help?
- Yeah sure..
Tritateci sopra quelli se volete.
Come on, Matt.
We don't have all day.
Fuck!
- Oh, deary me!
What are we going to do with you?
I'll get you plaster.
You alright?
What have you got there?
I found this in the soup.
I wonder what happened to that.
Thank you dear.
I thought I lost it.
Oh, it's cooked already.
Still no sign of your friends.
Lorrie?
- Not now, Jack.
- Can I come in, please?
I'm worried.
- You alright?
- No.
What's wrong?
Look.
I'm pregnant, Jack.
- We used protection!
- Yeah, I'm pregnant!
Fuck!
Shouldn't told you.
Find out how much it cost and I'll pay for it.
- For what?
- You're not gonna keep it, are you?
You don't want this.
You know I fucking don't.
Don't be so selfish!
I'm having this baby, Jack!
Fuck!
Why did you invite me away this weekend, Jack?
What do you mean?
Couldn't chose, huh?
Choose what?
Choose who!
It's Jill or me, Jack!
A real man won't put me through this!
I'm not gonna do that, Lorrie.
You are free to fuck up your life..
But I'm pretty damn won't fuck up mine!
You alright, Jack?
Hello?
Hello?
Is anyone there?
Shit!
Ed, is that you?
Stop fucking around!
You're making me worried.
Dirty bastard!
"Help Me"?
- Yo, Lorrie!
Give us a kiss.
- Pervert!
- Yo, Lorrie!
Give us a kiss.
- Pervert!
- Yo, Lorrie!
Give us a kiss.
- Pervert!
- Yo, Lorrie!
Give us a kiss.
- Pervert!
- Jill, he's not out there!
Oh gosh, he's still out?
This pie is delicious.
That's it, I've had enough.
Lorrie...
Jack?
Jack?
Jack?
Jack?
Jesus Jack!
What have they done to you?
I'm getting you out of here.
What happened?
He's out there!
He's f*cking out there!
He's got Jack!
Who?
- Jill, calm down, calm down.
Don't tell me to fucking calm down!
He's, he's fucking out there!
Lock the fucking door!
Call the police?
- Shit, no signal!
- We need Jack's keys!
Found it!
I'll go and get the car.
You stay with Jill, okay.
Barricade the door!
Come on, come on.
He's gone..
He's fucking gone, Lorrie!
Come on.
Come on!
He's gone..
Jill, look at me!
Tell me what you saw!
Tell me what you saw!
A man!
What man?
Quiet Jill!
Quiet!
It's going to be alright.
We'll wait until he's gone.
Don't leave me, Lorrie!
We can't fucking stay here!
We've got to go, it's our fucking chance.
He's gone.
Come on!
Wait!
My phone!
Jill?
Jill?
It's not good.
It's not fucking good!
- We need to go!
- Where's Jill?
- Come on!
- Where's Jill?
She's fucking dead Matt!
Come on!
- Come on, this way, this way!
- What?
You're crazy!
No, it's our only chance.
Come on!
Come on!
Lorrie, wait.
Come on!
I just need to catch up my breath, alright?
Do you think you can make it?
I'm not sure.
You've got to, Matt.
Okay?
Come on!
- Lorrie, just go!
Lorrie, phone the police!
Just go..
What is it?
He's out there?
Who?
Who's out there?
- We have to call the police!
- Tell me what's happened.
- He's got Matt, Jill ..
I can't make any sense of what you are saying.
He's fucking butcher!
We have to call the police!
Calm down, calm down.
I'll take you back in my cottage.
You'll be safe and sound there.
Fuck you!
Here you are, dear.
Drink this.
- What's that?
- It's herbal.
It will calm your nerves.
Come on, drink it up.
Yes!
Yes!
It's an emergency!
Yes, there seems to be disturbance at Blackstock Farm.
It tastes like chicken.
What?
Flesh, dear
Human.
Nice to have your friends for dinner.
That's right.
That's Jack's lying tongue.
Here, kitty kitty kitty..
Here, kitty kitty kitty..
Here, kitty kitty kitty..
Come here, kitty.
I know you are there..
Here, kitty kitty kitty..
Here, kitty kitty kitty..

(Insects and birds chirping)
Lord Boynton!
Lord Boynton!
Hey!
(Shouting in Arabic)
Quoi?
!
(Speaking Arabic)
(Horse whinnies)
(Traders calling out)
Don't...
Don't speak.
Why not?
You've got sunstroke, you need to stay where you are, be quite still.
Actually what I need to do is sit, I think, and drink a lot of water.
Shukran.
I'm dehydrated.
I've sent for a doctor.
Already got one.
Sarah King, MD.
You're the fellow who's going to get sunstroke, walking around without a hat.
I just introduced myself.
- (Woman) Raymond.
- Ah, my-my mother needs me.
If you can't introduce yourself, perhaps you might introduce me to your mother?
Unlikely.
- Thè au citron, s'il vous plaît.
- Oui, monsieur.
- Chaud, très chaud.
- Oui.
Alas, madame, I am desolate.
You have no newspapers of any description?
!
I am so sorry.
(Woman) You don't know what sorry is!
Got you, you double-distilled blighter!
Colonel Carbury, mon vieux.
Poirot.
All these years travelling, you'd think I'd be used to creepy-crawlies by now.
I did not know that you were the enthusiast for I'antiquitè.
For what?
You have come also for the exploration of Lord Boynton?
Ah, no, no.
Passing through.
Vraiment?
To where do you pass, Colonel?
Here and there.
You know, here and then...
You know.
- There?
- Or thereabouts.
Absolutely.
(Door opens)
- Can I help you?
- Oh!
Agnieszka, you are such a fool.
I am looking for... number nine?
This is six.
So sorry, my dear, for my intrusion.
You are, er, come to follow the labours of Lord Boynton?
Yes, he's my stepfather.
Truly, God has smiled upon you.
Your stepfather does a great thing, I think.
A great man.
(Loud chatter, car horn beeps)
- Oh!
- (Car horn)
(American accent) So I may remain assured of your very best services?
Thank you very much, sir.
Americans.
Do know how to arrive, hm?
(Man) Silly little man!
- Please!
- Look here...
- Do you know who I am?
- (Protesting in Arabic) Pay fare!
I am the son of Lord Boynton.
Son of Lord, you pay, please.
Thank you, sir.
(Speaks Arabic)
Bloody shambles!
Typical.
If you...
- (Snores) - (Sighs)
- (Boy) It was an accident.
- (Child crying)
(Child wailing)
(Woman screaming)
(Panting)
Jinny...
It's all right, honey.
It's all right now.
I was being drowned.
It was a dream, baby, it was just a dream.
It was a memory!
I can't go on like this.
(Man shouting)
(Knock on door)
Twelve minutes.
- You allowed me to oversleep...
- Mother by twelve minutes!
- I'm sorry.
Fetch my stick.
Stick!
(Chatter)
Ah, excellent.
There you are.
It's Leonard.
Boynton.
Your stepson.
How good of you to come, Mr Boynton.
- Carol, my vitamins.
- Now, Mother?
Clearly.
Jinny, you look like you're suffering from consumption.
That's drawing attention to yourself in the most unattractive way.
Apply colour!
Raymond...
Don't sit there, sit here.
Nanny...
Go somewhere else.
You look tired, dear.
We need to discuss your attitude.
Sulking is like shyness.
It is unacceptable, it is showing off.
I'm not sulking, Mother.
I merely question the wisdom of travelling when the market is jittery.
Wall Street knows better than to breathe without consulting me, wherever I may be at whatever juncture.
I forgot my book.
Fetch my book.
You think they're a rum crew, wait till you meet the archaeologist husband.
Although he's not actually psychotic, just old-fashioned bonkers.
Theodore Gerard.
We have met.
Bonce doctor.
I advised on a case in Edinburgh.
Used to have a beard?
Oh.
Yes, of course.
The bonce doctor!
- I recognise you, monsieur.
- Of course, it's all a sham.
The real object of the exercise...
is a reconciliation of his offspring and hers.
- Happy families among the tombs.
- There is disharmony?
Where Lady Boynton is, the Music of the Spheres is like nails down a blackboard.
Now, you must excuse me my personal disorder...
Can't help sticking my face down the stupid lion's throat.
Do you mind if I join you?
(Sighs)
I can't find these wretched pills.
Oh God, Raymond.
She has them.
What?
She has them already, they're in her bag.
The book she sent me to find, she didn't even bring to Syria.
Carol, we know these games.
One day, Raymond...
I swear to God...
- I know.
- I will take a hammer and I swear...
Maybe we should talk about that.
- Don't joke with me, Ray.
- I'm your brother.
I never joke.
(Call to prayer)
(Raymond) The way we let that woman steal them from us.
(Carol) Oh, God, Raymond.
We have no choice.
(Raymond) She has to die.
(Traders calling out)
(Man speaking Arabic)
Now, we're going now!
Please!
Please!
Yes, sir.
Please, please, please.
Tickety-boo.
Please.
This way.
OK, OK.
(Speaking Arabic)
Whoo!
Looks like Lord Boynton's expedition has created quite a stir.
Apart from the family and a three-line whip...
Dr King joins us, I suspect, because she stuck a pin in a map of the world.
Mr Jefferson Cope may actually be a little bit dull.
He might possibly like old bits of bone and pot and whatnot.
The honourable Leonard, stuck with running his father's house in Dorset, on no income, while said father swans around the Middle East looking for the head of John the Baptist.
As for the Polish nun, she gives me the heebie-jeebies personally.
(Shouting in Arabic)
No problem, no problem.
Don't be afraid.
No problem.
(Shouting in Arabic)
No problem, no problem.
(Speaking Arabic)
(Camel grunts)
Hm.
What have we here, I wonder?
A mobile toll-booth?
Dame Celia Westholme.
Sorry to hold up the bus, everybody.
Camel's on loan, had to go back.
Has Boynton made any significant progress?
Does anybody know?
- Have you read any of her books?
- Oui.
It's her fault I'm here.
She makes travel sound so thrilling.
Ah.
(Shouting in Arabic)
Welcome, welcome, welcome.
Did you have a nice journey?
I know, it's ghastly, isn't it?
Hello, little blossoms.
Hot showers and cold beer for everyone.
Even you, Nanny, you raving old dipsomaniac.
- Leonard, dear boy!
- Father.
Ah.
My child bride.
Dinner's in the pavilion at eight.
Everyone's invited.
Come along!
Raymond.
Utter bonanza of crippled personalities.
I'd have paid extra for this.
(Distant shouting)
(Operatic singing on radio)
(Shouting)
Making yourself useful, Leonard?
Good man!
Coming along!
That blind chap down in the Arab camp, every night I hear him tell a variation on the same story.
I've heard it all over Syria.
The daughter of Herodius brought John the Baptist's severed head to this land.
She buried it where the river meets the mountain.
Now, I've been every damn place in Syria where any river meets anything that could possibly be construed as a mountain, from Krak to Aleppo.
This is the only place left.
It has to be here!
Come along then.
Chop-chop.
Ah...
And these words...
Do they speak of John?
No.
It tells a different story.
A man is sitting in a tavern in Damascus.
He looks up from his wine and sees Death staring at him across the room.
He cries out, "But this cannot be my time!"
He flees Damascus, he rides his horse fast, right across the desert to Samarra.
When he arrives, he's thirsty.
Standing before him at the well... is Death.
Hm.
You're nodding.
On seeing Death for the second time, the man cries out, "This cannot be!
"For I escaped you in Damascus."
And Death, he lays his hand upon the shoulder of the man and says, "I also was surprised to see you..."
"...to see you in Damascus...
"for my appointment with you, it was always to be here in Samarra."
Try as one might, one cannot escape one's rightful destiny.
Oui.
I know you're here, Johnny.
I can almost smell you.
Sugar, Raymond?
To put sugar in one's tea is indicative of weak character.
Raymond doesn't take sugar.
Oh, good morning.
You look dreadful.
- Thank you.
I feel dreadful.
- You should see a doctor.
- I just did.
He told me I had malaria.
- Oh, Lord!
I dosed myself up, as much as it makes a difference.
You shan't come on the expedition today?
If I have an attack on the way to the river,
I'll most probably die.
The obvious solution is to remain here all day with Lady Boynton.
- Better come with us.
- Not a difficult decision.
The sun is up.
I shall spend today observing from the platform.
Good idea, poppet.
Cracking view of the Kasbah.
You can keep a beady one on Leonard and myself.
You assist with the digging, monsieur?
Oh, I would assist with digging the drains if the alternative were enforced social intercourse with my father's ghastly ten-ton wife.
You won't come down to the river, Lady Boynton?
By all accounts, the vista of the Kasbah is very fine.
- The boy bring my Times yet?
- No, Mother.
Dismiss him!
- (Slap)
- Sorry, might have stung.
Ah!
I am stung!
Yes, there's the bugger there.
Goodness, let me look at you.
Don't touch me!
Never touch me!
You're always looking at me.
Golly, am I?
All the time.
I turn round and you're just looking at me.
Why?
Perhaps I like the shape of your face.
It's a very pretty face.
Do you mind?
I certainly shan't do it if you mind.
I don't mind.
(Poirot) S'il vous plaît, Monsieur Cope.
Do not allow Poirot to detain you.
Oh, I'm in no hurry.
The place has been there a few years, it's not going anywhere,
You are acquainted with the family Boynton?
One can't live in New York and fail to be acquainted with the Boyntons.
Lady B is a pretty big financial noise.
I like her.
If I may say so, monsieur, it seems your amitiè is not reciprocated.
Oh, she hates everybody.
Everybody knows that, she just doesn't give a damn.
- I think it's quite stylish.
- You have the outlook most benevolent.
I'm easily pleased.
(Sarah) Out in the sun yet again without a hat.
(Raymond) Some people never learn.
(Carol) Raymond, let me read you what Mr Baedeker has to say.
"The monumental edifice knows as..." Excuse me!
Thank you so much.
I thought that free from the mother
I might be permitted some conversation with Raymond.
But no.
Evidently the family has decided I'm a gold-digger, and all overtures of friendship must be stamped on.
Frankly it's rather insulting.
I'm not having it.
Ladies and gentlemen, now we may rest.
We have arrived. (Speaks Arabic)
(Agnieszka) God is good.
God is glorious.
If you want my professional opinion, which you don't, but you should, so I'm gonna give it to you anyway, your family would do well to hear what Herr Freud said to me last year.
"To be American is bad enough," he said, "but to put money..."
(Mutters)
Oh!
Let me look at you.
I'll be fine.
I'll be... fine.
This gentleman needs to return to camp immediately.
Get your hands off me, I'll be fine!
Doctors!
Think you know everything?
(Sarah) You're too hot.
(Gerard) You don't have to... carry me.
- Jinny!
- That's my name!
(Gerard) I just need a drink of water.
I can hear the gears grinding in the old cerebellum.
Not really.
I was just wondering how Lady Boynton managed to negotiate that ladder affair, it's pretty vertiginous.
Would it kill you to call her "Mother"?
For me.
Stepmother would do.
(Leonard) God, it's hot.
Yes, it is.
Perhaps you would be kind enough to take the lady in question a glass of water.
Father, look, I'm sorry, but are you genuinely blind to the way she treats... everyone, except you?
Now!
I say!
Would you like a drink?
Can we get you anything at all?
To drink?
(Quietly) Like a bucket of strychnine.
Get these buggers away from me!
I'm perfectly well.
Lie down.
- Ah...
- Doctor, what do we do?
What did he say?
He said bugger off.
Oh. (Chuckles) Right you are.
Can do.
Not you.
You stay.
- No, Jinny.
- Oh, God.
I thought...
- Yeah.
- I thought you wanted my company.
I do, yes.
That's exactly what I want.
Listen to me, it's not... you.
It's not about a conquest.
For me, denial... is a very... particular pleasure.
It's not... (Sighs)
(Music on gramophone)
People say travel broadens the mind.
Mainly because people like me insist on it in their books.
But I have to say I doubt that it is true.
On the contrary.
I suspect travel narrows the mind.
One becomes so blasè about the wonders of the world.
The more I travel the more clearly I understand that... all that ever matters is the people.
Not the places.
Those Arabs, telling stories over couscous in the camp.
They fascinate me.
This, it's pretty enough, but show me the humans every time.
I don't much care for her.
The way she hangs around the younger Boynton girl.
They sniff out weakness, nuns, and misery, and they gorge on it.
Bloody vampires in drag, quite frankly.
(Men shouting, distant)
Poirot!
How did you find the river?
- Oh, I...
- Good, good.
We haven't turned up any glories here, but we live in hope.
Nil carborundum, and all that.
And Lady Boynton, she has enjoyed her day?
Oh, yes, monsieur.
Of course, she always does.
The word "boredom" is simply not in the vocab.
Darling!
I think it's time you climbed down from your perch for a martini.
Poppet?
Shall we say about ten minutes?
You little minx. (Chuckles)
(Sighs)
(Greville) Help!
Help!
Et alors.
Ça commence.
(Greville) Help!
(Commotion outside)
- Are you the girl who's a doctor?
- Yes.
Then you've met death.
So have I. Come on.
Shut her eyes.
Shut them.
I'm afraid it's true.
She's dead.
Your appointment with death, madame.
It was always to be here.
Et maintenant, mon Colonel, you are arrived.
This is an event for which you were prepared.
Non?
No.
This is something else.
Later.
Show me the dead woman.
What happened here?
Excusez-moi, but do you commission me to examine this case?
I do.
You two getting married or something?
Mind if I have a gander at your patient?
- Are you recovered, Doctor?
- I'll manage.
Juicy big hole where there shouldn't be one.
Somebody's stuck her.
- Mm, a knife.
- Bigger than a knife.
Fatter blade.
- Chisel?
- Chisel fits the bill.
Whatever the implement, it was wielded with authority.
One blow in, then vigorously churned about to create maximum damage.
She can't have been dead for more than an hour.
Yes.
I don't know why that should be there.
It is wax.
Well, one thing's for certain.
She can't stay here in this heat.
I'll make arrangements for the body to be transported.
Un moment, s'il vous plaît, mon Colonel.
- Excusez-moi.
- Yes.
Already there is so much about this case that is wrong.
You, yourself are wrong.
You are not what you appear.
You are not a policeman, yet you know a crime has been committed before it had been reported.
You bear the rank of Colonel, yet where is it mon ami that you serve?
So enough of these crypticities.
Explain yourself to Poirot or he cannot accept this case.
Point.
- Crypticities?
- Oui.
Poirot, you're a foreigner.
But I judge you to be a good egg, and therefore trustworthy.
What I'm about to deal you now is a card you must keep very close to your chest.
Is that understood?
Oui.
You continue with the digging, monsieur?
I am given to understand it's what Lady Boynton would have wanted.
You were, I think...
Please to forgive me somewhere in this area this afternoon?
Poirot, could you postpone your interrogation of the obvious murder suspect so he can arrange some necessities for his distressed father?
Thank you so much.
Oh!
I understand you're looking for a chisel, yes?
Fill your boots.
(Celia reading in Arabic)
Dame Celia.
Lord Boynton.
What is it that you read?
I'm cheering the bereaved with judicious extracts from The Perfumed Garden.
Are people saying that I killed my wife?
Non.
Non, monsieur.
We are all united in our desire to comfort you.
I was always glad that I was older than Leonora.
I thought at least...
I'll die first.
I won't have the agony of trying to live without her.
Nevertheless, it must be admitted the death of Lady B is hardly detrimental to the community.
It is not well, monsieur, that a human should die before her time it is come.
En plus, the nanny Madame Taylor has the great distress.
All right, all right, keep your hair on.
For heaven's sake, I was just trying to lighten the mood.
How did you achieve your newspaper, Monsieur Cope?
Came with me.
Many thanks.
I'm just lousy at being intrepid.
Always so hungry for news of home.
Back at the hotel you couldn't get a paper for love nor money.
(Gerard) I know.
This may help you in times of stress.
Mon Colonel.
Your men.
When is it that they arrive?
- Midnight, I should think.
- Hm.
Then you must have them search this area at dawn.
The search most diligent.
All around.
Looking for what?
In the first place, mon ami, a syringe.
It is instrumental in the murder of Lady Boynton.
Right.
Good grief.
- It will be done.
- Bon.
You see, mon ami... the voices of the little grey cells.
They have begun to sing to Poirot.
(Chanting prayers)
(lnsects buzzing)
Slit throat.
Je comprends pas.
It is not the custom du pays to waste life and food in this manner?
Barbarous.
Monsieur.
- Monsieur.
- Monsieur.
Look, Poirot, sorry to be so stand-offish.
Bit grim seeing one's father cry.
Oui.
Je vous en prie, monsieur.
What do you want to know?
I should like for you to tell me if you spoke to your stepmother yesterday afternoon,
- and if so, when?
- Er, we spoke... about one o'clock, hottest part of the day.
Bon.
She'd been perched up there like some evil great pudding ever since you lot set off.
I say we spoke.
I spoke.
She ignored me.
Nothing unusual about that.
Can we get you anything at all?
To drink?
You know how it was.
One mustn't disturb her when she was taking the sun, but...
God help you if you neglected to do so.
- Monsieur.
- Oui.
- We found this syringe.
- Ah.
- Where was this discovered?
- In the tent occupied by the old lady.
The nanny.
Merci.
(Agnieszka) "And the Lord said unto the servant:
"Go out into the highways and compel them to come in to my feast..."
(Jinny) "...that my house may be filled."
It's a beautiful parable.
(Agnieszka) The word King James renders as "compel"
is in the Greek "anankadzo".
It means compel with violence.
The Spanish knew this.
They used this single word to justify every atrocity of their Inquisition.
For it is God's own command that those unwilling to enter His Kingdom should be persuaded in with pain.
That's terrible.
Compulsion of any kind, my dear.
It can be terrible.
(Jinny) I overheard my stepfather telling the story that was written here.
Of Death following the man across the desert.
Something has followed me here to this place.
Something evil.
God is here to guard you, Jinny.
He lives in every grain of sand.
(Man speaking in Arabic)
(Other men chant reply)
(Water splashing, child gasping)
(Music playing faintly on gramophone)
(Carbury) What is it now?
(Music stops)
Sorry gentlemen.
Sand in the grooves.
Quite.
Well, the Arabs are all accounted for.
Oui.
This case, it is most unsatisfactory.
Still plenty of suspects, old boy.
But almost all of them were outside of the camp when the murder it was committed.
And this is corroborated by a witness who is impeccable.
Me.
They were with Poirot all of the time.
Raymond wasn't.
He came back.
Bien sûr.
Cela je connais bien.
Oui.
Also Lord Boynton and his son.
Yes, yes, and tomorrow we begin the further interrogations.
That's a queer one.
Without doubt there is more to Monsieur Cope than he wishes to be known.
But in that desire, and in this company...
he is not unique.
(Woman screams)
(Overlapping voices)
(Carbury) Off in this direction.
(Raymond) Where did it come from?
Close all those gates down there.
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.
(Men shouting in Arabic)
Did you see anyone moving?
No.
Where did it come from?
It's got to be something.
(Jinny gasping)
(Carbury) Good Lord.
Get her inside, quickly!
(Carol) It's OK.
(Carbury) You men, over here.
Close all the exits!
Don't let anyone leave.
Sister Agnieszka!
Ohh...
- (Sobbing) - (Carol) It's OK.
It's OK.
It's OK.
Shh.
It's OK.
Everything's going to be OK.
Shh, shh.
Can I help?
(Agnieszka muttering)
It would be useful to know what she was trying to tell us.
She's not trying to tell us anything.
She's talking to God.
(Poirot) You have Polish?
You don't need Polish to spot a woman at her prayers.
Pretty needlework, Doc.
Shouldn't we be getting her back to the hotel?
- Ask Dr King.
- You're the senior physician here.
You're much prettier and you're handler with the cutlery.
Besides, the nun is your patient.
I've got my hands full with the loony nanny.
Well, this, what I've done, it's only temporary.
So yes, we should.
It would be helpful to Poirot for all of us to return.
- Ei veniam da.
- That's Latin.
"Forgive him"?
Poirot has little Latin, but it can also be, I think, "Forgive her".
- My men can track...
- Non, non...
There is no need to despatch your men, Colonel.
The assailant of Sister Agnieszka has not fled.
There was a man...
He followed me across the desert.
I woke up and... he was putting a bag over my head.
Slaver.
Bound to be.
People think the slave trade is finished.
It's not.
I've seen the Waiting Cave on the beach at Mangapwani.
One hundred souls crammed into a space hardly bigger than this tent.
I threw myself on the floor to get away.
When I looked up, I saw...
You saw Sister Agnieszka struggling with your attacker and...
Well, you tried to help her, and...
you struck at the man with what?
A rock.
Bon.
And in your terror, and in the dark, accidentally you struck your friend and protector.
Now, you try to get some sleep, if you can.
Because tomorrow we face the rigours of the return journey.
Come close, Jinny.
Let me tell you story.
This... is the legend of Gilgamesh.
Oh.
Shukran.
Will she be all right?
The nun?
Oh, God knows.
Will you?
I'm not wounded.
That's debatable.
Seems to be consensus that you killed your mother.
(Scoffs) Is that your view, Sarah?
Heavens.
Five consecutive words, culminating in my Christian name.
If you're going to be this garrulous, I shall have to ask you to be less familiar.
- Do you think I killed her?
- No.
No, but what I think is irrelevant.
He's the one you need to convince.
You're the authority on stories.
Tell me... what was it that got loose when Pandora opened the box?
- All the evils of the world.
- That's it.
Mm.
Madness, greed, shame.
Those guys.
My stepfather did pretty much the same thing when he took the cork out of that goddamn tomb.
And here you are, Poirot... kicking the contents all over town.
Did Lady Boynton...
harm you physically?
My mother had little recourse to violence.
She was too smart for that.
Instead, she just prised open the top of our skulls and raked her poisonous tongue through our brains.
No place to hide, Poirot.
Even in your own head.
Ever.
Carol, Carol grew up petrified, did her best to ingratiate herself, you know, to win approval, which she never got.
Jinny just... was terrified to the point of madness and possibly beyond.
(Child gasping and choking)
Did you murder your mother, monsieur?
No.
But only because I lacked the moral courage.
She was a monster, Poirot.
It was her pleasure, always, to watch us suffer.
Why was she driven to be so cruel?
- To punish us, I guess.
- For what offence?
For being someone else's kids.
It's true.
We were adopted.
All of us.
It is no crime against God or nature to be an orphan.
Oh, but it is, monsieur.
It is a hideous crime.
Lady Boynton - Mrs Pierce as she was then - she wanted to have children so badly.
But between her and Mr Pierce, they couldn't make it happen.
For Mom, adoption was the only route.
But once she'd assembled her family of which there were many candidates... (Raymond crying)
Don't!
It was an accident.
(Carol)... and rejected a great number... (Beating and child crying)
Yes, monsieur, there were many children who were presented to us as new siblings, only to be removed a day later...
- (Screaming)
- One child stayed longer than the others but the beatings went on, until she also disappeared.
So there we were, we lucky few.
Raymond, Carol and Jinny.
Je comprends pas.
Mademoiselle Jinny, she was not even born.
Who was this other child?
I don't know.
I can't remember.
Who was that little girl?
Unacceptable goods.
(Beating and child screaming)
(Knock on door)
Merci.
Who was the child that you beat, madame?
Can you tell it to Poirot?
Lesley.
Yes.
Lesley.
Can you tell to me about Lesley, Madame?
You had to beat her.
She needed to be punished.
I did what was required... of me.
(Screaming and crying)
I don't think we're sufficiently sorry.
Not by a long chalk.
Again, Nanny.
(Nanny) God, she was an evil woman.
And Lesley, madame?
What became of her?
She is alive?
Fa...
Fa...
Father!
I'm not your father, my dear.
But I'll do my best.
Can you get me that bag?
I'll do my best to make you comfortable.
All right?
Thank you.
Bog standard sedative.
Check it if you want, Poirot.
Come on.
There's a good girl.
Oh, Monsieur Cope.
Monsieur, do you have a moment?
- But of course.
- I, er...
I don't know if this has any relevance to, er... what's been going on, but... it seems I've lost quite a lot of money.
Monsieur Cope, je suis desolè.
No, no, that's OK.
What's of interest is that the stock that's gone down the pan is The Pierce Holding Company.
- Non.
- Yes.
Lady Boynton's outfit.
Fireproof, bombproof, the safest bet on Wall Street.
I myself invested substantially.
Seems that there's been this rumour about the true value of the company.
These things, they come and go.
Lady Boynton'd generally get up on her hind legs, tell everyone to sit up straight.
It'd all calm down.
But she wasn't there.
The rumour became a panic, then a stampede to get out.
The whole outfit's bust to hell.
The shares are worthless.
(Men shouting)
Oh God, here comes that ghastly little Belgian, wringing his hands like the cowman come to collect his Christmas box.
- He's being respectful, Father.
- He's being a damned nuisance.
Monsieur.
Come for a nightcap among the bereaved?
Non, merci, Lord Boynton, quand-même.
Oh for God's sake, sit down, Poirot, you're giving me indigestion, hovering like that.
Merci.
I suppose it is quite proper that I should be questioned.
I was on the spot at the time.
And I imagine I inherit my wife's estate, so...
And the estate of Lady Boynton.
Of what does this principally consist?
God knows.
I never had charge of the money.
Leonora just subbed the digging as it went along.
Do you know, Leonard?
Raymond would have a clearer idea of value but it must add up to a few quid.
You disagree, monsieur?
Since we have been in Syria, there has been the financial collapse catastrophique.
The Pierce Holding Company is utterly disintegrated.
It seems that the death of Lady Boynton was not enough.
It also seems that... she has been obliterated from the earth.
It may surprise you to know, Mr Poirot, that I am not unaware that Lady Boynton was not universally adored.
Like many women who know their own mind, she found it all too easy to make enemies.
She did not make an enemy of me.
I loved her.
I am not ashamed to say so to you or to my son.
Was it necessary to air that observation in quite that way?
The methods of Poirot, monsieur, cannot always be agrèable.
Mesdames.
Excusez-moi, Dame Celia.
Were you acquainted with Lady Boynton before encountering her at the tomb?
Well, I'd seen her about.
Where had you seen her, madame?
Lady Boynton was pointed out to me by a man at a party who then preceded to tell me rather a lot about her.
About the way, in particular, she treated her children.
I decided then that I had no wish to further acquaintance with the woman.
She sounded perfectly odious.
Who was this man that was so well-informed?
I didn't get his name.
I wanted her dead, too.
Just in case you were wondering.
She was clearly blocking my way.
Raymond couldn't even look me in the eye with her still in existence.
So do you commend yourself to me as a suspect, mademoiselle?
I commend myself to you as one who has recently invested a great deal of time in a relationship that was always heading nowhere.
I now know that when I find something I want, I must act to take it.
(Celia) Bravo!
Sadly, all this resolution has taken your mind off the game.
Little trick I learnt the other day in Vienna.
You see?
Just when you least expect it, the church comes storming back.
Checkmate.
I didn't know you smoked.
I don't.
I've given up.
Since you threw the cigarette away, you've given up?
Your determination is impressive.
All six seconds of it.
Keep talking, I could go ten.
If I hadn't spoken, would you just have kept watching me?
We'll never know.
You're a strange man.
Does that matter?
Not necessarily.
- Raymond.
- Yeah.
Now is the time to kiss me.
Yeah.
(Speaks Arabic) Anybody in here who isn't dead?
(Agnieszka praying)
(Continues praying)
(Footsteps)
(Stops abruptly)
(Agnieszka resumes)
(Men shouting)
They have him, by God!
They have found the head of John!
News that is astonishing, monsieur.
I must return to Ain Musa immediately.
Is there a problem?
Nanny Taylor has drowned herself in the bath.
- Suicide.
- Oh, my God.
That's awful news.
Is somebody... dealing with it?
Oui, monsieur.
Because I must...
I must get back to the dig, I can't...
you know.
Oui.
Moral of the story:
If you want your death to attract the concern of your employer, make sure you're 2,000 years old.
Oh!
I keep meaning to give you something.
It's the details of the immigration you needed.
And on the back there's a list of employees.
Merci.
As requested, I've had a word with Mahmoud.
Some of his boys are privately saying that there was some character lurking about on the ladder that afternoon.
An Arab.
Not one of them.
But that was a good hour or so before the time of death.
This case is a mess, Poirot.
Not so, mon ami.
This case...
When Poirot has almost given up scrabbling for purchase on its shell of armour... boff... it opens to him like a flower.
Good Lord.
So...
What do we do?
We do what the murderer least expects Poirot to do.
We return to the dig.
All of us.
(Chattering)
(Carbury) Ahem!
This case, mes amis, it is full of the red... fish.
(Gerard) Herrings, possibly?
Merci.
There's so many diversions, so many distractions.
Attend well to Poirot as he peels them away like the skin of an onion.
Herrings, onions, do get a wriggle on, there's a good fellow.
Your wife, she funded your expeditions as you went along.
How much more efficient it would be to have the money all at once, non?
- What?
- There is no money.
Non, vraiment monsieur, for you there never has been.
For the running of Boynton Hall, alors, is for you always most arduous.
Lady Boynton, she was always most munificent to your father but never towards his son.
You can stare at me significantly as long as you like, monsieur.
I've done nothing wrong.
Tell to Poirot what was in the bag.
What bag?
What did you agree to purchase from the ragged Arab boy?
I remember the boy, I don't remember what rubbish he was flogging.
Fortunately, Poirot, he does.
And from it he extracted... this.
- Voilà.
- Voilà what?
Well, it's a tooth.
(Poirot) D'être precis, it is a molar taken from the upper jaw of St John.
You will observe that it bears the traces of the filling of gold.
For this skull it was supposed to masquerade as the skull of John the Baptist.
But in fact it is as you say, Monsieur Leonard, rubbish.
What the devil are you talking about, man?
This wasn't purchased from a hawker and planted.
This is untouched.
This entire sample was exhumed e situ intacto.
Forgive me, Poirot, but you're drivelling utter bilge, pompous little Belgian.
As my father has explained, this object was discovered undisturbed.
It's a perfect fit.
I don't understand.
All your life, Father, traipsing about the Middle East... time after time finding absolutely nothing of significance.
I wanted it to end.
You dear, deluded, stupid man.
I never expected your wife's bloody money.
I never wanted it.
I wanted you to be free of this need.
To find what you've been looking for.
Do you mind if I step out for a while?
- I'll come with you.
- No, no.
I simply wish to be alone for a moment.
Is that permitted?
Je vous en prie, monsieur.
Now the three of you.
The litany of cruelties you have endured.
The ceaseless humiliations.
(Beating, child screaming)
You multiply these incidents by hundreds and thousands.
The corrosion of the spirit, it is inevitable and insupportable.
(Child sobbing)
No wonder you wished to see Lady Boynton dead.
Indeed Poirot, he overheard you, Mademoiselle Carol, and you, Monsieur Raymond, whispering that your mother... must die.
And you, Dr King...
By your own admission, you also wished to see her dead.
You are a woman who has wasted time and is determined to waste no more.
What do we know of you, Monsieur Cope?
Me?
Will you show to me your passport?
Merci.
You choose to use your second Christian name and not your first?
- Yes.
- Why is that, I wonder?
My first given name is ambiguous, in terms of gender.
The spelling is different but it's also a girl's name.
As a child I found that tiresome.
I suggest that there are many things about your childhood that you found...
"tiresome",
Monsieur Leslie...
Jefferson Cope.
(Child crying and screaming)
I don't think we're sufficiently sorry.
The child that was thrashed... so brutally, on the orders of Lady Boynton, was not a girl, as misremembered by her daughter Carol, non... but a boy... by the name of Leslie.
If you know all that, you'll also know that I didn't kill her.
Merely to deprive her of her life would afford for you satisfaction most scant.
No, you wanted to make her life unbearable.
To degrade her, to hurt the woman, as she hurt you.
Lady Boynton was a person preoccupied with station and money and you decided to strip her of them both.
So I may remain assured of your very best services?
(Poirot) Of what service in particular did you wish to remain assured?
You have no newspapers of any description?
!
I am so sorry.
(Poirot) The withholding from Lady Boynton of the newspapers... that would keep her ignorant of the panic that you yourself had inspired to ensure the destruction of her empire.
I'm just lousy at being intrepid.
Back at the hotel you couldn't get a paper for love nor money.
And like the confidence trickster so accomplished, you invested in your own deceit.
You wrote off thousands of dollars of your own savings, merely to blow smoke in the face of Poirot!
Oh, Monsieur Cope.
It seems I've lost quite a lot of money.
Alors, Poirot has one more red herring left to fry.
And it is a fish most substantial.
Le Colonel, mes amis, he is not a policeman but is retained by the Foreign Office.
His mission in Syria was to uncover and destroy the trafficking of female slaves.
The abduction and sale of women for one purpose only.
- Pardonnez-moi, mesdames.
- I knew it!
Arab women.
Whatever the client ordered.
- White women?
- Yes.
They wanted... me?
Helas, mademoiselle.
It is the opinion of Poirot... that there is a person who instructed his agent to search for a young lady who is Caucasian and resembled you.
Exactement.
With your skin that is pale and your hair that is red.
Who is this agent, Poirot?
Is he here amongst us now?
Certainement!
Mademoiselle Jinny, when you struck at your attacker that night, you hit your target.
It's OK.
The woman who befriended you so assiduously... it was she who was smothering your face!
Sister Agnieszka!
Rot in hell!
You, Sister, will face the consequences.
The key... to the murder of Lady Boynton... it is not who, it is when.
Dame Celia, do you have any children?
No, I do not.
I urge you to reconsider your answer, madame.
I cannot reconsider.
I have no children.
Madame, you are a liar.
You have a daughter and she is amongst us now.
That is a filthy lie.
And in extremely poor taste.
So you disown her now, as you did when she was a baby?
Reclaim her of your own volition!
You owe to her a debt of ungiven love!
I had no choice.
No choice.
What was your position in the household of Lady Boynton?
In the days when she was Mrs Pierce?
Hm?
- A junior maid.
- Oui, c'est ça.
The servant of the lowest position whose duty it is to scrub.
Not to become pregnant by a guest of your employer.
The woman to whom you surrendered your child on the day of its birth.
Is it me?
Non, mademoiselle Carol.
It is not you.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.
You gave birth to me?
And delivered me up to that bitch?
I came... to save you.
How did you know this?
Mademoiselle, Poirot he did not know for certain.
Until this... very moment.
Non, non, non, mademoiselle.
Mon Colonel, Poirot he is much obliged to you for the accounts of the household and the registry of immigration which shows that three weeks after the baby was born,
Celia Westholme arrived on the coast of Ireland, to be taken care of by nuns.
Your child, she had been taken from you, and so you were now to become invisible, to nurse your shame.
But you were not to be the outcast.
Oh, no.
You were to recreate yourself as a free spirit.
A writer, a traveller.
A success.
Dame Celia Westholme.
And every time you thought of your daughter, you consoled yourself with the hope that she was happy but she had not begun life afresh, she was not happy.
She remained as a prisoner in the household of Lady Boynton.
(Water splashing)
(Child choking)
And your regret, it came flooding back... to boil in your heart.
Let me tell you a story.
This... is the legend of Gilgamesh.
Gilgamesh was the most beautiful man in all creation.
So you went in search of the father of your child, to Vienna, so out of the way of your customary travels, and together with this man, you agreed... to investigate to see whether the cruelties of Lady Boynton they were true.
And you discovered that all of the children had been tormented.
It was not the hornet that stung Lady Boynton.
How could it?
- Sorry, might have been stung.
- Ah!
The hornet, it was already dead!
You stung her... with this...
(Lady Boynton) Ah!
(Poirot)... which you then returned to Dr Gerard, who had prepared it for you.
(Lady Boynton) I am stung!
He then cleaned it and discarded it in the tent of Nanny Taylor, to implicate her.
(Scoffs) This is... colossal!
Wh-What was in the syringe?
A concoction of your own devising, Doctor, probably based on morphia.
You can't kill a woman the size of La Boynton with a thimbleful of morphia.
As you well know.
Doctor, you affect to know little of the administering of drugs, when en effet you are the expert.
You greet Poirot and ask him if he remembers you from Edinburgh.
The "bonce doctor," huh, with a beard?
Poirot, he remembers everything.
When you took the witness stand in Edinburgh to speak on the mind, the clerk of the court, he read out your qualifications.
Anaesthesia, Doctor, was your discipline, long before psychiatry.
No, of course you cannot kill Lady Boynton with such a dose, but you can remove from her control of the nervous system.
The power over her movement.
The power over her speech.
And Lady Boynton, who professed herself a lover of the sun... was now roasting to death and could say nothing.
Ingenious, monsieur, and commendably grotesque.
But Lady Boynton did not "roast to death".
She was stabbed.
Your prestidigitation with drugs, Doctor, was not over yet.
You injected yourself to simulate the symptoms of malaria.
Symptoms so authentic that you fooled even Dr King.
- I'll be fine!
- This gentleman needs to return to camp.
Mademoiselle Jinny, she attended you.
And how did you repay her for her kindness?
By giving to her another sedative of your own invention, to consolidate your alibi.
Earlier, you had killed a goat and trapped a quantity of its blood in a ball of wax.
This object you secreted in the folds of the clothes of your victim, where in due course it would melt in the heat of the sun.
One can never have enough sun, huh?
- (She whimpers)
- What?
You could have killed her then, but you wanted her to suffer for as long as possible.
Speak up, dear.
I can't help you if you don't speak up.
You used the ball of wax to confuse the time of death, and it was this wax that Poirot, he discovered on the dress of Lady Boynton, and on the floorboards and the little piece of pottery beneath her chair.
Wax which told to Poirot that there was an accomplice to the murder.
Et puis, you waited patiently.
The wax, it melted, the blood of the goat it began to flow, suggesting to the naked eye that she had already been stabbed.
And at last the cry it went up to tell the world... (Greville) Help!
...that Lady Boynton was dead, but she was not dead.
Non, not yet.
- Are you the girl who's a doctor?
- Yes.
Then you've met death.
So have I. Come on.
Only now...
was Death to meet its victim.
And in the sight of everyone, in the sight of Hercule Poirot himself... you, Dame Celia, murdered Lady Boynton with your own hands, as prescribed by Dr Gerard to quench your rage.
It took but a few seconds.
Even Dr King was deceived into believing that Lady Boynton had died earlier that day.
If you please to empty the contents of your handbag.
(Poirot) Ha.
Ah, oui.
And Dr Gerard, he encouraged Poirot to seek for the chisel.
Chisel fits the bill.
Whereas the murder weapon it was in your hand all of the day.
Goodness.
We did go to considerable trouble.
One question - what makes you think any of this has any basis whatsoever in the truth?
Nanny Taylor.
Dear God!
Did I kill her as well or was she one of yours?
You disordered her mind with a solution of mescaline so strong that the very speck of it made the head of Poirot to spin.
You wanted to promote in her hallucinations to make her susceptible to suggestion.
You burdened her mind with so much shame and guilt that given the opportunity you knew that she would do harm to herself.
You know you can't go on... after everything that you did.
Think what you helped her do to little Jinny.
(Child choking)
What did Nanny Taylor say to you?
Fa...
Fa...
Father!
This was not the ravings of a nervous breakdown.
For you yourself had told to her... that you were the father of Mademoiselle Jinny.
Portrait of Mum and Dad.
You'll appreciate now why I declined your particular offer of affection.
(Sighs) Well, well.
This is a pickle.
We set out to save you and destroyed everything.
- Thank you, Theo.
- It's all part of the service.
No extra charge.
I never stopped loving you, you know.
Be careful with this one, Poirot.
Digitalis.
The action, as you will appreciate, is irreversible.
I'm so sorry.
We hoped it wouldn't come to this.
(Gasps)
There, there, there.
There, there.
There.
(Gasps) No.
Don't, Doctor.
(Grunts) Look to the living.
They pay their bills quicker and they make better... conversation.
(lnhales)
(Jinny sobbing)
Monsieur.
I've just been chatting to Lord Boynton.
He pronounces himself "cured of archaeology".
- "Chatting."
- Oui.
Monsieur Raymond, in the matter of Pandora, you will recall that after all the evils had escaped the box, there was one other creature very small, very frail, that followed them into the world.
Hope.
Au revoir, la jeunesse.
- Monsieur Poirot.
- Mademoiselle.
Carol and I are going to Egypt, to see the Sphinx.
It's not much of an adventure, but we're doing it on our own.
It's a start.
It was actually my idea.
Lady Boynton would've said I was constitutionally too feeble, that my skin was too fair but I think it's probably time I showed my feeble skin who's boss.
C'est bien, mademoiselle.
Before he leaves, you will permit an old man to pontificate.
Alors, mademoiselle, there is nothing in the world so damaged that it cannot be repaired by the hand of Almighty God.
I encourage you to know this because without this certainty, we should all of us... be mad.
Je vous salue, mademoiselle.
Au revoir.
APPOINTMENT WITH DEATH Series 11 Episode 4
Lord Boynton!
Lord Boynton!
Hey!
(Shouting in Arabic)
Quoi?
!
Don't...
Don't speak.
Why not?
You've got sunstroke, you need to stay where you are, be quite still.
Actually what I need to do is sit, I think, and drink a lot of water.
Shukran.
I'm dehydrated.
I've sent for a doctor.
Already got one.
Sarah King, MD.
You're the fellow who's going to get sunstroke, walking around without a hat.
I just introduced myself.
- (Woman) Raymond.
- Ah, my-my mother needs me.
If you can't introduce yourself, perhaps you might introduce me to your mother?
Unlikely.
- The au citron, s'il vous plaît.
- Oui, monsieur.
- Chaud, tres chaud.
- Oui.
Alas, madame, I am desolate.
You have no newspapers of any description?
!
I am so sorry.
(Woman) You don't know what sorry is!
Got you, you double-distilled blighter!
Colonel Carbury, mon vieux.
Poirot.
All these years travelling, you'd think I'd be used to creepy-crawlies by now.
I did not know that you were the enthusiast for I'antiquite.
For what?
You have come also for the exploration of Lord Boynton?
Ah, no, no.
Passing through.
Vraiment?
To where do you pass, Colonel?
Here and there.
You know, here and then...
You know.
- There?
- Or thereabouts.
Absolutely.
(American accent) So I may remain assured of your very best services?
Thank you very much, sir.
Americans.
Do know how to arrive, hm?
(Man) Silly little man!
- Please!
- Look here...
- Do you know who I am?
- (Protesting in Arabic) Pay fare!
I am the son of Lord Boynton.
Son of Lord, you pay, please.
Thank you, sir.
(Speaks Arabic)
Bloody shambles!
Typical.
If you...
- (Snores) - (Sighs)
(Chatter)
Ah, excellent.
There you are.
It's Leonard.
Boynton.
Your stepson.
How good of you to come, Mr Boynton.
- Carol, my vitamins.
- Now, Mother?
Clearly.
Jinny, you look like you're suffering from consumption.
That's drawing attention to yourself in the most unattractive way.
Apply colour!
Raymond...
Don't sit there, sit here.
Nanny...
Go somewhere else.
You look tired, dear.
We need to discuss your attitude.
Sulking is like shyness.
It is unacceptable, it is showing off.
I'm not sulking, Mother.
I merely question the wisdom of travelling when the market is jittery.
Wall Street knows better than to breathe without consulting me, wherever I may be at whatever juncture.
I forgot my book.
Fetch my book.
You think they're a rum crew, wait till you meet the archaeologist husband.
Although he's not actually psychotic, just old-fashioned bonkers.
Theodore Gerard.
We have met.
Bonce doctor.
I advised on a case in Edinburgh.
Used to have a beard?
Oh.
Yes, of course.
The bonce doctor!
- I recognise you, monsieur.
- Of course, it's all a sham.
The real object of the exercise...
is a reconciliation of his offspring and hers.
- Happy families among the tombs.
- There is disharmony?
Where Lady Boynton is, the Music of the Spheres is like nails down a blackboard.
Now, you must excuse me my personal disorder...
Can't help sticking my face down the stupid lion's throat.
Do you mind if I join you?
(Sighs)
I can't find these wretched pills.
Oh God, Raymond.
She has them.
What?
She has them already, they're in her bag.
The book she sent me to find, she didn't even bring to Syria.
Carol, we know these games.
One day, Raymond...
I swear to God...
- I know.
- I will take a hammer and I swear...
Maybe we should talk about that.
- Don't joke with me, Ray.
- I'm your brother.
I never joke.
(Call to prayer)
(Raymond) The way we let that woman steal them from us.
(Carol) Oh, God, Raymond.
We have no choice.
(Raymond) She has to die.
(Traders calling out)
Now, we're going now!
Please!
Please!
Yes, sir.
Please, please, please.
Tickety-boo.
Please.
This way.
OK, OK.
(Speaking Arabic)
Whoo!
Looks like Lord Boynton's expedition has created quite a stir.
Apart from the family and a three-line whip...
Dr King joins us, I suspect, because she stuck a pin in a map of the world.
Mr Jefferson Cope may actually be a little bit dull.
He might possibly like old bits of bone and pot and whatnot.
The honourable Leonard, stuck with running his father's house in Dorset, on no income, while said father swans around the Middle East looking for the head of John the Baptist.
As for the Polish nun, she gives me the heebie-jeebies personally.
(Shouting in Arabic)
No problem, no problem.
Don't be afraid.
No problem.
(Shouting in Arabic)
No problem, no problem.
(Speaking Arabic)
(Camel grunts)
Hm.
What have we here, I wonder?
A mobile toll-booth?
Dame Celia Westholme.
Sorry to hold up the bus, everybody.
Camel's on loan, had to go back.
Has Boynton made any significant progress?
Does anybody know?
- Have you read any of her books?
- Oui.
It's her fault I'm here.
She makes travel sound so thrilling.
Ah.
(Shouting in Arabic)
Welcome, welcome, welcome.
Did you have a nice journey?
I know, it's ghastly, isn't it?
Hello, little blossoms.
Hot showers and cold beer for everyone.
Even you, Nanny, you raving old dipsomaniac.
- Leonard, dear boy!
- Father.
Ah.
My child bride.
Dinner's in the pavilion at eight.
Everyone's invited.
Come along!
Raymond.
Utter bonanza of crippled personalities.
I'd have paid extra for this.
(Distant shouting)
(Operatic singing on radio)
Making yourself useful, Leonard?
Good man!
Coming along!
That blind chap down in the Arab camp, every night I hear him tell a variation on the same story.
I've heard it all over Syria.
The daughter of Herodius brought John the Baptist's severed head to this land.
She buried it where the river meets the mountain.
Now, I've been every damn place in Syria where any river meets anything that could possibly be construed as a mountain, from Krak to Aleppo.
This is the only place left.
It has to be here!
Come along then.
Chop-chop.
Ah...
And these words...
Do they speak of John?
No.
It tells a different story.
A man is sitting in a tavern in Damascus.
He looks up from his wine and sees Death staring at him across the room.
He cries out, "But this cannot be my time!"
He flees Damascus, he rides his horse fast, right across the desert to Samarra.
When he arrives, he's thirsty.
Standing before him at the well... is Death.
Hm.
You're nodding.
On seeing Death for the second time, the man cries out, "This cannot be!
"For I escaped you in Damascus."
And Death, he lays his hand upon the shoulder of the man and says, "I also was surprised to see you..."
"...to see you in Damascus...
"for my appointment with you, it was always to be here in Samarra."
Try as one might, one cannot escape one's rightful destiny.
Oui.
I know you're here, Johnny.
I can almost smell you.
Sugar, Raymond?
To put sugar in one's tea is indicative of weak character.
Raymond doesn't take sugar.
Oh, good morning.
You look dreadful.
- Thank you.
I feel dreadful.
- You should see a doctor.
- I just did.
He told me I had malaria.
- Oh, Lord!
I dosed myself up, as much as it makes a difference.
You shan't come on the expedition today?
If I have an attack on the way to the river,
I'll most probably die.
The obvious solution is to remain here all day with Lady Boynton.
- Better come with us.
- Not a difficult decision.
The sun is up.
I shall spend today observing from the platform.
Good idea, poppet.
Cracking view of the Kasbah.
You can keep a beady one on Leonard and myself.
You assist with the digging, monsieur?
Oh, I would assist with digging the drains if the alternative were enforced social intercourse with my father's ghastly ten-ton wife.
- (Slap)
- Sorry, might have stung.
Ah!
I am stung!
Yes, there's the bugger there.
Goodness, let me look at you.
Don't touch me!
Never touch me!
You're always looking at me.
Golly, am I?
All the time.
I turn round and you're just looking at me.
Why?
Perhaps I like the shape of your face.
It's a very pretty face.
Do you mind?
I certainly shan't do it if you mind.
I don't mind.
(Poirot) S'il vous plaît, Monsieur Cope.
Do not allow Poirot to detain you.
Oh, I'm in no hurry.
The place has been there a few years, it's not going anywhere,
You are acquainted with the family Boynton?
One can't live in New York and fail to be acquainted with the Boyntons.
Lady B is a pretty big financial noise.
I like her.
If I may say so, monsieur, it would appear that your amitie is not reciprocated.
Oh, she hates everybody.
Everybody knows that, she just doesn't give a damn.
- I think it's quite stylish.
- You have the outlook most benevolent.
I'm easily pleased.
Ladies and gentlemen, now we may rest.
We have arrived. (Speaks Arabic)
(Agnieszka) God is good.
God is glorious.
If you want my professional opinion, which you don't, but you should, so I'm gonna give it to you anyway, your family would do well to hear what Herr Freud said to me last year.
"To be American is bad enough," he said, "but to put money..."
(Mutters)
Oh!
Let me look at you.
I'll be fine.
I'll be... fine.
This gentleman needs to return to camp immediately.
Get your hands off me, I'll be fine!
Doctors!
Think you know everything?
(Sarah) You're too hot.
(Gerard) You don't have to... carry me.
- Jinny!
- That's my name!
(Gerard) I just need a drink of water.
I can hear the gears grinding in the old cerebellum.
Not really.
I was just wondering how Lady Boynton managed to negotiate that ladder affair, it's pretty vertiginous.
Would it kill you to call her "Mother"?
For me.
Stepmother would do.
(Leonard) God, it's hot.
Yes, it is.
Perhaps you would be kind enough to take the lady in question a glass of water.
Father, look, I'm sorry, but are you genuinely blind to the way she treats... everyone, except you?
Now!
I say!
Would you like a drink?
Can we get you anything at all?
To drink?
(Quietly) Like a bucket of strychnine.
Get these buggers away from me!
I'm perfectly well.
Lie down.
- Ah...
- Doctor, what do we do?
What did he say?
He said bugger off.
Oh. (Chuckles) Right you are.
Can do.
Not you.
You stay.
- No, Jinny.
- Oh, God.
I thought...
- Yeah.
- I thought you wanted my company.
I do, yes.
That's exactly what I want.
Listen to me, it's not... you.
It's not about a conquest.
For me, denial... is a very... particular pleasure.
It's not... (Sighs)
(Music on gramophone)
People say travel broadens the mind.
Mainly because people like me insist on it in their books.
But I have to say I doubt that it is true.
On the contrary.
I suspect travel narrows the mind.
One becomes so blase about the wonders of the world.
The more I travel the more clearly I understand that... all that ever matters is the people.
Not the places.
This, it's pretty enough, but show me the humans every time.
Poirot!
How did you find the river?
- Oh, I...
- Good, good.
We haven't turned up any glories here, but we live in hope.
Nil carborundum, and all that.
And Lady Boynton, she has enjoyed her day?
Oh, yes, monsieur.
Of course, she always does.
The word "boredom" is simply not in the vocab.
Darling!
I think it's time you climbed down from your perch for a martini.
Poppet?
Shall we say about ten minutes?
You little minx. (Chuckles)
(Sighs)
(Greville) Help!
Help!
Et alors.
Ça commence.
(Greville) Help!
(Commotion outside)
- Are you the girl who's a doctor?
- Yes.
Then you've met death.
So have I. Come on.
Shut her eyes.
Shut them.
I'm afraid it's true.
She's dead.
Your appointment with death, madame.
It was always to be here.
What happened here?
Excusez-moi, but do you commission me to examine this case?
I do.
You two getting married or something?
Mind if I have a gander at your patient?
- Are you recovered, Doctor?
- I'll manage.
Juicy big hole where there shouldn't be one.
Somebody's stuck her.
- Mm, a knife.
- Bigger than a knife.
Fatter blade.
- Chisel?
- Chisel fits the bill.
Whatever the implement, it was wielded with authority.
One blow in, then vigorously churned about to create maximum damage.
She can't have been dead for more than an hour.
Yes.
I don't know why that should be there.
It is wax.
Well, one thing's for certain.
She can't stay here in this heat.
I'll make arrangements for the body to be transported.
(Celia reading in Arabic)
Dame Celia.
Lord Boynton.
What is it that you read?
I'm cheering the bereaved with judicious extracts from The Perfumed Garden.
Are people saying that I killed my wife?
Non.
Non, monsieur.
We are all united in our desire to comfort you.
I was always glad that I was older than Leonora.
I thought at least...
I'll die first.
I won't have the agony of trying to live without her.
How did you achieve your newspaper, Monsieur Cope?
Came with me.
Many thanks.
I'm just lousy at being intrepid.
Always so hungry for news of home.
Back at the hotel you couldn't get a paper for love nor money.
(Gerard) I know.
This may help you in times of stress.
Mon Colonel.
Your men.
When is it that they arrive?
- Midnight, I should think.
- Hm.
Then you must have them search this area at dawn.
The search most diligent.
All around.
Looking for what?
In the first place, mon ami, a syringe.
It is instrumental in the murder of Lady Boynton.
Right.
Good grief.
- It will be done.
- Bon.
You see, mon ami... the voices of the little grey cells.
They have begun to sing to Poirot.
(Chanting prayers)
I should like for you to tell me if you spoke to your stepmother yesterday afternoon,
- and if so, when?
- Er, we spoke... about one o'clock, hottest part of the day.
Bon.
She'd been perched up there like some evil great pudding ever since you lot set off.
I say we spoke.
I spoke.
Can we get you anything at all?
To drink?
You know how it was.
One mustn't disturb her when she was taking the sun, but...
God help you if you neglected to do so.
- Monsieur.
- Oui.
- We found this syringe.
- Ah.
- Where was this discovered?
- In the tent occupied by the old lady.
The nanny.
Merci.
(Agnieszka) "And the Lord said unto the servant:
"Go out into the highways and compel them to come in to my feast..."
(Jinny) "...that my house may be filled."
It's a beautiful parable.
(Agnieszka) The word King James renders as "compel"
is in the Greek "anankadzo".
It means compel with violence.
The Spanish knew this.
They used this single word to justify every atrocity of their Inquisition.
For it is God's own command that those unwilling to enter His Kingdom should be persuaded in with pain.
That's terrible.
Compulsion of any kind, my dear.
It can be terrible.
(Jinny) I overheard my stepfather telling the story that was written here.
Of Death following the man across the desert.
Something has followed me here to this place.
Something evil.
God is here to guard you, Jinny.
He lives in every grain of sand.
(Man speaking in Arabic)
(Other men chant reply)
(Water splashing, child gasping)
(Music playing faintly on gramophone)
(Carbury) What is it now?
(Music stops)
Sorry gentlemen.
Sand in the grooves.
Quite.
Well, the Arabs are all accounted for.
Oui.
This case, it is most unsatisfactory.
Still plenty of suspects, old boy.
But almost all of them were outside of the camp when the murder it was committed.
And this is corroborated by a witness who is impeccable.
Me.
They were with Poirot all of the time.
Raymond wasn't.
He came back.
Bien sűr.
Cela je connais bien.
Oui.
Also Lord Boynton and his son.
Yes, yes, and tomorrow we begin the further interrogations.
That's a queer one.
Without doubt there is more to Monsieur Cope than he wishes to be known.
But in that desire, and in this company...
he is not unique.
(Woman screams)
(Overlapping voices)
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.
(Men shouting in Arabic)
Did you see anyone moving?
No.
Where did it come from?
It's got to be something.
(Jinny gasping)
(Carbury) Good Lord.
Get her inside, quickly!
(Carol) It's OK.
(Carbury) You men, over here.
Close all the exits!
Don't let anyone leave.
Sister Agnieszka!
Ohh...
- (Sobbing) - (Carol) It's OK.
It's OK.
It's OK.
Shh.
It's OK.
Everything's going to be OK.
Shh, shh.
Can I help?
(Agnieszka muttering)
It would be useful to know what she was trying to tell us.
She's not trying to tell us anything.
She's talking to God.
Shouldn't we be getting her back to the hotel?
- Ask Dr King.
- You're the senior physician here.
You're much prettier and you're handler with the cutlery.
Besides, the nun is your patient.
I've got my hands full with the loony nanny.
Well, this, what I've done, it's only temporary.
So yes, we should.
It would be helpful to Poirot for all of us to return.
- Ei veniam da.
- That's Latin.
"Forgive him"?
Poirot has little Latin, but it can also be, I think, "Forgive her".
- My men can track...
- Non, non...
There is no need to despatch your men, Colonel.
The assailant of Sister Agnieszka has not fled.
There was a man...
He followed me across the desert.
I woke up and... he was putting a bag over my head.
Slaver.
Bound to be.
I threw myself on the floor to get away.
When I looked up, I saw...
You saw Sister Agnieszka struggling with your attacker and...
Well, you tried to help her, and...
you struck at the man with what?
A rock.
Bon.
And in your terror, and in the dark, accidentally you struck your friend and protector.
Now, you try to get some sleep, if you can.
Because tomorrow we face the rigours of the return journey.
Come close, Jinny.
Let me tell you a story.
This... is the legend of Gilgamesh.
Will she be all right?
The nun?
Oh, God knows.
Will you?
I'm not wounded.
That's debatable.
Seems to be consensus that you killed your mother.
(Scoffs) Is that your view, Sarah?
Heavens.
Five consecutive words, culminating in my Christian name.
If you're going to be this garrulous, I shall have to ask you to be less familiar.
- Do you think I killed her?
- No.
No, but what I think is irrelevant.
He's the one you need to convince.
You're the authority on stories.
Tell me... what was it that got loose when Pandora opened the box?
- All the evils of the world.
- That's it.
Mm.
Madness, greed, shame.
Those guys.
My stepfather did pretty much the same thing when he took the cork out of that goddamn tomb.
And here you are, Poirot... kicking the contents all over town.
Did Lady Boynton...
harm you physically?
My mother had little recourse to violence.
She was too smart for that.
Instead, she just prised open the top of our skulls and raked her poisonous tongue through our brains.
No place to hide, Poirot.
Even in your own head.
Ever.
Carol, Carol grew up petrified, did her best to ingratiate herself, you know, to win approval, which she never got.
Jinny just... was terrified to the point of madness and possibly beyond.
(Child gasping and choking)
Did you murder your mother, monsieur?
No.
But only because I lacked the moral courage.
She was a monster, Poirot.
It was her pleasure, always, to watch us suffer.
Why was she driven to be so cruel?
- To punish us, I guess.
- For what offence?
For being someone else's kids.
It's true.
We were adopted.
All of us.
It is no crime against God or nature to be an orphan.
Oh, but it is, monsieur.
It is a hideous crime.
Lady Boynton - Mrs Pierce as she was then - she wanted to have children so badly.
But between her and Mr Pierce, they couldn't make it happen.
For Mom, adoption was the only route.
But once she'd assembled her family of which there were many candidates... (Raymond crying)
Don't!
It was an accident.
(Carol)... and rejected a great number... (Beating and child crying)
Yes, monsieur, there were many children who were presented to us as new siblings, only to be removed a day later...
- (Screaming)
- One child stayed longer than the others but the beatings went on, until she also disappeared.
So there we were, we lucky few.
Raymond, Carol and Jinny.
Je comprends pas.
Mademoiselle Jinny, she was not even born.
Who was this other child?
I don't know.
I can't remember.
Who was that little girl?
Unacceptable goods.
(Beating and child screaming)
(Knock on door)
Who was the child that you beat, madame?
Can you tell it to Poirot?
Lesley.
Yes.
Lesley.
Can you tell to me about Lesley, Madame?
You had to beat her.
She needed to be punished.
I did what was required... of me.
(Screaming and crying)
I don't think we're sufficiently sorry.
Not by a long chalk.
Again, Nanny.
(Nanny) God, she was an evil woman.
And Lesley, madame?
What became of her?
She is alive?
Fa...
Fa...
Father!
I'm not your father, my dear.
But I'll do my best.
Can you get me that bag?
I'll do my best to make you comfortable.
All right?
Thank you.
Bog standard sedative.
Check it if you want, Poirot.
Come on.
There's a good girl.
Oh, Monsieur Cope.
Monsieur, do you have a moment?
- But of course.
- I, er...
I don't know if this has any relevance to, er... what's been going on, but... it seems I've lost quite a lot of money.
Monsieur Cope, je suis desole.
No, no, that's OK.
What's of interest is that the stock that's gone down the pan is The Pierce Holding Company.
- Non.
- Yes.
Lady Boynton's outfit.
Fireproof, bombproof, the safest bet on Wall Street.
I myself invested substantially.
Seems that there's been this rumour about the true value of the company.
These things, they come and go.
Lady Boynton'd generally get up on her hind legs, tell everyone to sit up straight.
It'd all calm down.
But she wasn't there.
The rumour became a panic, then a stampede to get out.
The whole outfit's bust to hell.
The shares are worthless.
(Men shouting)
Oh God, here comes that ghastly little Belgian, wringing his hands like the cowman come to collect his Christmas box.
- He's being respectful, Father.
- He's being a damned nuisance.
Monsieur.
Come for a nightcap among the bereaved?
Non, merci, Lord Boynton, quand-męme.
Oh for God's sake, sit down, Poirot, you're giving me indigestion, hovering like that.
Merci.
I suppose it is quite proper that I should be questioned.
I was on the spot at the time.
And I imagine I inherit my wife's estate, so...
And the estate of Lady Boynton.
Of what does this principally consist?
God knows.
I never had charge of the money.
Leonora just subbed the digging as it went along.
Do you know, Leonard?
Raymond would have a clearer idea of value but it must add up to a few quid.
You disagree, monsieur?
Since we have been in Syria, there has been the financial collapse catastrophique.
The Pierce Holding Company is utterly disintegrated.
It seems that the death of Lady Boynton was not enough.
It also seems that... she has been obliterated from the earth.
It may surprise you to know, Mr Poirot, that I am not unaware that Lady Boynton was not universally adored.
Like many women who know their own mind, she found it all too easy to make enemies.
She did not make an enemy of me.
I loved her.
I am not ashamed to say so to you or to my son.
Was it necessary to air that observation in quite that way?
The methods of Poirot, monsieur, cannot always be agreable.
Mesdames.
Excusez-moi, Dame Celia.
Were you acquainted with Lady Boynton before encountering her at the tomb?
Well, I'd seen her about.
Where had you seen her, madame?
Lady Boynton was pointed out to me by a man at a party who then preceded to tell me rather a lot about her.
About the way, in particular, she treated her children.
I decided then that I had no wish to further acquaintance with the woman.
She sounded perfectly odious.
Who was this man that was so well-informed?
I didn't get his name.
I wanted her dead, too.
Just in case you were wondering.
She was clearly blocking my way.
Raymond couldn't even look me in the eye with her still in existence.
So do you commend yourself to me as a suspect, mademoiselle?
I commend myself to you as one who has recently invested a great deal of time in a relationship that was always heading nowhere.
(Celia) Bravo!
Sadly, all this resolution has taken your mind off the game.
Little trick I learnt the other day in Vienna.
You see?
Just when you least expect it, the church comes storming back.
Checkmate.
(Speaks Arabic) Anybody in here who isn't dead?
(Agnieszka praying)
They have him, by God!
They have found the head of John!
News that is astonishing, monsieur.
I must return to Ain Musa immediately.
Is there a problem?
Nanny Taylor has drowned herself in the bath.
- Suicide.
- Oh, my God.
That's awful news.
Is somebody... dealing with it?
Oui, monsieur.
Because I must...
I must get back to the dig, I can't...
you know.
Oui.
Moral of the story:
If you want your death to attract the concern of your employer, make sure you're 2,000 years old.
Oh!
I keep meaning to give you something.
It's the details of the immigration you needed.
And on the back there's a list of employees.
Merci.
As requested, I've had a word with Mahmoud.
Some of his boys are privately saying that there was some character lurking about on the ladder that afternoon.
An Arab.
Not one of them.
But that was a good hour or so before the time of death.
This case is a mess, Poirot.
Not so, mon ami.
This case...
When Poirot has almost given up scrabbling for purchase on its shell of armour... boff... it opens to him like a flower.
Good Lord.
So...
What do we do?
We do what the murderer least expects Poirot to do.
We return to the dig.
All of us.
This case, mes amis, it is full of the red... fish.
(Gerard) Herrings, possibly?
Merci.
There's so many diversions, so many distractions.
Attend well to Poirot as he peels them away like the skin of an onion.
Herrings, onions, do get a wriggle on, there's a good fellow.
Your wife, she funded your expeditions as you went along.
How much more efficient it would be to have the money all at once, non?
- What?
- There is no money.
Non, vraiment monsieur, for you there never has been.
For the running of Boynton Hall, alors, is for you always most arduous.
Lady Boynton, she was always most munificent to your father but never towards his son.
You can stare at me significantly as long as you like, monsieur.
I've done nothing wrong.
Tell to Poirot what was in the bag.
What bag?
What did you agree to purchase from the ragged Arab boy?
I remember the boy, I don't remember what rubbish he was flogging.
Fortunately, Poirot, he does.
And from it he extracted... this.
- Voila.
- Voila... what?
Well, it's a tooth.
(Poirot) D'ętre precis, it is a molar taken from the upper jaw of St John.
You will observe that it bears the traces of the filling of gold.
For this skull it was supposed to masquerade as the skull of John the Baptist.
But in fact it is as you say, Monsieur Leonard, rubbish.
What the devil are you talking about, man?
This wasn't purchased from a hawker and planted.
This is untouched.
This entire sample was exhumed e situ intacto.
Forgive me, Poirot, but you're drivelling utter bilge, pompous little Belgian.
As my father has explained, this object was discovered undisturbed.
It's a perfect fit.
I don't understand.
All your life, Father, traipsing about the Middle East... time after time finding absolutely nothing of significance.
I wanted it to end.
You dear, deluded, stupid man.
I never expected your wife's bloody money.
I never wanted it.
I wanted you to be free of this need.
To find what you've been looking for.
Do you mind if I step out for a while?
- I'll come with you.
- No, no.
I simply wish to be alone for a moment.
Is that permitted?
Je vous en prie, monsieur.
Now the three of you.
The litany of cruelties you have endured.
The ceaseless humiliations.
(Beating, child screaming)
You multiply these incidents by hundreds and thousands.
The corrosion of the spirit, it is inevitable and insupportable.
(Child sobbing)
No wonder you wished to see Lady Boynton dead.
Indeed Poirot, he overheard you, Mademoiselle Carol, and you, Monsieur Raymond, whispering that your mother... must die.
And you, Dr King...
By your own admission, you also wished to see her dead.
You are a woman who has wasted time and is determined to waste no more.
What do we know of you, Monsieur Cope?
Me?
Will you show to me your passport?
Merci.
You choose to use your second Christian name and not your first?
- Yes.
- Why have you elected to do so, I wonder?
My first given name is ambiguous, in terms of gender.
The spelling is different but it's also a girl's name.
As a child I found that tiresome.
I suggest that there are many things about your childhood that you found...
"tiresome",
Monsieur Leslie...
Jefferson Cope.
(Child crying and screaming)
I don't think we're sufficiently sorry.
The child that was thrashed... so brutally, on the orders of Lady Boynton, was not a girl, as misremembered by her daughter Carol, non... but a boy... by the name of Leslie.
If you know all that, you'll also know that I didn't kill her.
Merely to deprive her of her life would afford for you satisfaction most scant.
No, you wanted to make her life unbearable.
To degrade her, to hurt the woman, as she hurt you.
Lady Boynton was a person preoccupied with station and money and you decided to strip her of them both.
So I may remain assured of your very best services?
(Poirot) Of what service in particular did you wish to remain assured?
You have no newspapers of any description?
!
I am so sorry.
(Poirot) The withholding from Lady Boynton of the newspapers... that would keep her ignorant of the panic that you yourself had inspired to ensure the destruction of her empire.
I'm just lousy at being intrepid.
Back at the hotel you couldn't get a paper for love nor money.
And like the confidence trickster so accomplished, you invested in your own deceit.
You wrote off thousands of dollars of your own savings, merely to blow smoke in the face of Poirot!
Oh, Monsieur Cope.
It seems I've lost quite a lot of money.
Alors, Poirot has one more red herring left to fry.
And it is a fish most substantial.
Le Colonel, mes amis, he is not a policeman but is retained by the Foreign Office.
His mission in Syria was to uncover and destroy the trafficking of female slaves.
The abduction and sale of women for one purpose only.
- Pardonnez-moi, mesdames.
- I knew it!
Arab women.
Whatever the client ordered.
- White women?
- Yes.
They wanted... me?
Helas, mademoiselle.
It is the opinion of Poirot... that there is a person who instructed his agent to search for a young lady who is Caucasian and resembled you.
Exactement.
With your skin that is pale and your hair that is red.
Who is this agent, Poirot?
Is he here amongst us now?
Certainement!
Mademoiselle Jinny, when you struck at your attacker that night, you hit your target.
It's OK.
The woman who befriended you so assiduously... it was she who was smothering your face!
Sister Agnieszka!
Rot in hell!
You, Sister, will face the consequences.
The key... to the murder of Lady Boynton... it is not who, it is when.
Dame Celia, do you have any children?
No, I do not.
I urge you to reconsider your answer, madame.
I cannot reconsider.
I have no children.
Madame, you are a liar.
You have a daughter and she is amongst us now.
That is a filthy lie.
And in extremely poor taste.
So you disown her now, as you did when she was a baby?
Reclaim her of your own volition!
You owe to her a debt of ungiven love!
I had no choice.
No choice.
What was your position in the household of Lady Boynton?
In the days when she was Mrs Pierce?
Hm?
- A junior maid.
- Oui, c'est ça.
The servant of the lowest position whose duty it is to scrub.
Not to become pregnant by a guest of your employer.
The woman to whom you surrendered your child on the day of its birth.
Is it me?
Non, mademoiselle Carol.
It is not you.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.
You gave birth to me?
And delivered me up to that bitch?
I came... to save you.
How did you know this?
Mademoiselle, Poirot he did not know for certain.
Until this... very moment.
Non, non, non, mademoiselle.
Mon Colonel, Poirot he is much obliged to you for the accounts of the household and the registry of immigration which shows that three weeks after the baby was born,
Celia Westholme arrived on the coast of Ireland, to be taken care of by nuns.
Your child, she had been taken from you, and so you were now to become invisible, to nurse your shame.
But you were not to be the outcast.
Oh, no.
You were to recreate yourself as a free spirit.
A writer, a traveller.
A success.
Dame Celia Westholme.
And every time you thought of your daughter, you consoled yourself with the hope that she was happy but she had not begun life afresh, she was not happy.
She remained as a prisoner in the household of Lady Boynton.
(Water splashing)
(Child choking)
And your regret, it came flooding back... to boil in your heart.
Let me tell you a story.
This... is the legend of Gilgamesh.
Gilgamesh was the most beautiful man in all creation.
So you went in search of the father of your child, to Vienna, so out of the way of your customary travels, and together with this man, you agreed... to investigate to see whether the cruelties of Lady Boynton they were true.
And you discovered that all of the children had been tormented.
It was not the hornet that stung Lady Boynton.
How could it?
- Sorry, might have been stung.
- Ah!
The hornet, it was already dead!
You stung her... with this...
(Lady Boynton) Ah!
(Poirot)... which you then returned to Dr Gerard, who had prepared it for you.
(Lady Boynton) I am stung!
He then cleaned it and discarded it in the tent of Nanny Taylor, to implicate her.
(Scoffs) This is... colossal!
Wh-What was in the syringe?
A concoction of your own devising, Doctor, probably based on morphia.
You can't kill a woman the size of La Boynton with a thimbleful of morphia.
As you well know.
Doctor, you affect to know little of the administering of drugs, when en effet you are the expert.
You greet Poirot and ask him if he remembers you from Edinburgh.
The "bonce doctor," huh, with a beard?
Poirot, he remembers everything.
When you took the witness stand in Edinburgh to speak on the mind, the clerk of the court, he read out your qualifications.
Anaesthesia, Doctor, was your discipline, long before psychiatry.
No, of course you cannot kill Lady Boynton with such a dose, but you can remove from her control of the nervous system.
The power over her movement.
The power over her speech.
And Lady Boynton, who professed herself a lover of the sun... was now roasting to death and could say nothing.
Ingenious, monsieur, and commendably grotesque.
But Lady Boynton did not "roast to death".
She was stabbed.
Your prestidigitation with drugs, Doctor, was not over yet.
You injected yourself to simulate the symptoms of malaria.
Symptoms so authentic that you fooled even Dr King.
- I'll be fine!
- This gentleman needs to return to camp.
Mademoiselle Jinny, she attended you.
And how did you repay her for her kindness?
By giving to her another sedative of your own invention, to consolidate your alibi.
Earlier, you had killed a goat and trapped a quantity of its blood in a ball of wax.
This object you secreted in the folds of the clothes of your victim, where in due course it would melt in the heat of the sun.
One can never have enough sun, huh?
- (She whimpers)
- What?
You could have killed her then, but you wanted her to suffer for as long as possible.
Speak up, dear.
I can't help you if you don't speak up.
You used the ball of wax to confuse the time of death, and it was this wax that Poirot, he discovered on the dress of Lady Boynton, and on the floorboards and the little piece of pottery beneath her chair.
Wax which told to Poirot that there was an accomplice to the murder.
Et puis, you waited patiently.
The wax, it melted, the blood of the goat it began to flow, suggesting to the naked eye that she had already been stabbed.
And at last the cry it went up to tell the world... (Greville) Help!
...that Lady Boynton was dead, but she was not dead.
Non, not yet.
- Are you the girl who's a doctor?
- Yes.
Then you've met death.
So have I. Come on.
Only now...
was Death to meet its victim.
And in the sight of everyone, in the sight of Hercule Poirot himself... you, Dame Celia, murdered Lady Boynton with your own hands, as prescribed by Dr Gerard to quench your rage.
It took but a few seconds.
Even Dr King was deceived into believing that Lady Boynton had died earlier that day.
If you please to empty the contents of your handbag.
(Poirot) Ha.
Ah, oui.
And Dr Gerard, he encouraged Poirot to seek for the chisel.
Chisel fits the bill.
Whereas the murder weapon it was in your hand all of the day.
Goodness.
We did go to considerable trouble.
One question - what makes you think any of this has any basis whatsoever in the truth?
Nanny Taylor.
Dear God!
Did I kill her as well or was she one of yours?
You disordered her mind with a solution of mescaline so strong that the very speck of it made the head of Poirot to spin.
You wanted to promote in her hallucinations to make her susceptible to suggestion.
You burdened her mind with so much shame and guilt that given the opportunity you knew that she would do harm to herself.
You know you can't go on... after everything that you did.
Think what you helped her do to little Jinny.
(Child choking)
What did Nanny Taylor say to you?
Fa...
Fa...
Father!
This was not the ravings of a nervous breakdown.
For you yourself had told to her... that you were the father of Mademoiselle Jinny.
Portrait of Mum and Dad.
You'll appreciate now why I declined your particular offer of affection.
(Sighs) Well, well.
This is a pickle.
We set out to save you and destroyed everything.
- Thank you, Theo.
- It's all part of the service.
No extra charge.
I never stopped loving you, you know.
Be careful with this one, Poirot.
Digitalis.
The action, as you will appreciate, is irreversible.
I'm so sorry.
We hoped it wouldn't come to this.
(Gasps)
There, there, there.
There, there.
There.
(Gasps) No.
Don't, Doctor.
(Grunts) Look to the living.
They pay their bills quicker and they make better... conversation.
(lnhales)
(Jinny sobbing)
- Monsieur Poirot.
- Mademoiselle.
Carol and I are going to Egypt, to see the Sphinx.
It's not much of an adventure, but we're doing it on our own.
It's a start.
It was actually my idea.
Lady Boynton would've said I was constitutionally too feeble, that my skin was too fair but I think it's probably time I showed my feeble skin who's boss.
C'est bien, mademoiselle.
Before he leaves, you will permit an old man to pontificate.
Alors, mademoiselle, there is nothing in the world so damaged ...that it cannot be repaired.
I incourage you to know this ...because without this certainty, we should all of us... be mad.
Je vous salue, mademoiselle.
Au revoir...
Lord Boynton!
Lord Boynton!
Hey!
Quoi?
Lord Boynton!
- I...
- Don't...
- Don't speak.
- Why not?
You've got sunstroke.
You need to just stay where you are, be quite still.
Oh, actually what I need to do is sit up and drink a lot of water.
Shukran.
I'm dehydrated.
RAYMOND:
I've sent for a doctor.
Already got one.
Sarah King, M.D.
You're the fellow who's gonna get sunstroke, walking around without a hat.
I just introduced myself.
Raymond.
Ah, my... my mother needs me.
Well, if you can't introduce yourself, perhaps you might introduce me to your mother?
Unlikely.
Thé au citron, s'il vous plaît.
- Oui, monsieur.
- Et chaud.
Très chaud.
Oui.
Alas, madame, I am desolate.
You have no newspapers of any description?
!
I am so sorry.
You don't know what sorry is.
Got you, you double-distilled blighter!
Colonel Carbury.
Mon vieux.
Poirot.
All these years traveling, you'd think I'd be used to creepy-crawlies by now.
Not a bit of it.
I did not know that you were the enthusiast pour I'antiquité.
For what, old boy?
No, but you are come also for the exploration of Lord Boynton?
Ah, no, no, no.
Passing through.
Oh, vraiment.
To where do you pass, Colonel?
Here and there.
You know, here, and then, you know...
There?
Or thereabouts.
Absolutely.
- Can I help you?
- Oh!
Agnieszka, you are such a fool.
I am looking for number nine?
- Oh, this is six.
- Ah.
So sorry, my dear, for my intrusion.
You are come to follow the labors of Lord Boynton?
Yes.
He's my stepfather.
Truly God has smiled upon you.
Your stepfather does a great thing, I think.
A great man.
Oh!
So I may remain assured of your very best services.
Thank you very much.
Too kind, sir.
Americans.
Do know how to arrive, eh?
Utterly outrageous.
Silly little man!
Sir, what about the fare?
Please.
Look here.
Do you know who I am?
I am the son of Lord Boynton.
Son of lord, you pay.
Please.
Thank you, sir.
The son.
Bloody shambles!
Typical.
If you...
Hey, Jinny.
It's all right, honey.
It's all right now.
I was being drowned.
It was a dream, baby.
It was just a dream.
It was a memory.
I can't go on like this.
12 minutes.
- You allowed me to oversleep...
- Mother...
- ...by 12 minutes.
- I'm so sorry
Fetch my stick.
Stick!
Ah.
Excellent.
There you are.
It's Leonard.
Boynton.
Your stepson.
How good of you to come, Mr. Boynton.
Carol, my vitamins.
- Now, Mother?
- Clearly.
Jinny, you look like you're suffering from consumption.
It's drawing attention to yourself in a most unattractive way.
Go to your room and apply color.
Raymond.
Don't sit there.
Sit here.
Nanny.
Go somewhere else.
You look tired, dear.
We need to discuss your attitude.
Sulking is like shyness.
It is unacceptable.
It is showing off.
I'm not sulking, Mother.
I merely question the wisdom of traveling when the market is so jittery.
Wall Street knows better than to breathe without consulting me, wherever I may be, at whatever juncture.
I forgot my book.
Fetch my book, Raymond.
You think they're a rum crew?
Wait till you meet the archaeologist husband.
Although he's not actually psychotic.
More just old-fashioned bonkers.
Theodore Gerard.
We have met.
Bonce doctor.
I advised on a case in Edinburgh.
- Used to have a beard.
- Oh!
Yes, of course.
The bonce doctor.
I recognize you, monsieur.
Of course, it's all a sham.
The real object of the exercise is a reconciliation of his offspring and hers.
Happy families among the tombs.
There is disharmony?
Where Lady Boynton is, the music of the spheres is curiously like nails down a blackboard.
Now, you must excuse me.
My personal disorder.
Can't help sticking my stupid face down the lion's throat.
Do you mind if I join you for a moment?
I can't find these wretched pills.
Oh, God, Raymond.
She has them.
What?
She has them already.
They're in her bag.
The book she sent me to find, she didn't even bring to Syria.
Carol, we know these games.
One day, Raymond...
- I swear to God.
- I know.
No, I will take a hammer, and I swear...
Maybe we should talk about that.
- Don't joke with me, Ray.
- I'm your brother.
I never joke.
The way we let that woman steal them from us.
- CAROL:
Oh, God, Raymond.
- I know.
Well, then, we have no choice.
She has to die.
Hurry up!
Hurry!
Now.
We're going now.
Please, please.
Yes, sir.
Please.
Please, please.
Tickety-boo.
Please.
This way.
Okay, okay.
Whew!
Looks like Lord Boynton's expedition has created quite a stir.
So apart from the family on a three-line whip,
Dr. King joins us, I suspect, because she stuck a pin in a map of the world.
Mr. Jefferson Cope may actually be a little bit dull.
He might possibly like old bits of bone and pot and whatnot.
The honorable Leonard, saddled with running his father's house in Dorset on no income while said father swans around the Middle East looking for the head of John the Baptist.
As for the Polish nun, she gives me the heeby-jeebies, personally.
No problem.
No, no.
No problem.
Don't be afraid.
No problem.
Abdullah!
Muhammad!
No problem.
No problem.
COPE:
Hm.
What have we here, I wonder?
A mobile tollbooth?
Dame Celia Westholme.
Sorry to hold up the bus, everybody.
Camel was on loan.
Had to go back.
Has Boynton made any significant progress, does anybody know?
Have you read any of her books, monsieur?
Oui.
It's her fault I'm here.
She makes travel sound so thrilling.
Ah.
Welcome, welcome, welcome!
Did you have a nice journey?
I know.
It's ghastly, isn't it?
Hello, little blossoms.
Hot showers and cold beer for everyone.
Even you, Nanny, you raving old dipsomaniac.
- Leonard.
Dear boy.
- Father.
Ah.
My child bride.
Dinner's in the pavilion at 8:00.
Everyone's invited.
Come along.
Raymond.
Utter bonanza of crippled personalities.
I'd have paid extra for this.
Making yourself useful, Leonard?
Good man.
Coming along.
That blind chap down in the Arab camp...
Every night I hear him tell a variation on the same story.
I've heard it all over Syria.
The daughter of Herodias brought John the Baptist's severed head to this land.
She buried it where the river meets the mountain.
Now, I've been every damn place in Syria where any river meets anything that could possibly be construed as a mountain, from Krak to Aleppo.
This is the only place left.
It has to be here.
Come along, then.
Chop-chop.
Oh, mon Dieu.
And these words...
Do they speak of John?
No.
It tells a different story.
A man is sitting in a tavern in Damascus.
He looks up from his wine and sees Death staring at him across the room.
He cries out...
"But this cannot be my time!"
He flees Damascus.
He rides his horse fast, right across the desert to Samarra.
When he arrives, he is thirsty.
Standing before him at the well is Death.
Hm.
You're nodding.
Upon seeing Death for the second time, the man, he cries out...
"This cannot be!
For I escaped you in Damascus."
And Death, he lays his hand upon the shoulder of the man and says,
"I also was surprised to see..."
"...to see you in Damascus.
For my appointment with you, it was always to be here in Samarra."
Try as one might, one cannot escape one's rightful destiny.
Oui.
I know you're here, Johnny.
I can almost smell you.
Sugar, Raymond?
To put sugar in one's tea is indicative of weak character.
Raymond doesn't take sugar.
Good morning.
You look dreadful.
Thank you.
I feel dreadful.
You should see a doctor.
DR. GERARD:
I just did.
He told me I had malaria.
DR. KING:
Oh, Lord.
I've dosed myself up, inasmuch as it makes a difference.
Well, you shan't come on the expedition today.
If I have an attack on the way to the river,
I'll most probably die.
The obvious solution is to remain here all day with Lady Boynton.
- You'd better come with us.
- Not a difficult decision.
The sun is up.
I shall spend today observing from the platform.
Good idea, poppet.
Cracking view of the casbah.
You can keep a beady one on Leonard and myself.
You assist with the digging, monsieur?
Oh, I would assist with digging the drains if the alternative were enforced social intercourse with my father's ghastly 10-ton wife.
You won't come down to the river, Lady Boynton?
By all accounts, the vista of the casbah is very fine.
Did the boy bring my Times yet?
No, Mother.
Dismiss him.
Sorry.
Might have been stung.
Ah!
I am stung!
Yes, there's the bugger there.
Oh, goodness.
Let me look at you.
Do not touch me.
Never touch me.
You're always looking at me.
- Golly, am I?
- All the time.
I turn 'round and you're just looking at me.
Why?
Perhaps I like the shape of your face.
It's a very pretty face.
Do you mind?
I certainly shan't do it if you mind.
I don't mind.
S'il vous plaît, M. Cope.
Do not allow Poirot to detain you.
Oh, I'm in no hurry.
The place has been there a few years.
It's not going anywhere.
You are acquainted with the family Boynton?
One can't live in New York and fail to be acquainted with the Boyntons.
Lady B. is a pretty big financial noise.
I like her.
If I may say so, monsieur, it would appear that your amity it is not reciprocated.
Oh, she hates everybody.
Everybody knows that.
She just doesn't give a damn.
I think it's quite stylish.
You have the outlook most benevolent, monsieur.
I'm easily pleased.
Out in the sun yet again without a hat.
Some people never learn.
Raymond, let me read you what Mr. Baedeker has to say...
"The monumental edifice known as..."
Excuse me.
Thank you so much.
I thought that, free from the appalling mother,
I might be permitted the smallest amount of anodyne conversation with Raymond.
But no.
Evidently the family has decided that I'm a gold digger and all overtures of friendship must be stamped on.
Frankly, it's rather insulting.
But I'm not having it.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Now we may rest.
We are arrived.
God is good.
God is glorious.
If you want my professional opinion... which you don't, but you should, so I'm gonna give it to you anyway...
Your family would do well to hear what Herr Freud said to me at a conference last year.
"To be American is bad enough," he said,
"but to put money... and to..."
- Take a little...
- Oh, oh.
- Okay, let me look at you.
- I'll be fine.
Mahmoud, this gentleman needs to return to camp immediately.
Get your hands off me.
I'll be fine.
Ruddy paws off me.
Doctors.
Think you know everything.
- You don't have to carry me.
- I want the exercise.
- Jinny!
- That's my name.
Just need a drink of water.
I can hear the gears grinding in the old cerebellum.
Not really.
I was just wondering how Lady Boynton managed to negotiate that ladder affair.
It's pretty vertiginous.
Would it kill you to call her "mother"?
For me?
"Stepmother" would do.
God, it's hot.
Yes, it is.
Perhaps you would be kind enough to take the lady in question a glass of water.
Father, look, I'm sorry.
But are you genuinely blind to the way she treats...
everyone?
Except you?
Now.
I say.
Would you like a drink?
Can we get you anything at all?
To drink?
Like a bucket of strychnine?
Get these buggers away from me.
Perfectly well.
Lie down.
Doctor, what do we do?
What was that?
What did he say?
- He said bugger off.
- Oh.
Right you are.
Can do.
Not you.
You stay.
- No, Jinny.
- Oh, God.
- I thought...
- Yeah.
I thought you wanted my company.
I do.
Yes.
That's...
That's exactly what I want.
Listen to me.
It's not you.
It's not about the conquest.
For me, denial is a very particular pleasure.
It's not...
People say travel broadens the mind.
Mainly because people like me insist on it in their books.
But I have to say I doubt that it is true.
On the contrary, I suspect travel narrows the mind.
One becomes so blasé about the wonders of the world.
The more I travel, the more clearly I understand that all that ever matters is the people.
Not the places.
Those Arabs telling stories over couscous in the camp.
They fascinate me.
This, it's pretty enough, but show me the humans every time.
I don't much care for her.
The way she hangs around the younger Boynton girl.
They sniff out weakness...
nuns... and misery, and they gorge on it.
Bloody vampires in drag, quite frankly.
Poirot.
How did you find the river?
- Oh, I...
- Good, good.
We haven't turned up any glories yet.
But we live in hope.
"Nil carborundum" and all that.
And Lady Boynton, she has enjoyed her day?
Oh, yes, monsieur.
Well, she always does.
The word "boredom" simply not in the vocab.
Darling?
I-I think it's time you climbed down from your perch for a martini.
Poppet?
Shall we say about 10 minutes?
Little minx.
Help!
Help!
Et alors.
Ça commence.
Help!
Help!
- You the girl who's a doctor?
- Yes.
Then you've met death.
So have I.
Come on.
Shut her eyes.
Shut them.
I-I'm afraid it's true.
She's dead.
Your appointment with death, madame.
It was always to be here.
Et maintenant, mon colonel, you are arrived?
This is an event for which you were prepared, non?
No.
This is something else.
Later.
Show me the dead woman.
What happened here?
Excusez-moi, but do you commission me to examine this case?
I do.
You two getting married or something?
Mind if I have a gander at your patient, Doc?
- You recovered, Doctor?
- I'll manage.
Juicy big hole where there shouldn't be one.
- Somebody stuck her.
- A knife.
No.
Bigger than a knife.
Fatter blade.
A chisel?
Chisel fits the bill.
Whatever the implement, it was wielded with authority.
It was one blow in, then vigorously churned about to create maximum damage.
She can't have been dead for more than an hour.
Yes, I don't know why that should be there.
It is wax.
Well, one thing's for certain.
She can't stay here in this heat.
I'll make arrangements for the body to be transported.
Un moment, s'il vous plaît, mon colonel.
Excusez-moi.
Yes.
Already there is so much about this case that is wrong.
You yourself are wrong.
You are not what you appear.
You are not a policeman, yet you know a crime it has been committed before it had been reported.
You bear the rank of colonel, yet where is it, mon ami, that you serve?
So enough of these crypticities.
Explain yourself to Poirot or he cannot accept this case.
Point!
- Crypticities?
- Oui.
Poirot, you're a foreigner.
But I judge you to be a good egg and therefore trustworthy.
Now, what I'm about to deal you is a card you must keep very close to your chest.
Is that understood?
Oui.
You continue with the digging, monsieur?
I am given to understand it's what Lady Boynton would have wanted.
You were, I think...
please to forgive me... somewhere in this area this afternoon?
Yes, Poirot, do you think you could postpone your interrogation of the obvious murder suspect so he can arrange some necessities for his distressed father?
Thank you so much.
Oh.
I understand you're looking for a chisel, yes?
Fill your boots.
WESTHOLME: [ Speaking Arabic ]
Dame Celia.
Lord Boynton.
What is it that you read?
I'm cheering the bereaved with judicious extracts from "The Perfumed Garden."
Are people saying that I killed my wife?
Non.
Non, monsieur.
We are all united in our desire to comfort you.
I was always glad that I was older than Leonora.
I thought, "At least I'll die first.
I won't have the agony of trying to live without her."
Nevertheless it must be admitted the death of Lady B.
Is hardly detrimental to the community.
But it is not well, monsieur, that a human being should die before her time it is come.
En plus, the nanny, Mme. Taylor, has the great distress.
All right, all right.
Keep your hair on.
For heaven's sake, I was just trying to lighten the mood.
How did you achieve your newspaper, M. Cope?
Came with me.
Many thanks.
I'm just lousy at being intrepid.
Always so hungry for news of home.
Back at the hotel you couldn't get a paper for love nor money.
DR. GERARD:
I know.
This may help you in times of stress.
Mon colonel?
Your men...
When is it that they arrive?
Midnight, I should think.
Oh.
Then you must have them search this area at dawn.
The search most diligent.
All around.
Looking for what?
In the first place, mon ami, a syringe.
It is instrumental in the murder of Lady Boynton.
Right.
Good grief.
- It will be done.
- Bon.
You see, mon ami, the voices of the little gray cells, they have begun to sing to Poirot.
Slit throat.
Je ne comprends pas.
It is not the custom du pays to waste life and the food in this manner?
Barbarous.
- Monsieur.
- Merci.
Look, Poirot, sorry to be so standoffish.
Bit grim seeing one's father cry.
Oui.
Je vous en prie, monsieur.
What do you want to know?
I should like, monsieur, for you to tell me if you spoke to your stepmother yesterday afternoon, and if so, when?
We spoke.
About 1:00.
- Hottest part of the day.
- Bon.
She'd been perched up there like some evil great pudding ever since you lot set off.
I say we spoke.
I spoke.
She ignored me.
Nothing unusual about that.
Can we get you anything at all?
To drink?
You know how it was.
One mustn't disturb her when she was taking the sun, but...
God help you if you neglected to do so.
- Monsieur.
- Oui?
- We found this syringe.
- Ah!
Where was this discovered?
In the tent occupied by the old lady.
The nanny.
Merci.
AGNIESZKA: "And the Lord said unto the servant,
'Go out into the highways and compel them to come in to my feast..."'
"That my house may be filled."
It's a beautiful parable.
The word King James renders as "compel"
is in the Greek "anagkazo."
It means "compel with violence."
The Spanish knew this.
They used this single word to justify every atrocity of their Inquisition.
For it is God's own command that those unwilling to enter his kingdom should be persuaded in with pain.
That's terrible.
Mm.
Compulsion of any kind, my dear, it can be terrible.
I overheard my stepfather telling the story that was written here... of Death following the man across the desert.
Something has followed me here to this place.
Something evil.
God is here to guard you, Jinny.
He lives in every grain of sand.
What is it now?
Sorry, gentlemen.
Sand in the grooves.
Quite.
Well, the Arabs are all accounted for.
Oui.
This case it is most unsatisfactory.
Still plenty of suspects, old boy.
Yes, but almost all of them were outside of the camp at the time that the murder it was committed.
And this is corroborated by a witness who is impeccable.
Me.
They were with Poirot all of the time.
Raymond wasn't.
He came back.
Bien sûr.
Cela je connais bien.
Oui.
CARBURY:
Also Lord Boynton and his son.
Yes, yes.
And tomorrow we begin the further interrogations.
Mm-hmm.
That's a queer one.
Without doubt there is more to M. Cope than he wishes to be known.
But in that desire and in this company he is not unique.
Hold on.
Over here.
Quickly.
Off in this direction.
- Where did it come from?
- Is anyone out there?
Close all those gates down there.
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.
You see anyone moving?
No.
Where did it come from?
It's got to be something.
Over there.
Oh, dear.
Get her inside.
Quickly.
You men, over here.
Don't let anyone leave.
Sister Agnieszka!
It's okay.
It's okay.
Shh.
It's okay.
Everything's going to be okay.
Can I help?
Be useful to know what she's trying to tell us.
She's not trying to tell us anything.
She's talking to God.
You have Polish, monsieur?
You don't need Polish to spot a woman at her prayers.
Very pretty needlework, Doc.
Shouldn't we be getting her back to the hotel?
Ask Dr. King.
You're the senior physician here.
Yeah, but you're much prettier and you're handler with the cutlery.
Besides, the nun's your patient.
I've got my hands full with the loony nanny.
Well, this, what I've done, it's only temporary.
- So, yes, we should.
- Ça fait du bien.
It would be helpful to Poirot for all of us to return.
Ei veniam dare.
Ei veniam dare.
That's Latin.
"Forgive him"?
Poirot has little Latin, but it can also be, I think, "Forgive her."
- My men can track...
- Non, non.
Non.
There is no need to dispatch your men, Colonel.
The assailant of Sister Agnieszka has not fled.
There was a man.
He followed me across the desert.
I woke up and he was putting a bag over my head.
Slaver.
Bound to be.
People think the slave trade is finished.
It's not.
I've seen the waiting caves on the beach at Mangapwani.
100 souls crammed into a space hardly bigger than this tent.
I threw myself on the floor to get away.
When I looked up, I saw...
You saw Sister Agnieszka was struggling with your attacker?
And, well, you tried to help her.
And you struck at the man with what?
A rock.
Well...
And in your terror, and in the dark, accidentally you struck your friend and protector.
Now, you try to get some sleep, if you can.
Because tomorrow we face the rigors of the return journey, hein?
Come close, Jinny.
Let me tell you a story.
This is the legend of Gilgamesh.
- Oh.
Shukran.
- Madame.
Will she be all right?
The nun?
Oh, God knows.
Will you?
- I'm not wounded.
- That's debatable.
Seems to be consensus that you killed your mother.
Is that your view, Sarah?
Heavens.
Five consecutive words culminating in my Christian name.
If you're going to be as garrulous as this, Mr. Boynton,
I shall have to ask you to be less familiar.
- Do you think I killed her?
- No.
No, but what I think is irrelevant.
He's the one you need to convince.
You're the authority on stories.
Tell me...
What was it that got loose when Pandora opened the box?
- All the evils of the world
- That's it.
Mm.
Madness.
Greed.
Shame.
Those guys.
My stepfather did pretty much the same thing when he took the cork out of that goddamn tomb.
And here you are, Poirot, kicking the contents all over town.
Did Lady Boynton harm you physically?
My mother had little recourse to violence.
She was too smart for that.
Instead, she just prized open the top of our skulls and raked her poisonous tongue through our brains.
No place to hide, Poirot.
Even in your own head.
Ever.
Carol, um...
Carol grew up petrified.
Did her best to ingratiate herself, you know, to win approval, which she never got.
Jinny just was terrified to the point of madness.
Possibly beyond.
Did you murder your mother, monsieur?
No.
But only because I lacked the moral courage.
She was a monster, Poirot.
It was her pleasure, always, to watch us suffer.
Why was she driven to be so cruel?
To punish us, I guess.
For what offense?
For being someone else's kids.
It's true.
We were adopted.
All of us.
It is no crime against God or nature to be an orphan.
Oh, but it is, monsieur.
It is a hideous crime.
Lady Boynton...
Mrs. Pierce as she was then...
she...
She wanted to have children so badly.
But between her and Mr. Pierce, they couldn't make it happen.
No, for Mom, adoption was the only route.
But once she'd assembled her family, of which there were many candidates...
Don't!
It was an accident.
...and rejected a great number...
Oh, yes, monsieur, there were many children who were presented to us as new siblings, only to be removed a day later.
One child stayed longer than the others, but the beatings went on until she also disappeared.
So there we were, we lucky few...
Raymond, Carol, and Jinny.
Je ne comprends pas.
Mlle. Jinny, she was not even born.
Who was this other child?
I don't know.
I can't remember.
Who was that little girl?
Unacceptable goods.
Merci.
Who was the child that you beat, madame?
Can you tell it to Poirot?
Lesley.
Yes.
Lesley.
Can you tell to me about Lesley, madame?
You had to beat her?
She needed to be punished?
I did what was required of me.
I don't think we're sufficiently sorry.
Not by a long chalk.
Again, Nanny.
God, she was an evil woman.
And Lesley, madame?
What became of her?
She is alive?
Fa...
Fa...
Father?
I'm not your father, my dear.
But I'll do my best...
- Can you get me that bag?
- Oui.
I'll do my best to make you comfortable.
All right?
Thank you.
Bog-standard sedative.
Check it if you want, Poirot.
Come on.
There's a good girl.
Come on.
Oh.
M. Cope.
- Monsieur, do you have a moment?
- But of course.
I, uh...
I-I don't know if this has any relevance to, uh, what's been going on, but it seems I've lost quite a lot of money.
M. Cope, je suis désolé.
No, no.
That's okay.
What's of interest is that the stock that's gone down the pan is the Pierce Holding Company.
- Non.
- Yes.
Lady Boynton's outfit.
Fireproof.
Bombproof.
The safest bet on Wall Street.
I myself invested substantially.
Seems that while we've been away there's been this rumor about the true value of the company.
These things, they come and go.
Lady Boynton'd generally get up on her hind legs, tell everyone to shut up and sit up straight and it'd all calm down.
But she wasn't there.
The rumor became a panic, then a stampede to get out.
The whole outfit's bust to hell.
Shares are worthless.
LORD BOYNTON:
Oh, God.
Here comes that ghastly little Belgian, wringing his hands like the cowman come to collect his Christmas box.
He's being respectful, Father.
He's being a damned nuisance.
Monsieur.
Come for a nightcap among the bereaved?
Non, merci, Lord Boynton.
Quand même.
Oh, for God's sake, sit down, Poirot.
You're giving me indigestion hovering like that.
Merci.
I suppose it is quite proper that I should be questioned.
I was on the spot at the time.
And I imagine I inherit my wife's estate, so...
And the estate of Lady Boynton...
Of what does this principally consist?
Well, God knows.
I never had charge of the money.
And Leonora just subbed the digging as it went along.
Do you know, Leonard?
Raymond would have a clearer idea of value.
But it must add up to a few quid.
You disagree, monsieur?
Since we have been in Syria, there has been the financial collapse catastrophique.
The Pierce Holding Company is utterly disintegrated.
It seems that the death of Lady Boynton was not enough, hein?
It also seems that she has been obliterated from the earth.
It may surprise you to know, Mr. Poirot, that I am not unaware that Lady Boynton was not universally adored.
Like many women who know their own mind, she found it all too easy to make enemies.
She did not make an enemy of me.
I loved her.
I am not ashamed to say so.
To you or to my son.
Was it necessary to air that observation in quite that way?
The methods of Poirot, monsieur, cannot always be agréable.
Mesdames.
Excusez-moi, Dame Celia.
Were you acquainted with Lady Boynton before encountering her at the tomb?
Well, I'd seen her about.
And where had you seen her, madame?
Lady Boynton was pointed out to me by a man at a party who then preceded to tell me rather a lot about her.
About the way, in particular, she treated her children.
I decided then and there I had no wish to further acquaintance with the woman by introducing myself to her.
She sounded perfectly odious.
And who was this man that was so well informed?
I didn't catch his name.
I wanted her dead, too.
Just in case you were wondering.
Well, she was clearly blocking my way.
Raymond couldn't even look me in the eye with her still in existence.
So do you commend yourself to me as a suspect, mademoiselle?
I commend myself to you as one who has recently invested a great deal of time in a relationship that was always heading nowhere.
I now know that when I find something I want,
I must act to take it.
WESTHOLME:
Bravo.
Sadly, all this resolution has taken your mind off the game.
It's a little trick I learnt the other day in Vienna.
You see, just when you least expect it, the church comes storming back.
Checkmate.
I didn't know you smoked.
I don't.
I've given up.
Since you threw the cigarette away, you've given up?
Well, your determination is impressive.
All six seconds of it.
Well, keep talking.
I could go 10.
If I hadn't spoken, would you just have kept watching me?
We'll never know.
You're a strange man.
Does that matter?
Not necessarily.
Raymond.
Yeah.
Now is the time to kiss me.
Yeah.
Anybody in here who isn't dead?
Ei veniam dare.
They have him, by God.
They have found the head of John.
News that is astonishing, monsieur.
I must return to Ain Musa immediately.
Is there a problem?
Nanny Taylor has drowned herself in the bath.
- Suicide.
- Oh, my God.
- That's awful news.
- Oui.
Is somebody dealing with it?
Oui, monsieur.
Because I must...
I-I must get back to the dig.
I can't, you know...
Oui.
Moral of the story being, if you want your death to attract the concern of your employer, make sure you're 2,000 years old.
- Ah, oui.
- Oh!
Keep meaning to give you something.
It's the details of the immigration you needed.
And on the back here is a list of employees.
Merci.
As requested, I've had a word with Mahmoud.
Some of his boys are privately saying that there was some character lurking about on the ladder that afternoon.
An Arab.
Not one of them.
But that was a good hour or so before the time of death.
This case is a mess, Poirot.
Not so, mon ami.
This case, when Poirot has almost given up scrabbling for purchase on its shell of armor...
Boff.
It opens to him like a flower.
Good Lord.
So, what do we do?
We do what the murderer least expects Poirot to do.
We return to the dig.
All of us.
This case, mes amis, it is full of the red... fish.
Herrings, possibly?
Merci.
There are so many diversions, so many distractions.
Attend well to Poirot as he peels them away like the skin of an onion.
Oh, herrings, onions.
Do get a wriggle on.
There's a good fellow.
Lord Boynton.
Your wife, she funded your expeditions as you went along, hein?
How much more efficient it would be to have the money all at once, non?
- What?
- There is no money.
Non, vraiment, monsieur.
For you, non, there never has been.
For the running of Boynton Hall, alors, is for you always most arduous.
No, Lady Boynton, she was always most munificent to your father but never towards his son.
You can stare at me significantly as long as you like, monsieur.
I've done nothing wrong.
Tell to Poirot what was in the bag.
What bag?
What did you agree to purchase from the ragged Arab boy?
LEONARD:
I remember the boy.
I don't remember what rubbish he was flogging.
Fortunately, Poirot, he does.
And from it he extracted this.
- Voilà.
- Voilà what?
Well, it's a tooth.
D'être precis, it is a molar taken from the upper jaw of St. John.
You will observe that it bears the traces of the filling of gold.
For this skull, it was supposed to masquerade as the skull of John the Baptist.
But, in fact, it is, as you say, M. Leonard, rubbish.
What the devil are you talking about, man?
This wasn't purchased from a hawker and planted.
This is untouched.
This entire sample was exhumed e situ intacto.
Forgive me, Poirot, but you're driveling utter bilge.
Pompous little Belgian.
My father has explained this object was discovered undisturbed.
It's a perfect fit.
Bon.
I don't understand.
All your life, Father traipsing about the Middle East, time after time finding absolutely nothing of significance.
I wanted it to end.
You dear, deluded, stupid man.
I never expected your wife's bloody money.
I never wanted it.
I wanted you to be free of this need, to find what you've been looking for.
You mind if I step out for a while?
- I'll come with you.
- No, no.
I simply wish to be alone for a moment.
Is that permitted?
Je vous en prie, monsieur.
Now the three of you.
The litany of cruelties you have endured, hein?
Well, the ceaseless humiliations.
You multiply these incidents by hundreds and thousands, and the corrosion of the spirit, it is inevitable and insupportable.
No wonder you wished to see Lady Boynton dead.
Indeed, Poirot, he overheard you, Mlle. Carol, and you, M. Raymond, whispering that your mother, she must die.
And you, Dr. King.
By your own admission, you also wished to see her dead.
You are a woman who has wasted time and is decided and determined to waste no more.
What do we know of you, M. Cope?
Me?
Will you show to me your passport?
Merci.
You choose to use your second Christian name and not your first.
Yes.
Why have you elected to do so, I wonder?
My first given name is ambiguous in terms of gender.
The spelling is different, but it's also a girl's name.
As a child, I found that tiresome.
I would suggest that there are many things about your childhood that you found tiresome,
M. Leslie Jefferson Cope.
I don't think we're sufficiently sorry.
The child that was thrashed so brutally on the orders of Lady Boynton was not a girl, as misremembered by her daughter Carol, non, but a boy by the name of Leslie.
If you know all that you'll also know that I didn't kill her.
Merely to deprive her of her life, monsieur, would afford for you satisfaction most scant.
No, you wanted to make her life unbearable, to degrade her, to hurt the woman, as... as she hurt you.
Lady Boynton was a person preoccupied with station and money, and you decided to strip her of them both.
So I may remain assured of your very best services.
Of what service did you wish to remain assured?
You have no newspapers of any description?
!
I am so sorry.
The withholding from Lady Boynton of the newspapers that would keep her ignorant of the panic that you yourself had inspired to ensure the destruction of her empire.
I'm just lousy at being intrepid.
Back at the hotel, you couldn't get a paper for love nor money.
And like the confidence trickster so accomplished, you invested in your own deceit.
You wrote off thousands of dollars of your own savings merely to blow smoke in the face of Poirot.
Oh.
M. Cope.
It seems I've lost quite a lot of money.
Alors.
Poirot has one more red herring left to fry.
And it is a fish most substantial.
Le colonel, mes amis, he is not a policeman but is retained by the Foreign Office.
His mission in Syria was to uncover and destroy the trafficking of female slaves, the abduction and sale of women for one purpose only.
- Pardonnez-moi, mesdames.
- I knew it.
- Arab women?
- Whatever the client ordered.
- White women?
- Yes.
They wanted me.
Hélas, mademoiselle.
It is the opinion of Poirot that there is a person who instructed his agent to search for a young lady who is Caucasian and resembled you exactement with your skin that is pale and your hair that is red.
Who is this agent, Poirot?
Is he here amongst us now?
Ah.
Certainement.
Mlle. Jinny, when you struck at your attacker that night, oh, you hit your target, hein?
It's okay.
The woman who befriended you so assiduously, it was she who was smothering your face!
Sister Agnieszka!
Rot in hell.
You, Sister, will face the consequences.
The key to the murder of Lady Boynton...
It is not who, it is when.
Dame Celia, do you have any children?
No, I do not.
I urge you to reconsider your answer, madame.
I cannot reconsider.
I have no children.
Well, then... madame, you are a liar.
You have a daughter, and she is amongst us now.
That is a filthy lie.
And in extremely poor taste.
So you disown her now as you did when she was a baby?
Reclaim her of your own volition!
You owe to her a debt of ungiven love.
I had no choice.
No choice.
What was your position in the household of Lady Boynton, in the days when she was Mrs. Pierce?
Huh?
- A junior maid.
- Oui.
C'est ça.
A servant of the lowest position whose duty it is to scrub.
Not to become pregnant by a guest of your employer.
The woman to whom you surrendered your child on the day of its birth.
Is it me?
Non, Mlle. Carol.
It is not you.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.
You gave birth to me and delivered me up to that bitch?
I came to save you.
How did you know this?
Mademoiselle, Poirot, he did not know for certain until this very moment.
Non, non, mademoiselle.
Mon colonel, Poirot, he is much obliged to you for the accounts of the household and the registry of immigration which shows that three weeks after the baby, it was born,
Celia Westholme arrived on the coast of Ireland to be taken care of by nuns.
Your child, she had been taken from you.
And so you were now to become invisible, to nurse your shame.
But you were not to be the outcast.
Oh, no.
You were to recreate yourself as a free spirit.
A writer, a traveler.
A success!
Dame Celia Westholme.
And every time you thought of your daughter, you consoled yourself with the hope that she... that she was happy.
But she had not begun life afresh.
She was not happy.
She remained as a prisoner in the household of Lady Boynton.
And your regret, it came flooding back, to boil in your heart.
Let me tell you a story.
It's the legend of Gilgamesh.
Gilgamesh was the most beautiful man in all creation.
And so you went in search of the father of your child, hein?
To Vienna.
So out of the way of your customary travels.
And together with this man, you agreed to investigate to see whether the cruelties of Lady Boynton, they were true.
And you discovered that all of the children had been tormented.
It was not the hornet that stung Lady Boynton.
How could it?
Sorry.
Might have been stung.
Ah!
The hornet, it was already dead.
You stung her with this.
Ah!
Which you then returned to Dr. Gerard, who had prepared it for you.
LADY BOYNTON:
I am stung!
He then cleaned it and discarded it in the tent of Nanny Taylor to implicate her.
T-This is colossal.
What...
What...
What was in the syringe?
A concoction of your own devising, Doctor, probably based on morphia.
You can't kill a woman the size of La Boynton with a thimbleful of morphia.
As you well know.
Doctor, you affect to know little of the administering of drugs, when, en effet, you are the expert.
You greet Poirot and ask him if he remembers you, hein, from Edinburgh... the bonce doctor with the beard?
Poirot, he remembers everything.
For when you took the witness stand in Edinburgh to speak on the life of the mind, the clerk of the court, he read out your qualifications.
And anesthesia, Doctor, was your discipline long before psychiatry.
No, of course you cannot kill Lady Boynton with such a dose.
But you can remove from her control of the nervous system.
The power over her movement.
The power over her speech.
And Lady Boynton, who professed herself a lover of the sun, was now roasting to death and could say nothing.
Ingenious, monsieur.
And commendably grotesque.
But Lady Boynton did not roast to death.
She was stabbed!
Your prestidigitation with drugs, Doctor, was not over yet.
You injected yourself to simulate the symptoms of malaria... symptoms so authentic that you fooled even Dr. King.
- Let me look at you.
- I'll be fine.
This gentleman needs to return to camp.
Mlle. Jinny, she attended you.
And how did you repay her for her kindness?
By giving to her another sedative of your own invention.
To consolidate your alibi.
Earlier, you had killed a goat and trapped a quantity of its blood in a ball of wax.
This object you secreted in the folds of the clothes of your victim, where in due course it would melt in the heat of the sun.
One can never have enough sun, huh?
What?
You could have killed her then.
But you wanted her to suffer for as long as possible.
Speak up, dear.
I can't help you if you don't speak up.
You used the ball of wax to confuse the time of death.
And it was this wax that Poirot, he discovered on the dress of Lady Boynton and on the floorboards and the little piece of pottery beneath her chair.
Wax which told to Poirot that there was an accomplice to the murder.
Et puis you waited patiently.
The wax, it melted.
The blood of the goat, it began to flow, suggesting to the naked eye that she had already been stabbed.
And at last, the cry, it went up to tell the world...
Help!
...that Lady Boynton was dead.
But she was not dead.
No.
Not yet.
- You the girl who's a doctor?
- Yes.
Then you've met death.
So have I.
Come on.
Only now was death to meet its victim.
And in the sight of everyone... ah, in the sight of Hercule Poirot himself you, Dame Celia, murdered Lady Boynton with your own hands, as prescribed by Dr. Gerard to quench your rage.
It took but a few seconds.
And even Dr. King was deceived into believing that Lady Boynton had died earlier that day.
If you please to empty the contents of your handbag.
Ah, oui.
And Dr. Gerard, he encouraged Poirot to seek for the chisel, hein?
Chisel fits the bill.
Whereas the murder weapon, it was in your hand all of the day.
DR. GERARD:
Goodness.
We did go to considerable trouble.
One question.
What makes you think any of this has any basis whatsoever in the truth?
Nanny Taylor.
Dear God!
Did I kill her as well?
Or was she one of yours?
You disordered her mind with a solution of mescaline so strong that the very speck of it made the head of Poirot to spin.
You wanted to promote in her hallucinations, to make her susceptible to suggestion.
You burdened her mind with so much shame and guilt that, given the opportunity, you knew that she would do harm to herself.
You know you can't go on.
After everything that you did.
Think what you helped her to do to little Jinny.
What did Nanny Taylor say to you?
Fa...
Fa...
Father?
This was not the ravings of a nervous breakdown.
For you yourself had told to her that you were the father of Mlle. Jinny.
Portrait of Mum and Dad.
You'll appreciate now why I declined your particular offer of affection.
Well, well.
This is a pickle.
Set out to save you.
Destroyed everything.
Thank you, Theo.
It's all part of the service.
No extra charge.
I never stopped loving you, you know?
Be careful with this one, Poirot.
Digitalis.
The action, as you will appreciate, is irreversible.
I'm so sorry.
We hoped it wouldn't come to this.
There, there.
There, there.
There, there.
There.
No, D-Doctor.
Look to the living.
They pay their bills quicker.
And they make better conversation.
JINNY: [ Sobbing ]
Monsieur.
Ah.
I've just been chatting to Lord Boynton.
And, um, he pronounces himself cured of his archaeology.
Chatting.
Oui.
M. Raymond, in the matter of Pandora, you will recall that after all the evils had escaped the box there was one other creature... very small, very frail... that followed them into the world.
Hope.
Au revoir, la jeunesse.
- M. Poirot.
- Mademoiselle.
Carol and I are going to Egypt to see the Sphinx.
Oh.
It's not much of an adventure, but we're doing it on our own.
It's a start.
It was actually my idea.
Lady Boynton would have said I was constitutionally too feeble, that my skin was too fair.
But I think it's probably time
I showed my feeble skin who's boss.
C'est bien, mademoiselle.
Before he leaves, you will permit an old man to pontificate?
Alors, mademoiselle, there is nothing in the world so damaged that it cannot be repaired by the hand of Almighty God.
I encourage you to know this, because without this certainty, we should all of us be mad.
Je vous salue, mademoiselle.
Au revoir.
SubRip:
HighCode
Lord Boynton!
Lord Boynton!
Hey!
(Shouting in Arabic)
Quoi?
!
(Speaking Arabic)
(Horse whinnies)
(Traders calling out)
Don't...
Don't speak.
Why not?
You've got sunstroke, you need to stay where you are, be quite still.
Actually what I need to do is sit, I think, and drink a lot of water.
Shukran.
I'm dehydrated.
I've sent for a doctor.
Already got one.
Sarah King, MD.
You're the fellow who's going to get sunstroke, walking around without a hat.
I just introduced myself.
- (Woman) Raymond.
- Ah, my-my mother needs me.
If you can't introduce yourself, perhaps you might introduce me to your mother?
Unlikely.
- Thè au citron, s'il vous plaît.
- Oui, monsieur.
- Chaud, très chaud.
- Oui.
Alas, madame, I am desolate.
You have no newspapers of any description?
!
I am so sorry.
(Woman) You don't know what sorry is!
Got you, you double-distilled blighter!
Colonel Carbury, mon vieux.
Poirot.
All these years travelling, you'd think I'd be used to creepy-crawlies by now.
I did not know that you were the enthusiast for I'antiquitè.
For what?
You have come also for the exploration of Lord Boynton?
Ah, no, no.
Passing through.
Vraiment?
To where do you pass, Colonel?
Here and there.
You know, here and then...
You know.
- There?
- Or thereabouts.
Absolutely.
(Door opens)
- Can I help you?
- Oh!
Agnieszka, you are such a fool.
I am looking for... number nine?
This is six.
So sorry, my dear, for my intrusion.
You are, er, come to follow the labours of Lord Boynton?
Yes, he's my stepfather.
Truly, God has smiled upon you.
Your stepfather does a great thing, I think.
A great man.
(Loud chatter, car horn beeps)
- Oh!
- (Car horn)
(American accent) So I may remain assured of your very best services?
Thank you very much, sir.
Americans.
Do know how to arrive, hm?
(Man) Silly little man!
- Please!
- Look here...
- Do you know who I am?
- (Protesting in Arabic) Pay fare!
I am the son of Lord Boynton.
Son of Lord, you pay, please.
Thank you, sir.
(Speaks Arabic)
Bloody shambles!
Typical.
If you...
- (Snores) - (Sighs)
- (Boy) It was an accident.
- (Child crying)
(Child wailing)
(Woman screaming)
(Panting)
Jinny...
It's all right, honey.
It's all right now.
I was being drowned.
It was a dream, baby, it was just a dream.
It was a memory!
I can't go on like this.
(Man shouting)
(Knock on door)
Twelve minutes.
- You allowed me to oversleep...
- Mother by twelve minutes!
- I'm sorry.
Fetch my stick.
Stick!
(Chatter)
Ah, excellent.
There you are.
It's Leonard.
Boynton.
Your stepson.
How good of you to come, Mr Boynton.
- Carol, my vitamins.
- Now, Mother?
Clearly.
Jinny, you look like you're suffering from consumption.
That's drawing attention to yourself in the most unattractive way.
Apply colour!
Raymond...
Don't sit there, sit here.
Nanny...
Go somewhere else.
You look tired, dear.
We need to discuss your attitude.
Sulking is like shyness.
It is unacceptable, it is showing off.
I'm not sulking, Mother.
I merely question the wisdom of travelling when the market is jittery.
Wall Street knows better than to breathe without consulting me, wherever I may be at whatever juncture.
I forgot my book.
Fetch my book.
You think they're a rum crew, wait till you meet the archaeologist husband.
Although he's not actually psychotic, just old-fashioned bonkers.
Theodore Gerard.
We have met.
Bonce doctor.
I advised on a case in Edinburgh.
Used to have a beard?
Oh.
Yes, of course.
The bonce doctor!
- I recognise you, monsieur.
- Of course, it's all a sham.
The real object of the exercise...
is a reconciliation of his offspring and hers.
- Happy families among the tombs.
- There is disharmony?
Where Lady Boynton is, the Music of the Spheres is like nails down a blackboard.
Now, you must excuse me my personal disorder...
Can't help sticking my face down the stupid lion's throat.
Do you mind if I join you?
(Sighs)
I can't find these wretched pills.
Oh God, Raymond.
She has them.
What?
She has them already, they're in her bag.
The book she sent me to find, she didn't even bring to Syria.
Carol, we know these games.
One day, Raymond...
I swear to God...
- I know.
- I will take a hammer and I swear...
Maybe we should talk about that.
- Don't joke with me, Ray.
- I'm your brother.
I never joke.
(Call to prayer)
(Raymond) The way we let that woman steal them from us.
(Carol) Oh, God, Raymond.
We have no choice.
(Raymond) She has to die.
(Traders calling out)
(Man speaking Arabic)
Now, we're going now!
Please!
Please!
Yes, sir.
Please, please, please.
Tickety-boo.
Please.
This way.
OK, OK.
(Speaking Arabic)
Whoo!
Looks like Lord Boynton's expedition has created quite a stir.
Apart from the family and a three-line whip...
Dr King joins us, I suspect, because she stuck a pin in a map of the world.
Mr Jefferson Cope may actually be a little bit dull.
He might possibly like old bits of bone and pot and whatnot.
The honourable Leonard, stuck with running his father's house in Dorset, on no income, while said father swans around the Middle East looking for the head of John the Baptist.
As for the Polish nun, she gives me the heebie-jeebies personally.
(Shouting in Arabic)
No problem, no problem.
Don't be afraid.
No problem.
(Shouting in Arabic)
No problem, no problem.
(Speaking Arabic)
(Camel grunts)
Hm.
What have we here, I wonder?
A mobile toll-booth?
Dame Celia Westholme.
Sorry to hold up the bus, everybody.
Camel's on loan, had to go back.
Has Boynton made any significant progress?
Does anybody know?
- Have you read any of her books?
- Oui.
It's her fault I'm here.
She makes travel sound so thrilling.
Ah.
(Shouting in Arabic)
Welcome, welcome, welcome.
Did you have a nice journey?
I know, it's ghastly, isn't it?
Hello, little blossoms.
Hot showers and cold beer for everyone.
Even you, Nanny, you raving old dipsomaniac.
- Leonard, dear boy!
- Father.
Ah.
My child bride.
Dinner's in the pavilion at eight.
Everyone's invited.
Come along!
Raymond.
Utter bonanza of crippled personalities.
I'd have paid extra for this.
(Distant shouting)
(Operatic singing on radio)
(Shouting)
Making yourself useful, Leonard?
Good man!
Coming along!
That blind chap down in the Arab camp, every night I hear him tell a variation on the same story.
I've heard it all over Syria.
The daughter of Herodius brought John the Baptist's severed head to this land.
She buried it where the river meets the mountain.
Now, I've been every damn place in Syria where any river meets anything that could possibly be construed as a mountain, from Krak to Aleppo.
This is the only place left.
It has to be here!
Come along then.
Chop-chop.
Ah...
And these words...
Do they speak of John?
No.
It tells a different story.
A man is sitting in a tavern in Damascus.
He looks up from his wine and sees Death staring at him across the room.
He cries out, "But this cannot be my time!"
He flees Damascus, he rides his horse fast, right across the desert to Samarra.
When he arrives, he's thirsty.
Standing before him at the well... is Death.
Hm.
You're nodding.
On seeing Death for the second time, the man cries out, "This cannot be!
"For I escaped you in Damascus."
And Death, he lays his hand upon the shoulder of the man and says, "I also was surprised to see you..."
"...to see you in Damascus...
"for my appointment with you, it was always to be here in Samarra."
Try as one might, one cannot escape one's rightful destiny.
Oui.
I know you're here, Johnny.
I can almost smell you.
Sugar, Raymond?
To put sugar in one's tea is indicative of weak character.
Raymond doesn't take sugar.
Oh, good morning.
You look dreadful.
- Thank you.
I feel dreadful.
- You should see a doctor.
- I just did.
He told me I had malaria.
- Oh, Lord!
I dosed myself up, as much as it makes a difference.
You shan't come on the expedition today?
If I have an attack on the way to the river,
I'll most probably die.
The obvious solution is to remain here all day with Lady Boynton.
- Better come with us.
- Not a difficult decision.
The sun is up.
I shall spend today observing from the platform.
Good idea, poppet.
Cracking view of the Kasbah.
You can keep a beady one on Leonard and myself.
You assist with the digging, monsieur?
Oh, I would assist with digging the drains if the alternative were enforced social intercourse with my father's ghastly ten-ton wife.
You won't come down to the river, Lady Boynton?
By all accounts, the vista of the Kasbah is very fine.
- The boy bring my Times yet?
- No, Mother.
Dismiss him!
- (Slap)
- Sorry, might have stung.
Ah!
I am stung!
Yes, there's the bugger there.
Goodness, let me look at you.
Don't touch me!
Never touch me!
You're always looking at me.
Golly, am I?
All the time.
I turn round and you're just looking at me.
Why?
Perhaps I like the shape of your face.
It's a very pretty face.
Do you mind?
I certainly shan't do it if you mind.
I don't mind.
(Poirot) S'il vous plaît, Monsieur Cope.
Do not allow Poirot to detain you.
Oh, I'm in no hurry.
The place has been there a few years, it's not going anywhere,
You are acquainted with the family Boynton?
One can't live in New York and fail to be acquainted with the Boyntons.
Lady B is a pretty big financial noise.
I like her.
If I may say so, monsieur, it seems your amitiè is not reciprocated.
Oh, she hates everybody.
Everybody knows that, she just doesn't give a damn.
- I think it's quite stylish.
- You have the outlook most benevolent.
I'm easily pleased.
(Sarah) Out in the sun yet again without a hat.
(Raymond) Some people never learn.
(Carol) Raymond, let me read you what Mr Baedeker has to say.
"The monumental edifice knows as..." Excuse me!
Thank you so much.
I thought that free from the mother
I might be permitted some conversation with Raymond.
But no.
Evidently the family has decided I'm a gold-digger, and all overtures of friendship must be stamped on.
Frankly it's rather insulting.
I'm not having it.
Ladies and gentlemen, now we may rest.
We have arrived. (Speaks Arabic)
(Agnieszka) God is good.
God is glorious.
If you want my professional opinion, which you don't, but you should, so I'm gonna give it to you anyway, your family would do well to hear what Herr Freud said to me last year.
"To be American is bad enough," he said, "but to put money..."
(Mutters)
Oh!
Let me look at you.
I'll be fine.
I'll be... fine.
This gentleman needs to return to camp immediately.
Get your hands off me, I'll be fine!
Doctors!
Think you know everything?
(Sarah) You're too hot.
(Gerard) You don't have to... carry me.
- Jinny!
- That's my name!
(Gerard) I just need a drink of water.
I can hear the gears grinding in the old cerebellum.
Not really.
I was just wondering how Lady Boynton managed to negotiate that ladder affair, it's pretty vertiginous.
Would it kill you to call her "Mother"?
For me.
Stepmother would do.
(Leonard) God, it's hot.
Yes, it is.
Perhaps you would be kind enough to take the lady in question a glass of water.
Father, look, I'm sorry, but are you genuinely blind to the way she treats... everyone, except you?
Now!
I say!
Would you like a drink?
Can we get you anything at all?
To drink?
(Quietly) Like a bucket of strychnine.
Get these buggers away from me!
I'm perfectly well.
Lie down.
- Ah...
- Doctor, what do we do?
What did he say?
He said bugger off.
Oh. (Chuckles) Right you are.
Can do.
Not you.
You stay.
- No, Jinny.
- Oh, God.
I thought...
- Yeah.
- I thought you wanted my company.
I do, yes.
That's exactly what I want.
Listen to me, it's not... you.
It's not about a conquest.
For me, denial... is a very... particular pleasure.
It's not... (Sighs)
(Music on gramophone)
People say travel broadens the mind.
Mainly because people like me insist on it in their books.
But I have to say I doubt that it is true.
On the contrary.
I suspect travel narrows the mind.
One becomes so blasè about the wonders of the world.
The more I travel the more clearly I understand that... all that ever matters is the people.
Not the places.
Those Arabs, telling stories over couscous in the camp.
They fascinate me.
This, it's pretty enough, but show me the humans every time.
I don't much care for her.
The way she hangs around the younger Boynton girl.
They sniff out weakness, nuns, and misery, and they gorge on it.
Bloody vampires in drag, quite frankly.
(Men shouting, distant)
Poirot!
How did you find the river?
- Oh, I...
- Good, good.
We haven't turned up any glories here, but we live in hope.
Nil carborundum, and all that.
And Lady Boynton, she has enjoyed her day?
Oh, yes, monsieur.
Of course, she always does.
The word "boredom" is simply not in the vocab.
Darling!
I think it's time you climbed down from your perch for a martini.
Poppet?
Shall we say about ten minutes?
You little minx. (Chuckles)
(Sighs)
(Greville) Help!
Help!
Et alors.
Ça commence.
(Greville) Help!
(Commotion outside)
- Are you the girl who's a doctor?
- Yes.
Then you've met death.
So have I. Come on.
Shut her eyes.
Shut them.
I'm afraid it's true.
She's dead.
Your appointment with death, madame.
It was always to be here.
Et maintenant, mon Colonel, you are arrived.
This is an event for which you were prepared.
Non?
No.
This is something else.
Later.
Show me the dead woman.
What happened here?
Excusez-moi, but do you commission me to examine this case?
I do.
You two getting married or something?
Mind if I have a gander at your patient?
- Are you recovered, Doctor?
- I'll manage.
Juicy big hole where there shouldn't be one.
Somebody's stuck her.
- Mm, a knife.
- Bigger than a knife.
Fatter blade.
- Chisel?
- Chisel fits the bill.
Whatever the implement, it was wielded with authority.
One blow in, then vigorously churned about to create maximum damage.
She can't have been dead for more than an hour.
Yes.
I don't know why that should be there.
It is wax.
Well, one thing's for certain.
She can't stay here in this heat.
I'll make arrangements for the body to be transported.
Un moment, s'il vous plaît, mon Colonel.
- Excusez-moi.
- Yes.
Already there is so much about this case that is wrong.
You, yourself are wrong.
You are not what you appear.
You are not a policeman, yet you know a crime has been committed before it had been reported.
You bear the rank of Colonel, yet where is it mon ami that you serve?
So enough of these crypticities.
Explain yourself to Poirot or he cannot accept this case.
Point.
- Crypticities?
- Oui.
Poirot, you're a foreigner.
But I judge you to be a good egg, and therefore trustworthy.
What I'm about to deal you now is a card you must keep very close to your chest.
Is that understood?
Oui.
You continue with the digging, monsieur?
I am given to understand it's what Lady Boynton would have wanted.
You were, I think...
Please to forgive me somewhere in this area this afternoon?
Poirot, could you postpone your interrogation of the obvious murder suspect so he can arrange some necessities for his distressed father?
Thank you so much.
Oh!
I understand you're looking for a chisel, yes?
Fill your boots.
(Celia reading in Arabic)
Dame Celia.
Lord Boynton.
What is it that you read?
I'm cheering the bereaved with judicious extracts from The Perfumed Garden.
Are people saying that I killed my wife?
Non.
Non, monsieur.
We are all united in our desire to comfort you.
I was always glad that I was older than Leonora.
I thought at least...
I'll die first.
I won't have the agony of trying to live without her.
Nevertheless, it must be admitted the death of Lady B is hardly detrimental to the community.
It is not well, monsieur, that a human should die before her time it is come.
En plus, the nanny Madame Taylor has the great distress.
All right, all right, keep your hair on.
For heaven's sake, I was just trying to lighten the mood.
How did you achieve your newspaper, Monsieur Cope?
Came with me.
Many thanks.
I'm just lousy at being intrepid.
Always so hungry for news of home.
Back at the hotel you couldn't get a paper for love nor money.
(Gerard) I know.
This may help you in times of stress.
Mon Colonel.
Your men.
When is it that they arrive?
- Midnight, I should think.
- Hm.
Then you must have them search this area at dawn.
The search most diligent.
All around.
Looking for what?
In the first place, mon ami, a syringe.
It is instrumental in the murder of Lady Boynton.
Right.
Good grief.
- It will be done.
- Bon.
You see, mon ami... the voices of the little grey cells.
They have begun to sing to Poirot.
(Chanting prayers)
(lnsects buzzing)
Slit throat.
Je comprends pas.
It is not the custom du pays to waste life and food in this manner?
Barbarous.
Monsieur.
- Monsieur.
- Monsieur.
Look, Poirot, sorry to be so stand-offish.
Bit grim seeing one's father cry.
Oui.
Je vous en prie, monsieur.
What do you want to know?
I should like for you to tell me if you spoke to your stepmother yesterday afternoon,
- and if so, when?
- Er, we spoke... about one o'clock, hottest part of the day.
Bon.
She'd been perched up there like some evil great pudding ever since you lot set off.
I say we spoke.
I spoke.
She ignored me.
Nothing unusual about that.
Can we get you anything at all?
To drink?
You know how it was.
One mustn't disturb her when she was taking the sun, but...
God help you if you neglected to do so.
- Monsieur.
- Oui.
- We found this syringe.
- Ah.
- Where was this discovered?
- In the tent occupied by the old lady.
The nanny.
Merci.
(Agnieszka) "And the Lord said unto the servant:
"Go out into the highways and compel them to come in to my feast..."
(Jinny) "...that my house may be filled."
It's a beautiful parable.
(Agnieszka) The word King James renders as "compel"
is in the Greek "anankadzo".
It means compel with violence.
The Spanish knew this.
They used this single word to justify every atrocity of their Inquisition.
For it is God's own command that those unwilling to enter His Kingdom should be persuaded in with pain.
That's terrible.
Compulsion of any kind, my dear.
It can be terrible.
(Jinny) I overheard my stepfather telling the story that was written here.
Of Death following the man across the desert.
Something has followed me here to this place.
Something evil.
God is here to guard you, Jinny.
He lives in every grain of sand.
(Man speaking in Arabic)
(Other men chant reply)
(Water splashing, child gasping)
(Music playing faintly on gramophone)
(Carbury) What is it now?
(Music stops)
Sorry gentlemen.
Sand in the grooves.
Quite.
Well, the Arabs are all accounted for.
Oui.
This case, it is most unsatisfactory.
Still plenty of suspects, old boy.
But almost all of them were outside of the camp when the murder it was committed.
And this is corroborated by a witness who is impeccable.
Me.
They were with Poirot all of the time.
Raymond wasn't.
He came back.
Bien sûr.
Cela je connais bien.
Oui.
Also Lord Boynton and his son.
Yes, yes, and tomorrow we begin the further interrogations.
That's a queer one.
Without doubt there is more to Monsieur Cope than he wishes to be known.
But in that desire, and in this company...
he is not unique.
(Woman screams)
(Overlapping voices)
(Carbury) Off in this direction.
(Raymond) Where did it come from?
Close all those gates down there.
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.
(Men shouting in Arabic)
Did you see anyone moving?
No.
Where did it come from?
It's got to be something.
(Jinny gasping)
(Carbury) Good Lord.
Get her inside, quickly!
(Carol) It's OK.
(Carbury) You men, over here.
Close all the exits!
Don't let anyone leave.
Sister Agnieszka!
Ohh...
- (Sobbing) - (Carol) It's OK.
It's OK.
It's OK.
Shh.
It's OK.
Everything's going to be OK.
Shh, shh.
Can I help?
(Agnieszka muttering)
It would be useful to know what she was trying to tell us.
She's not trying to tell us anything.
She's talking to God.
(Poirot) You have Polish?
You don't need Polish to spot a woman at her prayers.
Pretty needlework, Doc.
Shouldn't we be getting her back to the hotel?
- Ask Dr King.
- You're the senior physician here.
You're much prettier and you're handler with the cutlery.
Besides, the nun is your patient.
I've got my hands full with the loony nanny.
Well, this, what I've done, it's only temporary.
So yes, we should.
It would be helpful to Poirot for all of us to return.
- Ei veniam da.
- That's Latin.
"Forgive him"?
Poirot has little Latin, but it can also be, I think, "Forgive her".
- My men can track...
- Non, non...
There is no need to despatch your men, Colonel.
The assailant of Sister Agnieszka has not fled.
There was a man...
He followed me across the desert.
I woke up and... he was putting a bag over my head.
Slaver.
Bound to be.
People think the slave trade is finished.
It's not.
I've seen the Waiting Cave on the beach at Mangapwani.
One hundred souls crammed into a space hardly bigger than this tent.
I threw myself on the floor to get away.
When I looked up, I saw...
You saw Sister Agnieszka struggling with your attacker and...
Well, you tried to help her, and...
you struck at the man with what?
A rock.
Bon.
And in your terror, and in the dark, accidentally you struck your friend and protector.
Now, you try to get some sleep, if you can.
Because tomorrow we face the rigours of the return journey.
Come close, Jinny.
Let me tell you story.
This... is the legend of Gilgamesh.
Oh.
Shukran.
Will she be all right?
The nun?
Oh, God knows.
Will you?
I'm not wounded.
That's debatable.
Seems to be consensus that you killed your mother.
(Scoffs) Is that your view, Sarah?
Heavens.
Five consecutive words, culminating in my Christian name.
If you're going to be this garrulous, I shall have to ask you to be less familiar.
- Do you think I killed her?
- No.
No, but what I think is irrelevant.
He's the one you need to convince.
You're the authority on stories.
Tell me... what was it that got loose when Pandora opened the box?
- All the evils of the world.
- That's it.
Mm.
Madness, greed, shame.
Those guys.
My stepfather did pretty much the same thing when he took the cork out of that goddamn tomb.
And here you are, Poirot... kicking the contents all over town.
Did Lady Boynton...
harm you physically?
My mother had little recourse to violence.
She was too smart for that.
Instead, she just prised open the top of our skulls and raked her poisonous tongue through our brains.
No place to hide, Poirot.
Even in your own head.
Ever.
Carol, Carol grew up petrified, did her best to ingratiate herself, you know, to win approval, which she never got.
Jinny just... was terrified to the point of madness and possibly beyond.
(Child gasping and choking)
Did you murder your mother, monsieur?
No.
But only because I lacked the moral courage.
She was a monster, Poirot.
It was her pleasure, always, to watch us suffer.
Why was she driven to be so cruel?
- To punish us, I guess.
- For what offence?
For being someone else's kids.
It's true.
We were adopted.
All of us.
It is no crime against God or nature to be an orphan.
Oh, but it is, monsieur.
It is a hideous crime.
Lady Boynton - Mrs Pierce as she was then - she wanted to have children so badly.
But between her and Mr Pierce, they couldn't make it happen.
For Mom, adoption was the only route.
But once she'd assembled her family of which there were many candidates... (Raymond crying)
Don't!
It was an accident.
(Carol)... and rejected a great number... (Beating and child crying)
Yes, monsieur, there were many children who were presented to us as new siblings, only to be removed a day later...
- (Screaming)
- One child stayed longer than the others but the beatings went on, until she also disappeared.
So there we were, we lucky few.
Raymond, Carol and Jinny.
Je comprends pas.
Mademoiselle Jinny, she was not even born.
Who was this other child?
I don't know.
I can't remember.
Who was that little girl?
Unacceptable goods.
(Beating and child screaming)
(Knock on door)
Merci.
Who was the child that you beat, madame?
Can you tell it to Poirot?
Lesley.
Yes.
Lesley.
Can you tell to me about Lesley, Madame?
You had to beat her.
She needed to be punished.
I did what was required... of me.
(Screaming and crying)
I don't think we're sufficiently sorry.
Not by a long chalk.
Again, Nanny.
(Nanny) God, she was an evil woman.
And Lesley, madame?
What became of her?
She is alive?
Fa...
Fa...
Father!
I'm not your father, my dear.
But I'll do my best.
Can you get me that bag?
I'll do my best to make you comfortable.
All right?
Thank you.
Bog standard sedative.
Check it if you want, Poirot.
Come on.
There's a good girl.
Oh, Monsieur Cope.
Monsieur, do you have a moment?
- But of course.
- I, er...
I don't know if this has any relevance to, er... what's been going on, but... it seems I've lost quite a lot of money.
Monsieur Cope, je suis desolè.
No, no, that's OK.
What's of interest is that the stock that's gone down the pan is The Pierce Holding Company.
- Non.
- Yes.
Lady Boynton's outfit.
Fireproof, bombproof, the safest bet on Wall Street.
I myself invested substantially.
Seems that there's been this rumour about the true value of the company.
These things, they come and go.
Lady Boynton'd generally get up on her hind legs, tell everyone to sit up straight.
It'd all calm down.
But she wasn't there.
The rumour became a panic, then a stampede to get out.
The whole outfit's bust to hell.
The shares are worthless.
(Men shouting)
Oh God, here comes that ghastly little Belgian, wringing his hands like the cowman come to collect his Christmas box.
- He's being respectful, Father.
- He's being a damned nuisance.
Monsieur.
Come for a nightcap among the bereaved?
Non, merci, Lord Boynton, quand-même.
Oh for God's sake, sit down, Poirot, you're giving me indigestion, hovering like that.
Merci.
I suppose it is quite proper that I should be questioned.
I was on the spot at the time.
And I imagine I inherit my wife's estate, so...
And the estate of Lady Boynton.
Of what does this principally consist?
God knows.
I never had charge of the money.
Leonora just subbed the digging as it went along.
Do you know, Leonard?
Raymond would have a clearer idea of value but it must add up to a few quid.
You disagree, monsieur?
Since we have been in Syria, there has been the financial collapse catastrophique.
The Pierce Holding Company is utterly disintegrated.
It seems that the death of Lady Boynton was not enough.
It also seems that... she has been obliterated from the earth.
It may surprise you to know, Mr Poirot, that I am not unaware that Lady Boynton was not universally adored.
Like many women who know their own mind, she found it all too easy to make enemies.
She did not make an enemy of me.
I loved her.
I am not ashamed to say so to you or to my son.
Was it necessary to air that observation in quite that way?
The methods of Poirot, monsieur, cannot always be agrèable.
Mesdames.
Excusez-moi, Dame Celia.
Were you acquainted with Lady Boynton before encountering her at the tomb?
Well, I'd seen her about.
Where had you seen her, madame?
Lady Boynton was pointed out to me by a man at a party who then preceded to tell me rather a lot about her.
About the way, in particular, she treated her children.
I decided then that I had no wish to further acquaintance with the woman.
She sounded perfectly odious.
Who was this man that was so well-informed?
I didn't get his name.
I wanted her dead, too.
Just in case you were wondering.
She was clearly blocking my way.
Raymond couldn't even look me in the eye with her still in existence.
So do you commend yourself to me as a suspect, mademoiselle?
I commend myself to you as one who has recently invested a great deal of time in a relationship that was always heading nowhere.
I now know that when I find something I want, I must act to take it.
(Celia) Bravo!
Sadly, all this resolution has taken your mind off the game.
Little trick I learnt the other day in Vienna.
You see?
Just when you least expect it, the church comes storming back.
Checkmate.
I didn't know you smoked.
I don't.
I've given up.
Since you threw the cigarette away, you've given up?
Your determination is impressive.
All six seconds of it.
Keep talking, I could go ten.
If I hadn't spoken, would you just have kept watching me?
We'll never know.
You're a strange man.
Does that matter?
Not necessarily.
- Raymond.
- Yeah.
Now is the time to kiss me.
Yeah.
(Speaks Arabic) Anybody in here who isn't dead?
(Agnieszka praying)
(Continues praying)
(Footsteps)
(Stops abruptly)
(Agnieszka resumes)
(Men shouting)
They have him, by God!
They have found the head of John!
News that is astonishing, monsieur.
I must return to Ain Musa immediately.
Is there a problem?
Nanny Taylor has drowned herself in the bath.
- Suicide.
- Oh, my God.
That's awful news.
Is somebody... dealing with it?
Oui, monsieur.
Because I must...
I must get back to the dig, I can't...
you know.
Oui.
Moral of the story:
If you want your death to attract the concern of your employer, make sure you're 2,000 years old.
Oh!
I keep meaning to give you something.
It's the details of the immigration you needed.
And on the back there's a list of employees.
Merci.
As requested, I've had a word with Mahmoud.
Some of his boys are privately saying that there was some character lurking about on the ladder that afternoon.
An Arab.
Not one of them.
But that was a good hour or so before the time of death.
This case is a mess, Poirot.
Not so, mon ami.
This case...
When Poirot has almost given up scrabbling for purchase on its shell of armour... boff... it opens to him like a flower.
Good Lord.
So...
What do we do?
We do what the murderer least expects Poirot to do.
We return to the dig.
All of us.
(Chattering)
(Carbury) Ahem!
This case, mes amis, it is full of the red... fish.
(Gerard) Herrings, possibly?
Merci.
There's so many diversions, so many distractions.
Attend well to Poirot as he peels them away like the skin of an onion.
Herrings, onions, do get a wriggle on, there's a good fellow.
Your wife, she funded your expeditions as you went along.
How much more efficient it would be to have the money all at once, non?
- What?
- There is no money.
Non, vraiment monsieur, for you there never has been.
For the running of Boynton Hall, alors, is for you always most arduous.
Lady Boynton, she was always most munificent to your father but never towards his son.
You can stare at me significantly as long as you like, monsieur.
I've done nothing wrong.
Tell to Poirot what was in the bag.
What bag?
What did you agree to purchase from the ragged Arab boy?
I remember the boy, I don't remember what rubbish he was flogging.
Fortunately, Poirot, he does.
And from it he extracted... this.
- Voilà.
- Voilà what?
Well, it's a tooth.
(Poirot) D'être precis, it is a molar taken from the upper jaw of St John.
You will observe that it bears the traces of the filling of gold.
For this skull it was supposed to masquerade as the skull of John the Baptist.
But in fact it is as you say, Monsieur Leonard, rubbish.
What the devil are you talking about, man?
This wasn't purchased from a hawker and planted.
This is untouched.
This entire sample was exhumed e situ intacto.
Forgive me, Poirot, but you're drivelling utter bilge, pompous little Belgian.
As my father has explained, this object was discovered undisturbed.
It's a perfect fit.
I don't understand.
All your life, Father, traipsing about the Middle East... time after time finding absolutely nothing of significance.
I wanted it to end.
You dear, deluded, stupid man.
I never expected your wife's bloody money.
I never wanted it.
I wanted you to be free of this need.
To find what you've been looking for.
Do you mind if I step out for a while?
- I'll come with you.
- No, no.
I simply wish to be alone for a moment.
Is that permitted?
Je vous en prie, monsieur.
Now the three of you.
The litany of cruelties you have endured.
The ceaseless humiliations.
(Beating, child screaming)
You multiply these incidents by hundreds and thousands.
The corrosion of the spirit, it is inevitable and insupportable.
(Child sobbing)
No wonder you wished to see Lady Boynton dead.
Indeed Poirot, he overheard you, Mademoiselle Carol, and you, Monsieur Raymond, whispering that your mother... must die.
And you, Dr King...
By your own admission, you also wished to see her dead.
You are a woman who has wasted time and is determined to waste no more.
What do we know of you, Monsieur Cope?
Me?
Will you show to me your passport?
Merci.
You choose to use your second Christian name and not your first?
- Yes.
- Why is that, I wonder?
My first given name is ambiguous, in terms of gender.
The spelling is different but it's also a girl's name.
As a child I found that tiresome.
I suggest that there are many things about your childhood that you found...
"tiresome",
Monsieur Leslie...
Jefferson Cope.
(Child crying and screaming)
I don't think we're sufficiently sorry.
The child that was thrashed... so brutally, on the orders of Lady Boynton, was not a girl, as misremembered by her daughter Carol, non... but a boy... by the name of Leslie.
If you know all that, you'll also know that I didn't kill her.
Merely to deprive her of her life would afford for you satisfaction most scant.
No, you wanted to make her life unbearable.
To degrade her, to hurt the woman, as she hurt you.
Lady Boynton was a person preoccupied with station and money and you decided to strip her of them both.
So I may remain assured of your very best services?
(Poirot) Of what service in particular did you wish to remain assured?
You have no newspapers of any description?
!
I am so sorry.
(Poirot) The withholding from Lady Boynton of the newspapers... that would keep her ignorant of the panic that you yourself had inspired to ensure the destruction of her empire.
I'm just lousy at being intrepid.
Back at the hotel you couldn't get a paper for love nor money.
And like the confidence trickster so accomplished, you invested in your own deceit.
You wrote off thousands of dollars of your own savings, merely to blow smoke in the face of Poirot!
Oh, Monsieur Cope.
It seems I've lost quite a lot of money.
Alors, Poirot has one more red herring left to fry.
And it is a fish most substantial.
Le Colonel, mes amis, he is not a policeman but is retained by the Foreign Office.
His mission in Syria was to uncover and destroy the trafficking of female slaves.
The abduction and sale of women for one purpose only.
- Pardonnez-moi, mesdames.
- I knew it!
Arab women.
Whatever the client ordered.
- White women?
- Yes.
They wanted... me?
Helas, mademoiselle.
It is the opinion of Poirot... that there is a person who instructed his agent to search for a young lady who is Caucasian and resembled you.
Exactement.
With your skin that is pale and your hair that is red.
Who is this agent, Poirot?
Is he here amongst us now?
Certainement!
Mademoiselle Jinny, when you struck at your attacker that night, you hit your target.
It's OK.
The woman who befriended you so assiduously... it was she who was smothering your face!
Sister Agnieszka!
Rot in hell!
You, Sister, will face the consequences.
The key... to the murder of Lady Boynton... it is not who, it is when.
Dame Celia, do you have any children?
No, I do not.
I urge you to reconsider your answer, madame.
I cannot reconsider.
I have no children.
Madame, you are a liar.
You have a daughter and she is amongst us now.
That is a filthy lie.
And in extremely poor taste.
So you disown her now, as you did when she was a baby?
Reclaim her of your own volition!
You owe to her a debt of ungiven love!
I had no choice.
No choice.
What was your position in the household of Lady Boynton?
In the days when she was Mrs Pierce?
Hm?
- A junior maid.
- Oui, c'est ça.
The servant of the lowest position whose duty it is to scrub.
Not to become pregnant by a guest of your employer.
The woman to whom you surrendered your child on the day of its birth.
Is it me?
Non, mademoiselle Carol.
It is not you.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.
You gave birth to me?
And delivered me up to that bitch?
I came... to save you.
How did you know this?
Mademoiselle, Poirot he did not know for certain.
Until this... very moment.
Non, non, non, mademoiselle.
Mon Colonel, Poirot he is much obliged to you for the accounts of the household and the registry of immigration which shows that three weeks after the baby was born,
Celia Westholme arrived on the coast of Ireland, to be taken care of by nuns.
Your child, she had been taken from you, and so you were now to become invisible, to nurse your shame.
But you were not to be the outcast.
Oh, no.
You were to recreate yourself as a free spirit.
A writer, a traveller.
A success.
Dame Celia Westholme.
And every time you thought of your daughter, you consoled yourself with the hope that she was happy but she had not begun life afresh, she was not happy.
She remained as a prisoner in the household of Lady Boynton.
(Water splashing)
(Child choking)
And your regret, it came flooding back... to boil in your heart.
Let me tell you a story.
This... is the legend of Gilgamesh.
Gilgamesh was the most beautiful man in all creation.
So you went in search of the father of your child, to Vienna, so out of the way of your customary travels, and together with this man, you agreed... to investigate to see whether the cruelties of Lady Boynton they were true.
And you discovered that all of the children had been tormented.
It was not the hornet that stung Lady Boynton.
How could it?
- Sorry, might have been stung.
- Ah!
The hornet, it was already dead!
You stung her... with this... (Lady Boynton) Ah!
(Poirot)... which you then returned to Dr Gerard, who had prepared it for you.
(Lady Boynton) I am stung!
He then cleaned it and discarded it in the tent of Nanny Taylor, to implicate her.
(Scoffs) This is... colossal!
Wh-What was in the syringe?
A concoction of your own devising, Doctor, probably based on morphia.
You can't kill a woman the size of La Boynton with a thimbleful of morphia.
As you well know.
Doctor, you affect to know little of the administering of drugs, when en effet you are the expert.
You greet Poirot and ask him if he remembers you from Edinburgh.
The "bonce doctor," huh, with a beard?
Poirot, he remembers everything.
When you took the witness stand in Edinburgh to speak on the mind, the clerk of the court, he read out your qualifications.
Anaesthesia, Doctor, was your discipline, long before psychiatry.
No, of course you cannot kill Lady Boynton with such a dose, but you can remove from her control of the nervous system.
The power over her movement.
The power over her speech.
And Lady Boynton, who professed herself a lover of the sun... was now roasting to death and could say nothing.
Ingenious, monsieur, and commendably grotesque.
But Lady Boynton did not "roast to death".
She was stabbed.
Your prestidigitation with drugs, Doctor, was not over yet.
You injected yourself to simulate the symptoms of malaria.
Symptoms so authentic that you fooled even Dr King.
- I'll be fine!
- This gentleman needs to return to camp.
Mademoiselle Jinny, she attended you.
And how did you repay her for her kindness?
By giving to her another sedative of your own invention, to consolidate your alibi.
Earlier, you had killed a goat and trapped a quantity of its blood in a ball of wax.
This object you secreted in the folds of the clothes of your victim, where in due course it would melt in the heat of the sun.
One can never have enough sun, huh?
- (She whimpers)
- What?
You could have killed her then, but you wanted her to suffer for as long as possible.
Speak up, dear.
I can't help you if you don't speak up.
You used the ball of wax to confuse the time of death, and it was this wax that Poirot, he discovered on the dress of Lady Boynton, and on the floorboards and the little piece of pottery beneath her chair.
Wax which told to Poirot that there was an accomplice to the murder.
Et puis, you waited patiently.
The wax, it melted, the blood of the goat it began to flow, suggesting to the naked eye that she had already been stabbed.
And at last the cry it went up to tell the world... (Greville) Help!
...that Lady Boynton was dead, but she was not dead.
Non, not yet.
- Are you the girl who's a doctor?
- Yes.
Then you've met death.
So have I. Come on.
Only now...
was Death to meet its victim.
And in the sight of everyone, in the sight of Hercule Poirot himself... you, Dame Celia, murdered Lady Boynton with your own hands, as prescribed by Dr Gerard to quench your rage.
It took but a few seconds.
Even Dr King was deceived into believing that Lady Boynton had died earlier that day.
If you please to empty the contents of your handbag.
(Poirot) Ha.
Ah, oui.
And Dr Gerard, he encouraged Poirot to seek for the chisel.
Chisel fits the bill.
Whereas the murder weapon it was in your hand all of the day.
Goodness.
We did go to considerable trouble.
One question - what makes you think any of this has any basis whatsoever in the truth?
Nanny Taylor.
Dear God!
Did I kill her as well or was she one of yours?
You disordered her mind with a solution of mescaline so strong that the very speck of it made the head of Poirot to spin.
You wanted to promote in her hallucinations to make her susceptible to suggestion.
You burdened her mind with so much shame and guilt that given the opportunity you knew that she would do harm to herself.
You know you can't go on... after everything that you did.
Think what you helped her do to little Jinny.
(Child choking)
What did Nanny Taylor say to you?
Fa...
Fa...
Father!
This was not the ravings of a nervous breakdown.
For you yourself had told to her... that you were the father of Mademoiselle Jinny.
Portrait of Mum and Dad.
You'll appreciate now why I declined your particular offer of affection.
(Sighs) Well, well.
This is a pickle.
We set out to save you and destroyed everything.
- Thank you, Theo.
- It's all part of the service.
No extra charge.
I never stopped loving you, you know.
Be careful with this one, Poirot.
Digitalis.
The action, as you will appreciate, is irreversible.
I'm so sorry.
We hoped it wouldn't come to this.
(Gasps)
There, there, there.
There, there.
There.
(Gasps) No.
Don't, Doctor.
(Grunts) Look to the living.
They pay their bills quicker and they make better... conversation.
(lnhales)
(Jinny sobbing)
Monsieur.
I've just been chatting to Lord Boynton.
He pronounces himself "cured of archaeology".
- "Chatting."
- Oui.
Monsieur Raymond, in the matter of Pandora, you will recall that after all the evils had escaped the box, there was one other creature very small, very frail, that followed them into the world.
Hope.
Au revoir, la jeunesse.
- Monsieur Poirot.
- Mademoiselle.
Carol and I are going to Egypt, to see the Sphinx.
It's not much of an adventure, but we're doing it on our own.
It's a start.
It was actually my idea.
Lady Boynton would've said I was constitutionally too feeble, that my skin was too fair but I think it's probably time I showed my feeble skin who's boss.
C'est bien, mademoiselle.
Before he leaves, you will permit an old man to pontificate.
Alors, mademoiselle, there is nothing in the world so damaged that it cannot be repaired by the hand of Almighty God.
I encourage you to know this because without this certainty, we should all of us... be mad.
Je vous salue, mademoiselle.
Au revoir.
til death season3 episode05
What is up with you?
I thought it was a perfectly delightful auction.
Ok,you know what?
I can deal with you bidding on the 25-Pound wheel of cheese,
But putting me in the back so it can ride shotgun,not cool.
Don't be offended.
I just wanted to make sure the cheese had an air bag.
That's great.
Seriously,cheese does not know how to brace itself for a collision.
You do.
All i know is the woodcocks won a night downtown with--
With dinner and theater tickets and a night at a trendy hotel.
Meanwhile,i don't know which one of us gets to sleep next to you tonight.
Come on.You know our bed is way too warm for cheese.
Honey,look,i don't think you really appreciate what this is here.
Now,come on,feel it.
Rub your hand along the waxy protective coating.
Imagine the creamy tenderness within.
And then imagine the balloon procedure you're gonna have after consuming all of that.
Don't listen to her.
You and i are gonna have a lot of fun.
You know what?
Call me old-Fashioned,but i always thought you'd leave me for another woman.
So listen,when we got home,
We looked at our calendar and realized my sisters are coming to visit next weekend,
So we can't use our night out downtown,
And we wanted to offer it to you guys.
- That's great.
- No,thank you.
Could you clarify what you have against a night downtown and tickets to a show?
Honey,i hate musicals.
You know that.
I mean,do you ever really believe that the male lead likes girls?
Come on.
We would love it.
Thank you very much.
Let me give you some money.
- Oh,no,no,no.
- Don't worry about it.
It was our dumb mistake.
It's for the school anyway.
You can just have it.
That's--That's incredibly sweet.
Take our cheese.
As a token.
That is awesome.
You know,i've been eyeing' this cheese all night.
What just happened?
That's ok.
I don't know if we have room for it in our fridge.
Steph,are you kidding?
We'll make room.
What about all my batteries?
Batteries don't have to be refrigerated.
Oh,and your macrobiotic shampoo does?
That stuff contains living yeast cultures.
It's alive,steph,and my alopecia would be running wild without it.
Eddie,just give them the cheese.
I--You know what?
I don't want to.
Please,don't worry about it.
Give them the cheese.
But i love it.
All right.Here.
Just take it.
But if i hear that any of that ended up on top of a salad,
Everyone's in trouble.
Everyone!
Aw,how fantastic was that meal?
I know.Chocolate mousse with cayenne pepper,is it chocolaty?
Is it spicy?
It's both,you kooky chef.
I wish you could have seen how on i was tonight at intermission.
The guy at the urinal next to me,
He laughed so hard,he broke stream 3 times.
I'm sure you were funny,babe.
Aw,you know what?
I have to tell you,at first,i was dreading this evening,
But i have to say it's turned out pretty amazing.
Ah,it sure has.
I love you.
I love you,too.
Did you hear that?
We just said,"i love you,"
And neither of us is being wheeled into minor surgery.
I know.
Dare i say that there is something magical happening to us tonight?
We're half an hour away from home,and somehow we've been transformed.
I mean,look at me.
I haven't worn this outfit in years.
In the suburbs,i would just look like a prostitute.
You would.
You look incredibly slutty.
And maybe later in the hotel,i'll throw you a freebie.
Oh,that's good,'cause i don't have that kind of cash on me.
Eddie,wait a second.
Maybe someday when-
- You know,when you're done teaching,
We don't need that big house to take care of.
We should buy an apartment down here.
Well,why would we do that?
Well,just think about it,how great it would be.
We can walk to restaurants.
We can go to theater.
I mean,look at us tonight.
We could have a great life downtown.
Oh,i couldn't live in the city.
I mean,there are more chihuahuas here than people,
And you can't even go grocery shopping.
You can only take 2 bags,and you gotta wheel it home in one of those little carts.
No,no,no.That's old-Lady stuff.
Ok,wait.So you can't even discuss the idea of moving--
What could we even afford downtown?
A box.
A box,joy.
You know i can't go to the bathroom when i'm just a couple inches away from you.
I need a-
- A one-Room buffer zone.
I can't believe how stubborn you're being about this.
But you're not even making any sense.
Do you realize we couldn't even fit our sectional into an apartment?
Ok,there are these things.
I don't know if you've heard of them.
They're called furniture stores.
We could actually buy a new couch.
Ok,you are now officially insane.
It's taken countless hours of watching "shawshank redemption" to mold that couch to my ass,
And we're just gonna throw that all away?
Are you so afraid of change,
You're not even willing to entertain the idea of something new and exciting?
I'm not afraid.
We already have a home,and it's perfectly lovely.
Ok,so that's it?
Just no?
I'm gonna have to die in that house?
"That house"?
That's our house.
You're gonna die in that house,
I'm gonna die in that house,and we're gonna like it.
You know what?
I can't--I-
- I have to be alone,ok?
I will meet you in the hotel.
- What are you
- Taxi!
W-Wait.
But what about the hotel sex?
You're really in your own little world,aren't you?
So you didn't even get hotel sex?
Nope.
Too bad.
I love me my hotel sex.
If you focus on the strange furniture and nothing else,
It's almost like having an affair.
Yeah,well,it didn't happen.
So what was this big fight about?
All right.Well,the--
Cheese me,heidi.
Try it with some pear.
Just the cheese,please.
All right,well,it actually first was a-
- Really a magical night,
And then we start walkin' back to the hotel,
And joy brings up the idea of us movin' to the city someday,
To which i say no way in hell,to which she gives me a rather graphic hand gesture.
Ng story short,no boom-Boom for the big man.
And all this was over moving into the city someday?
Yep.
You lost out on glorious,
Dirty hotel sex because of a hypothetical fight about something
That is not happening now and probably never will?
I gather you think i made a poor decision.
That i do.
She cornered me.
I had to stake my claim.
But anything could happen in the future.
You could get divorced.
I could support myself with my irish dancing.
Look,ed,i know you like to be right all the time,but in a hypothetical fight,
All you ever have to do is say yes to whatever.
Yes gets you sex.
No gets you no sex and a room full of dudes eating' cheese.
See,i've only been married one year,and even i know that.
It's like me and steph had this big fight one night over what to name our kids.
She is all into gaylord.
I mean,like i'm gonna really name my kid gaylord.
Gaylord woodcock.
She's really not leaving anything to chance,is she?
But i realized we are not having kids for years.
So i said yes.
I got all the points for being a great guy.
And i'll fight that stupid-Ass name when she's all drugged up in the hospital.
Hey,todd,you agree with this?
Oh,yeah.
My wife thinks her mother's moving in with us when she gets old.
That woman's either dying before or on the way to my house.
Really?
So i'm just supposed to give in?
When it's all hypothetical,just be the hero and throw your lady a yes'm.
Hello.
You know,this drawer is doing that thing where it sticks again,
But i guess i'm gonna have to get used to it,
Because i'm gonna be here for the rest of my life.
Which actually isn't gonna be that long,because when i do get it open,
I'm gonna stab myself with the first knife i see.
You know,apropos to that,i've been doing some thinking about this downtown thing,
And maybe much like our faulty drawer,i,too,may get stuck in my ways.
You know,you're the one with the vision,joy.
You're the one who said we should carpet the basement,and i fought you.
Oh,i fought you like an angry monkey.
But you were right,and i'll be damned if you're not right about this.
So let's do it.
Let's move downtown someday.
Really?
A-Are you serious?
Absolutely.
The big city!
Someday.
But what about all that stuff about this being our home?
Oh,honey,you know what?
I realized that any place is our home as long as it has you and my shower chair.
Oh,honey,i--I know that you're always a little afraid of change,
But this is gonna be so great for us.
It's gonna be like chapter 2 of our relationship.
Aw,baby,if chapter 2 is anything like chapter one,i can't wait.
Not that crazy about chapter 3,'cause that's probably where one of us dies.
Oh,god.
I'm so excited about this.
I mean,there's-
- There's so much that we can do down there.
We can join the art museum,and they're always having those jazz cocktail hours,
And we can go to film festivals.
And we can run up and down the "rocky"steps over and over again.
Oh,baby,i'm so sorry that we got in such a big fight over this.
Oh,me,too,but we're gonna be livin' downtown,
Laughin' about this fight someday.
In the meantime,i believe i owe you some hotel sex.
Really?
And how do we exactly replicate the hotel aspect of the sex?
Well,here's what we're gonna do.
Yes?
We're gonna turn off the lights and do what we need to do,
And then every 10 minutes,i'm gonna knock on the wall and yell,"housekeeping.
I'm gonna put on my fluffy robe.
Hey,you.
Hey,you.
Would it be inappropriate to send you a thank-You note
For your craftsmanship in the bedroom last night?
Hey,can i come in kinda quick?
What's happening?
Need to get this the hell out of my life.
Jeff's in the shower.
When he gets out,i'm telling him a neighbor's dog ran into the kitchen,
Ate it,and ran off to die in a distant field.
Ok,that's not a good story.
It is if you people back me up.
Okey-Dokey.
Hello,old friend.
I'm gonna put you on a doughnut.
Ok,i have about 7 minutes while jeff does his mud mask.
So tell me,how was the night out downtown?
Oh,it turned out really great.
In fact,don't get too used to us as neighbors,
Because we're actually thinking of moving down there.
In a magical time called someday.
Really?
We would miss you guys.
We would miss you so much.
You know,it's funny you're bringing this up,
Because a girlfriend of mine from yoga
Is a realtor for this big condo complex they're building downtown.
What?
Yeah.It's not gonna be ready for years,
But she said if you get in before they break ground,
You can get an amazing deal.
They're showing model units this weekend.
Oh,my god.
Is this a sign or what?
Eddie,we gotta check that out.
Yeah,yeah,we--We gotta.
Thank you for telling us about this great opportunity.
Asses!
Ho,what's that about?
Well,i took your advice about how to handle my hypothetical problem,
And i told joy that we would be moving to the city someday,
And then your wife comes over and tells her about this great,
Hot condo deal,and now i'm actually moving downtown,asses!
It sounds like your hypothetical problem is no longer hypothetical.
How did your glorious brain get wasted teaching dodgeball?
I did not see this comin'.
Is that my cheese?
No,it's mine.
Some crazy dog ate your cheese.
So joy talked with this realtor,
And it turns out that we're touring this model apartment tomorrow.
What am i gonna do?
I really don't know.
Hello.
This possibility didn't occur to any one of you?
Well,to be honest,i wasn't really listening that hard.
I was kinda thinking about what i was gonna have for dinner.
I'm gonna have to live in the city.
Do you think this body could climb down a fire escape?
I'm gonna burn,boys.
I'm gonna burn hard.
Ended up goin' with beef stew.
- Um,and you
- Me?
Yes,you.
Steph just had to give us the big,fancy night downtown,
And steph had to tell joy about the condo deal.
You know what?
This is your cheese,and it's delicious.
Look at this.
The towers at boathouse row.
How cool is that?
We could be living in a building with their own mini pencils.
I can finally write my tiny novel.
Ok,so listen.
The woman that i talked to said that these units were 80% sold,
So we have to be prepared to move.
I brought the checkbook.
Oh,you did,you crazy kid.
Give me that.
- Is everything ok?
- Yeah.
Yeah,everything is great.
It's just,you know,being downtown,
You know,the energy,i'm all hopped up.
What is it about being in the city that brings out such honesty?
I feel like i could tell you anything,like i don't wanna live in the city.
Wait.What?
You said that you loved this idea.
Yeah,i know,honey,but you said we would do it someday,not now.
You see,someday has that nice implied never going for it,
Where now is really,really soon.
So basically you never wanted to move here?
That is correct.
You just made me think that you would move
So i'd get all fancy on you in the bedroom?
Wh-Wh--How dare you?
Yes.
Wh-Wh-
- Nipple and hair!
Nipple and hair!
Nipple--
Randy?
I spoke to you earlier.
Joy and eddie stark.
Oh,yes,yes,yes.
Hello.Welcome.Welcome.
So this is our one-Bedroom model,
And i'm happy to say demand has been so great,
We're already selling units in building 7,so.
All right,let me show you around a little bit.
Granite countertops are standard,
As are top-Of-The-Line stainless-Steel appliances.
Here's a feature that i love.
It's a plasma.
Could you do that again?
Sure.
And once more,if you would.
- So,uh,randy.
- Yes.
- This is--The living,dining,kitchen area.
- Yes.
What is this big area right here?
Oh,uh--Oh,that unit is on our premier level.
It's a little bit more pricey.
It's 1-4.
1-4.
Like 1-4 thousand?
You're funny.
1.4 million.
Did you wanna see it?
My husband found that jacket.
What do you think?
Well,i know that it's not huge,
But all of our buildings have a lot of common space--
A rec room,gym,movie night--
And the flannigan's chain is putting in a flagship restaurant on the ground floor,
So i hope you don't mind the smell of potato skins wafting into your apartment.
Oh.My.God.
I'm gonna let the two of you just poke around a little bit,
And then i can answer any of your questions.
Thank you.
I have to tell you,
I haven't flip-Flopped like this since i changed my stance on sandra bullock.
Honey,you were right.I love this place.
It's tiny.I hate it.Let's go.
No,no,wait,wait.
How come all of a sudden,you're jumping off-Board here?
I--I-
- Don't you understand?
We will be living directly on top of a festive chain restaurant.
You know how i've always dreamed about a place where i could run my own tab.
"Uh,hi,flannigan's.
It's me.
" You know,i love it.
That's ridiculous.
We are not gonna base our decision about where we live on potato skins.
Why not?
Potato skins make me happy.
You know what would make me happy?
Leaving here and going to get a coffee drink with booze in it.
Joy,i--I want to do this.
Well,no.
I am putting my foot down.
Oh,she put her foot down.
Heads-Up,brother.
Her foot is down.
Any questions?
- We're gonna have to take a minute to think about it.
- Yes,we wanna put in a down payment.
Outside.
Ok,so let me get this straight.
When you say yes and i say no,it happens,
But if i say yes and you say no,it's off,huh?
Well,that just isn't fair.
Well,you know what?
Life's not fair,bub.
Oh,yeah?
Wanna know what else isn't fair?
I'm 3 feet taller than you,
So i'm gonna write a down-Payment check way up here!
- No,you're not.
- That's right.
Oh,yes,i am.
Julius erving--
Property group.
You can't keep your hands up there all day,eddie.
Oh,really?
Well,i once spent an entire summer in high school feeding giraffes at the zoo,
And those suckers eat constantly.
Give me that!
The big city.
Yeah,seriously.
Stop it.
I'm serious.
I walked into that place,and.
I mean,sure--It was sleek,and it was cool and everything,
But it wasn't our scratched-Up kitchen table that we have coffee at every morning,
And it wasn't our annoying,broken silverware drawer,
And it certainly wasn't our big,
Beige sectional couch that's not only molded to your ass,
But my ass as well.
We made those dents together.
That's what matters.
I'm sorry.You were right.
It's our home.
Come on,baby.
Let's go home.
Yeah,but the pretty plasma went up and down and up and down.
Oh,my god.
Our car.
They took our radio.
I hate downtown!
Thank you.
I feel so violated.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Come on.Let's go home.
Oh,my god!
They stole my cheese!
What the hell was the cheese doing in the car?
Well,i had 18 pounds left,and it was staring to turn,
So i'd travel with it to maximize my intake.
Oh,my god.
Look,all right,you know what?
You drive,because i'm gonna keep my eyes peeled for some punks eating' cheese.
It's mid-winter, 1230.
A horrific scene is played out in the middle of a busy market square.
An infant child is held up to the crowds.
(BABY CRIES)
Seconds later, she's dead.
Her small corpse lies discarded in the mud, her brains splattered across the column of the market cross.
Not far from the scene sits the man who ordered her murder.
Meet Alexander II, King of the Scots.
70 years later, the skin is flayed from the back of a hated English cleric.
Meet the man who had that skin fashioned into a sword belt -
William Wallace, rebel, fugitive.
This is the story of two ruthless men -
Alexander II, who forged Scotland in blood and violence.
And William Wallace, whose resistance to the nation-breaking King of England, hammered national consciousness into the Scots.
This is the River Tay, just north of Perth.
It runs past Scone, the ancient inauguration site of the kings of Scotland.
On a cold December morning in 1214, a 16-year-old boy journeyed across this river heading for Scone.
His elderly father William had died the night before, but there was no time for mourning.
This quick-tempered teenager was about to become the next king of Scots, Alexander II.
Alexander is descended from a powerful dynasty of kings, traditionally known as the Canmores.
A family who, for generations, fought to preserve their bloodline and kingdom.
Alexander was an only son.
From a young age, he'd been destined for greatness, but he wasn't Alexander the Great just yet.
The kingdom he inherited was smaller than the Scotland we recognise today.
It rubbed shoulders with a patchwork of other peoples and different languages.
To the north, the Earldoms of Caithness and Sutherland.
To the west, the Gaels of the Hebrides and the Isles.
And in the south, the fiercely independent Lordship of Galloway.
But England, England was bigger, stronger, richer than them all.
And for nearly 200 years, the English kings said the Kingdom of Scots belonged to them.
The English were the overlords.
It was all a game in which what you said you owned mattered every bit as much as what you actually held.
The early Canmores had played the game, had recognised English superiority, but subservience was not Alexander's style.
As far as Alexander was concerned, he was every bit the equal of an English king.
Call it brash, call it arrogant, he was on a mission to free his kingship from English overlordship once and for all.
But Alexander had a problem.
If he hoped to free Scotland from overlordship, he would first have to resolve a bitter dispute with the king of England, King John.
Northumbria, Cumberland and Westmorland were territories to which both the kings of England and the kings of Scots laid claim.
To settle the argument, Alexander's father had given both money and two of his daughters to King John of England.
But John had reneged on the deal.
Now Alexander was determined to take back what was rightfully his.
Alexander wasn't the only one with a grudge against King John.
There was a long queue of English barons with similar grievances.
Their biggest gripe against King John was that he had bled them dry with his constant requests for money to fund his war in France.
In protest, they drew up a list of over 60 demands.
MAN: (READS) "All hostages and charters shall...
"All cities, boroughs, towns and ports shall enjoy...
"Officials will not seize any land...
"Ye shall do this without destruction or damage..."
NEIL OLIVER:
The document became known as Magna Carta.
The barons added Alexander's claim to the disputed northern territories to the bottom of the list, in Clause 59.
A promise to "do right" by Alexander, King of the Scots.
MAN: (READS) "Alexander, the King of the Scots,
"concerning the return of his sisters and hostages,
"and his liberties and his right,
"according to the way in which we..."
NEIL OLIVER:
King John had no option but to agree to the barons' demands.
He affixed his seal to the charter.
But no sooner had he done so, he rejected it, calling it "mere foolishness".
Enough was enough.
The barons decided to rid themselves of King John.
England plunged into civil war.
This was too good an opportunity to miss.
A chance to reclaim the border lands he believed were rightfully his.
So he invaded northern England.
He laid siege to Norham Castle.
He burned Newcastle to the ground, and he took Carlisle.
This impassioned teenager meant business.
Alexander was no stranger to the battlefield.
Despite his tender years, he'd served his military apprenticeship aged only 14, when he led his father's army.
After crushing Gaelic rebels in the north of Scotland,
Alexander earned the respect of his men.
Two years later,
Alexander won the respect of the rebellious English barons as he took on their king.
Now, with King John on the defensive, the barons in the north of England decided to switch allegiance and form a pact with Alexander.
On 11 January 1216, in Melrose Abbey, the northern barons lined up to swear fealty to the King for their lands.
And that king was the King of Scots.
As far as Alexander was concerned, now that the northern barons had paid homage to him, the disputed border lands were his.
He had avenged his father.
While Alexander tightened his grip in the north, the English barons in the south turned to john's enemy, the French, for help.
The barons invited Prince Louis to England to take the English crown.
He accepted.
In the spring of 1216, the French prince and his army sailed for England.
Opportunity knocked again.
Alexander planned to cut a deal with the French prince.
In return for his support, Alexander intended to press Louis to recognise the disputed northern territories as Scottish.
In a stroke, the English Crown's claims of overlordship would be swept aside.
So he did something no Scottish monarch had done before, or since.
He marched an army all the way to Dover.
Meeting little resistance on his way south, he joined forces with the French army and together they laid siege to Dover Castle - the key to England.
In all the wars with England, no other Scottish king ever came so far.
It was an incredible achievement.
Alexander's head must have swelled with every passing day.
He was 17 and he was on the brink of achieving his family's longest-held ambition.
Half of Britain was nearly his.
But then fate dealt a devastating blow.
King John died.
On the face of it, his death should have been good news for Alexander, but with John out of the way, the need for the barons' war vanished.
The barons who had once opposed King John now flocked to his son's side - the new king, Henry III.
Both Alexander, King of Scots, and Louis, the French prince, had outgrown their usefulness.
The English barons sent them packing.
There was no deal for Alexander - all of his grand ambitions fizzled out.
Henry III reissued Magna Carta and all references to Alexander's claims were omitted - not even a footnote.
Despite loud protests, the ground was cut from beneath his feet and he was left out in the cold.
And it got worse.
The Pope gave his backing to Henry III.
Alexander found himself excommunicated the powers of the Scottish church suspended.
Back to square one.
It stung.
The Pope chastised him like a wayward son, ordering the truculent teenager to return his English conquests and pay homage for them to the King of England - the nine-year-old King of England.
In Northampton, on 19 December 1217,
Alexander, bereft of allies, paid homage to the child king, Henry III.
His ambition of ruling the northern territories of England was over.
Deflated, Alexander returned to Scotland.
His ambitions shattered, his morale was at an all-time low.
He came here to Arbroath Abbey to pay respects to his father William, who had also failed to regain the northern territories.
If Alexander had learnt anything from the war in England, it was that the northern barons had felt English, not Scottish.
They had chosen Henry as their king, not Alexander.
The English barons knew instinctively who their king was.
But could the same be said for the Scottish nobles?
The Scottish nobles were split between two powerful factions.
In the south were the descendants of Norman families, invited to settle in southern Scotland by the early Canmore kings.
Helping to build many of the great Border abbeys and cathedrals, they changed the face of Scotland, transforming it into a more European-looking kingdom.
In the north were the territories of powerful Gaelic earls, whose ancestors had forged the Kingdom of Scots.
But these were the very Gaelic lords that Alexander's family had rejected in favour of a Norman future.
The old Gaelic elite became sidelined.
Once upon a time, they'd helped run the kingdom.
Now they were called things like "divider of the King's meat", while the French-speaking brat pack of Norman lords received titles like "chancellor" and "constable of Scotland".
One chronicler of the time wrote, "The modern kings of Scotland
"count themselves as Frenchmen in race, manners, language and culture.
"They keep only Frenchmen in their household and following,
"and have reduced the Scots to utter servitude."
Some Gaelic nobles adopted the Norman ways, but others returned to their own lands, beyond the reach of the King of Scots - the semi-independent Gaelic lands of Galloway, Argyll, Ross,
Sutherland and Caithness, sometimes subject to the King of Scots, sometimes not.
And beyond them, Alexander's rule petered out completely.
The Hebrides and the Northern Isles - all lands claimed by another aspiring and aggressive kingdom Norway.
It was messy, too messy for Alexander's liking.
He would never throw off English claims of overlordship until all the Scottish nobles acknowledged him as their king.
It was time for a new approach and a new deal.
Alexander decided to strike a balance between Norman innovation and Gaelic tradition.
In his new Scotland, both would be allowed to flourish.
He invited the Gaelic warlords back in from the cold.
In return for some of the top jobs, they would fight his battles.
They would help him conquer Scotland, territory by territory.
His first test came from the north, when the men of Caithness roasted one of Alexander's bishops alive.
Alexander returned the compliment in spades.
In Ross, challengers to Alexander's succession rebelled against him.
In response, Alexander's Gaelic warlords severed the leaders' heads and presented them to him as a gift.
In the west, Alexander pressed on again, down the Great Glen to Lochaber and beyond to the Isles, to attack the lands of the Norwegian king.
Mercy and compassion were never Alexander's strong points.
The man who would be king of all Scotland proved to be utterly ruthless from the moment he set out to subdue it.
A symbol of just how far he would go to secure his kingship was in his treatment of a baby girl.
Alive, she represented a rival claim to his throne.
In Alexander's eyes, she was just as much of a threat as any sword-wielding assassin.
He took no chances.
The infant was a distant relative of the Canmore line.
Her fate was recorded by the Lanercost Chronicle.
MAN: (READS) "The daughter, who had not long left her mother's womb,
"innocent as she was,
"was put to death in the view of the marketplace.
"Her head was struck against the column, and her brains clashed out."
NEIL OLIVER:
Alexander now had what he wanted.
Her elimination killed off the last threat to the Scottish Crown.
This terrible and shocking act was remembered for generations to come.
And that was the point.
Loud and clear, the King of Scots let it be known,
"This is what will happen to anyone who crosses my path,
"however young, however innocent."
But his actions had delivered results.
Something new had emerged.
Alexander's victories had not only brought peace, but something far more enduring.
One people, one kingdom.
Now everyone was subject to one king and that made them one people
- Scots.
Alexander had restored the esteem of his Kingdom to such an extent that King Henry III of England agreed to a border, established for the first time in 1237.
Psychologically, that was a big step.
Now Scots could say,
"This is Scotland, that is England, and we are different."
Alexander's 35-year reign ended when he died on 8 July 1249.
His kingdom stretched all the way from Caithness in the north to the Solway Firth in the south.
That was the legacy of Alexander II.

In the years following his death, a stronger, more confident Scotland entered a golden age.
His son, Alexander III, inherited the family firm.
Times were good.
Scotland prospered and culture flowered.
England now saw Scotland differently.
Suddenly, the Scots were worth getting into bed with.
Claims of overlordship were replaced by offers of marriage.
And so it was that at Christmas 1251,
Alexander III, King of the Scots, married Princess Margaret of England.
It was an ostentatious display of wealth and power and the message was clear -
Scotland was determined to be seen as an equal partner, an equal kingdom.
Eyeing the proceedings was the bride's brother, the young Prince Edward.
Heir to the throne of England, this long-legged, blue-eyed boy was the epitome of an English prince.
But more penetrating eyes could see beyond the image.
This boy's life would be less than saintly.
Edward had a taste for violence.
The chronicler Matthew Paris famously recalled how the young prince got one of his followers to attack a man, cut off an ear and gouge out an eye.
Paris wondered what kind of king he would make,
"If he does these things when the wood is green,
"what can be hoped for when it is seasoned?"
As time passed, Edward grew into a formidable and skilful warrior.
He indulged his lust for war by heading off on crusade to the Holy Land.
On his return, he is every inch the hero, and at last crowned King of England.
But while Edward's life took on the glow of a medieval boy's own story,
Alexander III '5 life turned into Greek tragedy.
In the space of nine years,
Alexander III lost his wife - Edward's sister - and all three of his children.
The Canmore dynasty was withering on the vine.
Edward was shocked and sent a letter of condolence to his brother-in-law.
Alexander's reply to that letter seems to suggest a genuine warmth between the two kings.
(READS) "You have offered much solace for our grief by saying
"that although death has borne away your kindred in these parts,
"we are united together perpetually, God willing,
"by the tie of indissoluble affection."
Then, in March 1286, Edward heard about another death
- Alexander.
The King of Scots had finished his business in Edinburgh but he was desperate to travel the 20-odd miles to here at Kinghorn and the royal palace where his new young wife, Yolande, was waiting for him.
His advisors begged him not to go - it was a foul night, dark and stormy - but the warnings went unheeded and somewhere near here
Alexander became separated from his guides and was thrown from his horse.
They found his body on the beach the next morning, the neck broken.
Edward mourned the death of his brother-in-law, though some would say that he shed crocodile tears.
He may have been related to Scotland's royal family - his father may have recognised Scotland's sovereignty - but Edward was descended from a long line of English kings who claimed to be her overlord, a claim that Edward had not forgotten.
And now the kingdom's future hung by a thread.
Next in line to the Scottish throne was Alexander's three-year-old granddaughter and Edward's grand-niece, Margaret, known as the Maid of Norway.
The child Margaret was the last direct link with the Canmore dynasty.
Her marriage to Edward's son was speedily arranged.
As far as Edward was concerned, as soon as the ink on the marriage agreement was dry,
Scotland would belong to him.
The logic was simple.
Medieval women were property.
What they owned belonged to their husbands.
What the Maid owned, once she was married, would belong to Edward's son.
Then in October 1290, the Maid died.
The house of Canmore was finished.
Scotland was without a royal family.
For Edward, this was an act of divine providence.
The succession was in doubt because there were two leading contenders vying for the Scots throne.
John Balliol and Robert Bruce the Elder were from two of Scotland's most powerful families.
Both had enough military muscle to back their claim on the field.
Scotland was divided.
It fell to the Guardians - men chosen to govern the realm in the absence of a king - to prevent civil war.
But they needed help.
An impartial, friendly arbitrator.
Someone with experience.
Someone who could command respect.
Who else but King Edward I?
Internationally respected monarch, and master of the law.
And, after all, relations between the two kingdoms were amicable and Edward was family.
There was no reason to doubt him.
Edward called for a parliament to be held on 6th May 1291 to decide the future of the Scottish crown, and the location he chose was Norham - over there, on the English side of the River Tweed.
The Scots smelled a rat.
The future of Scotland to be decided in England?
It wasn't right.
So the Scots stalled on the Scottish side of the river.
It was a stand-off.
It didn't take Edward long to reveal his true colours, his real intention.
He sent word to the Scots that the parliament would not start until the Guardians and the claimants for the throne of Scotland acknowledged his position as superior overlord of Scotland.
The Scots were stunned.
60 years of peace and now this.
They would not give up their hard-won autonomy.
One of the six Guardians of Scotland was Bishop Wishart of Glasgow.
A shrewd and powerful figure, Wishart, a bulldog of a man.
True to style, he delivered Scotland's response in person.
He told Edward to his face.
MAN:
The Scottish Kingdom is not held in tribute or homage to anyone save God alone.
Edward shrugged off Wishart's words of defiance.
Although Bruce and Balliol had the only serious claims,
Edward decided to change the rules again.
He produced 11 more claimants from leading noble families and declared that if they didn't acknowledge his overlordship, they would be eliminated from the contest.
The Scots were outmanoeuvred.
If Bruce and Balliol wanted the job of King of Scots, they had no choice but to agree to Edward's terms.
One by one, the now 13 claimants, along with the Guardians of Scotland, swore fealty to Edward, the King of England, as "superior and direct overlord of the kingdom of Scotland.
Edward had what he wanted.
It made no difference to him who was actually chosen.
He already had all of the claimants' oaths of subservience in the bag.
In the end, it was John Balliol who emerged as heir to the throne.
Edward had it all stitched up.
He was Scotland's superior overlord and not a drop of blood had been spilt.
Wishart's deepest fears were being realised before his very eyes.
He didn't hang around long.
He'd seen enough.
No longer a Guardian, Wishart returned to Glasgow.
The new King of Scots, John Balliol, had to pay homage and swear fealty to Edward for his kingdom a second time.
Edward's authority was absolute.
He could do exactly as he wanted... and he did.
In 1294, Edward demanded Scottish troops for his war against France.
Then he summoned Balliol himself to fight.
The King of Scots to do military service for the King of England?
It seemed unthinkable.
At a stroke, the achievements of the Canmores - the forging of Scotland, its status as a separate and distinct entity, was in peril.
It was time for action.
Bishop Wishart and the other Scots leaders realised Balliol was no match for Edward.
At a parliament in Stirling, they debated what to do about Balliol.
Wishart had no qualms.
By the end of the meeting, the Bishop's radical view prevailed.
A new Guardianship was established.
A council of 12 men was selected to run the affairs of the kingdom in Balliol's name.
Balliol was to be reduced to a figurehead, to be wheeled out to play the role of ruler.
Now, the real governors of Scotland laid plans to fight Edward.
As Wishart saw it, the council had two tasks - negotiate a treaty with France and prepare the country for war.
France was Edward's enemy.
Military support from them would mean the Scots stood a chance against Edward's forces.
In the late summer of 1295, a delegation left Stirling for Paris to negotiate a treaty with the French king.
The terms were simple.
Should Edward attack France, then the Scots would wage war against the English.
In return, the French promised support should Scotland be attacked.
The French agreed.
When Edward went to war against France in 1296, the Scots duly marched into England.
The fuse was (it.
Wishart waited for Edward's inevitable onslaught.
It came.
On 30 March 1296, Edward's army crossed into Scotland.
Edward wasn't a man to do things by halves.
At around 30,000 strong, this was the largest army that had ever been sent north.
First stop, Berwick-upon-Tweed.
Just as the Easter celebrations were drawing to a close,
Edward crossed the Tweed.
The feeble, timber fortifications offered no resistance.
What followed was one of the worst massacres in British medieval history.
For two days, streams of blood flowed from the bodies of the slain.
For his tyrannous rage, he ordered 7,500 souls of both sexes to be massacred.
Mills could be turned round by the flow of their blood.
Despite the surrender of the local garrison,
Edward set about the wholesale slaughter of the town's population.
The orgy of violence only came to an end when the frantic pleading of local clergy moved Edward to show at least some pity.
But Berwick was just a warm-up.
Edward's reputation would now precede him, as he advanced north into the heartlands of Scotland.
After defeating the large but inexperienced Scots army at Dunbar, resistance to Edward buckled.
Castle after castle fell.
Most of the Scots nobility were captured and imprisoned.
It was over.
Now, Edward wanted the man he believed responsible -
Balliol, the lamb caught amongst the wolves.
It took Balliol eight days to negotiate his surrender, which was hardly surprising, as he did have a lot of explaining to do.
Edward was angry.
Balliol had acted contemptibly and illegally.
He was Edward's man, and yet he had conspired with the French and attacked English soil.
He was a defaulting vassal who would have to be punished, along with the Scots if they refused to submit.
But Edward wanted more than a simple surrender.
He wanted a show.
Paraded as a penitent before Edward, Balliol was stripped of his kingship, the royal insignia ripped from his clothing, earning him the cruel nickname Toom Tabard -
"empty suit", King Nobody.
Broken and humiliated, Balliol was sent to the Tower of London and then to exile in France.
Not content to humiliate a man, Edward plundered the country.
He set about systematically stripping Scotland of all her symbols of sovereignty and independence - the crown jewels, the Black Rood of St Margaret, the holiest and most venerated relic of Scotland and the Stone of Destiny, the centrepiece of Scottish king-making.
In the months that followed,
Edward decided to take a tour of his newly won kingdom.
But this was no tourist trip.
City by city, burgh by burgh, castle by castle,
Edward forced the Scottish nobles to sign up to his new regime to put their names to what became the most infamous document in Scottish history.
The Ragman Roll.
Well, the Ragman Roll is a list of the Scottish nobles who had to give homage to Edward I of England in 1296.
So, it's got about...
nearly 1,900 names on it.
NEIL OLIVER:
What is contained in all these endless lines of text?
What exactly are they signing up to?
Well, basically, they had to pay homage to Edward I, who had defeated the Scots at the Battle of Dunbar, and he was essentially the King of Scots now, and they had to acknowledge him as their lord and master.
What are the famous names that would stand out?
Well, you've got a full panoply of the Scottish nobility.
You've got the competitors for the throne, the head of the house of Balliol, Bruce, the Stuarts are there, there's a complete set of bishops, people like Bishop Wishart, and then there is, of course, a lot of knights, if you like,
and lesser people who held land in Scotland at that time.
But it isn't just the names of the nobility and bishops that appear on the Ragman Roll.
Representatives across the Scottish kingdom, religious and political, were forced to fix their seals of submission.
Scotland was without a king.
Beaten, broken and humiliated.
The winter of 1296 was one of the country's darkest.
Edward left the governance of Scotland to two trusted lieutenants and returned to where he'd left off- fighting the French.
As he crossed the Tweed back into England, he quipped,
"A man does good work when he rids himself of shit."
But in the rush to be rid of Scotland, Edward missed something.
Scotland had never been directly ruled by an English king, so when Edward ordered the Scots to join his war in France, the Scots grew resentful.
And when Edward imposed English taxes to pay for it, the Scots grew rebellious.
Alexander II had given the Scots a united kingdom with a border, a sense of who they were.
But within the space of a decade, all of this was swept away.
Edward had already absorbed Wales into his kingdom and conscripted the Welsh into his armies.
Now he proposed to do exactly the same thing with Scotland.
And it was the prospect of being absorbed by England, of being forced to fight Edward's battles, that tipped the Scots over the edge.
The first spark of resistance was struck in the Gaelic north.
It was a small act of defiance, a single standard raised against Edward, but soon a myriad of flames engulfed the kingdom, and among them was one man, William Wallace.
William Wallace.
The Wallace.
For many, he's the ultimate freedom fighter, for others, a terrorist.
He is the enigmatic hero who appears from nowhere to liberate his people and to shape history.
The Wallace story is one of the defining legends of Scottish identity and the epitome of Scotland's story.
And yet, with all the mythologising, we've lost sight of Wallace the man - a remarkable man, but a man nonetheless.
The younger son of an obscure knight,
Wallace's destiny would be shaped less by himself, more by the needs of others.
And what Bishop Wishart, the self-appointed chief of the Scottish resistance movement, needed right now was time.
Scotland had run out of leaders.
Most of her nobles were either imprisoned or had been forced to fix their seals to the Ragman Rolls.
Wishart could have been under no illusions when the pair met here, at Glasgow Cathedral.
Wallace was no leader of armies, but he was smart and he could fight and he had the popular touch.
Most importantly, he could buy time for Wishart while the Bishop tried to raise the Scots nobles in Ayrshire.
An English chronicler put it simply -
"Wishart caused a certain bloody man, William Wallace,
"who had formerly been a chief of brigands in Scotland,
"to revolt against the King and assemble people in his support."
And that's exactly what Wallace did.
After killing the hated English sheriff of Lanark, the very symbol of Edward's oppressive regime,
Wallace's rising swiftly gained momentum.
But the men who flocked to Wallace's side weren't of noble blood.
His army were peasants - humble folk, the middling sort.
The kind of people who'd had first-hand experience of Edward's policies of wringing as many men and taxes out of Scotland as he could.
If Wallace's army was to stand any chance against Edward's mighty war machine, they needed space, open space, and time to train.
Wallace knew this would be no easy task.
His army was used to the hit-and-run tactics of guerrilla warfare.
They had little experience of the battlefield.
The best he could offer his men was discipline.
By the late summer of 1297, Wallace's army was ready.
He joined forces with Andrew Murray, a nobleman's son who had led a successful revolt in the north.
Together, they marched their men to intercept the English at Stirling.
It was only then, when the English woke up, they realised the handful of rebels had swollen into a respectable-sized army.
But the English captain, Warenne, wasn't alarmed.
His army, with its impressive heavy cavalry, could take on any peasant rabble.
To confront the Scots, the English army had to cross the River Forth.
Easier said than done.
Deep and impassable, the Forth rises in the west and flows east to meet the North Sea, almost cutting the country in half.
The crossing point - a narrow, wooden bridge at Stirling.
When the English arrived, Wallace and Murray were waiting.
They knew the land and they understood the strategic importance of the bridge across the Forth as the gateway to the north.
They positioned their army on the slopes of Abbey Craig, about a mile from the bridge.
On September 11th 1297, both armies faced each other.
In bald terms, Warenne told the Scots to surrender.
Wallace told them, "Go back and tell your people
"that we have not come for the benefit of peace,
"but to do battle to defend ourselves and liberate our kingdom.
"Let them come to us, and we will prove this in their very beards."
The English horsemen began to ride across the bridge.
Warenne suddenly exploded - he hadn't actually given the order to cross.
So he made his men come back to his side and regroup.
Then, on his command, they began to cross for a second time.
Wallace must have been amazed by this comic display of arrogance and complacency.
But Warenne didn't care how it looked.
He didn't rate Wallace's army.
As far as he was concerned, this would be little more than a good training exercise for the men.
What they learned was how to die.
The English were trapped, caught in the loop of the river with nowhere to go.
As the chronicler Guisborough said,
"There was indeed no better place in all the land
"to deliver the English into the hands of the Scots,
"and so many into the power of the few. "
By nightfall, 5,000 English infantry and 100 knights had perished.
Among the English dead lay the body of the hated treasurer.
He'd been flayed alive.
The treasurer had taken the skin off Scots' backs, and now they had done the same to him in return.
Wallace kept the skin, had it fashioned into a sword belt, a memento of the day's victory.
The defeat was a huge loss of face for Edward.
The great English army, the vast, Edwardian war machine that had conquered Wales, that was famed throughout Europe, had been defeated.
But hardest of all to swallow was the fact it had been defeated by a bunch of peasant amateurs - Scots peasant amateurs, to boot.
It was at this time that Edward first heard the name William Wallace.
We can be sure of one thing - he'd never forget it.
The Scottish nobles were dumbfounded.
Now they were forced to rub shoulders with the middling folk to make this man Guardian of Scotland.
Murray, the noble who commanded the army with Wallace, would have been their preferred choice, but his death after Stirling Bridge ruled that out.
Here at Kirk of the Forest,
Wallace the outlaw became Sir William Wallace, the Guardian of Scotland.
He was the hero of the hour, for now.
But despite his victory, there were those who didn't approve of a mere commoner being given such a big job.
After all, what did he know about politics and kings?
But none of that mattered at the moment.
What did matter was that he had proved himself in battle and his job was only half clone.
Only when John Balliol was restored to the throne could Scotland be free.
Wallace had proved to be Edward's equal in every regard except status.
He was brutal, he was ruthless, he fought on Edward's terms.
He played dirty-.
The defeat at Stirling Bridge had angered Edward.
Now he wanted revenge.
By July, his vast military machine, composed mainly of newly conquered Welsh, crossed into Scotland.
As Edward advanced north, he encountered a wasted landscape.
There was no sign of Wallace, but he could see his handiwork in every burnt-out farm.
Weeks passed, there was still no sign of him.
But then the logic of Wallace's strategy became obvious.
Denied food supplies, the English army started to starve, and fighting broke out between the English and Welsh infantry.
Edward's army was close to disintegration when it finally arrived at Linlithgow's town walls.
He realised he might have to abandon the war altogether, unless he could find Wallace, and fast.
The scouts reported that the Scots army was less than 20 miles away, at Falkirk.
Edward force-marched his men until they came upon Wallace.
The Scots were dug in - four schiltroms, bristling with spears.
Edward's propaganda machine had gone into overdrive.
The English troops weren't expecting to see Wallace the man, rather, Wallace the monster, an ogre who would quite literally skin them alive.
And of course, it was Edward who had unleashed the monster.
He had unmade Scotland, taking it apart bit by bit, and Wallace was the result.
Edward was unconcerned - it would all be over soon.
And it was, in a hail of arrows.
Edward's archers began the slaughter of the infantry.
It was said the Scots fell like blossom in an orchard when the fruit had ripened.
The cavalry completed the rout.
Wallace resigned as Guardian.
Scotland descended into five years of exhausting, costly, protracted fighting.
Then the Scots lost their ally, the French.
Alone, they could not defeat Edward.
It was pointless going on - the Scots sought terms.
Equally, Edward was tired and old.
He was in his 605, and the war was burning a very large hole in his pocket.
He wanted to draw a line under the whole sorry business.
But naturally, he wanted that on his own terms.
He wanted Wallace.
"As for William Wallace," said Edward,
"it is agreed that he shall render himself up at the mercy and will
"of our sovereign lord the King, as it shall seem good to him."
Wallace's fate was sealed the following month.
At the St Andrew's Parliament of 1304, he was declared an outlaw by the Scots nobles.
129 landowners took Edward as their liege lord.
Among their ranks was the man who had helped create Wallace Robert Wishart, the Bishop of Glasgow.
In truth, the document they signed up to, the Ordinances of 1305, marked the completion of the second conquest of Scotland.
And this time, there was no mention of a king or a kingdom, merely a land.
As for Wallace, Edward had singled him out for special treatment.
No words of peace were offered.
Wallace must submit to Edward's pleasure.
Edward played every dirty trick in the book.
He threatened and blackmailed Wallace's friends, forcing them to hunt down the fugitive.
Finally, Wallace was betrayed.
On 3rd August 1305, he was seized in a house near Glasgow.
According to an English source, Wallace was surprised in his bed.
In the Scots version of what happened,
Wallace put up a huge fight before he was eventually taken.
Three weeks later, Wallace stood here, Westminster Hall, before Edward's judges.
The King, ever the master of the law, was determined to destroy Wallace's reputation.
A crown of laurel leaves had been placed on his head, to mock, it was said, Wallace's boast that one day he would wear a crown.
As an outlaw, he was already legally condemned - no plea, no jury, no witnesses, no defence.
He was merely presented with the indictment.
That he had notoriously committed killings, arson, destruction of property, and sacrilege during the war with England.
That he had assumed the title of Guardian and seduced the Scots into an alliance with France.
The charge of treason was an innovation, but if it was on the King's Record, then it was law.
If Edward said he was a traitor, then he was.
It was only then that Wallace spoke.
He had never been a traitor.
He had never sworn allegiance to Edward.
Like Scotland, Wallace was trapped by Edward's laws.
The outcome was a forgone conclusion.
He suffered a traitor's death.
There was no Christian burial.
Wallace's boiled head was spiked on London Bridge and his quartered body sent north to Newcastle, Berwick, Stirling and Perth as an example of the fate that would befall anyone who challenged Edward.
What are we to make of Wallace?
What is important is what he became after his death.
He became a brand, repackaged and rolled out in the centuries to come to suit both nationalist and unionist agendas.
700 years later, the basic vision of a free, independent Scotland, for which William Wallace fought, still haunts the collective Scots imagination.
For many, Wallace remains Scotland's greatest patriot.
But what had he actually achieved?
In the end, Wallace had failed.
Scotland's king remained in exile, her nobles under oath.
Edward I, the Hammer of the Scots, had conquered Scotland.
You might even say he had turned it into an English region.
But in his fixation with the crown and the kingdom, he'd underestimated the people.
Edward's determination to crush them had served only to define for the Scots who they really were.
It's mid-winter, 1230.
A horrific scene is played out in the middle of a busy market square.
An infant child is held up to the crowds.
(BABY CRIES)
Seconds later, she's dead.
Her small corpse lies discarded in the mud, her brains splattered across the column of the market cross.
Not far from the scene sits the man who ordered her murder.
Meet Alexander II, King of the Scots.
70 years later, the skin is flayed from the back of a hated English cleric.
Meet the man who had that skin fashioned into a sword belt -
William Wallace, rebel, fugitive.
This is the story of two ruthless men -
Alexander II, who forged Scotland in blood and violence.
And William Wallace, whose resistance to the nation-breaking King of England, hammered national consciousness into the Scots.
This is the River Tay, just north of Perth.
It runs past Scone, the ancient inauguration site of the kings of Scotland.
On a cold December morning in 1214, a 16-year-old boy journeyed across this river heading for Scone.
His elderly father William had died the night before, but there was no time for mourning.
This quick-tempered teenager was about to become the next king of Scots, Alexander II.
Alexander is descended from a powerful dynasty of kings, traditionally known as the Canmores.
A family who, for generations, fought to preserve their bloodline and kingdom.
Alexander was an only son.
From a young age, he'd been destined for greatness, but he wasn't Alexander the Great just yet.
The kingdom he inherited was smaller than the Scotland we recognise today.
It rubbed shoulders with a patchwork of other peoples and different languages.
To the north, the Earldoms of Caithness and Sutherland.
To the west, the Gaels of the Hebrides and the Isles.
And in the south, the fiercely independent Lordship of Galloway.
But England, England was bigger, stronger, richer than them all.
And for nearly 200 years, the English kings said the Kingdom of Scots belonged to them.
The English were the overlords.
It was all a game in which what you said you owned mattered every bit as much as what you actually held.
The early Canmores had played the game, had recognised English superiority, but subservience was not Alexander's style.
As far as Alexander was concerned, he was every bit the equal of an English king.
Call it brash, call it arrogant, he was on a mission to free his kingship from English over-lordship once and for all.
But Alexander had a problem.
If he hoped to free Scotland from over-lordship, he would first have to resolve a bitter dispute with the king of England, King John.
Northumbria, Cumberland and Westmorland were territories to which both the kings of England and the kings of Scots laid claim.
To settle the argument, Alexander's father had given both money and two of his daughters to King John of England.
But John had reneged on the deal.
Now Alexander was determined to take back what was rightfully his.
Alexander wasn't the only one with a grudge against King John.
There was a long queue of English barons with similar grievances.
Their biggest gripe against King John was that he had bled them dry with his constant requests for money to fund his war in France.
In protest, they drew up a list of over 60 demands.
MAN: (READS) "All hostages and charters shall...
"All cities, boroughs, towns and ports shall enjoy...
"Officials will not seize any land...
"Ye shall do this without destruction or damage..."
NEIL OLIVER:
The document became known as Magna Carta.
The barons added Alexander's claim to the disputed northern territories to the bottom of the list, in Clause 59.
A promise to "do right" by Alexander, King of the Scots.
MAN: (READS) "Alexander, the King of the Scots,
"concerning the return of his sisters and hostages,
"and his liberties and his right,
"according to the way in which we..."
NEIL OLIVER:
King John had no option but to agree to the barons' demands.
He affixed his seal to the charter.
But no sooner had he done so, he rejected it, calling it "mere foolishness".
Enough was enough.
The barons decided to rid themselves of King John.
England plunged into civil war.
This was too good an opportunity to miss.
A chance to reclaim the border lands he believed were rightfully his.
So he invaded northern England.
He laid siege to Norham Castle.
He burned Newcastle to the ground, and he took Carlisle.
This impassioned teenager meant business.
Alexander was no stranger to the battlefield.
Despite his tender years, he'd served his military apprenticeship aged only 14, when he led his father's army.
After crushing Gaelic rebels in the north of Scotland,
Alexander earned the respect of his men.
Two years later,
Alexander won the respect of the rebellious English barons as he took on their king.
Now, with King John on the defensive, the barons in the north of England decided to switch allegiance and form a pact with Alexander.
On 11 January 1216, in Melrose Abbey, the northern barons lined up to swear fealty to the King for their lands.
And that king was the King of Scots.
As far as Alexander was concerned, now that the northern barons had paid homage to him, the disputed border lands were his.
He had avenged his father.
While Alexander tightened his grip in the north, the English barons in the south turned to John's enemy, the French, for help.
The barons invited Prince Louis to England to take the English crown.
He accepted.
In the spring of 1216, the French prince and his army sailed for England.
Opportunity knocked again.
Alexander planned to cut a deal with the French prince.
In return for his support, Alexander intended to press Louis to recognise the disputed northern territories as Scottish.
In a stroke, the English Crown's claims of over-lordship would be swept aside.
So he did something no Scottish monarch had done before, or since.
He marched an army all the way to Dover.
Meeting little resistance on his way south, he joined forces with the French army and together they laid siege to Dover Castle - the key to England.
In all the wars with England, no other Scottish king ever came so far.
It was an incredible achievement.
Alexander's head must have swelled with every passing day.
He was 17 and he was on the brink of achieving his family's longest-held ambition.
Half of Britain was nearly his.
But then fate dealt a devastating blow.
King John died.
On the face of it, his death should have been good news for Alexander, but with John out of the way, the need for the barons' war vanished.
The barons who had once opposed King John now flocked to his son's side - the new king, Henry III.
Both Alexander, King of Scots, and Louis, the French prince, had outgrown their usefulness.
The English barons sent them packing.
There was no deal for Alexander - all of his grand ambitions fizzled out.
Henry III reissued Magna Carta and all references to Alexander's claims were omitted - not even a footnote.
Despite loud protests, the ground was cut from beneath his feet and he was left out in the cold.
And it got worse.
The Pope gave his backing to Henry III.
Alexander found himself excommunicated the powers of the Scottish church suspended.
Back to square one.
It stung.
The Pope chastised him like a wayward son, ordering the truculent teenager to return his English conquests and pay homage for them to the King of England - the nine-year-old King of England.
In Northampton, on 19 December 1217,
Alexander, bereft of allies, paid homage to the child king, Henry III.
His ambition of ruling the northern territories of England was over.
Deflated, Alexander returned to Scotland.
His ambitions shattered, his morale was at an all-time low.
He came here to Arbroath Abbey to pay respects to his father William, who had also failed to regain the northern territories.
If Alexander had learnt anything from the war in England, it was that the northern barons had felt English, not Scottish.
They had chosen Henry as their king, not Alexander.
The English barons knew instinctively who their king was.
But could the same be said for the Scottish nobles?
The Scottish nobles were split between two powerful factions.
In the south were the descendants of Norman families, invited to settle in southern Scotland by the early Canmore kings.
Helping to build many of the great Border abbeys and cathedrals, they changed the face of Scotland, transforming it into a more European-looking kingdom.
In the north were the territories of powerful Gaelic earls, whose ancestors had forged the Kingdom of Scots.
But these were the very Gaelic lords that Alexander's family had rejected in favour of a Norman future.
The old Gaelic elite became sidelined.
Once upon a time, they'd helped run the kingdom.
Now they were called things like "divider of the King's meat", while the French-speaking brat pack of Norman lords received titles like "chancellor" and "constable of Scotland".
One chronicler of the time wrote, "The modern kings of Scotland
"count themselves as Frenchmen in race, manners, language and culture.
"They keep only Frenchmen in their household and following,
"and have reduced the Scots to utter servitude."
Some Gaelic nobles adopted the Norman ways, but others returned to their own lands, beyond the reach of the King of Scots - the semi-independent Gaelic lands of Galloway, Argyll, Ross,
Sutherland and Caithness, sometimes subject to the King of Scots, sometimes not.
And beyond them, Alexander's rule petered out completely.
The Hebrides and the Northern Isles - all lands claimed by another aspiring and aggressive kingdom Norway.
It was messy, too messy for Alexander's liking.
He would never throw off English claims of over-lordship until all the Scottish nobles acknowledged him as their king.
It was time for a new approach and a new deal.
Alexander decided to strike a balance between Norman innovation and Gaelic tradition.
In his new Scotland, both would be allowed to flourish.
He invited the Gaelic warlords back in from the cold.
In return for some of the top jobs, they would fight his battles.
They would help him conquer Scotland, territory by territory.
His first test came from the north, when the men of Caithness roasted one of Alexander's bishops alive.
Alexander returned the compliment in spades.
In Ross, challengers to Alexander's succession rebelled against him.
In response, Alexander's Gaelic warlords severed the leaders' heads and presented them to him as a gift.
In the west, Alexander pressed on again, down the Great Glen to Lochaber and beyond to the Isles, to attack the lands of the Norwegian king.
Mercy and compassion were never Alexander's strong points.
The man who would be king of all Scotland proved to be utterly ruthless from the moment he set out to subdue it.
A symbol of just how far he would go to secure his kingship was in his treatment of a baby girl.
Alive, she represented a rival claim to his throne.
In Alexander's eyes, she was just as much of a threat as any sword-wielding assassin.
He took no chances.
The infant was a distant relative of the Canmore line.
Her fate was recorded by the Lanercost Chronicle.
MAN: (READS) "The daughter, who had not long left her mother's womb,
"innocent as she was,
"was put to death in the view of the marketplace.
"Her head was struck against the column, and her brains dashed out."
NEIL OLIVER:
Alexander now had what he wanted.
Her elimination killed off the last threat to the Scottish Crown.
This terrible and shocking act was remembered for generations to come.
And that was the point.
Loud and clear, the King of Scots let it be known,
"This is what will happen to anyone who crosses my path,
"however young, however innocent."
But his actions had delivered results.
Something new had emerged.
Alexander's victories had not only brought peace, but something far more enduring.
One people, one kingdom.
Now everyone was subject to one king and that made them one people
- Scots.
Alexander had restored the esteem of his Kingdom to such an extent that King Henry III of England agreed to a border, established for the first time in 1237.
Psychologically, that was a big step.
Now Scots could say,
"This is Scotland, that is England, and we are different."
Alexander's 35-year reign ended when he died on 8 July 1249.
His kingdom stretched all the way from Caithness in the north to the Solway Firth in the south.
That was the legacy of Alexander II.
(FOLK MUSIC PLAYS)
# Ex te lux oritur o dulcis Scocia
# Qua vere noscitur fulgens Norwagia
# Que cum transvehitur Trahis suspiria... #
In the years following his death, a stronger, more confident Scotland entered a golden age.
His son, Alexander III, inherited the family firm.
Times were good.
Scotland prospered and culture flowered.
England now saw Scotland differently.
Suddenly, the Scots were worth getting into bed with.
Claims of over-lordship were replaced by offers of marriage.
And so it was that at Christmas 1251,
Alexander III, King of the Scots, married Princess Margaret of England.
It was an ostentatious display of wealth and power and the message was clear -
Scotland was determined to be seen as an equal partner, an equal kingdom.
Eyeing the proceedings was the bride's brother, the young Prince Edward.
Heir to the throne of England, this long-legged, blue-eyed boy was the epitome of an English prince.
But more penetrating eyes could see beyond the image.
This boy's life would be less than saintly.
Edward had a taste for violence.
The chronicler Matthew Paris famously recalled how the young prince got one of his followers to attack a man, cut off an ear and gouge out an eye.
Paris wondered what kind of king he would make,
"If he does these things when the wood is green,
"what can be hoped for when it is seasoned?"
As time passed, Edward grew into a formidable and skilful warrior.
He indulged his lust for war by heading off on crusade to the Holy Land.
On his return, he is every inch the hero, and at last crowned King of England.
But while Edward's life took on the glow of a medieval boy's own story,
Alexander III's life turned into Greek tragedy.
In the space of nine years,
Alexander III lost his wife - Edward's sister - and all three of his children.
The Canmore dynasty was withering on the vine.
Edward was shocked and sent a letter of condolence to his brother-in-law.
Alexander's reply to that letter seems to suggest a genuine warmth between the two kings.
(READS) "You have offered much solace for our grief by saying
"that although death has borne away your kindred in these parts,
"we are united together perpetually, God willing,
"by the tie of indissoluble affection."
Then, in March 1286, Edward heard about another death
- Alexander.
The King of Scots had finished his business in Edinburgh but he was desperate to travel the 20-odd miles to here at Kinghorn and the royal palace where his new young wife, Yolande, was waiting for him.
His advisors begged him not to go - it was a foul night, dark and stormy - but the warnings went unheeded and somewhere near here
Alexander became separated from his guides and was thrown from his horse.
They found his body on the beach the next morning, the neck broken.
Edward mourned the death of his brother-in-law, though some would say that he shed crocodile tears.
He may have been related to Scotland's royal family - his father may have recognised Scotland's sovereignty - but Edward was descended from a long line of English kings who claimed to be her overlord, a claim that Edward had not forgotten.
And now the kingdom's future hung by a thread.
Next in line to the Scottish throne was Alexander's three-year-old granddaughter and Edward's grand-niece, Margaret, known as the Maid of Norway.
The child Margaret was the last direct link with the Canmore dynasty.
Her marriage to Edward's son was speedily arranged.
As far as Edward was concerned, as soon as the ink on the marriage agreement was dry,
Scotland would belong to him.
The logic was simple.
Medieval women were property.
What they owned belonged to their husbands.
What the Maid owned, once she was married, would belong to Edward's son.
Then in October 1290, the Maid died.
The house of Canmore was finished.
Scotland was without a royal family.
For Edward, this was an act of divine providence.
The succession was in doubt because there were two leading contenders vying for the Scots throne.
John Balliol and Robert Bruce the Elder were from two of Scotland's most powerful families.
Both had enough military muscle to back their claim on the field.
Scotland was divided.
It fell to the Guardians - men chosen to govern the realm in the absence of a king - to prevent civil war.
But they needed help.
An impartial, friendly arbitrator.
Someone with experience.
Someone who could command respect.
Who else but King Edward I?
Internationally respected monarch, and master of the law.
And, after all, relations between the two kingdoms were amicable and Edward was family.
There was no reason to doubt him.
Edward called for a parliament to be held on 6th May 1291 to decide the future of the Scottish crown, and the location he chose was Norham - over there, on the English side of the River Tweed.
The Scots smelled a rat.
The future of Scotland to be decided in England?
It wasn't right.
So the Scots stalled on the Scottish side of the river.
It was a stand-off.
It didn't take Edward long to reveal his true colours, his real intention.
He sent word to the Scots that the parliament would not start until the Guardians and the claimants for the throne of Scotland acknowledged his position as superior overlord of Scotland.
The Scots were stunned.
60 years of peace and now this.
They would not give up their hard-won autonomy.
One of the six Guardians of Scotland was Bishop Wishart of Glasgow.
A shrewd and powerful figure, Wishart, a bulldog of a man.
True to style, he delivered Scotland's response in person.
He told Edward to his face.
MAN:
The Scottish Kingdom is not held in tribute or homage to anyone save God alone.
Edward shrugged off Wishart's words of defiance.
Although Bruce and Balliol had the only serious claims,
Edward decided to change the rules again.
He produced 11 more claimants from leading noble families and declared that if they didn't acknowledge his over-lordship, they would be eliminated from the contest.
The Scots were outmanoeuvred.
If Bruce and Balliol wanted the job of King of Scots, they had no choice but to agree to Edward's terms.
One by one, the now 13 claimants, along with the Guardians of Scotland, swore fealty to Edward, the King of England, as "superior and direct overlord of the kingdom of Scotland".
Edward had what he wanted.
It made no difference to him who was actually chosen.
He already had all of the claimants' oaths of subservience in the bag.
In the end, it was John Balliol who emerged as heir to the throne.
Edward had it all stitched up.
He was Scotland's superior overlord and not a drop of blood had been spilt.
Wishart's deepest fears were being realised before his very eyes.
He didn't hang around long.
He'd seen enough.
No longer a Guardian, Wishart returned to Glasgow.
The new King of Scots, John Balliol, had to pay homage and swear fealty to Edward for his kingdom a second time.
Edward's authority was absolute.
He could do exactly as he wanted... and he did.
In 1294, Edward demanded Scottish troops for his war against France.
Then he summoned Balliol himself to fight.
The King of Scots to do military service for the King of England?
It seemed unthinkable.
At a stroke, the achievements of the Canmores - the forging of Scotland, its status as a separate and distinct entity, was in peril.
It was time for action.
Bishop Wishart and the other Scots leaders realised Balliol was no match for Edward.
At a parliament in Stirling, they debated what to do about Balliol.
Wishart had no qualms.
By the end of the meeting, the Bishop's radical view prevailed.
A new Guardianship was established.
A council of 12 men was selected to run the affairs of the kingdom in Balliol's name.
Balliol was to be reduced to a figurehead, to be wheeled out to play the role of ruler.
Now, the real governors of Scotland laid plans to fight Edward.
As Wishart saw it, the council had two tasks - negotiate a treaty with France and prepare the country for war.
France was Edward's enemy.
Military support from them would mean the Scots stood a chance against Edward's forces.
In the late summer of 1295, a delegation left Stirling for Paris to negotiate a treaty with the French king.
The terms were simple.
Should Edward attack France, then the Scots would wage war against the English.
In return, the French promised support should Scotland be attacked.
The French agreed.
When Edward went to war against France in 1296, the Scots duly marched into England.
The fuse was lit.
Wishart waited for Edward's inevitable onslaught.
It came.
On 30 March 1296, Edward's army crossed into Scotland.
Edward wasn't a man to do things by halves.
At around 30,000 strong, this was the largest army that had ever been sent north.
First stop, Berwick-upon-Tweed.
Just as the Easter celebrations were drawing to a close,
Edward crossed the Tweed.
The feeble, timber fortifications offered no resistance.
What followed was one of the worst massacres in British medieval history.
For two days, streams of blood flowed from the bodies of the slain.
For his tyrannous rage, he ordered 7,500 souls of both sexes to be massacred.
Mills could be turned round by the flow of their blood.
Despite the surrender of the local garrison,
Edward set about the wholesale slaughter of the town's population.
The orgy of violence only came to an end when the frantic pleading of local clergy moved Edward to show at least some pity.
But Berwick was just a warm-up.
Edward's reputation would now precede him, as he advanced north into the heartlands of Scotland.
After defeating the large but inexperienced Scots army at Dunbar, resistance to Edward buckled.
Castle after castle fell.
Most of the Scots nobility were captured and imprisoned.
It was over.
Now, Edward wanted the man he believed responsible -
Balliol, the lamb caught amongst the wolves.
It took Balliol eight days to negotiate his surrender, which was hardly surprising, as he did have a lot of explaining to do.
Edward was angry.
Balliol had acted contemptibly and illegally.
He was Edward's man, and yet he had conspired with the French and attacked English soil.
He was a defaulting vassal who would have to be punished, along with the Scots if they refused to submit.
But Edward wanted more than a simple surrender.
He wanted a show.
Paraded as a penitent before Edward, Balliol was stripped of his kingship, the royal insignia ripped from his clothing, earning him the cruel nickname Toom Tabard -
"empty suit", King Nobody.
Broken and humiliated, Balliol was sent to the Tower of London and then to exile in France.
Not content to humiliate a man, Edward plundered the country.
He set about systematically stripping Scotland of all her symbols of sovereignty and independence - the crown jewels, the Black Rood of St Margaret, the holiest and most venerated relic of Scotland and the Stone of Destiny, the centrepiece of Scottish king-making.
In the months that followed,
Edward decided to take a tour of his newly won kingdom.
But this was no tourist trip.
City by city, burgh by burgh, castle by castle,
Edward forced the Scottish nobles to sign up to his new regime to put their names to what became the most infamous document in Scottish history.
The Ragman Roll.
Well, the Ragman Roll is a list of the Scottish nobles who had to give homage to Edward I of England in 1296.
So, it's got about...
nearly 1,900 names on it.
NEIL OLIVER:
What is contained in all these endless lines of text?
What exactly are they signing up to?
Well, basically, they had to pay homage to Edward I, who had defeated the Scots at the Battle of Dunbar, and he was essentially the King of Scots now, and they had to acknowledge him as their lord and master.
What are the famous names that would stand out?
Well, you've got a full panoply of the Scottish nobility.
You've got the competitors for the throne, the head of the house of Balliol, Bruce, the Stuarts are there, there's a complete set of bishops, people like Bishop Wishart, and then there is, of course, a lot of knights, if you like,
and lesser people who held land in Scotland at that time.
But it isn't just the names of the nobility and bishops that appear on the Ragman Roll.
Representatives across the Scottish kingdom, religious and political, were forced to fix their seals of submission.
Scotland was without a king.
Beaten, broken and humiliated.
The winter of 1296 was one of the country's darkest.
Edward left the governance of Scotland to two trusted lieutenants and returned to where he'd left off - fighting the French.
As he crossed the Tweed back into England, he quipped,
"A man does good work when he rids himself of shit."
But in the rush to be rid of Scotland, Edward missed something.
Scotland had never been directly ruled by an English king, so when Edward ordered the Scots to join his war in France, the Scots grew resentful.
And when Edward imposed English taxes to pay for it, the Scots grew rebellious.
Alexander II had given the Scots a united kingdom with a border, a sense of who they were.
But within the space of a decade, all of this was swept away.
Edward had already absorbed Wales into his kingdom and conscripted the Welsh into his armies.
Now he proposed to do exactly the same thing with Scotland.
And it was the prospect of being absorbed by England, of being forced to fight Edward's battles, that tipped the Scots over the edge.
The first spark of resistance was struck in the Gaelic north.
It was a small act of defiance, a single standard raised against Edward, but soon a myriad of flames engulfed the kingdom, and among them was one man, William Wallace.
William Wallace.
The Wallace.
For many, he's the ultimate freedom fighter, for others, a terrorist.
He is the enigmatic hero who appears from nowhere to liberate his people and to shape history.
The Wallace story is one of the defining legends of Scottish identity and the epitome of Scotland's story.
And yet, with all the mythologising, we've lost sight of Wallace the man - a remarkable man, but a man nonetheless.
The younger son of an obscure knight,
Wallace's destiny would be shaped less by himself, more by the needs of others.
And what Bishop Wishart, the self-appointed chief of the Scottish resistance movement, needed right now was time.
Scotland had run out of leaders.
Most of her nobles were either imprisoned or had been forced to fix their seals to the Ragman Rolls.
Wishart could have been under no illusions when the pair met here, at Glasgow Cathedral.
Wallace was no leader of armies, but he was smart and he could fight and he had the popular touch.
Most importantly, he could buy time for Wishart while the Bishop tried to raise the Scots nobles in Ayrshire.
An English chronicler put it simply -
"Wishart caused a certain bloody man, William Wallace,
"who had formerly been a chief of brigands in Scotland,
"to revolt against the King and assemble people in his support."
And that's exactly what Wallace did.
After killing the hated English sheriff of Lanark, the very symbol of Edward's oppressive regime,
Wallace's rising swiftly gained momentum.
But the men who flocked to Wallace's side weren't of noble blood.
His army were peasants - humble folk, the middling sort.
The kind of people who'd had first-hand experience of Edward's policies of wringing as many men and taxes out of Scotland as he could.
If Wallace's army was to stand any chance against Edward's mighty war machine, they needed space, open space, and time to train.
Wallace knew this would be no easy task.
His army was used to the hit-and-run tactics of guerrilla warfare.
They had little experience of the battlefield.
The best he could offer his men was discipline.
By the late summer of 1297, Wallace's army was ready.
He joined forces with Andrew Murray, a nobleman's son who had led a successful revolt in the north.
Together, they marched their men to intercept the English at Stirling.
It was only then, when the English woke up, they realised the handful of rebels had swollen into a respectable-sized army.
But the English captain, Warenne, wasn't alarmed.
His army, with its impressive heavy cavalry, could take on any peasant rabble.
To confront the Scots, the English army had to cross the River Forth.
Easier said than done.
Deep and impassable, the Forth rises in the west and flows east to meet the North Sea, almost cutting the country in half.
The crossing point - a narrow, wooden bridge at Stirling.
When the English arrived, Wallace and Murray were waiting.
They knew the land and they understood the strategic importance of the bridge across the Forth as the gateway to the north.
They positioned their army on the slopes of Abbey Craig, about a mile from the bridge.
On September 11th 1297, both armies faced each other.
In bald terms, Warenne told the Scots to surrender.
Wallace told them, "Go back and tell your people
"that we have not come for the benefit of peace,
"but to do battle to defend ourselves and liberate our kingdom.
"Let them come to us, and we will prove this in their very beards."
The English horsemen began to ride across the bridge.
Warenne suddenly exploded - he hadn't actually given the order to cross.
So he made his men come back to his side and regroup.
Then, on his command, they began to cross for a second time.
Wallace must have been amazed by this comic display of arrogance and complacency.
But Warenne didn't care how it looked.
He didn't rate Wallace's army.
As far as he was concerned, this would be little more than a good training exercise for the men.
What they learned was how to die.
The English were trapped, caught in the loop of the river with nowhere to go.
As the chronicler Guisborough said,
"There was indeed no better place in all the land
"to deliver the English into the hands of the Scots,
"and so many into the power of the few."
By nightfall, 5,000 English infantry and 100 knights had perished.
Among the English dead lay the body of the hated treasurer.
He'd been flayed alive.
The treasurer had taken the skin off Scots' backs, and now they had done the same to him in return.
Wallace kept the skin, had it fashioned into a sword belt, a memento of the day's victory.
The defeat was a huge loss of face for Edward.
The great English army, the vast, Edwardian war machine that had conquered Wales, that was famed throughout Europe, had been defeated.
But hardest of all to swallow was the fact it had been defeated by a bunch of peasant amateurs - Scots peasant amateurs, to boot.
It was at this time that Edward first heard the name William Wallace.
We can be sure of one thing - he'd never forget it.
The Scottish nobles were dumbfounded.
Now they were forced to rub shoulders with the middling folk to make this man Guardian of Scotland.
Murray, the noble who commanded the army with Wallace, would have been their preferred choice, but his death after Stirling Bridge ruled that out.
Here at Kirk of the Forest,
Wallace the outlaw became Sir William Wallace, the Guardian of Scotland.
He was the hero of the hour, for now.
But despite his victory, there were those who didn't approve of a mere commoner being given such a big job.
After all, what did he know about politics and kings?
But none of that mattered at the moment.
What did matter was that he had proved himself in battle and his job was only half done.
Only when John Balliol was restored to the throne could Scotland be free.
Wallace had proved to be Edward's equal in every regard except status.
He was brutal, he was ruthless, he fought on Edward's terms.
He played dirty.
The defeat at Stirling Bridge had angered Edward.
Now he wanted revenge.
By July, his vast military machine, composed mainly of newly conquered Welsh, crossed into Scotland.
As Edward advanced north, he encountered a wasted landscape.
There was no sign of Wallace, but he could see his handiwork in every burnt-out farm.
Weeks passed, there was still no sign of him.
But then the logic of Wallace's strategy became obvious.
Denied food supplies, the English army started to starve, and fighting broke out between the English and Welsh infantry.
Edward's army was close to disintegration when it finally arrived at Linlithgow's town walls.
He realised he might have to abandon the war altogether, unless he could find Wallace, and fast.
The scouts reported that the Scots army was less than 20 miles away, at Falkirk.
Edward force-marched his men until they came upon Wallace.
The Scots were dug in - four schiltroms, bristling with spears.
Edward's propaganda machine had gone into overdrive.
The English troops weren't expecting to see Wallace the man, rather, Wallace the monster, an ogre who would quite literally skin them alive.
And of course, it was Edward who had unleashed the monster.
He had unmade Scotland, taking it apart bit by bit, and Wallace was the result.
Edward was unconcerned - it would all be over soon.
And it was, in a hail of arrows.
Edward's archers began the slaughter of the infantry.
It was said the Scots fell like blossom in an orchard when the fruit had ripened.
The cavalry completed the rout.
Wallace resigned as Guardian.
Scotland descended into five years of exhausting, costly, protracted fighting.
Then the Scots lost their ally, the French.
Alone, they could not defeat Edward.
It was pointless going on - the Scots sought terms.
Equally, Edward was tired and old.
He was in his 60s, and the war was burning a very large hole in his pocket.
He wanted to draw a line under the whole sorry business.
But naturally, he wanted that on his own terms.
He wanted Wallace.
"As for William Wallace,"said Edward,
"it is agreed that he shall render himself up at the mercy and will
"of our sovereign lord the King, as it shall seem good to him."
Wallace's fate was sealed the following month.
At the St Andrew's Parliament of 1304, he was declared an outlaw by the Scots nobles.
129 landowners took Edward as their liege lord.
Among their ranks was the man who had helped create Wallace Robert Wishart, the Bishop of Glasgow.
In truth, the document they signed up to, the Ordinances of 1305, marked the completion of the second conquest of Scotland.
And this time, there was no mention of a king or a kingdom, merely a land.
As for Wallace, Edward had singled him out for special treatment.
No words of peace were offered.
Wallace must submit to Edward's pleasure.
Edward played every dirty trick in the book.
He threatened and blackmailed Wallace's friends, forcing them to hunt down the fugitive.
Finally, Wallace was betrayed.
On 3rd August 1305, he was seized in a house near Glasgow.
According to an English source, Wallace was surprised in his bed.
In the Scots version of what happened,
Wallace put up a huge fight before he was eventually taken.
Three weeks later, Wallace stood here, Westminster Hall, before Edward's judges.
The King, ever the master of the law, was determined to destroy Wallace's reputation.
A crown of laurel leaves had been placed on his head, to mock, it was said, Wallace's boast that one day he would wear a crown.
As an outlaw, he was already legally condemned - no plea, no jury, no witnesses, no defence.
He was merely presented with the indictment.
That he had notoriously committed killings, arson, destruction of property, and sacrilege during the war with England.
That he had assumed the title of Guardian and seduced the Scots into an alliance with France.
The charge of treason was an innovation, but if it was on the King's Record, then it was law.
If Edward said he was a traitor, then he was.
It was only then that Wallace spoke.
He had never been a traitor.
He had never sworn allegiance to Edward.
Like Scotland, Wallace was trapped by Edward's laws.
The outcome was a forgone conclusion.
He suffered a traitor's death.
There was no Christian burial.
Wallace's boiled head was spiked on London Bridge and his quartered body sent north to Newcastle, Berwick, Stirling and Perth as an example of the fate that would befall anyone who challenged Edward.
What are we to make of Wallace?
What is important is what he became after his death.
He became a brand, repackaged and rolled out in the centuries to come to suit both nationalist and unionist agendas.
700 years later, the basic vision of a free, independent Scotland, for which William Wallace fought, still haunts the collective Scots imagination.
For many, Wallace remains Scotland's greatest patriot.
But what had he actually achieved?
In the end, Wallace had failed.
Scotland's king remained in exile, her nobles under oath.
Edward I, the Hammer of the Scots, had conquered Scotland.
You might even say he had turned it into an English region.
But in his fixation with the crown and the kingdom, he'd underestimated the people.
Edward's determination to crush them had served only to define for the Scots who they really were.
You little motherfucker!
Get up, Zack.
Come on, I don't wanna be late for work.
- Ahh!
Get out!
- Jesus, fuck!
Close the door if you're gonna take a shit.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over, it was not closed.
- Close the door, Zack!
- Okay, okay.
- God.
- Fine.
- What's that thing?
- It's a hand warmer.
We're going now.
- You smell that?
Is that the car?
Fuck.
- Oh, goddamn it.
- What?
What?
- Oh, it's wedged in my taint.
- What is?
- It got wedged in my taint.
- What?
- It's stuck under my balls.
- It's between my balls and my leg.
- What's happening?
- Please, pull over.
Pull the fuck over!
- Okay, all right!
Jesus, okay.
- It's about to move up to my ass.
- What?
The movement makes it hotter.
It's tucked under them.
It's stuck under them.
Oh, fuck.
I think I burned my ball hair off.
It's not funny.
Can you help me pick out an outfit for tonight?
I'm working till 6.
- Well, I can try stuff on at the store.
- The store?
No, how about instead, you get a friend?
But you are my friend.
I mean a girl friend, jeez.
Mr. Delaney, can you work for me tomorrow?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
Then you must come in the next day, I tell you.
- It's Black Friday.
- Black Friday?
It's the biggest mall-shopping day of the year.
And since the mall is just up the street, I would like you to come out and work.
- On Black Friday.
- Oh, yeah.
All right, you want me to work on Moolie Monday too?
- I'm sorry?
- How about Nigga Tuesday?
- Nigga Tuesday?
This a new holiday?
- You come to a brother and tell him he gotta work on Black Friday.
You got any idea how racist that sounds?
Telling me to work.
What, you think you own me?
- I never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?
You thought,
"I'm gonna lay down the law for this nigga, I put food on his table, clothes on his nigga baby backs, and he ain't gonna say shit."
- This ain't Amistad.
- You shut up.
You goddamn right this ain't Amistad.
I can't wait till the post office settles my disability suit because then I'm gonna be out this motherfucker.
I'm gonna be Oprah rich.
Y'all can kiss my ass.
You know what?
Fuck you.
Fuck you, and suck cock.
- To hell with you.
- To hell with you.
- Zachary will work.
Zack, my boy.
- Yeah.
- The customer with the harelip-
- Oh, yeah.
- speak me, say you were playing baseball here the other night.
Wiffle ball.
And, uh, no, that wasn't me.
Maybe the harelip makes it sound like "baseball."
Yeah, maybe you hear with an accent.
- Fuck you, okay?
- Okay.
One day, I'm gonna put a camera over there, and then I can tell-
I'll know everything you do when I'm gone.
Everything.
Scratch your balls, take a shit, everything, I tell you, okay?
Okay.
Fucker.
I hate both of you ebony and ivory motherfuckers, I tell you.
- Why is he so fucking high-strung?
- "Fuck off, I tell you.
Very good."
Can you believe that Gandhi motherfucker, telling me I gotta work on Black Friday?
Ain't that some shit?
- Yeah.
- Like I don't wanna do shopping.
Biggest sales day of the year.
I'm getting a flat-screen TV, believe that.
That's my fault, I should tell you.
I asked for Friday morning off, I'm sorry.
- For what?
- I actually need a lot of recovery time.
Tonight is me and Miri's ten-year high school reunion.
I'm just gonna get fucking alcohol poisoning.
- Reunion?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
- Isn't that fucked up that they do that?
They say it's the best chance to get everyone together.
People come back in town for the holidays.
But they could have it in the middle of the summer at a blowjob contest that I was judging, and it would still be retarded.
- So why you going, then?
- Miri's making me go.
Why you always bending over backwards for that girl,
- knowing she ain't giving up no ass?
- We got a good thing going.
She pays half the rent, does dishes, she wakes me up in the morning.
Why complicate that with sex?
Besides, man, I've known her since the first grade.
You don't fuck someone you met in the first grade.
Excuse me, I met my wife in kindergarten.
We got married senior year, and she has been the queen of my world ever since.
- What if you could do it all over again?
- I'd jerk off and live by myself.
That woman is the bane of my existence.
- See?
- Excuse me, can I get a coffee, black?
Can't you see we talking, white?
If you're gonna continue to emasculate me with this Barbie dress-up shit,
I'm using your laptop.
Don't forget to smack it when you turn it on, otherwise the screen doesn't come on.
Why don't you spring and get a new one?
Same reason I don't spring for clothes for tonight, I'm broke.
There's a chick who works at Teen Juice at the mall, you know.
I gave her a good deal on yarn,
- so she's letting me borrow this stuff.
- Yo, bro.
- What?
- You're buying a vibrator online.
- What's wrong with the one you have?
- It died last week.
Look at the size of those fucking panties.
Shoot that shit.
Shoot it.
My God, who even knew Amazon sold shit like this?
This is incredible.
- Those are fucking granny panties.
- Okay,
A, I don't appreciate you violating the sanctity of my Amazon Wish List page, and B, I'm not buying that thing from Amazon, because it turns out I don't have a credit card they take.
- Oh, shit.
- I'm sorry, guys.
Am I in the way?
You're a fucking faggot, all right?
Let's go to Starbucks.
- He's a shitty barista anyways.
- Cock.
- And he throws like a bitch.
- You know what else I throw?
My nut sack in your coffees, so how did that taste, fucker?
We saw your girlfriend in her underwear, cunt nugget.
Well, too bad she's not my girlfriend, you little fuck
- Oh, they're gone.
Are you still talking to me?
Uh, just said, I'm gonna look up more fuck toys on Amazon.
Oh, holy shit.
- They sell the Fleshlight here too.
- What's that?
It's a fucking pocket pussy that is shaped like a flashlight
"for discretionary jacking off."
That way if you get caught, no one thinks it's weird.
You're just a guy who likes to fuck his flashlight.
I am totally buying this shit.
Whoa, if you've got money to burn, how about paying the electric bill?
- That's due already?
- November's is probably due now, but I was talking about September's.
Tell me this doesn't rock.
You kind of look like Ronald McDonald.
That makes me want some McNuggets.
Why would you wanna buy a pocket pussy anyway?
That is so sad.
What?
Excuse me, I forgot about the nobility that accompanies coming with a fucking vibrator.
Think a kid in Darfur gets saved every time a vibrator makes you come?
No.
- "Real feel action"?
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
If you start fucking machines, I'm moving out.
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a machine.
How come you get to fuck something with a motor in it?
I've never met a man who can make me come like a vibrator does.
That's bullshit.
You get to be Buck Rogers having sex in the 25th century with fucking Twiki and Dr. Theopolis.
I'm stuck to a bottle of Jergens in the bathroom.
Holy bejesus.
You do not use my Jergens to jack it in our bathroom.
No, you know what I do actually, is I light a bunch of candles and I sprawl out on my sheets and I listen to Sting.
No, I'm a guy.
Give me two Popsicle sticks and a rubber band,
I'll find a way to fuck it, like a filthy MacGyver.
Oh, my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.
How about this?
I don't get why you're putting so much effort into this thing.
I thought we were just gonna go to sit around and make fun of everybody.
I can't wear anything that I already own and expect to bring home Bobby Long.
Bobby fucking Long?
No way.
Didn't that guy call you "Stinky Linky"?
Yeah, that was then, okay?
Maybe now he can save me a fortune in Amazon bills.
Maybe you can fuck our landlord so we can at least keep a roof over our heads.
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.
Hey, I bought skates with last week's paycheck
- and I need those to skate with.
- Oh.
And this week's will barely cover the past two water bills, so...
Is this sexy?
Yeah, in like a To Catch a Predator kind of way, it is pretty fucking sexy.
Then we're done.
What the fuck?
Zack.
- You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?
- They shut it off.
- Oh, shit.
Just, uh-
Help me get this shit out of my hair.
Just use the water out of the toilet.
- There's poo in there.
- Not that part.
- The back part of the toilet thing.
- Oh, that makes sense.
Take the cup there and then scoop it in, there you go.
Here, I'll lean back and you can just, you know, pour it down like
- Like that.
You're harshing my buzz, you know.
This is so lame.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Whoa!
All right, one hour tops, then we're gone.
Or I had an idea.
We could just not go at all, which would rock.
Even though we're broke and we've never amounted to anything, we're still better than these people, right?
No.
Not at all.
We're probably not even as good as most of them, unless one of them is a crackhead or something.
Just tell me I'm prettier than when we graduated.
You look about the same.
Definitely not prettier, but around the same.
I'm thinner, though, right?
A little?
Not really.
Well, good pep talk.
Fuck.
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.
- You don't recognize us, do you?
- Um, no, sorry.
Zack Brown, Miri Linky.
Were you the one they called Stinky Linky?
Oh, no, no one ever called me that.
Oh.
- Great.
What does yours say?
- What the fuck?
Come on.
- I'm sure I had a nickname.
Nothing?
- All right, you have a great time, and before you go, don't forget your copy of The Roving Roe-Ver.
What the fuck's this shit?
That is not shit, that would be our bi-monthly newsletter.
- Awesome.
- It updates you
- on what everyone's doing.
- Finally.
I love your enthusiasm.
Here you go.
Write your e-mail address on that and I'll be sure to add you to our 800-member-strong mailing list.
We had 800 people in our graduating class?
Yes, and only 250 R.S.V.P.'d.
Doesn't that suck, Mary?
- Miri.
- You married, Bets?
- I am.
Two kids.
- Wow, that's beautiful.
- Awesome.
- You wanna fuck me later?
- Uh, no, I'm married.
- Okay, cool.
If you change your mind,
- I'll be in there getting shitfaced.
- He will.
- Just so you know, I eat the pussy.
- He does.
Ah, tempting.
Again, no.
- Shall we?
- Sir.
Bye, Bets.
Think about it.
Enjoy.
Can I get two beers, please?
You want a beer?
- Yeah.
- Three beers.
- Thank you.
- Here you go.
Is that Zack?
Or am I Zack?
Whoa, ho, ho.
Oh, wow.
- Never gets old, huh?
- The other Zack.
Oh, in my world, nobody calls me "the other Zack,"
now that this guy's not around anymore, huh?
- Get the fuck off of me.
- There can be only one.
- What?
- Highlander, man?
The Kurgan.
Remember?
I'd yell it at you whenever we passed each other in the hallway?
Like it was yesterday, man.
Awesome.
Awesome.
Awesome.
God, you guys have so much to catch up on.
Whoo.
- No.
- I'm gonna let you get to it.
Bitch.
Have you seen that big blowup picture they have of me?
Yeah, it's-
My hair is terrible.
I can't believe I even wore my hair like that.
That's before I knew about styling products, you know.
It makes a big difference in life.
But you live and learn, though, right?
I mean, ten years ago, Pittsburgh, who knew anything about fashion?
Back in the day, our hairstyle, oh...
Hey, stranger.
- Whoa.
Stinky Linky.
- Yeah.
Although it's just Miri now.
- Give me a hug.
- Oh, okay.
- Hi, heh, heh, heh.
- Hi.
Wow.
- How have you been?
- Great, great.
- Yeah?
- You look fantastic.
Wow, that is not something that you would have said to me ten years ago.
- Well, I've grown up.
- Yes.
Yes, you have.
You just look...
Ooh, heh, heh.
- Well, listen to you.
Thank you.
- No, don't thank me, just fuck me.
Roxanne.
Hey.
Someone I like, what are the odds, huh?
Zack Brown, we had four years of Spanish together.
Why does no one recognize me?
- Am I thinner?
Is that it?
- Look at him.
- Who?
- My stupid husband.
No fucking shit.
John Butterfield?
You actually married John Butterfield?
- That's amazing.
- Don't ever get married.
It sucks.
You stop appreciating each other and run out of shit to talk about after the first year.
But look at him now, chatty as fuck.
Flirting up a storm with that cheerleader nimrod Monica Von.
You want me to maybe flirt with you so he can see it, even it up a bit?
I don't wanna get even.
If I was gonna do anything, I'd wanna one-up the asshole.
You can give me a handjob in the girls' locker room.
- Fine, but make it fast.
- Fuck, yeah.
Are you staying in town for a while or-?
Just tonight.
I fly back to L.A. tomorrow.
L.A., wow, Los Angeles.
Gosh, Bobby Long, coming up in the world.
- With Mrs. Long, I bet, huh?
- No, no, no.
No Mrs. Long for me.
- Then can I be honest with you?
- Sure.
Um...
Whew.
I think I need a drink.
Do you need a drink?
Because I need a drink to say this.
- I've got a beer already, so-
- Oh, great, thank you.
I think there's a cigarette butt in there.
Yup.
Sorry about the elbow.
There can be only one.
Can I get a beer, please?
Thank you very much.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
My friend's making an ass of herself hitting on her high school crush.
Oh, God, that's so sad.
It's so Miri, is what it is.
I'm Zack, by the way.
Brandon.
Don't worry, we weren't in the same class or anything.
- Okay.
Lucky you.
- Are you a Monroe-ver?
Well, I went here, let's just leave it at that, I guess.
Do you have one of the large blown-up pictures of your younger self
- hanging around here?
- I do, kind of.
Right there.
- Gorgeous.
- Good times.
What do you do?
What brings you here?
I came with somebody who went to school here.
- Really?
- Bobby Long.
No shit.
That's who my friend's hitting on right now.
See right there?
- Really.
- One dressed like Hannah Montana?
In L.A., we call that look "Nickelodeon chic."
- Wait, L.A.?
Los Angeles?
- California.
That's awesome, man.
What do you do out there?
- I'm an actor.
- Wow, that's really impressive.
- Thank you, thank you.
- In fucking movies?
"Fucking movies." Pretty much.
Look at you.
What-?
Anything I've seen?
What movies?
Oh, all sorts of movies with all-male casts.
All-male casts.
Like Glengarry Glen Ross?
Like that?
Like Glen and Gary Suck Ross' Meaty Cock and Drop Their Hairy Nuts in His Eager Mouth.
- Is that like a sequel?
- Sort of.
- It's a re-imagining.
- Oh, like The Wiz.
More erotic and with less women.
No women, to be exact.
I apologize in advance if I am out of line here, but are you in gay porn?
- Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?
- I thought you recognized me, that's-
- Oh, okay, I get it.
You're not in my demographic, so I'm not insulted.
- Not really.
Who's your demographic?
- Do you love pussy?
- I do.
- Then not you.
Oh, okay.
I came here tonight hoping to seduce you and bring you back to my apartment and sleep with you to, uh, get back at you, you know, for calling me Stinky Linky all those years ago.
Wow.
That is a weird revenge plot.
- You must be a terrible lay for that.
- What?
No, I'm great.
I mean, I've had enough practice and everything.
That-
Wow, that sounded not good.
I fuck a lot.
That's what I meant to say.
That doesn't sound good either. wow.
You're a lot funnier than I remember.
Thank you.
Gosh, you turned out to be such a nice guy.
It just
- You know, it makes it even easier to just
- To just say this.
Would you like to come back to my place and maybe open a bottle of wine and have ourselves a real high school reunion?
- I-
- Hello, Miriam.
Beat it, we're talking.
- I wanted to introduce you to Brandon.
- Salutations.
- Bobby's boyfriend.
- Bobby who?
- Bobby me.
- Bobby Long.
Brandon is the star of such adult fare as
- What was that one called again?
You Better Shut Your Mouth or I'm Gonna Fuck It.
That's right.
I'm surprised I forgot that.
Are you fucking with me?
No, they're fucking with each other.
Oh, my God.
- No.
- What?
Granny Panties?
- Excuse me?
- How can you tell?
This is so crazy.
I was literally just watching you, like, right before we got here.
This is so crazy.
This is you, right?
My name's Granny Panties, and nobody wants to fuck me.
Nothing's whiter than my big gay ass-
Where'd you get that?
Oh, I entered "gay" and "ass," and it was the top hit.
It's had 200,000 views in three hours.
Honey, you are, like-
I'm jealous right now because you're, like, super famous.
Baby, please take our picture.
I get a picture with Granny Panties.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is awesome.
- All right, smile.
Okay, got it.
- Did you get it?
- Oh, thank you very much.
- E-mail me that.
Oh, because he's the worst photographer.
Okay, good.
- You're gay?
- Yeah.
And I'm on the Internet wearing a diaper?
Who knew you'd come to Pittsburgh and meet a celebrity?
I'm gonna binge-drink now until I pass out.
Okay.
She'll be fine.
So you guys suck each other's cocks, huh?
Oh, like crazy.
Okay, that's enough, I think.
I'm embarrassing him.
I love when he's embarrassed.
He's not living out loud, so he gets all like, ooh.
- You are totally in love, aren't you?
- Zachary, we are.
Wow, I-
Oh, God, I just wanna eat him up, yum, yum.
Save some for me, yum, yum, yum.
- I can't keep my hands off him.
- You've had one too many.
Although he does most of the eating in the sack.
In the sack and of the sack.
All right, that's enough.
Look, you've drunk too much.
You do this every time.
You get too Mary for everybody in the room
- and you can't contain yourself.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
And by containing myself, do you mean containing myself in a closet?
In a closet of denial?
Is that-?
No, no, no.
Holy shit, this just got real.
This is exactly why you haven't met my mother.
You don't know how to ease people into this situation.
- You just force your way in every time.
- I thought, maybe for one second in this godforsaken town, I could be myself.
I'm so sorry.
No, you're right, I should just butch up and pretend that I don't love it when you shove your dick in my mouth.
- This is the best night of my life.
- Am I making a spectacle?
- I could make a much bigger scene.
- You really are.
I'm sorry.
Pittsburgh.
Listen up, Monroe-vers.
My name is Brandon St. Randy, and I love Bobby Long.
- Fucking A.
- Is that enough?
Is that enough of a scene?
I could start doing worse than that.
The reason you haven't taken me to your mother's-
Your mother with her makeup and all her drinking, she's in the closet too.
- They fight just like real people.
- I thought I'd be a conduit for you-
Thank you.
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm not.
- Thank you.
- I love you.
- I'll e-mail you.
- Zack, it was so nice to meet you.
And I will be patient with you.
I will be there on your journey.
I will be your Sherpa up the mountain of gayness.
Well, might as well see how many hits Granny Panties is up to, huh?
Did I do that?
Thanks, George.
What kind of evil fucks turn off your power the day-?
No, the night before Thanksgiving?
Who does that?
Can you get an advance on your card?
Fleshlight maxed-out my $200 limit.
Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.
This is bad.
If we don't come up with rent, we're gonna get locked out.
Who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.
Which means by the time we get home, there's no heat either.
Well, I think it's time we put what we always talked about into effect.
- You're gonna have to start hooking.
- You know, you jest, but these are the exact circumstances people find themselves in right before they start having sex for money.
- Yeah.
- Or making porn.
- Oh, my God, yeah.
- What?
You got an idea?
We could make a porno.
- Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?
No, that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me?
That's a rad idea.
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend, he said he makes a hundred grand a year because he shoots and distributes his own porno flicks.
If it's so easy, how come everybody doesn't do it?
Because other people have options and dignity, which we do not have, which puts us in an amazingly advantageous position.
Fuck you, I have dignity.
Where?
Is it hidden in your gigantic underpants that are plastered all over the Internet?
Is that where you hide your dignity?
Every woman has a pair of those period panties.
That's, like, a fact.
Okay.
Families.
I bet people don't make porno, because they have families.
But luckily, your parents are dead.
Sorry.
My grandparents are dead.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
So who are we gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone mainstream now.
It's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks in it.
Look at Paris Hilton.
She throat-fucks a guy in night vision, now she's selling fragrances to tweens.
And I'm pretty sure she's legally retarded.
That's for tweens?
Have you seen that Joe Francis guy who made Girls Gone Wild?
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot piece of shit in the world and he has a jet and a fucking island.
Look, there's got to be a less extreme solution to our financial woes here.
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper route.
- I don't have a bike.
- Be a waiter.
No one wants me around their food.
Would you eat food that I gave you?
I would not eat food that you gave me, that's true.
I mean, nobody wants to see us fuck, Zack.
Everybody wants to see anybody fuck.
I hate Rosie O'Donnell, but if someone said, "I got a tape of Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid,"
I'd be like, "Why aren't we watching that right now?"
Because she's famous.
Hello.
So are you.
You're fucking Granny Panties.
My underwear and your ass are famous, we're not.
So who the F would wanna watch us fuck?
- At least 800 people.
- The jerks we went to school with?
- Are you serious?
- Of course.
If you heard that someone we graduated with was in a fucking porno movie, you'd watch it, right?
I'd watch that guy Brandon suck a cock, I just met him.
With this mailing list, we have almost a thousand people that would definitely buy a porno we were in just to be like,
"Hey, I sat next to that guy in Civics.
Look at his fucking dick."
We sell a thousand copies at 20 bucks a pop, bam, we have paid off our bills.
- So, what do you think?
- I don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.
Oh, wow, like you've never done that before.
How many guys have you met in a bar, taken home, banged with your mouth and then never talked to again?
That's what we call a stranger.
Dude, I don't one-night mouth-fuck anybody that I pick up in bars.
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in the porno movie for some weird reason.
I guess...
We could fuck.
- Ew.
- Fuck you.
I mean, you're a nice-enough-looking guy and everything-
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're an all-right-enough-looking girl.
- How does that feel?
- Dude, I'm just saying it'd be weird and wrong, you know, like fucking my brother.
Okay, seriously, we're just talking about sex, okay?
It's for a purpose.
It's for getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.
- Wow.
- Just explain to your private beforehand,
"Look, this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash."
- Oh, my God.
- What?
You're just doing this because you've always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?
Yes.
I've gone my whole life pretending that I want nothing to do with you, just hoping one day we'd be in such dire financial straits that I could use it to finally make my move on you.
- You're just being sarcastic.
- I am.
See, I was pretending to cry right there.
I guess it's not like it'd be creepy, like if we got way too drunk one night and accidentally fucked, you know?
No.
We'd be going in with the understanding that it's-
A business decision.
Strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.
- Right.
- And by end,
I mean, I'll be waxing your ass.
Fuck you.
I'm not even letting you see my ass.
I've seen your ass and the rest of you naked around a billion times already.
- That goes both ways, buddy.
- You've never seen my dick.
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.
Are you kidding?
That party we went to where you got blasted, and Houls dared you to give yourself head, and we all watched you try for, like, an hour.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks by the way, for fucking letting me do that.
Thank you.
Oh, God.
We really do know too much about each other.
See, and this would really just be one more thing.
I mean, look at us.
It's Thanksgiving and we're huddled around a flaming fucking garbage can like a couple of steno bums.
I mean, this could give us a chance to pay off our debt, pay our bills, get a fucking nicer apartment with heat in it maybe.
What are you doing?
Miriam Linky, will you have sex with me on camera for money?
I will.
- A producer?
- Yeah.
- Guy who gets to finance the movie.
- You think I got that kind of money?
We just need that.
What you're about to spend on the flat screen.
Now I can't get my flat screen?
Fuck that.
No, no, no.
With your cut of the profits, you're gonna get two flat screens.
One in your living room, one in your bathroom.
One in the bathroom?
You know, it's always been my dream to watch shit while I shit.
Everyone with an ass loves to watch shit while they shit.
- I'm gonna make that happen for you.
- I don't know, man.
What else the producer do?
- Um, they help with the casting.
- What's casting?
Finding the people to be in the movie.
- I get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.
Like, I can look at a titty, make sure there ain't no moles on there?
- You can look at both titties, man.
- Man.
I've been looking at the same busted titties for the past almost 20 years.
- I'm due for another new titty.
- Please help us.
Please.
Please.
Yes.
Yes.
I love you.
Well, don't mind that smell.
We had some homeless people squatting in here.
You know, they'd void their bowels everywhere but the bathroom.
Anyway, you pick up the poop and you've got yourself a movie studio.
Why don't we shoot in your apartment?
No power.
You wanna pay our electric bill?
- You motherfuckers...
- We'll take it.
- Bring it back.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, God.
Come on.
Why the fuck do I have to do everything?
Fuckers.
Hey, what is that?
Fucking guys.
This fucking team, man.
They fucking suck.
I'm gonna hatefuck the shit out of you, ref.
- Dude.
- It's cool.
- He's my cousin.
- Hey.
Didn't you used to videotape the varsity basketball games in high school?
Just the away games.
I did it because I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.
Which one?
Whichever one wanted to fuck the guy who taped the varsity games.
- Aw.
- Still know how to work a camera?
- Who cares what the title is?
- The porn I liked when I was a kid, it was always, like, a spoof of a popular movie, you know?
Like, um, Edward Penishands.
Okay, so we need a mildly clever, vaguely dirty title, that sounds like a real movie
- and sums up what you're gonna see.
- Correct.
An American Werewolf in Brenda?
Fuckback Mountain?
- Too soon?
A Cock-in-Lips Now?
- Next.
Cradle the balls.
Work the shaft.
Jerk my come-crayon and let me color you white.
I need cock and I need it now.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
It's "puss" as in pussy.
Oh, because I was like, who would wanna fuck puss?
I want to slam my ham in your can, woman.
Scene.
- This guy is amazing.
- This guy's great-looking too.
I wanna fuck him.
Hi, my name's Delaney and I'm a producer.
I really don't know what it means.
I'm gonna be honest, this is my first time.
You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna touch you or nothing like that.
- All right.
- I have a wife, you know.
We're happy.
I mean, not happy, but it's cool, you know.
Just so you know, there will be some fucking.
- We'll talk about that if you get the part.
- Okay.
I mean, not
- We won't be fucking, there'll be fucking in the movie.
Like I said, I got a wife.
She don't play that shit.
- She is a crazy bitch.
- Yep.
It's my job as the producer to see what you got.
So if that makes you uncomfortable in any way, you don't have to show me anything you don't wanna show me, because-
I love the movies.
- Lawrence of a Labia.
- No.
- Oh, come on.
- Dawn of the Dick.
Yeah, but how are zombies doing it at all sexy?
I want to eat your brain and your ass.
- Dude.
- Sci-fi.
Yeah.
Close Encounters With a Turd From Behind.
- I don't know what that means.
- Just asses.
Fucking deep in asses.
What?
We're making a porno and we just need to know what you would be or would not be interested in doing.
If anything.
- No anal.
- Oh, definitely no anal.
Anal and hugging.
I don't do ass stuff.
- Anal.
- Ah, fuck.
- Oh, wait, oral.
I like anal.
- Yay.
Okay, well, so, uh, do you have any special skills?
Special skills?
I can get a boner really quick and it sticks straight up.
- Is that really a special skill?
- I think.
- Can you show us what you mean?
- Sure.
Oh, that is special.
Yeah, you're hired, Mr. -
- Who are you again?
- Lester.
Lester "The Molester" Cockinshtuff.
- No.
- Wow.
That is the best porn name I've ever heard, man.
I can have a porn name?
- Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.
Are you Granny Panties?
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The panties are actually in the house.
- I'll get them.
- Whoa.
- Star Sex 2:
The Wrath of Cunt.
- We never made a Star Sex 1.
I guess we can lose Star Sex 3:
The Search for Cock, then.
- Cocunt.
- What's that?
It's Cocoon with a cunt.
So Delaney tells us you have a special talent of some sort.
I don't know if I'd call it a special talent, but it's a little something I picked up doing bachelor parties.
It would probably be easier if I just showed you.
- Great.
- The floor is yours.
So a movie, huh?
That could be fun.
Holy fuck.
Her name, Bubbles.
- Invasion of the Potty-Snatchers?
- That's like MAD Magazine stupid.
Well, fuck you, okay?
You try to think of a good sci-fi porno title.
It's hard.
There's gotta be one we haven't thought of that would say it all, not be ridiculously filthy and off-putting, and still have instant recognition with our audience.
- I got it.
- I got it.
- Star Whores.
- Yeah.
It's funny, right?
See, we figured this opens us up to an even bigger sales market beyond the people we went to school with.
People who like comics and sci-fi.
Comics?
Like "Ziggy"?
"Ziggy"?
Is that even in fucking papers anymore?
No, man.
Fuck you. "Ziggy" is a comic, right next to "Family Circus."
No, like Spider-Man and shit, you know?
There's always a shitload of Star Wars nerds at those comic-book shows.
So we sell them a Princess Leia they can really fucking jerk off to.
- That'd be me, Princess Lay-Her.
- Who am I playing?
You, my friend, are the lead role of Lubed Guy-Baller.
Man, he's gonna be balling dudes?
I thought you said this was boys on girls.
If I have to fuck a guy, okay, but I'd rather fuck a girl.
What's wrong with you, boy?
- We'll change the name to Sky-Baller.
- Sky-Baller.
I will be Hung So-low.
Delaney, my friend, you are On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
Man, I can't be in no porno.
My wife will kill me.
Hump me, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
You're my only hump.
On the other hand, fuck my wife.
Unfortunately, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over does not have any sex in the movie but the droids do, I
- CUP and R2-T-Bag.
I robot.
And Stacey over here is gonna play Darth Vibrator.
- I'm the bad guy?
- She's not a guy, Zack.
I know that because I'm not a fucking idiot.
In our movie, Darth Vibrator is a bad girl who wants to fuck the galaxy, literally, and it's up to Lubed and Hung to stop her with their cocks.
- You and me get to have sex, then?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- I know.
Isn't that awesome?
Hold up, hold up.
So who's all having sex with who in this movie?
As of last night, I was having sex with Zack.
What?
Han Solo ain't never had no sex with Princess Leia in the Star Wars.
Guys, this isn't a literal adaptation here.
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.
Kind of like The Wiz or like a parody.
With lots of anal.
- Cool.
- I know, isn't that awesome?
I have a question, do Princess Lay-Her and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?
Uh, no, because they're brother and sister, and according to Miri, brothers and sisters can't fuck.
But you said, that this wasn't a literal translation, so that means Lester's character could have sex with Miri's character.
Because I would love to fucking eat her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.
Dream on, pal, it's never gonna happen, okay?
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See, she's fine
- Wait, what?
Yep.
I mean, everyone else is having sex with more than one person in this movie all of a sudden, so I think it's, you know, not fair if I'm only fucking you.
Guys, read amongst yourselves, okay?
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Look, Miri, we got plenty of sex going on in this thing, you don't have to do that.
Zack, it's fine.
I mean I have slept with way worse-looking guys than Lester.
I just wanna do my part for the movie like everyone else.
You're having sex in the movie, you don't need to fuck someone else.
- You're good.
- I'm only fucking you, though.
So don't we need to vary it up to keep it fair?
Fair for-?
I don't
- What?
Fair for who?
What are these, blood diamonds we're talking about?
Fair for everyone else who is fucking more than one person, a. k.a. you, in the movie.
- I mean, fine-
- All right.
I mean, if you don't care-
I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
Fuck.
I don't give a shit.
Like you said, you know, you've fucked bigger idiots than Lester.
Holy shit.
Are we really gonna shoot this in outer space?
Maybe not bigger idiots.
Thank you.
- Cut.
All right, guys, that's it.
- Yeah.
Make sure you leave your costume so we know they're here for tomorrow.
Mostly, everybody, thank you so much for helping us get ready, you know.
Cleaning this place out, building the sets, sewing the costumes, it's just-
I mean, it's really amazing.
Thank you.
Seriously, thanks.
But this is just the beginning, guys.
If Star Whores works, and it will, we are set up for sequels galore.
The Empire Strikes Ass.
- Return of the Brown-Eye.
- The Phantom Man-Ass.
And Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter.
- Okay.
- Revenge of the Shit.
- You got it?
- Yeah, no, we got it.
Ew.
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.
- We'll talk about that one.
We're gonna have a lot of fun, but more importantly, we're gonna make a lot of fucking money, okay?
- Yeah.
- So get ready for greatness, people.
Tomorrow we start principal photography.
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
- All right, good night, you guys.
- We got a movie.
- What?
- Nothing.
I think someone should acknowledge how insane and amazing this is
- and it's all because of you.
- I don't know.
It's just a porno.
You know what I mean.
You've really come into your own.
Shut the fuck up.
So speaking of coming into things, ready for tomorrow?
Twenty years, we're finally gonna know what it's like to have sex with each other.
You say that like you've been wondering what it'd be like to sleep with me for a while now.
Why the fuck do you think I started hanging out with you?
I knew it.
Here, help.
Let's just promise that it's not gonna change anything between us, okay?
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Some guys can't keep sex in perspective.
If anyone's gotta keep this in perspective, it's you, okay?
I don't want you getting all mushy and gooey on me after I give you the best orgasm you've ever had.
Oh, like you know what you're doing down there at all.
I actually don't.
Where's the clitoris?
Is it in your ass?
Just, you know, make sure you kind of whoop it up and act like I'm a stud who knows what he's doing, okay?
Just be a pal.
Oh, dude, I am gonna Meryl Streep the fuck out of this tomorrow, you watch.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
No.
Really, thank you.
For everything.
You're welcome.
Less than 12 hours and we make Monroeville history.
- I really hope nothing goes wrong.
- It's a movie.
What could go wrong?
What are you doing?
- What's up?
- What the fuck?
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait.
- Wait.
- Stop.
Stop.
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck is going on?
Condos is what's going on, as soon as this shit-hole's demo'd.
No, you gotta stop it right now.
We rented this place for a month from Mr. Jenkins.
Sounds like your Mr. Jenkins was full of shit.
Luxury Homesteads bought this place a month ago.
I'm gonna kill that lying old fuck.
You're gonna have to go Florida, that's where he moved.
We've got thousands of dollars of equipment in there.
- Please.
- If you wanna sift through this rubble when we're done, be my guest.
Hey, get that fucking beam down.
This is the last thing you wanna hear.
If you don't get an advance,
I don't think we're gonna keep a roof over our heads.
I got an advance already.
It went into all the costumes.
- So all our money's gone?
- All your money?
Never mind what my wife's gonna do when there ain't no new snow tires, or when she sees I charged a video camera.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this, man.
I just wanted to see some free titties.
That's all.
But there's no such thing as free titties, is there, Zack?
- Is there?
- Fuck this noise.
Why don't we get another camera, and shoot something else?
Where are we gonna do that?
Got another sound stage?
Sound stage?
We had a shit-covered garage we turned into a sound stage.
We find someplace new and we do it again.
How?
Okay, I'm broke, man.
No, make that, I was broke.
Now I am really tapped out.
I have to get another job to pay Delaney back.
So please tell me, how can I afford to start over?
- What can I get you?
- Yeah, can I get a, uh-?
Too fucking late.
Cappuccino, 3.50.
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
I mean, I'm a total loser in every single other aspect of my life.
What made me think I could do something as simple as filming people fucking?
We have no money left, nowhere to shoot, no sets, we have no fucking cameras.
Here.
It's time I go back to my regular life where I am a quiet fuckup who doesn't cost anybody any money and knows his goddamn position behind this fucking counter making cappuccinos for this fucking guy.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Fuck, yes.
Zack.
You sneaky Indian motherfucker.
I tell you, yes.
Swallow My Cockuccino.
- What?
- That's it.
That's the movie.
Why didn't I think of it before?
We don't need sets or a stage.
Look at all this production value, waiting to have balls on it.
Hold up.
You wanna shoot a dirty movie here, where we work?
Yes.
Fuck, yes, I do.
You know how many stories I have from working here?
How many times I've been laid right there after hours?
You've never gotten laid here after hours.
I know.
Thank you for reminding me.
But I always wish I had, and that's what porno is.
It's fantasy.
It's taking the normal and making it abnormal by fucking it.
Don't do that.
The little dog don't like that.
How did you get a camera?
By being a terrible, untrustworthy employee, that's how.
Give me today, I'll bang out a script.
Meet me back here after closing.
We're gonna launch arching ropes of jism all over this motherfucker.
Peace.
I like that guy but if he tries to fuck that little dog tonight for real,
I'm calling the Humane Society.
It's called Bean-N-Gone, so get the fuck out of here.
Hey, Barry.
- Stand by, Stace, picture's up.
- Okay.
Roll tape.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 12, Take 1.
And action.
I'd like a double espresso so I can stay up all night because I'm in the mood to fuck.
Well, I am a whore-ista, so I love to fuck.
Would you like to fuck me?
Holy fuck.
You mean, after you're done with your shift?
I mean during my shift.
- Sorry.
- Keep going, keep going.
With your shaft.
Let us fuck.
Cue music.
Okay, open up to camera, guys.
Let us see it.
More tongue.
Little less tongue.
Oh, that was good.
Cue effects.
Oh, yeah, like that.
Oh, yeah.
See, I told you it would work.
Didn't I tell you?
It looks amazing.
It's incredible.
Oh, the beans hurt.
Easy.
- Move in for coverage.
- Nice.
That's why we got him.
- Nice.
I'm impressed.
- Get in there, Deacon.
- Come on.
- Like that?
Like that.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
- Pull out a bit, actually.
- That's hot.
No, not you, Lester.
Put it back in.
Kiss the muscle.
- I kiss the muscle.
- You kiss the muscle.
- Can he slap her ass a little?
- Don't be a fucking pervert, dude.
- Stir, come on.
Stir.
- Yeah, stir it.
Stir it, baby.
Hey.
- Holy.
- Shit.
Are you guys still open?
No.
We close at 9.
I need coffee so I'm drive home.
- Okay.
Yeah.
- Thank you.
That's a cute kitty.
Okay.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You guys see the game?
I was at it.
Fucking Roethlisberger, the quarterback, was all fucking,
"Hug it, chug it, football.
All night." Heh-heh.
Okay, pal, here you go.
On the house.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Have a good one.
- Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- I said, have a good one.
Oh.
- Okay.
Keep moving.
- You and your little dog.
Go Steelers.
Action.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, like that.
Oh, fuck it, chuck it, football.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, God, this is good.
You take it.
You take it.
Take it, Barry.
Oh, take it.
Take it, Barry.
Take it.
I'm disturbed at how turned on I am by this.
- Shit, dude, it's almost 6.
- Oh, fuck.
Okay, that's a wrap, everybody, yeah.
Let's give a hand to our hotties with the bodies from last night.
Stacey, Lester, Bubbles, Barry, whoo.
- Yeah.
- Nice.
Okay, when we come back tonight, we finish up the venti-vulva scene, and then we get into me and Miri's stuff.
Again, amazing first night, everybody.
Thank you so much.
Let us fuck.
- Hey, how'd it look?
- How do you think it looked?
It looked like shit going into other shit, in focus.
What an artist.
That was Kurosawa's motto. "Shit going into other shit."
Oh, man, I can't believe you gotta work now.
It's okay.
You know, honestly, I don't think I could sleep.
- I'm pretty, like, pumped up right now.
- Right?
It was amazing.
It was awesome.
I think the cast and crew had a good time.
- We were getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.
I just wanna keep shooting people boning all day.
I don't think I've ever met the ambitious Zack Brown before.
- Well, I'm trying to pay the bills, so...
- It's not a bad thing.
I think it looks good on you.
Come on, hurry.
Come on, come on, come on.
Wait a minute.
- You guys never did it before?
- It's fine.
You know, we talked about it and it's just for the movie.
We're friends, you know, we're just friends.
And we will always just be just friends, so...
Listen, I have some extra lube from last night.
I understand it's kind of hard getting wet when everyone's watching.
At least it was for Barry.
- I don't know if I am gonna need it.
- Really?
Yeah, I think I'm just excited.
Uh-huh.
At the idea of people watching, not because of Zack.
Oh, God.
Zack could never have that effect on me in a million years.
- Hello, Miriam.
- Oh, hey.
Wow.
- Your face.
- Yeah.
Weird, huh?
I don't think I've seen your face since senior year.
I think I made a mistake.
I did it for you so you wouldn't get road rash during our scene, but I should have asked first, I look like a fucking beluga whale.
I think I'll be going now.
Okay.
All I keep thinking is we should've done a trial run at home last week or something.
- Oh, my God.
Right?
- I know.
- You're still cool to do it, though, right?
- Yeah, um.
Totally.
Are you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I'm, uh...
- Honestly, I'm a little nervous, I guess.
- You are?
- It's kind of a big deal.
- It is?
Yeah, you know, it's our first time together since our auspicious debut on viral video.
Oh, yeah.
That's a fuckload of pressure for a director.
As a director, please.
What about the anxiety I'm feeling as an actress?
- Did I pick the right project?
- Yeah.
What about this follow-up?
Julia Roberts followed Pretty Woman with Sleeping With the Enemy.
I'm following Granny Panties with Swallow My Cockuccino.
Only difference is this movie's about cock-sucking and her movie just sucked cock, period.
- The only difference, yeah.
- The end was pretty rad.
I liked that.
- When she kills him.
- with a gun.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- She calls the cops first.
- She calls it in first.
- It was so awesome.
- Awesome, yeah.
So I guess we should do this.
I think we should probably wait just until I lose another 20 or 30 pounds.
Stop it.
You look good.
Thanks.
So, what about me?
How do I look?
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful, so I guess it's not a big deal, but you look amazing.
- Okay.
Let's go make a porno.
- Okay.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 8, Take 1.
- Come here.
- I'm over-?
All right, settle.
Action.
Who could it be?
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm a delivery man and I have some cream for you.
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.
I work out.
So do you want me to give you your cream now?
I've been waiting for it all day.
- Fuck.
Come on.
- Oops.
Keep going.
I spilled my cream.
Do you mind?
I don't mind.
Especially if you spill it on my face.
Let us fuck.
- Fix my shirt.
Think I should?
- Okay.
Let me see them titties.
Actually, you know what?
Sorry, I don't think we should show them.
- What?
- We shouldn't show your breasts.
- Aren't you gonna take your shirt off?
- I'm just gonna open it.
You're not gonna take it off?
Why not?
My tits are bigger than yours.
I don't wanna show that.
She's not gonna show her tits?
I showed my cock and my asshole.
- Okay, I'll do your pants.
- Back and forth. okay.
- Holy shit.
- Where's that delivery?
I can't believe this.
I was delivering cream, and look what's happening.
- Jesus, what is that, a rumba?
- What's a rumba?
That awkward movement.
- Should I take your underpants off?
- Yeah, take them off.
What the fuck?
How does this work?
They're just like
- I'll do it.
- I'll do mine, you just
- You do yours.
- I'll do my pants.
Granny panties.
Just get on with it already.
I'm gonna fuck you with my pecker.
Dude, that's really dirty.
- That's too dirty?
- That offends me.
- Penis?
- Fine.
- I'm gonna fuck you with my penis.
- I can't wait.
For my penis.
Be careful, Miri.
Okay, there we go.
Just keep rolling, keep rolling.
- I'll walk forward.
- Fucking cream is coming.
This is the worst porno I've ever seen.
- Get over here, delivery man.
- Let's fuck on these beans.
- You okay?
- Yup.
- Okay, all right.
- Just leave them.
Just leave them.
- They're really distracting.
- You should leave them.
- You gotta get your
- There you go.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.
This okay?
Okay.
Okay, uh.
- We'll start kissing on three, okay?
- Okay.
One, two, three.
Go.
I'm ready.
- I'm ready.
- Okay.
Deacon.
- Deacon.
Deacon.
- What?
Did you see Lost this week, man?
I missed it.
What happened?
They're on the island, off the island.
Who can follow that?
I think they're in hell.
Would you all shut the motherfuck up?
I want you to come.
- I want you to come with me.
- Okay.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Cut.
That's it?
It's over?
Ain't he supposed to come on her titties?
Well, it wasn't what we'd shot-listed, but that was nice.
- It was so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack.
Thanks, Lester, uh.
It wasn't just me, though, guys.
Give it up for my radiant costar here, Miri.
- Nice.
- Um, show's over in here.
Let's move out, start lighting the next scene.
- All right.
- Let's do it.
- You looked so beautiful.
- Thanks.
I thought they were gonna be fucking hard.
- It was pretty.
- Pretty don't sell.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
You good, Mir?
You need anything?
I'm just gonna take a minute, okay?
Okay, uh.
I'll just be out there.
Yeah.
- That was fun.
- Yeah, fun.
"Fun." You fucking douche.
Wow.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You working on a rewrite?
- Yeah, just for tonight's scene.
- I'm ready to go when you are, though.
- Okay.
You know, before we go, I...
I'm thinking that, uh, it's a good idea if we talk about what happened last night.
- Oh.
- I mean, we don't have to, but I think-
Okay, yeah, uh.
I kind of dropped the ball on that, I guess, huh?
- No, no.
It's...
- To be honest, it was...
You know, I didn't realize how weird it would be for me.
Weird?
Like
- Weird how?
Acting and directing at the same time.
It's a lot to process, you know.
For the first time, I thought my balls didn't have enough hair on them.
That's not what I meant.
I know what you meant.
How you feeling about it?
I guess, um...
I feel like...
Like we...
- Holy fuck.
- The power's on.
Did you do this?
How did this happen?
I burned the bills.
How could we have done that?
- The water.
- The water.
Come on, come on, come on.
Yeah!
- We can shower in our home again.
- We are liquid.
Greetings.
Have you heard the good news about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?
Oh, my God, did you guys do this?
We got tired of you taking showers at our places all the time.
So we took up a collection amongst ourselves.
And chipped away at your mountain of debt.
You guys paid off our massive utilities bills?
- How did you afford that?
- I stole my old lady's bingo winnings.
And Mistress Bubbles did a bachelor party tonight at which yours truly was a guest star, thank you very much.
- Oh.
- Whoa.
Don't get too excited.
We didn't pay off your whole bill.
Just a month of each.
They agreed to turn everything back on?
At 9 at night?
How does that work?
Stacey knows somebody that works at Power and Light.
- You guys...
- This is amazing.
You didn't have to do this.
You didn't have to put us in your movie.
- Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.
- Or put us in your movie either.
- We said that already.
Guys, honestly, I don't know what to say.
You can start by saying we can take tonight off so we can have our wrap party right now.
Guys, we're not wrapped.
We still have four days of shooting left.
Excuse me.
In my "producorial" capacity,
I'm shutting the movie down for a night so we can get a little silly.
Go, go, go.
- Yes.
- Yes.
You all drink.
Was it just amazing with him, after all those years of not knowing?
It was, um, weird.
- But good.
- My scene with Zack's tomorrow.
You don't say.
But I'm a little nervous.
I was thinking about trying to get with him tonight.
- Really?
- I mean, if you don't mind.
You are just friends and all, so I didn't think it would be a biggie.
- It wouldn't be a biggie, would it?
- No.
No, no.
It's not a biggie.
What?
No.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Stacey, I'm not married to the guy, so...
I don't know.
You guys just looked kind of intimate last night.
- We did?
- Yeah.
Well, we're just better actors than I thought, I think, so you know what?
If you wanna get with him, you should just go ask him.
- He'd be really excited to hear that.
- Yeah?
For real, you don't mind?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
All the quarters are on the ground.
- Hey, Stace.
- Hey, Zack.
Come on, are you guys playing or what?
Well, I'm bummed, but I totally get it.
It's no problem to work with Lester again.
He has a nice cock.
Well, you're a trouper, Stace.
Oh, but if I start making weird faces or anything during the scene, it's just because I've been constipated all day.
Oh, shit, uh.
We don't have to shoot the scene tonight.
No, I want to.
Anal's great for when you're constipated.
It totally loosens you up.
I use ex-lax, but good to know.
Okay, I never thought I would have that conversation.
So are we starting with Lester and Stacey tonight?
We were supposed to start with Lester and Miri.
I know.
She
- We're not gonna do that.
I don't think Miri's gonna do that.
Hey.
So where are we shooting this?
Over here?
- What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.
Our scene's tonight, right?
Can I talk to you for a minute in the back?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
What do you want me to shoot here?
Start with the close-ups of Lester and Stacey.
Give me a second, man.
What an artist.
Okay, uh.
Did I do something wrong to you?
No.
Then why are you here?
I'm here for the same reason you're here.
To make the movie.
Okay, just, like, for your own personal information, you're acting really weird right now.
I'm acting weird?
I think you're acting weird right now.
Oh, I'm acting- How exactly am I acting weird?
You've been trying to keep me from fucking anybody but you since we started this thing.
Maybe I was thinking about your feelings.
Were you thinking of my feelings when you were banging Stacey?
Because that'd be really sad for Stacey.
She told me that you told her that that was okay.
I told her that it was okay to ask you.
Holy shit.
I get it.
I fucking get it.
It was a test.
That whole thing was a fucking test, is that it?
If it was, how do you think you did?
We had a discussion, Miri.
We had
- Actually, we had many discussions about how it was just sex
- and how we wouldn't let it get weird.
- I'm not acting weird.
You're acting like a jealous girlfriend is what the fuck you're acting like.
- I am not your girlfriend.
- I know that.
You're not my boyfriend, so why are we having this conversation right now?
Because you're about to fuck Lester to spite me, it seems like.
Did you fuck Stacey to spite me?
No.
You fucked her like you fucked every other bitch and never gave a shit how I felt about it.
- Well, that was before.
- Before what?
Look, don't fucking pretend that the other night, you and me, right there, that that didn't mean anything to you, that you didn't feel it too.
Oh.
You're not getting all gooey on me here, are you, Zack?
You know what?
If you were any other bitch I didn't give a rat's ass about,
I would tell you to go fuck yourself right now because I fucking hate this game-playing shit.
But you, you mean more to me than that, so I'm just gonna lay this out on front street.
I know you felt something big, something real the other night when we were together because I felt it too.
We tried to fuck and instead, we wound up making love.
So if this is what you need to hear in order to keep you from fucking Lester, if this is what you need, then fine.
Here it is, I'm gonna say it.
I love you, Miri.
Happy?
Oh, Jesus.
You better get ahold of yourself, Zack, because we just fucked.
Okay.
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?
But you did.
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.
Wait-
All right, don't forget I'm down here.
Watch that pullout, huh?
Yeah.
Mmm.
This is some damn good coffee.
- Where you going?
- Getting the fuck out of here.
We gotta finish this movie.
Yo!
You believe this shit?
Do you believe this shit?
What the fuck just happened in there?
I'll tell you what just happened in there.
That chick frosted me like I was a fucking cake.
Zack.
Okay, seriously, get a picture of me right now.
I'm hunting humans.
- Dude, check it out.
Ooh.
- Oh, shit.
Seriously, let's shoot the shit out of this bitch.
- Where you aiming at?
- Cock shots?
Cock shots.
We shot you in the balls, cunt nugget.
Well, it's my job to get shot in the balls, so
- Oh, they're gone.
Excuse me.
Didn't you used to work at the Bean-N-Gone in Monroeville?
I sure as shit hope this pays better, I tell you.
So why don't they just shoot you with a puck?
What do you mean?
I mean, what does paintball got to do with hockey?
Nothing, I guess.
- So ain't no prizes or-?
- No, no.
So, what are they paying $5 for?
To shoot a Broad Street Bully in the balls.
White people are fucked up.
Yup, they sure are.
It's a living.
You've been getting the checks I've been sending?
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Probably didn't save you from a brutal tongue-lashing, though, huh?
You know, the wife never found out about the camera, because I paid off the bills.
How did you manage that?
- Because now I'm Oprah rich.
- No way.
- The post office fucking settled?
- Hundred-sixty large, son.
- Nice, man.
Congratulations.
- A beautiful day, thank you very much.
I thought you made that whole thing up.
No, no.
It was very real.
You can believe it.
Even though she's spending all of it.
Well, since you ain't gonna ask me, I'll just go ahead and tell you.
- No, I have not seen Miri.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.
Oh, I suppose you weren't gonna ask about your movie, neither?
Look, that's why I came down here.
I need you to come take a look at it.
- I'm not interested.
Sorry.
- You'd better get interested
- because you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?
The story doesn't make sense.
- The story?
- The story doesn't make sense.
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?
It's a movie, dog, and a movie's gotta have an ending, which we don't have at the moment.
Come shot, credits.
There's your fucking ending.
Do me this favor, okay?
When you're done getting your nuts blown off, come back to humble Monroeville to my crib for a couple hours, check out the flick, you tell me what's missing.
No.
I'll tell you what, you do that, you don't owe me shit no more.
- Really?
- Really.
- Is your wife home?
- Yes.
- Maybe I should leave the pads on.
- You got some extra ones?
Hey, honey.
Where the fuck you been?
And who in the fuck is this now?
Would you calm down, woman?
Goddamn.
You already left one white boy down in my basement while you off gallivanting and shit.
What if this motherfucker
- was all grabby on me?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
Oh, what in the fuck is that supposed to mean?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
- White boys love me.
White boy.
- I said, white boy.
- Yeah?
You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?
- Should I say yes?
- Just say yes.
Yeah.
- Why don't you, uh, head downstairs?
- Oh, okay.
It's just through this hallway.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
What the fuck you looking at?
Why you gotta be yelling at me in front of my director?
- Oh, he's a director?
- Yeah.
I didn't know that.
Shit, he's a director.
Well, why don't he direct my ass to a new husband?
How about that shit?
- That's the bedroom.
- Keep talking, maybe he will.
Oh, don't nobody want them saggy-ass balls!
Saggy balls?
Look at these sagging-ass titties you got around here.
- You could tie these together.
- Motherfucker, we match.
Oh, shit.
Where's my paintball gun at?
Look at you, editor and DP.
You got your shit covered, man.
Please, don't ever say "shit-covered" to me again.
Roll the film for the man, please, so we can see what he thinks.
Just jump through it.
I ain't got all night.
The bitch is on me.
"Nigga Rich Productions." Classy.
- Yeah, DreamWorks was taken.
- Was it?
Plus, it sounds like an underground gay fuck club.
"I met a guy at DreamWorks." Yeah.
All right, so we got Lester and Stacey fucking.
Then we got Barry and Bubbles fucking.
And then this boring bullshit.
Okay, just, uh, go to the next scene, would you?
Uh...
- What next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?
We never shot it.
- Why not?
- Because after you left that night,
Miri came out of the backroom and said she couldn't do it.
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped?
So...
- Wait, so Miri-
- Never fucked nobody.
Just you.
Now, I wonder why she did that.
- Hm.
- Hm.
You see, there was a time when I was just a bitter old fuck making coffees, and Stacey was just a lap dancer and Barry and Bubbles didn't know each other and this fool here, hell, I don't even know what he was.
- A white supremacist.
- Man, fuck you.
Then two people come along and showed us something we didn't know existed.
A world of possibilities where plain old people just like us could do something special.
Even if it's something as simple as filming people fucking.
Sometimes we just need someone to show us something we can't see for ourselves
and then we're changed forever.
So as you can see, our movie ain't got no ending.
Every movie needs an ending, don't it?
Peace.
Delaney, you're a slick cupid motherfucker.
Ain't love grand?
Why the fuck is this white boy running through my goddamn house?
Sometimes.
Miri.
- Miri.
- Zack?
- Miri.
I'm sorry.
- Get out.
- Close the door.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over-
- Just close the fucking door, Zack.
I never slept with Stacey that night, okay?
I swear to God.
When we got into my room, you know what we did?
We talked about you, and us and how things were different and how I was too much of a fucking pussy to just tell you how I felt about you.
And I know
- I know that that's only because of all the stupid shit we said about how we wouldn't let sex change us, but it did.
It changed me.
That has to be love, right?
It has to be love and just so you know, I can't go back to being just friends anymore,
- because I just can't.
- Good.
And I think-
I think that you feel the same way.
Because that night after I left, you didn't fuck Lester.
What's up, Zack?
You know what?
I don't care that you're fucking Lester, okay?
How's that?
- Oh, shit.
- I don't wanna be with anyone but you.
So I will wait forever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life because I love you, and I have for as long as I can remember.
And I would rather die than be without you, Miriam Linky.
Miri's last name is Linky?
You're gonna fuck a guy who doesn't know your last name?
Or that you beat up Carl Roth in the sixth grade?
I know that.
Or what your senior prom dress would've looked like had we gone but we decided not to, and we got drunk alone instead.
Or that you washed your hair in the toilet.
We're not fucking, Zack.
Or that you're not fucking Zack- What?
I asked her to fuck me.
She wouldn't do it.
I even tried to talk her into giving me the fucking Dutch rudder.
Shot me down on that too.
- And a Dutch rudder is?
- Don't know what a Dutch rudder-?
All right, you grab your dick, then you have someone else work your arm.
Here, let me show you.
All right, grab my arm.
I'm grabbing my dick, you're grabbing my arm.
Now work it.
Work my arm.
See that shit?
Work it up and down.
It's like someone else is jerking you off.
Okay.
There's the double Dutch rudder, which, I grab my dick, you grab your dick, you work my arm, I work your arm, same time.
It's like jerking off together but not gay.
We're not touching dicks, each other's dicks anyway.
I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.
It feels good, sir.
Try me, come on.
Sorry to change the subject on you, Lester, but if you're not fucking Miri, why is your dick out right now?
Because I live here now, and I like to be naked.
- What?
- When you moved out, she couldn't afford to pay her rent by herself, so I moved in to help.
But you just came out of her room.
That's my room now.
She moved in your old room.
Wait, wait, wait.
She changed rooms?
Yeah, she said she did it because she missed the smell of you or some shit.
I don't smell anything.
But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.
- Night, Zack.
- Night.
Do you?
Then why are you crying?
Because I missed you so much.
Me too.
I love you.
- I love you, I love you.
- I love you.
I don't mean to alarm you but I think I just jerked off Lester a little bit.
- The Dutch rudder?
- Yeah, it's ingenious, right?
If you ask me nicely, I will Dutch-rudder you the rest of our lives.
Good.
I'm getting tired of fucking the Fleshlight.
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.
- What'd it feel like?
- Like fucking a flashlight.
- Wrong room.
- Oh, God.
That's gross.
Let us fuck.
Hello.
Welcome to Nigga Rich Productions, home of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, the production house for the couple looking to put a little spice in their sex life.
- Shall we take a look around?
- Fuck me so hard.
Oh, God.
First, you'll meet for a consultation with one of our romance-ologists, who'll coach you through that initial awkward stage before you're camera-ready.
So we will start off with some erotic massage and some-
Dude.
Some light petting.
That sounds good.
Are you guys sure you don't wanna do some, uh, butt-sack work too?
- Uh, let's move on, shall we?
- Why?
From their break-out hit, Swallow My Cockuccino, to the multi-million selling Swallow My Cockuccino II and the award-winning Star Whores saga, including Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter,
Zack and Miri have proven time and again that they know how to shoot hot sex.
As an actor, I've sometimes brought my work home with me inappropriately.
When you're telling your real-life lover in the bedroom, to, you know, bend over while you cake your hand in K-Y, it is a sign that the romance is dead, I think.
Then we turned to the professionals at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
Oh, my God, they totally saved our civil union.
They filmed what was inside of us and not what was coming out of us necessarily.
It helped me see his asshole as not just a come dumpster, but a sign of his beauty, his flower.
It became a, uh, gorgeous orchid.
Orchids grow in sort of the filthiest conditions.
That's what his asshole became to me.
This beautiful flower amidst shit.
- Honey, they get the metaphor.
- I don't think they do.
Let's just say, thank you to Zack and Miri.
It's helped us out, it's helped our friends.
Enrique?
Park?
Park?
Enrique?
Can we get a little love for Zack and Miri?
They don't even know what's going on, they're so pilled up.
But don't take his word for it.
Just ask our co-founders.
- Hi.
I'm Miri Linky Brown.
- I'm Zack Linky Brown.
Here at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, we're dedicated
- to committing your love-
- Or lust.
- to high-end, quality production digital video.
A forever keepsake of your passion.
That's right, Miri.
Why set up a camera at the end of your bed and settle for one unflattering angle, when you could let the professionals dazzle and delight your senses with an array of shots so masterfully rendered you'll swear Martin Scorsese snuck into your room
and caught you fucking?
And remember, we're not just the presidents of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
We're also clients.
Call now to set up your appointment
Way to fuck, Zack.

You little motherfucker!
Get up, Zack.
Come on, I don't wanna be late for work.
MIRI:
- Ahh!
Get out!
- Jesus, fuck!
Close the door if you're gonna take a shit.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over, it was not closed.
- Close the door, Zack!
- Okay, okay.
MIRI:
- God.
- Fine.
- What's that thing?
- It's a hand warmer.
[ SIGHS ]
We're going now.
- You smell that?
Is that the car?
Fuck.
- Oh, goddamn it.
- What?
What?
- Oh, it's wedged in my taint.
- What is?
- It got wedged in my taint.
- What?
- It's stuck under my balls.
- It's between my balls and my leg.
- What's happening?
- Please, pull over.
Pull the fuck over!
- Okay, all right!
Jesus, okay.

- It's about to move up to my ass.

- What?

It's not funny.
Can you help me pick out an outfit for tonight?
I'm working till 6.
- Well, I can try stuff on at the store.
- The store?
No, how about instead, you get a friend?
But you are my friend.
I mean a girl friend, jeez.
[ JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ]
Mr. Delaney, can you work for me tomorrow?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
Then you must come in the next day, I tell you.
- It's Black Friday.
- Black Friday?
It's the biggest mall-shopping day of the year.
And since the mall is just up the street, I would like you to come out and work.
- On Black Friday.
- Oh, yeah.
All right, you want me to work on Moolie Monday too?
- I'm sorry?
- How about Nigga Tuesday?
- Nigga Tuesday?
This a new holiday?
- You come to a brother and tell him he gotta work on Black Friday.
You got any idea how racist that sounds?
Telling me to work.
What, you think you own me?
- I never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?
You thought,
"I'm gonna lay down the law for this nigga, I put food on his table, clothes on his nigga baby backs, and he ain't gonna say shit."
- This ain't Amistad.
- You shut up.
You goddamn right this ain't Amistad.
I can't wait till the post office settles my disability suit because then I'm gonna be out this motherfucker.
I'm gonna be Oprah rich.
Y'all can kiss my ass.

Fuck you.
Fuck you, and suck cock.
- To hell with you.

- To hell with you.
- Zachary will work.
Zack, my boy.
- Yeah.
- The customer with the harelip--
- Oh, yeah.
--speak me, say you were playing baseball here the other night.
Wiffle ball.
And, uh, no, that wasn't me.
Maybe the harelip makes it sound like "baseball."
ZACK:
Yeah, maybe you hear with an accent.
- Fuck you, okay?
- Okay.
One day, I'm gonna put a camera over there, and then I can tell--
I'll know everything you do when I'm gone.
Everything.
Scratch your balls, take a shit, everything, I tell you, okay?
Okay.

I hate both of you ebony and ivory motherfuckers, I tell you.
- Why is he so fucking high-strung?
- "Fuck off, I tell you.
Very good."
Can you believe that Gandhi motherfucker, telling me I gotta work on Black Friday?
Ain't that some shit?
- Yeah.
- Like I don't wanna do shopping.
Biggest sales day of the year.
I'm getting a flat-screen TV, believe that.
That's my fault, I should tell you.
I asked for Friday morning off, I'm sorry.
- For what?
- I actually need a lot of recovery time.
Tonight is me and Miri's ten-year high school reunion.
I'm just gonna get fucking alcohol poisoning.
- Reunion?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
- Isn't that fucked up that they do that?
They say it's the best chance to get everyone together.
People come back in town for the holidays.
But they could have it in the middle of the summer at a blowjob contest that I was judging, and it would still be retarded.
- So why you going, then?
- Miri's making me go.
Why you always bending over backwards for that girl,
- knowing she ain't giving up no ass?
- We got a good thing going.
She pays half the rent, does dishes, she wakes me up in the morning.
Why complicate that with sex?
Besides, man, I've known her since the first grade.
You don't fuck someone you met in the first grade.
Excuse me, I met my wife in kindergarten.
We got married senior year, and she has been the queen of my world ever since.
- What if you could do it all over again?
- I'd jerk off and live by myself.
That woman is the bane of my existence.
- See?
- Excuse me, can I get a coffee, black?
Can't you see we talking, white?
ZACK:
If you're gonna continue to emasculate me with this Barbie dress-up shit,
I'm using your laptop.
Don't forget to smack it when you turn it on, otherwise the screen doesn't come on.
[ COMPUTER PLAYS FANFARE ]
Why don't you spring and get a new one?
Same reason I don't spring for clothes for tonight, I'm broke.
There's a chick who works at Teen Juice at the mall, you know.
I gave her a good deal on yarn,
- so she's letting me borrow this stuff.
- Yo, bro.
[ ZACK LAUGHING ]
MIRI:
- What?
- You're buying a vibrator online.
- What's wrong with the one you have?
MIRI:
- It died last week.
Look at the size of those fucking panties.
Shoot that shit.
Shoot it.
ZACK:
My God, who even knew Amazon sold shit like this?
This is incredible.
- Those are fucking granny panties.
MIRI:
- Okay,
A, I don't appreciate you violating the sanctity of my Amazon Wish List page, and B, I'm not buying that thing from Amazon, because it turns out I don't have a credit card they take.
[ ZACK GRUNTS ]
- Oh, shit.
- I'm sorry, guys.
Am I in the way?
You're a fucking faggot, all right?
Let's go to Starbucks.
- He's a shitty barista anyways.
- Cock.
- And he throws like a bitch.
ZACK:
- You know what else I throw?
My nut sack in your coffees, so how did that taste, fucker?
We saw your girlfriend in her underwear, cunt nugget.
Well, too bad she's not my girlfriend, you little fuck-
- Oh, they're gone.
MIRI:
Are you still talking to me?
Uh, just said, I'm gonna look up more fuck toys on Amazon.
Oh, holy shit.
- They sell the Fleshlight here too.
- What's that?
It's a fucking pocket pussy that is shaped like a flashlight
"for discretionary jacking off."
That way if you get caught, no one thinks it's weird.
You're just a guy who likes to fuck his flashlight.
I am totally buying this shit.
Whoa, if you've got money to burn, how about paying the electric bill?
- That's due already?
- November's is probably due now, but I was talking about September's.
Tell me this doesn't rock.
You kind of look like Ronald McDonald.
That makes me want some McNuggets.
Why would you wanna buy a pocket pussy anyway?
That is so sad.
What?
Excuse me, I forgot about the nobility that accompanies coming with a fucking vibrator.
Think a kid in Darfur gets saved every time a vibrator makes you come?
No.
- "Real feel action"?
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
If you start fucking machines, I'm moving out.
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a machine.
How come you get to fuck something with a motor in it?
I've never met a man who can make me come like a vibrator does.
That's bullshit.
You get to be Buck Rogers having sex in the 25th century with fucking Twiki and Dr. Theopolis.
I'm stuck to a bottle of Jergens in the bathroom.
Holy bejesus.
You do not use my Jergens to jack it in our bathroom.
ZACK:
No, you know what I do actually, is I light a bunch of candles and I sprawl out on my sheets and I listen to Sting.
No, I'm a guy.
Give me two Popsicle sticks and a rubber band,
I'll find a way to fuck it, like a filthy MacGyver.
Oh, my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.
How about this?
I don't get why you're putting so much effort into this thing.
I thought we were just gonna go to sit around and make fun of everybody.
I can't wear anything that I already own and expect to bring home Bobby Long.
Bobby fucking Long?
No way.
Didn't that guy call you "Stinky Linky"?
Yeah, that was then, okay?
Maybe now he can save me a fortune in Amazon bills.
Maybe you can fuck our landlord so we can at least keep a roof over our heads.
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.
Hey, I bought skates with last week's paycheck
- and I need those to skate with.
- Oh.
And this week's will barely cover the past two water bills, so...
Is this sexy?
Yeah, in like a To Catch a Predator kind of way, it is pretty fucking sexy.
Then we're done.

- You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?
- They shut it off.
- Oh, shit.
Just, uh--

Just use the water out of the toilet.
- There's poo in there.
- Not that part.
- The back part of the toilet thing.
- Oh, that makes sense.

- Like that.

Whoa!
All right, one hour tops, then we're gone.
Or I had an idea.
We could just not go at all, which would rock.
Even though we're broke and we've never amounted to anything, we're still better than these people, right?
No.
Not at all.
We're probably not even as good as most of them, unless one of them is a crackhead or something.
Just tell me I'm prettier than when we graduated.
You look about the same.
Definitely not prettier, but around the same.
I'm thinner, though, right?
A little?
Not really.

Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.
This is bad.
If we don't come up with rent, we're gonna get locked out.
Who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.
Which means by the time we get home, there's no heat either.
Well, I think it's time we put what we always talked about into effect.
- You're gonna have to start hooking.
- You know, you jest, but these are the exact circumstances people find themselves in right before they start having sex for money.
- Yeah.
- Or making porn.
ZACK:
- Oh, my God, yeah.
- What?
You got an idea?
We could make a porno.
- Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?
No, that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me?
That's a rad idea.
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend, he said he makes a hundred grand a year because he shoots and distributes his own porno flicks.
If it's so easy, how come everybody doesn't do it?
Because other people have options and dignity, which we do not have, which puts us in an amazingly advantageous position.
Fuck you, I have dignity.
Where?
Is it hidden in your gigantic underpants that are plastered all over the Internet?
Is that where you hide your dignity?
Every woman has a pair of those period panties.
That's, like, a fact.
Okay.
Families.
I bet people don't make porno, because they have families.
But luckily, your parents are dead.
Sorry.
My grandparents are dead.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
So who are we gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone mainstream now.
It's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks in it.
Look at Paris Hilton.
She throat-fucks a guy in night vision, now she's selling fragrances to tweens.
And I'm pretty sure she's legally retarded.
That's for tweens?
Have you seen that Joe Francis guy who made Girls Gone Wild?
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot piece of shit in the world and he has a jet and a fucking island.
Look, there's got to be a less extreme solution to our financial woes here.
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper route.
- I don't have a bike.
- Be a waiter.

Would you eat food that I gave you?
I would not eat food that you gave me, that's true.
MIRI:
I mean, nobody wants to see us fuck, Zack.
ZACK:
Everybody wants to see anybody fuck.
I hate Rosie O'Donnell, but if someone said, "I got a tape of Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid,"
I'd be like, "Why aren't we watching that right now?"
Because she's famous.
Hello.
So are you.
You're fucking Granny Panties.
My underwear and your ass are famous, we're not.
So who the F would wanna watch us fuck?
- At least 800 people.
- The jerks we went to school with?
- Are you serious?
- Of course.
If you heard that someone we graduated with was in a fucking porno movie, you'd watch it, right?
I'd watch that guy Brandon suck a cock, I just met him.
With this mailing list, we have almost a thousand people that would definitely buy a porno we were in just to be like,
"Hey, I sat next to that guy in Civics.
Look at his fucking dick."
We sell a thousand copies at 20 bucks a pop, bam, we have paid off our bills.
ZACK:
- So, what do you think?
- I don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.
Oh, wow, like you've never done that before.
How many guys have you met in a bar, taken home, banged with your mouth and then never talked to again?
That's what we call a stranger.
Dude, I don't one-night mouth-fuck anybody that I pick up in bars.
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in the porno movie for some weird reason.
I guess...
We could fuck.
- Ew.
- Fuck you.
I mean, you're a nice-enough-looking guy and everything--
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're an all-right-enough-looking girl.
- How does that feel?
- Dude, I'm just saying it'd be weird and wrong, you know, like fucking my brother.
Okay, seriously, we're just talking about sex, okay?
It's for a purpose.
It's for getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.
- Wow.
- Just explain to your private beforehand,
"Look, this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash."
- Oh, my God.
- What?
You're just doing this because you've always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?
Yes.
I've gone my whole life pretending that I want nothing to do with you, just hoping one day we'd be in such dire financial straits that I could use it to finally make my move on you.
MIRI:
- You're just being sarcastic.
- I am.
See, I was pretending to cry right there.
MIRI:
I guess it's not like it'd be creepy, like if we got way too drunk one night and accidentally fucked, you know?
No.
We'd be going in with the understanding that it's--
A business decision.
Strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.
- Right.
- And by end,
I mean, I'll be waxing your ass.
Fuck you.
I'm not even letting you see my ass.
I've seen your ass and the rest of you naked around a billion times already.
- That goes both ways, buddy.
- You've never seen my dick.
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.
Are you kidding?
That party we went to where you got blasted, and Houls dared you to give yourself head, and we all watched you try for, like, an hour.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks by the way, for fucking letting me do that.
Thank you.
Oh, God.
We really do know too much about each other.
See, and this would really just be one more thing.
I mean, look at us.
It's Thanksgiving and we're huddled around a flaming fucking garbage can like a couple of steno bums.
I mean, this could give us a chance to pay off our debt, pay our bills, get a fucking nicer apartment with heat in it maybe.
What are you doing?
Miriam Linky, will you have sex with me on camera for money?
I will.
DELANEY:
- A producer?
ZACK:
- Yeah.
- Guy who gets to finance the movie.
- You think I got that kind of money?
We just need that.
What you're about to spend on the flat screen.
Now I can't get my flat screen?
Fuck that.
No, no, no.
With your cut of the profits, you're gonna get two flat screens.
One in your living room, one in your bathroom.
One in the bathroom?
You know, it's always been my dream to watch shit while I shit.
Everyone with an ass loves to watch shit while they shit.
- I'm gonna make that happen for you.
- I don't know, man.
What else the producer do?
- Um, they help with the casting.
- What's casting?
Finding the people to be in the movie.
- I get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.
Like, I can look at a titty, make sure there ain't no moles on there?
- You can look at both titties, man.
- Man.
I've been looking at the same busted titties for the past almost 20 years.
- I'm due for another new titty.
- Please help us.
Please.
Please.
Yes.
Yes.
I love you.
Well, don't mind that smell.
We had some homeless people squatting in here.
You know, they'd void their bowels everywhere but the bathroom.
Anyway, you pick up the poop and you've got yourself a movie studio.
Why don't we shoot in your apartment?
No power.
You wanna pay our electric bill?
- You motherfuckers...
- We'll take it.
[ WHISTLE BLOWS ]
MAN 1 :
- Bring it back.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
DEACON:
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, God.
Come on.
Why the fuck do I have to do everything?
Fuckers.
[ CROWD CHEERS ]
MAN 2:
Hey, what is that?
DEACON:
Fucking guys.
This fucking team, man.
They fucking suck.
[ MAN 2 SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ]
I'm gonna hatefuck the shit out of you, ref.
- Dude.
- It's cool.
- He's my cousin.
- Hey.
Didn't you used to videotape the varsity basketball games in high school?
Just the away games.
I did it because I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.
Which one?
Whichever one wanted to fuck the guy who taped the varsity games.
- Aw.
- Still know how to work a camera?
- Who cares what the title is?
- The porn I liked when I was a kid, it was always, like, a spoof of a popular movie, you know?
Like, um, Edward Penishands.
Okay, so we need a mildly clever, vaguely dirty title, that sounds like a real movie
- and sums up what you're gonna see.
- Correct.
An American Werewolf in Brenda?
Fuckback Mountain?
- Too soon?
A Cock-in-Lips Now?
MIRI :
- Next.
Cradle the balls.
Work the shaft.
Jerk my come-crayon and let me color you white.
I need cock and I need it now.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
It's "puss" as in pussy.
Oh, because I was like, who would wanna fuck puss?
I want to slam my ham in your can, woman.
Scene.
- This guy is amazing.
- This guy's great-looking too.
I wanna fuck him.
DELANEY:
Hi, my name's Delaney and I'm a producer.
I really don't know what it means.
I'm gonna be honest, this is my first time.
You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna touch you or nothing like that.
- All right.
- I have a wife, you know.
We're happy.
I mean, not happy, but it's cool, you know.
Just so you know, there will be some fucking.
- We'll talk about that if you get the part.
- Okay.
I mean, not-
- We won't be fucking, there'll be fucking in the movie.
Like I said, I got a wife.
She don't play that shit.
- She is a crazy bitch.
- Yep.
It's my job as the producer to see what you got.
So if that makes you uncomfortable in any way, you don't have to show me anything you don't wanna show me, because--
I love the movies.
- Lawrence of a Labia.
- No.
- Oh, come on.
- Dawn of the Dick.
Yeah, but how are zombies doing it at all sexy?
I want to eat your brain and your ass.
[ GROANING ]
- Dude.
- Sci-fi.
Yeah.
Close Encounters With a Turd From Behind.
- I don't know what that means.
- Just asses.
Fucking deep in asses.
[ TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ]
What?
We're making a porno and we just need to know what you would be or would not be interested in doing.
If anything.
- No anal.
- Oh, definitely no anal.
Anal and hugging.
I don't do ass stuff.
- Anal.
- Ah, fuck.
- Oh, wait, oral.
I like anal.
- Yay.
Okay, well, so, uh, do you have any special skills?
Special skills?
I can get a boner really quick and it sticks straight up.
- Is that really a special skill?
- I think.
- Can you show us what you mean?
- Sure.
Oh, that is special.
[ ZACK CHUCKLES ]
Yeah, you're hired, Mr.--
- Who are you again?
- Lester.
Lester "The Molester" Cockinshtuff.
- No.
- Wow.
That is the best porn name I've ever heard, man.
I can have a porn name?
- Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.
Are you Granny Panties?
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The panties are actually in the house.
- I'll get them.
- Whoa.
- Star Sex 2:
The Wrath of Cunt.
MIRI:
- We never made a Star Sex 1.
I guess we can lose Star Sex 3:
The Search for Cock, then.
- Cocunt.
- What's that?
It's Cocoon with a cunt.
[ LAUGHING ]
So Delaney tells us you have a special talent of some sort.
I don't know if I'd call it a special talent, but it's a little something I picked up doing bachelor parties.
It would probably be easier if I just showed you.
- Great.
- The floor is yours.
So a movie, huh?
That could be fun.
Holy fuck.
Her name, Bubbles.
- Invasion of the Potty-Snatchers?
- That's like MAD Magazine stupid.
Well, fuck you, okay?
You try to think of a good sci-fi porno title.
It's hard.
MIRI:
There's gotta be one we haven't thought of that would say it all, not be ridiculously filthy and off-putting, and still have instant recognition with our audience.
- I got it.
- I got it.
- Star Whores.
- Yeah.
It's funny, right?
See, we figured this opens us up to an even bigger sales market beyond the people we went to school with.
People who like comics and sci-fi.
Comics?
Like "Ziggy"?
"Ziggy"?
Is that even in fucking papers anymore?
No, man.
Fuck you. "Ziggy" is a comic, right next to "Family Circus."
No, like Spider-Man and shit, you know?
There's always a shitload of Star Wars nerds at those comic-book shows.
So we sell them a Princess Leia they can really fucking jerk off to.
- That'd be me, Princess Lay-Her.
- Who am I playing?
You, my friend, are the lead role of Lubed Guy-Baller.
Man, he's gonna be balling dudes?
I thought you said this was boys on girls.
If I have to fuck a guy, okay, but I'd rather fuck a girl.
What's wrong with you, boy?
- We'll change the name to Sky-Baller.
- Sky-Baller.
I will be Hung So-low.
Delaney, my friend, you are On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
Man, I can't be in no porno.
My wife will kill me.
Hump me, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
You're my only hump.
On the other hand, fuck my wife.
Unfortunately, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over does not have any sex in the movie but the droids do, I-CUP and R2-T-Bag.
I robot.
And Stacey over here is gonna play Darth Vibrator.
- I'm the bad guy?
- She's not a guy, Zack.
I know that because I'm not a fucking idiot.
In our movie, Darth Vibrator is a bad girl who wants to fuck the galaxy, literally, and it's up to Lubed and Hung to stop her with their cocks.
- You and me get to have sex, then?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- I know.
Isn't that awesome?
Hold up, hold up.
So who's all having sex with who in this movie?
As of last night, I was having sex with Zack.
What?
Han Solo ain't never had no sex with Princess Leia in the Star Wars.
ZACK:
Guys, this isn't a literal adaptation here.
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.
Kind of like The Wiz or like a parody.
With lots of anal.
- Cool.
- I know, isn't that awesome?
I have a question, do Princess Lay-Her and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?
Uh, no, because they're brother and sister, and according to Miri, brothers and sisters can't fuck.
But you said, that this wasn't a literal translation, so that means Lester's character could have sex with Miri's character.
Because I would love to fucking eat her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.
Dream on, pal, it's never gonna happen, okay?
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See, she's fine-
- Wait, what?
Yep.
I mean, everyone else is having sex with more than one person in this movie all of a sudden, so I think it's, you know, not fair if I'm only fucking you.
Guys, read amongst yourselves, okay?
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Look, Miri, we got plenty of sex going on in this thing, you don't have to do that.
Zack, it's fine.
I mean I have slept with way worse-looking guys than Lester.
I just wanna do my part for the movie like everyone else.
You're having sex in the movie, you don't need to fuck someone else.
- You're good.
- I'm only fucking you, though.
So don't we need to vary it up to keep it fair?
Fair for--?
I don't-
- What?
Fair for who?
What are these, blood diamonds we're talking about?
Fair for everyone else who is fucking more than one person, a.k.a. you, in the movie.
- I mean, fine--
- All right.
I mean, if you don't care--
I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
Fuck.
I don't give a shit.
Like you said, you know, you've fucked bigger idiots than Lester.
Holy shit.
Are we really gonna shoot this in outer space?
Maybe not bigger idiots.
[ MOUTHS ] Thank you.
- Cut.
All right, guys, that's it.
- Yeah.
Make sure you leave your costume so we know they're here for tomorrow.
Mostly, everybody, thank you so much for helping us get ready, you know.
Cleaning this place out, building the sets, sewing the costumes, it's just--
I mean, it's really amazing.
Thank you.
ZACK:
Seriously, thanks.
But this is just the beginning, guys.
If Star Whores works, and it will, we are set up for sequels galore.
The Empire Strikes Ass.
- Return of the Brown-Eye.
- The Phantom Man-Ass.
And Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter.
- Okay.
- Revenge of the Shit.
- You got it?
- Yeah, no, we got it.
Ew.
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.
- We'll talk about that one.
We're gonna have a lot of fun, but more importantly, we're gonna make a lot of fucking money, okay?
- Yeah.
- So get ready for greatness, people.
Tomorrow we start principal photography.
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
- All right, good night, you guys.
- We got a movie.
- What?
- Nothing.
I think someone should acknowledge how insane and amazing this is
- and it's all because of you.
- I don't know.
It's just a porno.
You know what I mean.
You've really come into your own.
Shut the fuck up.
So speaking of coming into things, ready for tomorrow?
Twenty years, we're finally gonna know what it's like to have sex with each other.
You say that like you've been wondering what it'd be like to sleep with me for a while now.
Why the fuck do you think I started hanging out with you?
I knew it.
Here, help.
Let's just promise that it's not gonna change anything between us, okay?
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Some guys can't keep sex in perspective.
If anyone's gotta keep this in perspective, it's you, okay?
I don't want you getting all mushy and gooey on me after I give you the best orgasm you've ever had.
Oh, like you know what you're doing down there at all.
I actually don't.
Where's the clitoris?
Is it in your ass?
Just, you know, make sure you kind of whoop it up and act like I'm a stud who knows what he's doing, okay?
Just be a pal.
Oh, dude, I am gonna Meryl Streep the fuck out of this tomorrow, you watch.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
No.
Really, thank you.
For everything.
You're welcome.
Less than 12 hours and we make Monroeville history.
- I really hope nothing goes wrong.
- It's a movie.
What could go wrong?
ZACK:
What are you doing?
DELANEY:
- What's up?
- What the fuck?
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait.
- Wait.
- Stop.
Stop.
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck is going on?
Condos is what's going on, as soon as this shit-hole's demo'd.
No, you gotta stop it right now.
We rented this place for a month from Mr. Jenkins.
Sounds like your Mr. Jenkins was full of shit.
Luxury Homesteads bought this place a month ago.
I'm gonna kill that lying old fuck.
You're gonna have to go Florida, that's where he moved.
We've got thousands of dollars of equipment in there.
- Please.
- If you wanna sift through this rubble when we're done, be my guest.
Hey, get that fucking beam down.
MIRI:
This is the last thing you wanna hear.
If you don't get an advance,
I don't think we're gonna keep a roof over our heads.
I got an advance already.
It went into all the costumes.
- So all our money's gone?
- All your money?
Never mind what my wife's gonna do when there ain't no new snow tires, or when she sees I charged a video camera.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this, man.
DELANEY:
I just wanted to see some free titties.
That's all.
But there's no such thing as free titties, is there, Zack?
- Is there?
- Fuck this noise.
Why don't we get another camera, and shoot something else?
Where are we gonna do that?
Got another sound stage?
Sound stage?
We had a shit-covered garage we turned into a sound stage.
We find someplace new and we do it again.
[ DOOR SQUEAKS ]
How?
Okay, I'm broke, man.
No, make that, I was broke.
Now I am really tapped out.
I have to get another job to pay Delaney back.
So please tell me, how can I afford to start over?
- What can I get you?
- Yeah, can I get a, uh--?
Too fucking late.
Cappuccino, 3.50.
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
I mean, I'm a total loser in every single other aspect of my life.
What made me think I could do something as simple as filming people fucking?
We have no money left, nowhere to shoot, no sets, we have no fucking cameras.
Here.
It's time I go back to my regular life where I am a quiet fuckup who doesn't cost anybody any money and knows his goddamn position behind this fucking counter making cappuccinos for this fucking guy.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
ZACK:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Fuck, yes.
Zack.
[ CHUCKLES ]
You sneaky Indian motherfucker.
I tell you, yes.
Swallow My Cockuccino.
- What?
- That's it.
That's the movie.
Why didn't I think of it before?
We don't need sets or a stage.
Look at all this production value, waiting to have balls on it.
Hold up.
You wanna shoot a dirty movie here, where we work?
Yes.
Fuck, yes, I do.
You know how many stories I have from working here?
How many times I've been laid right there after hours?
You've never gotten laid here after hours.
I know.
Thank you for reminding me.
But I always wish I had, and that's what porno is.
It's fantasy.
It's taking the normal and making it abnormal by fucking it.
Don't do that.
The little dog don't like that.
How did you get a camera?
By being a terrible, untrustworthy employee, that's how.
Give me today, I'll bang out a script.
Meet me back here after closing.
We're gonna launch arching ropes of jism all over this motherfucker.
Peace.
I like that guy but if he tries to fuck that little dog tonight for real,
I'm calling the Humane Society.
It's called Bean-N-Gone, so get the fuck out of here.
Hey, Barry.
ZACK:
- Stand by, Stace, picture's up.
- Okay.
ZACK:
Roll tape.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 12, Take 1.
ZACK:
And action.
I'd like a double espresso so I can stay up all night because I'm in the mood to fuck.
Well, I am a whore-ista, so I love to fuck.
Would you like to fuck me?
Holy fuck.
You mean, after you're done with your shift?
I mean during my shift.
- Sorry.
- Keep going, keep going.
With your shaft.
Let us fuck.
Cue music.
[ FUNK MUSIC PLAYING ]
Okay, open up to camera, guys.
Let us see it.
More tongue.
Little less tongue.
Oh, that was good.
[ CASH REGISTER BEEPING ]
Cue effects.
[ MOANING ]
Oh, yeah, like that.
Oh, yeah.
See, I told you it would work.
Didn't I tell you?
It looks amazing.
It's incredible.
STACEY:
Oh, the beans hurt.
Easy.
- Move in for coverage.
- Nice.
That's why we got him.
- Nice.
I'm impressed.
- Get in there, Deacon.
- Come on.
- Like that?
Like that.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
- Pull out a bit, actually.
STACEY:
- That's hot.
No, not you, Lester.
Put it back in.
Kiss the muscle.
- I kiss the muscle.
- You kiss the muscle.
- Can he slap her ass a little?
- Don't be a fucking pervert, dude.
- Stir, come on.
Stir.
- Yeah, stir it.
Stir it, baby.
Hey.
- Holy.
- Shit.
Are you guys still open?
No.
We close at 9.
I need coffee so I'm drive home.
- Okay.
Yeah.
MAN:
- Thank you.
That's a cute kitty.
Okay.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You guys see the game?
I was at it.
Fucking Roethlisberger, the quarterback, was all fucking,
"Hug it, chug it, football.
All night." Heh-heh.
Okay, pal, here you go.
On the house.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Have a good one.
- Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- I said, have a good one.
Oh.
- Okay.
Keep moving.
MAN:
- You and your little dog.
Go Steelers.
Action.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, like that.
Oh, fuck it, chuck it, football.
Oh, yeah.
BARRY:
Oh, God, this is good.
[ BARRY MOANING ]
You take it.
You take it.
Take it, Barry.
Oh, take it.
Take it, Barry.
Take it.
I'm disturbed at how turned on I am by this.
- Shit, dude, it's almost 6.
- Oh, fuck.
Okay, that's a wrap, everybody, yeah.
Let's give a hand to our hotties with the bodies from last night.
Stacey, Lester, Bubbles, Barry, whoo.
LESTER:
- Yeah.
ZACK:
- Nice.
Okay, when we come back tonight, we finish up the venti-vulva scene, and then we get into me and Miri's stuff.
Again, amazing first night, everybody.
Thank you so much.
Let us fuck.
- Hey, how'd it look?
- How do you think it looked?
It looked like shit going into other shit, in focus.
What an artist.
That was Kurosawa's motto. "Shit going into other shit."
Oh, man, I can't believe you gotta work now.
It's okay.
You know, honestly, I don't think I could sleep.
- I'm pretty, like, pumped up right now.
- Right?
It was amazing.
It was awesome.
I think the cast and crew had a good time.
- We were getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.
I just wanna keep shooting people boning all day.
I don't think I've ever met the ambitious Zack Brown before.
- Well, I'm trying to pay the bills, so...
- It's not a bad thing.
I think it looks good on you.
ZACK:
Come on, hurry.
Come on, come on, come on.
BUBBLES:
Wait a minute.
- You guys never did it before?
MIRI:
- It's fine.
You know, we talked about it and it's just for the movie.
We're friends, you know, we're just friends.
And we will always just be just friends, so...
Listen, I have some extra lube from last night.
I understand it's kind of hard getting wet when everyone's watching.
At least it was for Barry.
- I don't know if I am gonna need it.
- Really?
Yeah, I think I'm just excited.
Uh-huh.
At the idea of people watching, not because of Zack.
Oh, God.
Zack could never have that effect on me in a million years.
- Hello, Miriam.
- Oh, hey.
Wow.
- Your face.
- Yeah.
Weird, huh?
I don't think I've seen your face since senior year.
ZACK:
I think I made a mistake.
I did it for you so you wouldn't get road rash during our scene, but I should have asked first, I look like a fucking beluga whale.
I think I'll be going now.
ZACK:
Okay.
[ CLEARING THROAT ]
All I keep thinking is we should've done a trial run at home last week or something.
- Oh, my God.
Right?
- I know.
[ LAUGHING ]
- You're still cool to do it, though, right?
- Yeah, um.
Totally.
Are you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I'm, uh...
- Honestly, I'm a little nervous, I guess.
- You are?
- It's kind of a big deal.
- It is?
Yeah, you know, it's our first time together since our auspicious debut on viral video.
Oh, yeah.
That's a fuckload of pressure for a director.
As a director, please.
What about the anxiety I'm feeling as an actress?
- Did I pick the right project?
- Yeah.
What about this follow-up?
Julia Roberts followed Pretty Woman with Sleeping With the Enemy.
I'm following Granny Panties with Swallow My Cockuccino.
Only difference is this movie's about cock-sucking and her movie just sucked cock, period.
- The only difference, yeah.
- The end was pretty rad.
I liked that.
- When she kills him.
- with a gun.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- She calls the cops first.
- She calls it in first.
- It was so awesome.
- Awesome, yeah.
So I guess we should do this.
I think we should probably wait just until I lose another 20 or 30 pounds.
Stop it.
You look good.
Thanks.
So, what about me?
How do I look?
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful, so I guess it's not a big deal, but you look amazing.
- Okay.
Let's go make a porno.
- Okay.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 8, Take 1.
DEACON:
- Come here.
- I'm over--?
All right, settle.
Action.
[ KNOCKING ON DOOR ]
Who could it be?
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm a delivery man and I have some cream for you.
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.
I work out.
So do you want me to give you your cream now?
I've been waiting for it all day.
- Fuck.
Come on.
- Oops.
[ WHISPERS ] Keep going.
I spilled my cream.
Do you mind?
I don't mind.
Especially if you spill it on my face.
Let us fuck.
[ ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ]
- Fix my shirt.
Think I should?
- Okay.
Let me see them titties.
Actually, you know what?
Sorry, I don't think we should show them.
- What?
- We shouldn't show your breasts.
- Aren't you gonna take your shirt off?
- I'm just gonna open it.
You're not gonna take it off?
Why not?
My tits are bigger than yours.
I don't wanna show that.
She's not gonna show her tits?
I showed my cock and my asshole.
- Okay, I'll do your pants.
- Back and forth. okay.
- Holy shit.
- Where's that delivery?
I can't believe this.
I was delivering cream, and look what's happening.
- Jesus, what is that, a rumba?
- What's a rumba?
That awkward movement.
- Should I take your underpants off?
- Yeah, take them off.
ZACK:
What the fuck?
How does this work?
They're just like-
- I'll do it.
- I'll do mine, you just-
- You do yours.
- I'll do my pants.
Granny panties.
Just get on with it already.
I'm gonna fuck you with my pecker.
Dude, that's really dirty.
- That's too dirty?
- That offends me.
- Penis?
- Fine.
- I'm gonna fuck you with my penis.
- I can't wait.
For my penis.
Be careful, Miri.
Okay, there we go.
Just keep rolling, keep rolling.
- I'll walk forward.
- Fucking cream is coming.
This is the worst porno I've ever seen.
MIRI:
- Get over here, delivery man.
ZACK:
- Let's fuck on these beans.
[ GRUNTING ]
- You okay?
- Yup.
ZACK:
- Okay, all right.
- Just leave them.
Just leave them.
- They're really distracting.
- You should leave them.
- You gotta get your-
- There you go.
ZACK:
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.
This okay?
Okay.
Okay, uh.
- We'll start kissing on three, okay?
- Okay.
One, two, three.
Go.
MIRI:
I'm ready.
- I'm ready.
- Okay.
Deacon.
- Deacon.
Deacon.
- What?
Did you see Lost this week, man?
I missed it.
What happened?
They're on the island, off the island.
Who can follow that?
I think they're in hell.
Would you all shut the motherfuck up?
[ MOANING ]
I want you to come.
- I want you to come with me.
- Okay.
Oh, God.
ZACK:
Oh, God.
Cut.
That's it?
It's over?
Ain't he supposed to come on her titties?
Well, it wasn't what we'd shot-listed, but that was nice.
- It was so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack.
Thanks, Lester, uh.
It wasn't just me, though, guys.
Give it up for my radiant costar here, Miri.
[ CHEERING ]
LESTER:
- Nice.
- Um, show's over in here.
Let's move out, start lighting the next scene.
- All right.
LESTER:
- Let's do it.
BUBBLES:
- You looked so beautiful.
- Thanks.
DELANEY:
I thought they were gonna be fucking hard.
- It was pretty.
DELANEY:
- Pretty don't sell.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
You good, Mir?
You need anything?
I'm just gonna take a minute, okay?
Okay, uh.
I'll just be out there.
Yeah.
- That was fun.
- Yeah, fun.
ZACK [ WHISPERS ] :
"Fun." You fucking douche.
[ SIGHS ]
Wow.
- Hey.
ZACK:
- Hey.
- You working on a rewrite?
- Yeah, just for tonight's scene.
- I'm ready to go when you are, though.
- Okay.
You know, before we go, I...
I'm thinking that, uh, it's a good idea if we talk about what happened last night.
- Oh.
- I mean, we don't have to, but I think--
Okay, yeah, uh.
I kind of dropped the ball on that, I guess, huh?
- No, no.
It's...
- To be honest, it was...
You know, I didn't realize how weird it would be for me.
Weird?
Like-
- Weird how?
Acting and directing at the same time.
It's a lot to process, you know.
For the first time, I thought my balls didn't have enough hair on them.
That's not what I meant.
I know what you meant.
How you feeling about it?
I guess, um...
I feel like...
Like we...
- Holy fuck.
- The power's on.
Did you do this?
ZACK:
How did this happen?
I burned the bills.
How could we have done that?
- The water.
- The water.
MIRI:
Come on, come on, come on.
Yeah!
- We can shower in our home again.
- We are liquid.
[ KNOCKING ON DOOR ]
Greetings.
Have you heard the good news about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?
Oh, my God, did you guys do this?
We got tired of you taking showers at our places all the time.
So we took up a collection amongst ourselves.
And chipped away at your mountain of debt.
You guys paid off our massive utilities bills?
- How did you afford that?
- I stole my old lady's bingo winnings.
And Mistress Bubbles did a bachelor party tonight at which yours truly was a guest star, thank you very much.
- Oh.
- Whoa.
Don't get too excited.
We didn't pay off your whole bill.
Just a month of each.
They agreed to turn everything back on?
At 9 at night?
How does that work?
Stacey knows somebody that works at Power and Light.
- You guys...
- This is amazing.
You didn't have to do this.
You didn't have to put us in your movie.
- Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.
- Or put us in your movie either.
- We said that already.
Guys, honestly, I don't know what to say.
You can start by saying we can take tonight off so we can have our wrap party right now.
Guys, we're not wrapped.
We still have four days of shooting left.
Excuse me.
In my "producorial" capacity,
I'm shutting the movie down for a night so we can get a little silly.
[ DMX'S "PARTY UP (UP IN HERE)" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ]
[ THE PIXIES' "HEY" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ]
[ COIN CLINKING AND PEOPLE CHATTERING ]
Go, go, go.
- Yes.
- Yes.
[ LAUGHING ]
You all drink.
Was it just amazing with him, after all those years of not knowing?
It was, um, weird.
- But good.
- My scene with Zack's tomorrow.
You don't say.
But I'm a little nervous.
I was thinking about trying to get with him tonight.
- Really?
- I mean, if you don't mind.
You are just friends and all, so I didn't think it would be a biggie.
- It wouldn't be a biggie, would it?
- No.
No, no.
It's not a biggie.
What?
No.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Stacey, I'm not married to the guy, so...
I don't know.
You guys just looked kind of intimate last night.
- We did?
- Yeah.
Well, we're just better actors than I thought, I think, so you know what?
If you wanna get with him, you should just go ask him.
- He'd be really excited to hear that.
- Yeah?
For real, you don't mind?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
DEACON:
All the quarters are on the ground.
ZACK:
- Hey, Stace.
- Hey, Zack.
[ WHISPERING ]
DEACON:
Come on, are you guys playing or what?
[ INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE ]
Well, I'm bummed, but I totally get it.
It's no problem to work with Lester again.
He has a nice cock.
Well, you're a trouper, Stace.
Oh, but if I start making weird faces or anything during the scene, it's just because I've been constipated all day.
Oh, shit, uh.
We don't have to shoot the scene tonight.
No, I want to.
Anal's great for when you're constipated.
It totally loosens you up.
I use ex-lax, but good to know.
Okay, I never thought I would have that conversation.
So are we starting with Lester and Stacey tonight?
We were supposed to start with Lester and Miri.
I know.
She-
- We're not gonna do that.
I don't think Miri's gonna...
[ KNOCKING ON DOOR ]
...do that.
Hey.
So where are we shooting this?
Over here?
- What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.
Our scene's tonight, right?
Can I talk to you for a minute in the back?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
What do you want me to shoot here?
Start with the close-ups of Lester and Stacey.
Give me a second, man.
What an artist.
Okay, uh.
Did I do something wrong to you?
No.
Then why are you here?
I'm here for the same reason you're here.
To make the movie.
Okay, just, like, for your own personal information, you're acting really weird right now.
I'm acting weird?
I think you're acting weird right now.
Oh, I'm acting-- How exactly am I acting weird?
You've been trying to keep me from fucking anybody but you since we started this thing.
Maybe I was thinking about your feelings.
Were you thinking of my feelings when you were banging Stacey?
Because that'd be really sad for Stacey.
She told me that you told her that that was okay.
I told her that it was okay to ask you.
Holy shit.
I get it.
I fucking get it.
It was a test.
That whole thing was a fucking test, is that it?
If it was, how do you think you did?
We had a discussion, Miri.
We had-
- Actually, we had many discussions about how it was just sex
- and how we wouldn't let it get weird.
- I'm not acting weird.
You're acting like a jealous girlfriend is what the fuck you're acting like.
- I am not your girlfriend.
- I know that.
You're not my boyfriend, so why are we having this conversation right now?
Because you're about to fuck Lester to spite me, it seems like.
Did you fuck Stacey to spite me?
No.
You fucked her like you fucked every other bitch and never gave a shit how I felt about it.
- Well, that was before.
- Before what?
Look, don't fucking pretend that the other night, you and me, right there, that that didn't mean anything to you, that you didn't feel it too.
Oh.
You're not getting all gooey on me here, are you, Zack?
You know what?
If you were any other bitch I didn't give a rat's ass about,
I would tell you to go fuck yourself right now because I fucking hate this game-playing shit.
But you, you mean more to me than that, so I'm just gonna lay this out on front street.
I know you felt something big, something real the other night when we were together because I felt it too.
We tried to fuck and instead, we wound up making love.
So if this is what you need to hear in order to keep you from fucking Lester, if this is what you need, then fine.
Here it is, I'm gonna say it.
I love you, Miri.
Happy?
Oh, Jesus.
You better get ahold of yourself, Zack, because we just fucked.
Okay.
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?
But you did.
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.
[ WHISPERS ] Wait--
All right, don't forget I'm down here.
Watch that pullout, huh?
STACEY:
Yeah.
Mmm.
This is some damn good coffee.
- Where you going?
- Getting the fuck out of here.
We gotta finish this movie.
[ GASPS ]
Yo!
[ COUGHING AND GROANING ]
You believe this shit?
Do you believe this shit?
What the fuck just happened in there?
I'll tell you what just happened in there.
That chick frosted me like I was a fucking cake.
Zack.
TEEN 1 :
Okay, seriously, get a picture of me right now.
I'm hunting humans.
- Dude, check it out.
Ooh.
- Oh, shit.
Seriously, let's shoot the shit out of this bitch.
- Where you aiming at?
- Cock shots?
Cock shots.
[ BUZZER RINGS ]
[ BUZZER RINGS ]
We shot you in the balls, cunt nugget.
Well, it's my job to get shot in the balls, so-
- Oh, they're gone.
MAN:
Excuse me.
Didn't you used to work at the Bean-N-Gone in Monroeville?
I sure as shit hope this pays better, I tell you.
[ CHATTERING ]
So why don't they just shoot you with a puck?
What do you mean?
I mean, what does paintball got to do with hockey?
Nothing, I guess.
- So ain't no prizes or--?
- No, no.
So, what are they paying $5 for?
To shoot a Broad Street Bully in the balls.
White people are fucked up.
Yup, they sure are.
It's a living.
You've been getting the checks I've been sending?
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Probably didn't save you from a brutal tongue-lashing, though, huh?
You know, the wife never found out about the camera, because I paid off the bills.
How did you manage that?
- Because now I'm Oprah rich.
- No way.
- The post office fucking settled?
- Hundred-sixty large, son.
- Nice, man.
Congratulations.
- A beautiful day, thank you very much.
I thought you made that whole thing up.
No, no.
It was very real.
You can believe it.
Even though she's spending all of it.
Well, since you ain't gonna ask me, I'll just go ahead and tell you.
- No, I have not seen Miri.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.
Oh, I suppose you weren't gonna ask about your movie, neither?
Look, that's why I came down here.
I need you to come take a look at it.
- I'm not interested.
Sorry.
- You'd better get interested
- because you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?
The story doesn't make sense.
- The story?
- The story doesn't make sense.
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?
It's a movie, dog, and a movie's gotta have an ending, which we don't have at the moment.
Come shot, credits.
There's your fucking ending.
Do me this favor, okay?
When you're done getting your nuts blown off, come back to humble Monroeville to my crib for a couple hours, check out the flick, you tell me what's missing.
No.
I'll tell you what, you do that, you don't owe me shit no more.
- Really?
- Really.
- Is your wife home?
- Yes.
- Maybe I should leave the pads on.
- You got some extra ones?
Hey, honey.
Where the fuck you been?
And who in the fuck is this now?
Would you calm down, woman?
Goddamn.
You already left one white boy down in my basement while you off gallivanting and shit.
What if this motherfucker
- was all grabby on me?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
Oh, what in the fuck is that supposed to mean?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
WIFE:
- White boys love me.
White boy.
- I said, white boy.
- Yeah?
You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?
- Should I say yes?
- Just say yes.
Yeah.
- Why don't you, uh, head downstairs?
- Oh, okay.
It's just through this hallway.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
What the fuck you looking at?
Why you gotta be yelling at me in front of my director?
- Oh, he's a director?
- Yeah.
I didn't know that.
Shit, he's a director.
Well, why don't he direct my ass to a new husband?
How about that shit?
- That's the bedroom.
DELANEY:
- Keep talking, maybe he will.
Oh, don't nobody want them saggy-ass balls!
Saggy balls?
Look at these sagging-ass titties you got around here.
- You could tie these together.
- Motherfucker, we match.
Oh, shit.
Where's my paintball gun at?
Look at you, editor and DP.
You got your shit covered, man.
Please, don't ever say "shit-covered" to me again.
Roll the film for the man, please, so we can see what he thinks.
Just jump through it.
I ain't got all night.
The bitch is on me.
"Nigga Rich Productions." Classy.
- Yeah, DreamWorks was taken.
- Was it?
Plus, it sounds like an underground gay fuck club.
"I met a guy at DreamWorks." Yeah.
All right, so we got Lester and Stacey fucking.
Then we got Barry and Bubbles fucking.
And then this boring bullshit.
Okay, just, uh, go to the next scene, would you?
Uh...
- What next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?
We never shot it.
- Why not?
- Because after you left that night,
Miri came out of the backroom and said she couldn't do it.
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped?
So...
- Wait, so Miri--
- Never fucked nobody.
Just you.
Now, I wonder why she did that.
- Hm.
- Hm.
You see, there was a time when I was just a bitter old fuck making coffees, and Stacey was just a lap dancer and Barry and Bubbles didn't know each other and this fool here, hell, I don't even know what he was.
- A white supremacist.
- Man, fuck you.
Then two people come along and showed us something we didn't know existed.
A world of possibilities where plain old people just like us could do something special.
Even if it's something as simple as filming people fucking.
Sometimes we just need someone to show us something we can't see for ourselves
and then we're changed forever.
So as you can see, our movie ain't got no ending.
Every movie needs an ending, don't it?
Peace.
Delaney, you're a slick cupid motherfucker.
Ain't love grand?
WIFE:
Why the fuck is this white boy running through my goddamn house?
[ DOOR SLAMS ]
Sometimes.
Miri.
- Miri.
MIRI:
- Zack?
ZACK:
- Miri.
I'm sorry.
MIRI:
- Get out.
- Close the door.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over--
- Just close the fucking door, Zack.
I never slept with Stacey that night, okay?
I swear to God.
When we got into my room, you know what we did?
We talked about you, and us and how things were different and how I was too much of a fucking pussy to just tell you how I felt about you.
And I know-
- I know that that's only because of all the stupid shit we said about how we wouldn't let sex change us, but it did.
It changed me.
That has to be love, right?
It has to be love and just so you know, I can't go back to being just friends anymore,
- because I just can't.
- Good.
And I think--
I think that you feel the same way.
Because that night after I left, you didn't fuck Lester.
What's up, Zack?
You know what?
I don't care that you're fucking Lester, okay?
How's that?
- Oh, shit.
- I don't wanna be with anyone but you.
So I will wait forever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life because I love you, and I have for as long as I can remember.
And I would rather die than be without you, Miriam Linky.
Miri's last name is Linky?
You're gonna fuck a guy who doesn't know your last name?
Or that you beat up Carl Roth in the sixth grade?
I know that.
Or what your senior prom dress would've looked like had we gone but we decided not to, and we got drunk alone instead.
Or that you washed your hair in the toilet.
We're not fucking, Zack.
Or that you're not fucking Zack-- What?
I asked her to fuck me.
She wouldn't do it.
I even tried to talk her into giving me the fucking Dutch rudder.
Shot me down on that too.
- And a Dutch rudder is?
- Don't know what a Dutch rudder--?
All right, you grab your dick, then you have someone else work your arm.
Here, let me show you.
All right, grab my arm.
I'm grabbing my dick, you're grabbing my arm.
Now work it.
Work my arm.
See that shit?
Work it up and down.
It's like someone else is jerking you off.
Okay.
There's the double Dutch rudder, which, I grab my dick, you grab your dick, you work my arm, I work your arm, same time.
It's like jerking off together but not gay.
We're not touching dicks, each other's dicks anyway.
I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.
It feels good, sir.
Try me, come on.
Sorry to change the subject on you, Lester, but if you're not fucking Miri, why is your dick out right now?
Because I live here now, and I like to be naked.
- What?
- When you moved out, she couldn't afford to pay her rent by herself, so I moved in to help.
But you just came out of her room.
That's my room now.
She moved in your old room.
Wait, wait, wait.
She changed rooms?
Yeah, she said she did it because she missed the smell of you or some shit.
[ SNIFFS ]
I don't smell anything.
But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.
- Night, Zack.
- Night.
Do you?
Then why are you crying?
Because I missed you so much.
ZACK:
Me too.
I love you.
- I love you, I love you.
ZACK:
- I love you.
I don't mean to alarm you but I think I just jerked off Lester a little bit.
- The Dutch rudder?
- Yeah, it's ingenious, right?
If you ask me nicely, I will Dutch-rudder you the rest of our lives.
Good.
I'm getting tired of fucking the Fleshlight.
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.
- What'd it feel like?
- Like fucking a flashlight.
LESTER:
- Wrong room.
- Oh, God.
That's gross.
Let us fuck.
Hello.
Welcome to Nigga Rich Productions, home of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, the production house for the couple looking to put a little spice in their sex life.
- Shall we take a look around?
- Fuck me so hard.
Oh, God.
First, you'll meet for a consultation with one of our romance-ologists, who'll coach you through that initial awkward stage before you're camera-ready.
So we will start off with some erotic massage and some--
Dude.
Some light petting.
That sounds good.
Are you guys sure you don't wanna do some, uh, butt-sack work too?
- Uh, let's move on, shall we?
- Why?
ANNOUNCER:
From their break-out hit, Swallow My Cockuccino, to the multi-million selling Swallow My Cockuccino II and the award-winning Star Whores saga, including Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter,
Zack and Miri have proven time and again that they know how to shoot hot sex.
As an actor, I've sometimes brought my work home with me inappropriately.
When you're telling your real-life lover in the bedroom, to, you know, bend over while you cake your hand in K-Y, it is a sign that the romance is dead, I think.
Then we turned to the professionals at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
Oh, my God, they totally saved our civil union.
They filmed what was inside of us and not what was coming out of us necessarily.
It helped me see his asshole as not just a come dumpster, but a sign of his beauty, his flower.
It became a, uh, gorgeous orchid.
Orchids grow in sort of the filthiest conditions.
That's what his asshole became to me.
This beautiful flower amidst shit.
- Honey, they get the metaphor.
- I don't think they do.
Let's just say, thank you to Zack and Miri.
It's helped us out, it's helped our friends.
Enrique?
Park?
Park?
Enrique?
Can we get a little love for Zack and Miri?
They don't even know what's going on, they're so pilled up.
But don't take his word for it.
Just ask our co-founders.
- Hi.
I'm Miri Linky Brown.
- I'm Zack Linky Brown.
Here at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, we're dedicated
- to committing your love--
- Or lust.
--to high-end, quality production digital video.
A forever keepsake of your passion.
That's right, Miri.
Why set up a camera at the end of your bed and settle for one unflattering angle, when you could let the professionals dazzle and delight your senses with an array of shots so masterfully rendered you'll swear Martin Scorsese snuck into your room
and caught you fucking?
And remember, we're not just the presidents of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
We're also clients.
ANNOUNCER:
Call now to set up your appointment
LESTER:
Way to fuck, Zack.
You little motherfucker!
Get up' Zack.
Come on, I don't wanna be late for work.
Ahh!
Get out!
- Jesus, fuck!
Close the door if you're gonna take a shit.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over, it was not closed.
- Close the door' Zack!
- Okay, okay.
God.
- Fine.
- What's that thing?
- It's a hand warmer.
We're going now.
- You smell that?
Is that the car?
Fuck.
- Oh, goddamn it.
- What?
What?
- Oh, it's wedged in my taint.
- What is?
- It got wedged in my taint.
- What?
- It's stuck under my balls.
- It's between my balls and my leg.
- What's happening?
- Please, pull over.
Pull the fuck over!
- All right, all right!
Jesus, all right!
It's about to move up to my ass.
What?
The movement makes it hotter.
It's tucked under them.
It's stuck under them.
Oh' fuck.
I think I burned my ball hair off.
It's not funny.
Can you help me pick out an outfit for tonight?
I'm working till 6.
- Well' I can try stuff on at the store.
- The store?
No, how about instead, you get a friend?
But you are my friend.
I mean a girl friend, jeez.
Mr. Delaney, can you work for me tomorrow?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
Then you must come in the next day, I tell you.
- It's Black Friday.
- Black Friday?
It's the biggest mall-shopping day of the year.
And since the mall is just up the street, I would like you to come out and work.
- On Black Friday.
- Oh, yeah.
All right, you want me to work on Moolie Monday too?
- I'm sorry?
- How about Nigga Tuesday?
- Nigga Tuesday?
Is this a new holiday?
- You come to a brother and tell him he gotta work on Black Friday.
You got any idea how racist that sounds?
Telling me to work.
What, you think you own me?
- I never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?
You thought,
"I'm gonna lay down the law for this nigga, I put food on his table, clothes on his nigga baby backs, and he ain't gonna say shit. "
- This ain't Amistad.
- You shut up.
You goddamn right this ain't Amistad.
I can't wait till the post office settles my disability suit because then I'm gonna be out this motherfucker.
I'm gonna be Oprah rich.
Y'all can kiss my ass.
You know what?
Fuck you.
Fuck you, and suck cock.
- To hell with you.
To hell with you.
- Zachary will work.
Zack' my boy.
- Yeah.
- The customer with the harelip-
- Oh, yeah.
- speak me, say you were playing baseball here the other night.
Wiffle ball.
And' uh' no' that wasn't me.
Maybe the harelip makes it sound like "baseball. "
Yeah, maybe you hear with an accent.
- Fuck you, okay?
- Okay.
One day' I'm gonna put a camera over there' and then I can tell-
I'll know everything you do when I'm gone.
Everything.
Scratch your balls, take a shit, everything, I tell you, okay?
Okay.
Fucker.
I hate both of you ebony and ivory motherfuckers, I tell you.
- Why is he so fucking high-strung?
- "Fuck off, I tell you.
Very good. "
Can you believe that Gandhi motherfucker, telling me I gotta work on Black Friday?
Ain't that some shit?
- Yeah.
- Like I don't wanna do shopping.
Biggest sales day of the year.
I'm getting a flat-screen TV, believe that.
That's my fault, I should tell you.
I asked for Friday morning off, I'm sorry.
- For what?
- I actually need a lot of recovery time.
Tonight is me and Miri's ten-year high school reunion.
I'm just gonna get fucking alcohol poisoning.
- Reunion?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
- Isn't that fucked up that they do that?
They say it's the best chance to get everyone together.
People come back in town for the holidays.
But they could have it in the middle of the summer at a blowjob contest that I was judging' and it would still be retarded.
- So why you going, then?
- Miri's making me go.
Why you always bending over backwards for that girI'
- knowing she ain't giving up no ass?
- We got a good thing going.
She pays half the rent, does dishes, she wakes me up in the morning.
Why complicate that with sex?
Besides, man, I've known her since the first grade.
You don't fuck someone you met in the first grade.
Excuse me, I met my wife in kindergarten.
We got married senior year, and she has been the queen of my world ever since.
- What if you could do it all over again?
- I'd jerk off and live by myself.
That woman is the bane of my existence.
- See?
- Excuse me, can I get a coffee, black?
Can't you see we talking, white?
If you're gonna continue to emasculate me with this Barbie dress-up shit'
I'm using your laptop.
Don't forget to smack it when you turn it on, otherwise the screen doesn't come on.
Why don't you spring and get a new one?
Same reason I don't spring for clothes for tonight, I'm broke.
There's a chick who works at Teen Juice at the mall, you know.
I gave her a good deal on yarn,
- so she's letting me borrow this stuff.
- Yo, bro.
What?
- You're buying a vibrator online.
- What's wrong with the one you have?
It died last week.
Look at the size of those fucking panties.
Shoot that shit.
Shoot it.
My God, who even knew Amazon sold shit like this?
This is incredible.
- Those are fucking granny panties.
Okay,
A, I don't appreciate you violating the sanctity of my Amazon Wish List page' and B, I'm not buying that thing from Amazon, because it turns out I don't have a credit card they take.
- Oh, shit.
- I'm sorry, guys.
Am I in the way?
You're a fucking faggot, all right?
Let's go to Starbucks.
- He's a shitty barista anyways.
- Cock.
- And he throws like a bitch.
You know what else I throw?
My nut sack in your coffees, so how did that taste, fucker?
We saw your girlfriend in her underwear, cunt nugget.
well' too bad she's not my girlfriend, you little fuck
- Oh, they're gone.
MIRl:
Are you still talking to me?
Uh, just said, I'm gonna look up more fuck toys on Amazon.
Oh' holy shit.
- They sell the Fleshlight here too.
- What's that?
It's a fucking pocket pussy that is shaped like a flashlight
"for discretionary jacking off. "
That way if you get caught, no one thinks it's weird.
You're just a guy who likes to fuck his flashlight.
I am totally buying this shit.
Whoa, if you've got money to burn, how about paying the electric bill?
- That's due already?
- November's is probably due now, but I was talking about September's.
Tell me this doesn't rock.
You kind of look like Ronald McDonald.
That makes me want some McNuggets.
Why would you wanna buy a pocket pussy anyway?
That is so sad.
What?
Excuse me, I forgot about the nobility that accompanies coming with a fucking vibrator.
Think a kid in Darfur gets saved every time a vibrator makes you come?
No.
- "Real feel action"?
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
If you start fucking machines, I'm moving out.
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a machine.
How come you get to fuck something with a motor in it?
I've never met a man who can make me come like a vibrator does.
That's bullshit.
You get to be Buck Rogers having sex in the 25th century with fucking Twiki and Dr. Theopolis.
I'm stuck to a bottle of Jergens in the bathroom.
Holy bejesus.
You do not use my Jergens to jack it in our bathroom.
No, you know what I do actually, is I light a bunch of candles and I sprawl out on my sheets and I listen to Sting.
No, I'm a guy.
Give me two Popsicle sticks and a rubber band,
I'll find a way to fuck it, like a filthy MacGyver.
Oh' my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.
How about this?
I don't get why you're putting so much effert into this thing.
I thought we were just gonna go to sit around and make fun of everybody.
I can't wear anything that I already own and expect to bring home Bobby Long.
Bobby fucking Long?
No way.
Didn't that guy call you "Stinky Linky"?
Yeah, that was then, okay?
Maybe now he can save me a fortune in Amazon bills.
Maybe you can fuck our landlord so we can at least keep a roof over our heads.
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.
Hey, I bought skates with last week's paycheck
- and I need those to skate with.
- Oh.
And this week's will barely cover the past two water bills, so...
Is this sexy?
Yeah, in like a To Catch a Predator kind of way' it is pretty fucking sexy.
Then we're done.
What the fuck?
Zack.
- You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?
- They shut it off.
- Oh, shit.
Just, uh-
Help me get this shit out of my hair.
Just use the water out of the toilet.
- There's poo in there.
- Not that part.
- The back part of the toilet thing.
- Oh, that makes sense.
Take the cup there and then scoop it in, there you go.
Here, I'll lean back and you can just' you know, pour it down like
- Like that.
You're harshing my buzz' you know.
This is so lame.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Whoa!
All right, one hour tops, then we're gone.
Or I had an idea.
We could just not go at all, which would rock.
Even though we're broke and we've never amounted to anything, we're still better than these people, right?
No.
Not at all.
We're probably not even as good as most of them, unless one of them is a crackhead or something.
Just tell me I'm prettier than when we graduated.
You look about the same.
Definitely not prettier, but around the same.
I'm thinner, though' right?
A little?
Not really.
well' good pep talk.
Fuck.
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.
- You don't recognize us' do you?
- Um, no, sorry.
Zack Brown, Miri Linky.
Were you the one they called Stinky Linky?
Oh' no' no one ever called me that.
Oh.
- Great.
What does yours say?
- What the fuck?
Come on.
- I'm sure I had a nickname.
Nothing?
- All right, you have a great time' and before you go, don't forget your copy of The Roving Roe-Ver.
What the fuck's this shit?
That is not shit, that would be our bi-monthly newsletter.
- Awesome.
It updates you
- on what everyone's doing.
- Finally.
I love your enthusiasm.
Here you go.
Write your e-mail address on that and I'll be sure to add you to our 800-member-strong mailing list.
We had 800 people in our graduating class?
Yes, and only 250 R.S.V.P.'d.
Doesn't that suck, Mary?
- Miri.
- You married, Bets?
- I am.
Two kids.
- Wow, that's beautiful.
- Awesome.
- You wanna fuck me later?
- Uh, no, I'm married.
- Okay, cool.
If you change your mind,
- I'll be in there getting shitfaced.
- He will.
- Just so you know, I eat the pussy.
- He does.
Ah, tempting.
Again, no.
- Shall we?
- Sir.
Bye, Bets.
Think about it.
Enjoy.
Can I get two beers' please?
You want a beer?
- Yeah.
- Three beers.
- Thank you.
Here you go.
Is that Zack?
Or am I Zack?
Whoa, ho, ho.
MIRl:
Oh' wow.
- Never gets old, huh?
- The other Zack.
Oh' in my world, nobody calls me "the other Zack,"
now that this guy's not around anymore, huh?
- Get the fuck off of me.
- There can be only one.
- What?
- Highlander, man?
The Kurgan.
Remember?
I'd yell it at you whenever we passed each other in the hallway?
Like it was yesterday' man.
Awesome.
Awesome.
Awesome.
God, you guys have so much to catch up on.
Whoo.
- No.
- I'm gonna let you get to it.
Bitch.
Have you seen that big blowup picture they have of me?
Yeah, it's-
My hair is terrible.
I can't believe I even wore my hair like that.
That's before I knew about styling products' you know.
It makes a big difference in life.
But you live and learn, though' right?
I mean, ten years ago, Pittsburgh, who knew anything about fashion?
Back in the day' our hairstyle, oh...
Hey, stranger.
- Whoa.
Stinky Linky.
- Yeah.
Although it's just Miri now.
- Give me a hug.
- Oh, okay.
- Hi, heh, heh, heh.
- Hi.
Wow.
- How have you been?
- Great, great.
- Yeah?
- You look fantastic.
Wow, that is not something that you would have said to me ten years ago.
- Well' I've grown up.
- Yes.
Yes, you have.
You just look...
Ooh, heh, heh.
- Well' listen to you.
Thank you.
- No, don't thank me, just fuck me.
Roxanne.
Hey.
Someone I like, what are the odds' huh?
Zack Brown, we had four years of Spanish together.
Why does no one recognize me?
- Am I thinner?
Is that it?
- Look at him.
- Who?
- My stupid husband.
No fucking shit.
John Butterfield?
You actually married John Butterfield?
- That's amazing.
- Don't ever get married.
It sucks.
You stop appreciating each other and run out of shit to talk about after the first year.
But look at him now, chatty as fuck.
Flirting up a storm with that cheerleader nimrod Monica Von.
You want me to maybe flirt with you so he can see it, even it up a bit?
I don't wanna get even.
If I was gonna do anything, I'd wanna one-up the asshole.
You can give me a handjob in the girls' locker room.
- Fine, but make it fast.
- Fuck, yeah.
Are you staying in town for a while or-?
Just tonight.
I fly back to L.A. tomorrow.
L.A., wow, Los Angeles.
Gosh' Bobby Long' coming up in the world.
- With Mrs. Long, I bet, huh?
- No, no, no.
No Mrs. Long for me.
- Then can I be honest with you?
- Sure.
Um...
Whew.
I think I need a drink.
Do you need a drink?
Because I need a drink to say this.
- I've got a beer already, so-
- Oh, great, thank you.
I think there's a cigarette butt in there.
Yup.
Sorry about the elbow.
There can be only one.
Can I get a beer, please?
Thank you very much.
Oh' Jesus Christ.
My friend's making an ass of herself hitting on her high school crush.
Oh' God' that's so sad.
It's so Miri, is what it is.
I'm Zack, by the way.
Brandon.
Don't worry, we weren't in the same class or anything.
- Okay.
Lucky you.
- Are you a Monroe-ver?
well' I went here' let's just leave it at that, I guess.
Do you have one of the large blown-up pictures of your younger self
- hanging around here?
- I do, kind of.
Right there.
Gorgeous.
- Good times.
What do you do?
What brings you here?
I came with somebody who went to school here.
- Really?
- Bobby Long.
No shit.
That's who my friend's hitting on right now.
See right there?
- Really.
- One dressed like Hannah Montana?
In L.A., we call that look "Nickelodeon chic. "
- Wait, L.A.?
Los Angeles?
- California.
That's awesome, man.
What do you do out there?
- I'm an actor.
- Wow, that's really impressive.
- Thank you, thank you.
- In fucking movies?
"Fucking movies. " Pretty much.
Look at you.
What-?
Anything I've seen?
What movies?
Oh' all sorts of movies with all-male casts.
All-male casts.
Like Glengarry Glen Ross?
Like that?
Like Glen and Gary Suck Ross' Meaty Cock and Drop Their Hairy Nuts in His Eager Mouth.
- Is that like a sequel?
- Sort of.
- It's a re-imagining.
- Oh, like The Wiz.
More erotic and with less women.
No women' to be exact.
I apologize in advance if I am out of line here, but are you in gay porn?
- Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?
- I thought you recognized me, that's-
- Oh, okay, I get it.
You're not in my demographic' so I'm not insulted.
- Not really.
Who's your demographic?
- Do you love pussy?
- I do.
- Then not you.
Oh' okay.
I came here tonight hoping to seduce you and bring you back to my apartment and sleep with you to, uh, get back at you, you know, for calling me Stinky Linky all those years ago.
Wow.
That is a weird revenge plot.
- You must be a terrible lay for that.
- What?
No, I'm great.
I mean, I've had enough practice and everything.
That-
Wow, that sounded not good.
I fuck a lot.
That's what I meant to say.
That doesn't sound good either.
Wow.
You're a lot funnier than I remember.
Thank you.
Gosh, you turned out to be such a nice guy.
It just
- You know' it makes it even easier to just
- To just say this.
Would you like to come back to my place and maybe open a bottle of wine and have ourselves a real high school reunion?
- I-
- Hello, Miriam.
Beat it, we're talking.
- I wanted to introduce you to Brandon.
- Salutations.
- Bobby's boyfriend.
- Bobby who?
- Bobby me.
- Bobby Long.
Brandon is the star of such adult fare as
- What was that one called again?
You Better Shut Your Mouth or I'm Gonna Fuck It.
That's right.
I'm surprised I forgot that.
Are you fucking with me?
No, they're fucking with each other.
Oh' my God.
- No.
- What?
Granny Panties?
- Excuse me?
- How can you tell?
This is so crazy.
I was literally just watching you, like, right before we got here.
This is so crazy.
This is you, right?
TEEN 1 My name's Granny Panties, and nobody wants to fuck me.
Nothing's whiter than my big gay ass-
Where'd you get that?
Oh' I entered "gay" and "ass," and it was the top hit.
It's had 200,000 views in three hours.
Honey' you are, like-
I'm jealous right now because you're, like, super famous.
Baby, please take our picture.
I get a picture with Granny Panties.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is awesome.
- All right, smile.
Okay' got it.
- Did you get it?
- Oh, thank you very much.
- E-mail me that.
Oh' because he's the worst photographer.
Okay' good.
- You're gay?
- Yeah.
And I'm on the Internet wearing a diaper?
Who knew you'd come to Pittsburgh and meet a celebrity?
I'm gonna binge-drink now until I pass out.
Okay.
She'll be fine.
So you guys suck each other's cocks, huh?
Oh' like crazy.
Okay, that's enough, I think.
I'm embarrassing him.
I love when he's embarrassed.
He's not living out loud, so he gets all like, ooh.
- You are totally in love, aren't you?
- Zachary' we are.
Wow, I-
Oh' God' I just wanna eat him up, yum, yum.
Save some for me' yum, yum, yum.
- I can't keep my hands off him.
- You've had one too many.
Although he does most of the eating in the sack.
In the sack and of the sack.
All right, that's enough.
Look, you've drunk too much.
You do this every time.
You get too Mary for everybody in the room
- and you can't contain yourself.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
And by containing myself, do you mean containing myself in a closet?
In a closet of denial?
Is that-?
No, no, no.
Holy shit, this just got real.
This is exactly why you haven't met my mother.
You don't know how to ease people into this situation.
- You just force your way in every time.
- I thought, maybe for one second in this godforsaken town, I could be myself.
I'm so sorry.
No, you're right' I should just butch up and pretend that I don't love it when you shove your dick in my mouth.
- This is the best night of my life.
Am I making a spectacle?
- I could make a much bigger scene.
- You really are.
I'm sorry.
Pittsburgh.
Listen up' Monroe-vers.
My name is Brandon St. Randy' and I love Bobby Long.
- Fucking A. Is that enough?
Is that enough of a scene?
I could start doing worse than that.
The reason you haven't taken me to your mother's-
Your mother with her makeup and all her drinking, she's in the closet too.
- They fight just like real people.
- I thought I'd be a conduit for you-
Thank you.
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm not.
- Thank you.
- I love you.
- I'll e-mail you.
- Zack, it was so nice to meet you.
And I will be patient with you.
I will be there on your journey.
I will be your Sherpa up the mountain of gayness.
well' might as well see how many hits Granny Panties is up to, huh?
Did I do that?
Thanks, George.
What kind of evil fucks turn off your power the day-?
No, the night before Thanksgiving?
Who does that?
Can you get an advance on your card?
Fleshlight maxed-out my $200 limit.
Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.
This is bad.
If we don't come up with rent, we're gonna get locked out.
Who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.
Which means by the time we get home, there's no heat either.
well' I think it's time we put what we always talked about into effect.
- You're gonna have to start hooking.
- You know, you jest, but these are the exact circumstances people find themselves in right before they start having sex for money.
- Yeah.
- Or making porn.
Oh, my God, yeah.
- What?
You got an idea?
We could make a porno.
- Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?
No, that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me?
That's a rad idea.
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend, he said he makes a hundred grand a year because he shoots and distributes his own porno flicks.
If it's so easy, how come everybody doesn't do it?
Because other people have options and dignity, which we do not have, which puts us in an amazingly advantageous position.
Fuck you, I have dignity.
Where?
Is it hidden in your gigantic underpants that are plastered all over the Internet?
Is that where you hide your dignity?
Every woman has a pair of those period panties.
That's, like, a fact.
Okay.
Families.
I bet people don't make porno, because they have families.
But luckily, your parents are dead.
Sorry.
My grandparents are dead.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
So who are we gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone mainstream now.
It's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks in it.
Look at Paris Hilton.
She throat-fucks a guy in night vision, now she's selling fragrances to tweens.
And I'm pretty sure she's legally retarded.
That's for tweens?
Have you seen that Joe Francis guy who made Girls Gone Wild?
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot piece of shit in the world and he has a jet and a fucking island.
Look, there's got to be a less extreme solution to our financial woes here.
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper route.
- I don't have a bike.
- Be a waiter.
No one wants me around their food.
Would you eat food that I gave you?
I would not eat food that you gave me, that's true.
I mean, nobody wants to see us fuck, Zack.
Everybody wants to see anybody fuck.
I hate Rosie O'Donnell, but if someone said' "I got a tape of Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid,"
I'd be like, "Why aren't we watching that right now?"
Because she's famous.
Hello.
So are you.
You're fucking Granny Panties.
My underwear and your ass are famous' we're not.
So who the F would wanna watch us fuck?
- At least 800 people.
- The jerks we went to school with?
- Are you serious?
- Of course.
If you heard that someone we graduated with was in a fucking porno movie, you'd watch it, right?
I'd watch that guy Brandon suck a cock, I just met him.
With this mailing list, we have almost a thousand people that would definitely buy a porno we were in just to be like,
"Hey, I sat next to that guy in Civics.
Look at his fucking dick. "
We sell a thousand copies at 20 bucks a pop, bam' we have paid off our bills.
So' what do you think?
- I don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.
Oh' wow, like you've never done that before.
How many guys have you met in a bar, taken home, banged with your mouth and then never talked to again?
That's what we call a stranger.
Dude, I don't one-night mouth-fuck anybody that I pick up in bars.
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in the porno movie for some weird reason.
I guess...
We could fuck.
- Ew.
- Fuck you.
I mean, you're a nice-enough-looking guy and everything-
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're an all-right-enough-looking girl.
- How does that feel?
- Dude' I'm just saying it'd be weird and wrong, you know, like fucking my brother.
Okay, seriously, we're just talking about sex, okay?
It's for a purpose.
It's for getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.
- Wow.
- Just explain to your private beforehand,
"Look' this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash. "
- Oh, my God.
- What?
You're just doing this because you've always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?
Yes.
I've gone my whole life pretending that I want nothing to do with you, just hoping one day we'd be in such dire financial straits that I could use it to finally make my move on you.
You're just being sarcastic.
- I am.
See' I was pretending to cry right there.
MIRl:
I guess it's not like it'd be creepy, like if we got way too drunk one night and accidentally fucked, you know?
No.
We'd be going in with the understanding that it's-
A business decision.
Strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.
- Right.
- And by end,
I mean, I'll be waxing your ass.
Fuck you.
I'm not even letting you see my ass.
I've seen your ass and the rest of you naked around a billion times already.
- That goes both ways, buddy.
- You've never seen my dick.
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.
Are you kidding?
That party we went to where you got blasted, and Houls dared you to give yourself head, and we all watched you try for, like, an hour.
Oh' yeah.
Thanks by the way, for fucking letting me do that.
Thank you.
Oh' God.
We really do know too much about each other.
See' and this would really just be one more thing.
I mean, look at us.
It's Thanksgiving and we're huddled around a flaming fucking garbage can like a couple of steno bums.
I mean, this could give us a chance to pay off our debt, pay our bills, get a fucking nicer apartment with heat in it maybe.
What are you doing?
Miriam Linky, will you have sex with me on camera for money?
I will.
A producer?
Yeah.
- Guy who gets to finance the movie.
- You think I got that kind of money?
We just need that.
What you're about to spend on the flat screen.
Now I can't get my flat screen?
Fuck that.
No, no, no.
With your cut of the profits, you're gonna get two flat screens.
One in your living room, one in your bathroom.
One in the bathroom?
You know, it's always been my dream to watch shit while I shit.
Everyone with an ass loves to watch shit while they shit.
- I'm gonna make that happen for you.
- I don't know, man.
What else the producer do?
- Um, they help with the casting.
- What's casting?
Finding the people to be in the movie.
- I get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.
Like, I can look at a titty, make sure there ain't no moles on there?
- You can look at both titties, man.
- Man.
I've been looking at the same busted titties for the past almost 20 years.
- I'm due for another new titty.
- Please help us.
Please.
Please.
Yes.
Yes.
I love you.
well' don't mind that smell.
We had some homeless people squatting in here.
You know, they'd void their bowels everywhere but the bathroom.
Anyway, you pick up the poop and you've got yourself a movie studio.
Why don't we shoot in your apartment?
No power.
You wanna pay our electric bill?
- You motherfuckers...
- We'll take it.
Bring it back.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Oh' Jesus.
Oh' Jesus.
Oh' God.
Come on.
Why the fuck do I have to do everything?
Fuckers.
Hey, what is that?
Fucking guys.
This fucking team, man.
They fucking suck.
I'm gonna hatefuck the shit out of you, ref.
- Dude.
- It's cool.
- He's my cousin.
- Hey.
Didn't you used to videotape the varsity basketball games in high school?
Just the away games.
I did it because I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.
Which one?
Whichever one wanted to fuck the guy who taped the varsity games.
- Aw.
- Still know how to work a camera?
- Who cares what the title is?
- The porn I liked when I was a kid, it was always, like, a spoof of a popular movie, you know?
Like, um, Edward Penishands.
Okay, so we need a mildly clever, vaguely dirty title, that sounds like a real movie
- and sums up what you're gonna see.
- Correct.
An American Werewolf in Brenda?
Fuckback Mountain?
- Too soon?
A Cock-in-Lips Now?
Next.
Cradle the balls.
Work the shaft.
Jerk my come-crayon and let me color you white.
I need cock and I need it now.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
It's "puss" as in pussy.
Oh' because I was like' who would wanna fuck puss?
I want to slam my ham in your can, woman.
Scene.
- This guy is amazing.
- This guy's great-looking too.
I wanna fuck him.
Hi, my name's Delaney and I'm a producer.
I really don't know what it means.
I'm gonna be honest' this is my first time.
You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna touch you or nothing like that.
- All right.
- I have a wife, you know.
We're happy.
I mean, not happy' but it's cool, you know.
Just so you know, there will be some fucking.
- We'll talk about that if you get the part.
- Okay.
I mean, not
- We won't be fucking, there'll be fucking in the movie.
Like I said' I got a wife.
She don't play that shit.
- She is a crazy bitch.
- Yep.
It's my job as the producer to see what you got.
So if that makes you uncomfortable in any way, you don't have to show me anything you don't wanna show me, because-
I love the movies.
- Lawrence of a Labia.
- No.
- Oh, come on.
- Dawn of the Dick.
Yeah, but how are zombies doing it at all sexy?
I want to eat your brain and your ass.
- Dude.
- Sci-fi.
Yeah.
Close Encounters With a Turd From Behind.
- I don't know what that means.
- Just asses.
Fucking deep in asses.
What?
We're making a porno and we just need to know what you would be or would not be interested in doing.
If anything.
- No anal.
- Oh, definitely no anal.
Anal and hugging.
I don't do ass stuff.
- Anal.
- Ah, fuck.
- Oh, wait, oral.
I like anal.
- Yay.
Okay, well, so, uh, do you have any special skills?
Special skills?
I can get a boner really quick and it sticks straight up.
- Is that really a special skill?
- I think.
- Can you show us what you mean?
- Sure.
Oh' that is special.
Yeah, you're hired, Mr. -
- Who are you again?
- Lester.
Lester "The Molester" Cockinshtuff.
- No.
- Wow.
That is the best porn name I've ever heard' man.
I can have a porn name?
- Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.
Are you Granny Panties?
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The panties are actually in the house.
- I'll get them.
- Whoa.
- Star Sex 2:
The Wrath of Cunt.
We never made a Star Sex 1.
I guess we can lose Star Sex 3:
The Search for Cock, then.
- Cocunt.
- What's that?
It's Cocoon with a cunt.
So Delaney tells us you have a special talent of some sort.
I don't know if I'd call it a special talent, but it's a little something I picked up doing bachelor parties.
It would probably be easier if I just showed you.
- Great.
- The floor is yours.
So a movie, huh?
That could be fun.
Holy fuck.
Her name's Bubbles.
- Invasion of the Potty-Snatchers?
- That's like MAD Magazine stupid.
well' fuck you' okay?
You try to think of a good sci-fi porno title.
It's hard.
There's gotta be one we haven't thought of that would say it all' not be ridiculously filthy and off-putting, and still have instant recognition with our audience.
- I got it.
- I got it.
- Star Whores.
- Yeah.
It's funny' right?
See' we figured this opens us up to an even bigger sales market beyond the people we went to school with.
People who like comics and sci-fi.
Comics?
Like "Ziggy"?
"Ziggy"?
Is that even in fucking papers anymore?
No, man.
Fuck you. "Ziggy" is a comic' right next to "Family Circus. "
No, like Spider-Man and shit, you know?
There's always a shitload of Star Wars nerds at those comic-book shows.
So we sell them a Princess Leia they can really fucking jerk off to.
- That'd be me, Princess Lay-Her.
- Who am I playing?
You' my friend, are the lead role of Lubed Guy-Baller.
Man' he's gonna be balling dudes?
I thought you said this was boys on girls.
If I have to fuck a guy' okay, but I'd rather fuck a girl.
What's wrong with you, boy?
- We'll change the name to Sky-Baller.
- Sky-Baller.
I will be Hung So-low.
Delaney, my friend, you are On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
Man' I can't be in no porno.
My wife will kill me.
Hump me, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
You're my only hump.
On the other hand, fuck my wife.
Unfortunately, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over does not have any sex in the movie but the droids do, I
- CUP and R2-T-Bag.
I robot.
And Stacey over here is gonna play Darth Vibrator.
- I'm the bad guy?
- She's not a guy, Zack.
I know that because I'm not a fucking idiot.
In our movie, Darth Vibrator is a bad girl who wants to fuck the galaxy, literally' and it's up to Lubed and Hung to stop her with their cocks.
- You and me get to have sex, then?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- I know.
Isn't that awesome?
Hold up, hold up.
So who's all having sex with who in this movie?
As of last night, I was having sex with Zack.
What?
Han Solo ain't never had no sex with Princess Leia in the Star Wars.
Guys' this isn't a literal adaptation here.
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.
Kind of like The Wiz or like a parody.
With lots of anal.
- Cool.
- I know, isn't that awesome?
I have a question, do Princess Lay-Her and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?
Uh, no, because they're brother and sister, and according to Miri' brothers and sisters can't fuck.
But you said, that this wasn't a literal translation, so that means Lester's character could have sex with Miri's character.
Because I would love to fucking eat her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.
Dream on, pal, it's never gonna happen, okay?
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See' she's fine
- Wait, what?
Yep.
I mean, everyone else is having sex with more than one person in this movie all of a sudden, so I think it's' you know' not fair if I'm only fucking you.
Guys, read amongst yourselves, okay?
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Look, Miri, we got plenty of sex going on in this thing, you don't have to do that.
Zack, it's fine.
I mean I have slept with way worse-looking guys than Lester.
I just wanna do my part for the movie like everyone else.
You're having sex in the movie, you don't need to fuck someone else.
- You're good.
- I'm only fucking you' though.
So don't we need to vary it up to keep it fair?
Fair for-?
I don't
- What?
Fair for who?
What are these, blood diamonds we're talking about?
Fair for everyone else who is fucking more than one person, a. k.a. you' in the movie.
- I mean, fine-
- All right.
I mean, if you don't care-
I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
Fuck.
I don't give a shit.
Like you said, you know, you've fucked bigger idiots than Lester.
Holy shit.
Are we really gonna shoot this in outer space?
Maybe not bigger idiots.
Thank you.
- Cut.
All right, guys, that's it.
- Yeah.
Make sure you leave your costume so we know they're here for tomorrow.
Mostly, everybody, thank you so much for helping us get ready' you know.
Cleaning this place out, building the sets, sewing the costumes, it's just-
I mean, it's really amazing.
Thank you.
Seriously, thanks.
But this is just the beginning, guys.
If Star Whores works, and it wilI' we are set up for sequels galore.
The Empire Strikes Ass.
- Return of the Brown-Eye.
- The Phantom Man-Ass.
And Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter.
- Okay.
- Revenge of the Shit.
- You got it?
- Yeah, no, we got it.
Ew.
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.
- We'll talk about that one.
We're gonna have a lot of fun' but more importantly, we're gonna make a lot of fucking money' okay?
- Yeah.
- So get ready for greatness, people.
Tomorrow we start principal photography.
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
- All right, good night, you guys.
- We got a movie.
- What?
- Nothing.
I think someone should acknowledge how insane and amazing this is
- and it's all because of you.
- I don't know.
It's just a porno.
You know what I mean.
You've really come into your own.
Shut the fuck up.
So speaking of coming into things' ready for tomorrow?
Twenty years' we're finally gonna know what it's like to have sex with each other.
You say that like you've been wondering what it'd be like to sleep with me for a while now.
Why the fuck do you think I started hanging out with you?
I knew it.
Here, help.
Let's just promise that it's not gonna change anything between us, okay?
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Some guys can't keep sex in perspective.
If anyone's gotta keep this in perspective, it's you, okay?
I don't want you getting all mushy and gooey on me after I give you the best orgasm you've ever had.
Oh' like you know what you're doing down there at all.
I actually don't.
Where's the clitoris?
Is it in your ass?
Just, you know, make sure you kind of whoop it up and act like I'm a stud who knows what he's doing' okay?
Just be a pal.
Oh' dude, I am gonna Meryl Streep the fuck out of this tomorrow, you watch.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
No.
Really, thank you.
For everything.
You're welcome.
Less than 12 hours and we make Monroeville history.
- I really hope nothing goes wrong.
- It's a movie.
What could go wrong?
What are you doing?
What's up?
- What the fuck?
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait.
- Wait.
- Stop.
Stop.
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck is going on?
Condos is what's going on, as soon as this shit-hole's demo'd.
No, you gotta stop it right now.
We rented this place for a month from Mr. Jenkins.
Sounds like your Mr. Jenkins was full of shit.
Luxury Homesteads bought this place a month ago.
I'm gonna kill that lying old fuck.
You're gonna have to go Florida, that's where he moved.
We've got thousands of dollars of equipment in there.
- Please.
- If you wanna sift through this rubble when we're done, be my guest.
Hey, get that fucking beam down.
MIRl:
This is the last thing you wanna hear.
If you don't get an advance,
I don't think we're gonna keep a roof over our heads.
I got an advance already.
It went into all the costumes.
- So all our money's gone?
- All your money?
Never mind what my wife's gonna do when there ain't no new snow tires, or when she sees I charged a video camera.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this' man.
I just wanted to see some free titties.
That's all.
But there's no such thing as free titties' is there, Zack?
- Is there?
- Fuck this noise.
Why don't we get another camera, and shoot something else?
Where are we gonna do that?
Got another sound stage?
Sound stage?
We had a shit-covered garage we turned into a sound stage.
We find someplace new and we do it again.
How?
Okay, I'm broke, man.
No, make that' I was broke.
Now I am really tapped out.
I have to get another job to pay Delaney back.
So please tell me, how can I afford to start over?
- What can I get you?
- Yeah, can I get a, uh-?
Too fucking late.
Cappuccino, 3.50.
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
I mean, I'm a total loser in every single other aspect of my life.
What made me think I could do something as simple as filming people fucking?
We have no money left, nowhere to shoot, no sets, we have no fucking cameras.
Here.
It's time I go back to my regular life where I am a quiet fuckup who doesn't cost anybody any money and knows his goddamn position behind this fucking counter making cappuccinos for this fucking guy.
Oh' yeah.
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
Oh' yeah.
Yeah.
Fuck, yes.
Zack.
You sneaky Indian motherfucker.
I tell you, yes.
Swallow My Cockuccino.
- What?
- That's it.
That's the movie.
Why didn't I think of it before?
We don't need sets or a stage.
Look at all this production value, waiting to have balls on it.
Hold up.
You wanna shoot a dirty movie here, where we work?
Yes.
Fuck, yes, I do.
You know how many stories I have from working here?
How many times I've been laid right there after hours?
You've never gotten laid here after hours.
I know.
Thank you for reminding me.
But I always wish I had, and that's what porno is.
It's fantasy.
It's taking the normal and making it abnormal by fucking it.
Don't do that.
The little dog don't like that.
How did you get a camera?
By being a terrible, untrustworthy employee, that's how.
Give me today, I'll bang out a script.
Meet me back here after closing.
We're gonna launch arching ropes of jism all over this motherfucker.
Peace.
I like that guy but if he tries to fuck that little dog tonight for real,
I'm calling the Humane Society.
It's called Bean-N-Gone, so get the fuck out of here.
Hey, Barry.
Stand by, Stace' picture's up.
- Okay.
Roll tape.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 12, Take 1.
And action.
I'd like a double espresso so I can stay up all night because I'm in the mood to fuck.
well' I am a whore-ista, so I love to fuck.
Would you like to fuck me?
Holy fuck.
You mean, after you're done with your shift?
I mean during my shift.
- Sorry.
- Keep going, keep going.
With your shaft.
Let us fuck.
Cue music.
Okay, open up to camera, guys.
Let us see it.
More tongue.
Little less tongue.
Oh' that was good.
Cue effects.
Oh' yeah, like that.
Oh' yeah.
See' I told you it would work.
Didn't I tell you?
It looks amazing.
It's incredible.
Oh' the beans hurt.
Easy.
- Move in for coverage.
- Nice.
That's why we got him.
- Nice.
I'm impressed.
- Get in there, Deacon.
- Come on.
- Like that?
Like that.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
- Pull out a bit, actually.
That's hot.
No, not you, Lester.
Put it back in.
Kiss the muscle.
- I kiss the muscle.
- You kiss the muscle.
- Can he slap her ass a little?
- Don't be a fucking pervert, dude.
- Stir, come on.
Stir.
- Yeah, stir it.
Stir it, baby.
Hey.
- Holy.
- Shit.
Are you guys still open?
No.
We close at 9.
I need coffee so I'm drive home.
- Okay.
Yeah.
Thank you.
That's a cute kitty.
Okay.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You guys see the game?
I was at it.
Fucking Roethlisberger, the quarterback, was all fucking'
"Hug it' chug it, football.
All night. " Heh-heh.
Okay, paI' here you go.
On the house.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Have a good one.
- Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- I said, have a good one.
Oh.
- Okay.
Keep moving.
You and your little dog.
Go Steelers.
Action.
Oh' yeah.
Yeah, yeah, like that.
Oh' fuck it' chuck it' football.
Oh' yeah.
Oh' God' this is good.
You take it.
You take it.
Take it, Barry.
Oh, take it.
Take it, Barry.
Take it.
I'm disturbed at how turned on I am by this.
- Shit, dude' it's almost 6.
- Oh, fuck.
Okay, that's a wrap, everybody, yeah.
Let's give a hand to our hotties with the bodies from last night.
Stacey, Lester, Bubbles, Barry' whoo.
Yeah.
Nice.
Okay, when we come back tonight, we finish up the venti-vulva scene' and then we get into me and Miri's stuff.
Again' amazing first night, everybody.
Thank you so much.
Let us fuck.
- Hey' how'd it look?
- How do you think it looked?
It looked like shit going into other shit, in focus.
What an artist.
That was Kurosawa's motto. "Shit going into other shit. "
Oh' man, I can't believe you gotta work now.
It's okay.
You know, honestly, I don't think I could sleep.
- I'm pretty, like, pumped up right now.
- Right?
It was amazing.
It was awesome.
I think the cast and crew had a good time.
- We were getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.
I just wanna keep shooting people boning all day.
I don't think I've ever met the ambitious Zack Brown before.
- Well' I'm trying to pay the bills, so...
- It's not a bad thing.
I think it looks good on you.
Come on, hurry.
Come on, come on' come on.
Wait a minute.
- You guys never did it before?
It's fine.
You know, we talked about it and it's just for the movie.
We're friends' you know' we're just friends.
And we will always just be just friends, so...
Listen' I have some extra lube from last night.
I understand it's kind of hard getting wet when everyone's watching.
At least it was for Barry.
- I don't know if I am gonna need it.
- Really?
Yeah, I think I'm just excited.
Uh-huh.
At the idea of people watching' not because of Zack.
Oh' God.
Zack could never have that effect on me in a million years.
- Hello, Miriam.
- Oh, hey.
Wow.
- Your face.
- Yeah.
Weird, huh?
I don't think I've seen your face since senior year.
I think I made a mistake.
I did it for you so you wouldn't get road rash during our scene, but I should have asked first' I look like a fucking beluga whale.
I think I'll be going now.
Okay.
All I keep thinking is we should've done a trial run at home last week or something.
- Oh, my God.
Right?
- I know.
- You're still cool to do it, though, right?
- Yeah, um.
Totally.
Are you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I'm, uh...
- Honestly, I'm a little nervous, I guess.
- You are?
- It's kind of a big deal.
- It is?
Yeah, you know, it's our first time together since our auspicious debut on viral video.
Oh' yeah.
That's a fuckload of pressure for a director.
As a director, please.
What about the anxiety I'm feeling as an actress?
- Did I pick the right project?
- Yeah.
What about this follow-up?
Julia Roberts followed Pretty Waman with Sleeping With the Enemy.
I'm following Granny Panties with Swallow My Cockuccino.
Only difference is this movie's about cock-sucking and her movie just sucked cock, period.
- The only difference, yeah.
- The end was pretty rad.
I liked that.
- When she kills him.
- With a gun.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- She calls the cops first.
- She calls it in first.
- It was so awesome.
- Awesome, yeah.
So I guess we should do this.
I think we should probably wait just until I lose another 20 or 30 pounds.
Stop it.
You look good.
Thanks.
So, what about me?
How do I look?
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful, so I guess it's not a big deal, but you look amazing.
- Okay.
Let's go make a porno.
- Okay.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 8, Take 1.
Come here.
- I'm over-?
All right, settle.
Action.
Who could it be?
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm a delivery man and I have some cream for you.
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.
I work out.
So do you want me to give you your cream now?
I've been waiting for it all day.
- Fuck.
Come on.
- Oops.
Keep going.
I spilled my cream.
Do you mind?
I don't mind.
Especially if you spill it on my face.
Let us fuck.
- Fix my shirt.
Think I should?
- Okay.
Let me see them titties.
Actually, you know what?
Sorry, I don't think we should show them.
- What?
- We shouldn't show your breasts.
- Aren't you gonna take your shirt off?
- I'm just gonna open it.
You're not gonna take it off?
Why not?
My tits are bigger than yours.
I don't wanna show that.
She's not gonna show her tits?
I showed my cock and my asshole.
- Okay, I'II do your pants.
- Back and forth. okay.
- Holy shit.
- Where's that delivery?
I can't believe this.
I was delivering cream, and look what's happening.
- Jesus, what is that, a rumba?
- What's a rumba?
That awkward movement.
- Should I take your underpants off?
- Yeah, take them off.
What the fuck?
How does this work?
They're just like
- I'll do it.
- I'll do mine, you just
- You do yours.
- I'll do my pants.
Granny panties.
Just get on with it already.
I'm gonna fuck you with my pecker.
Dude, that's really dirty.
- That's too dirty?
- That offends me.
- Penis?
- Fine.
- I'm gonna fuck you with my penis.
- I can't wait.
For my penis.
Be careful, Miri.
Okay, there we go.
Just keep rolling, keep rolling.
- I'll walk forward.
- Fucking cream is coming.
This is the worst porno I've ever seen.
Get over here, delivery man.
Let's fuck on these beans.
- You okay?
- Yup.
Okay' all right.
- Just leave them.
Just leave them.
- They're really distracting.
- You should leave them.
- You gotta get your
- There you go.
Okay' okay.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.
This okay?
Okay.
Okay, uh.
- We'll start kissing on three' okay?
- Okay.
One, two, three.
Go.
MIRl:
I'm ready.
- I'm ready.
- Okay.
Deacon.
- Deacon.
Deacon.
- What?
Did you see Lost this week, man?
I missed it.
What happened?
They're on the island, off the island.
Who can follow that?
I think they're in hell.
Would you all shut the motherfuck up?
I want you to come.
- I want you to come with me.
- Okay.
Oh' God.
Oh' God.
Cut.
That's it?
It's over?
Ain't he supposed to come on her titties?
well' it wasn't what we'd shot-listed' but that was nice.
- It was so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack.
Thanks, Lester, uh.
It wasn't just me, though, guys.
Give it up for my radiant costar here, Miri.
Nice.
- Um, show's over in here.
Let's move out' start lighting the next scene.
- All right.
Let's do it.
You looked so beautiful.
- Thanks.
I thought they were gonna be fucking hard.
- It was pretty.
Pretty don't sell.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
You good, Mir?
You need anything?
I'm just gonna take a minute, okay?
Okay, uh.
I'll just be out there.
Yeah.
- That was fun.
- Yeah, fun.
ZACK "Fun. " You fucking douche.
Wow.
- Hey.
Hey.
- You working on a rewrite?
- Yeah, just for tonight's scene.
- I'm ready to go when you are, though.
- Okay.
You know, before we go, I...
I'm thinking that, uh, it's a good idea if we talk about what happened last night.
- Oh.
- I mean, we don't have to' but I think-
Okay, yeah, uh.
I kind of dropped the ball on that, I guess, huh?
- No, no.
It's...
- To be honest, it was...
You know, I didn't realize how weird it would be for me.
Weird?
Like
- Weird how?
Acting and directing at the same time.
It's a lot to process, you know.
For the first time' I thought my balls didn't have enough hair on them.
That's not what I meant.
I know what you meant.
How you feeling about it?
I guess, um...
I feel like...
Like we...
- Holy fuck.
- The power's on.
Did you do this?
How did this happen?
I burned the bills.
How could we have done that?
- The water.
- The water.
MIRl:
Come on, come on' come on.
Yeah!
- We can shower in our home again.
- We are liquid.
Greetings.
Have you heard the good news about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?
Oh' my God, did you guys do this?
We got tired of you taking showers at our places all the time.
So we took up a collection amongst ourselves.
And chipped away at your mountain of debt.
You guys paid off our massive utilities bills?
- How did you afferd that?
- I stole my old lady's bingo winnings.
And Mistress Bubbles did a bachelor party tonight at which yours truly was a guest star, thank you very much.
- Oh.
- Whoa.
Don't get too excited.
We didn't pay off your whole bill.
Just a month of each.
They agreed to turn everything back on?
At 9 at night?
How does that work?
Stacey knows somebody that works at Power and Light.
- You guys...
- This is amazing.
You didn't have to do this.
You didn't have to put us in your movie.
- Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.
- Or put us in your movie either.
- We said that already.
Guys, honestly, I don't know what to say.
You can start by saying we can take tonight off so we can have our wrap party right now.
Guys, we're not wrapped.
We still have four days of shooting left.
Excuse me.
In my "producoriaI" capacity,
I'm shutting the movie down for a night so we can get a little silly.
Go' go' go.
- Yes.
- Yes.
You all drink.
Was it just amazing with him, after all those years of not knowing?
It was, um, weird.
- But good.
- My scene with Zack's tomorrow.
You don't say.
But I'm a little nervous.
I was thinking about trying to get with him tonight.
- Really?
- I mean, if you don't mind.
You are just friends and all' so I didn't think it would be a biggie.
- It wouldn't be a biggie, would it?
- No.
No, no.
It's not a biggie.
What?
No.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Stacey' I'm not married to the guy, so...
I don't know.
You guys just looked kind of intimate last night.
- We did?
- Yeah.
well' we're just better actors than I thought, I think, so you know what?
If you wanna get with him' you should just go ask him.
- He'd be really excited to hear that.
- Yeah?
For real, you don't mind?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
All the quarters are on the ground.
Hey, Stace.
- Hey' Zack.
Come on, are you guys playing or what?
well' I'm bummed, but I totally get it.
It's no problem to work with Lester again.
He has a nice cock.
well' you're a trouper, Stace.
Oh' but if I start making weird faces or anything during the scene' it's just because I've been constipated all day.
Oh' shit' uh.
We don't have to shoot the scene tonight.
No, I want to.
anal's great for when you're constipated.
It totally loosens you up.
I use ex-lax' but good to know.
Okay, I never thought I would have that conversation.
So are we starting with Lester and Stacey tonight?
We were supposed to start with Lester and Miri.
I know.
She
- We're not gonna do that.
I don't think Miri's gonna do that.
Hey.
So where are we shooting this?
Over here?
- What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.
Our scene's tonight, right?
Can I talk to you for a minute in the back?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
What do you want me to shoot here?
Start with the close-ups of Lester and Stacey.
Give me a second, man.
What an artist.
Okay, uh.
Did I do something wrong to you?
No.
Then why are you here?
I'm here for the same reason you're here.
To make the movie.
Okay, just, like' for your own personal information, you're acting really weird right now.
I'm acting weird?
I think you're acting weird right now.
Oh' I'm acting- How exactly am I acting weird?
You've been trying to keep me from fucking anybody but you since we started this thing.
Maybe I was thinking about your feelings.
Were you thinking of my feelings when you were banging Stacey?
Because that'd be really sad for Stacey.
She told me that you told her that that was okay.
I told her that it was okay to ask you.
Holy shit.
I get it.
I fucking get it.
It was a test.
That whole thing was a fucking test, is that it?
If it was, how do you think you did?
We had a discussion, Miri.
We had
- Actually, we had many discussions about how it was just sex
- and how we wouldn't let it get weird.
- I'm not acting weird.
You're acting like a jealous girlfriend is what the fuck you're acting like.
- I am not your girlfriend.
- I know that.
You're not my boyfriend, so why are we having this conversation right now?
Because you're about to fuck Lester to spite me, it seems like.
Did you fuck Stacey to spite me?
No.
You fucked her like you fucked every other bitch and never gave a shit how I felt about it.
- Well' that was before.
- Before what?
Look, don't fucking pretend that the other night, you and me, right there, that that didn't mean anything to you, that you didn't feel it too.
Oh.
You're not getting all gooey on me here, are you, Zack?
You know what?
If you were any other bitch I didn't give a rat's ass about,
I would tell you to go fuck yourself right now because I fucking hate this game-playing shit.
But you, you mean more to me than that' so I'm just gonna lay this out on front street.
I know you felt something big, something real the other night when we were together because I felt it too.
We tried to fuck and instead, we wound up making love.
So if this is what you need to hear in order to keep you from fucking Lester, if this is what you need, then fine.
Here it is, I'm gonna say it.
I love you, Miri.
Happy?
Oh' Jesus.
You better get ahold of yourself, Zack, because we just fucked.
Okay.
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?
But you did.
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.
Wait-
All right, don't forget I'm down here.
Watch that pullout, huh?
Yeah.
Mmm.
This is some damn good coffee.
- Where you going?
- Getting the fuck out of here.
We gotta finish this movie.
Yo!
You believe this shit?
Do you believe this shit?
What the fuck just happened in there?
I'll tell you what just happened in there.
That chick frosted me like I was a fucking cake.
Zack.
Okay, seriously' get a picture of me right now.
I'm hunting humans.
- Dude' check it out.
Ooh.
- Oh, shit.
Seriously, let's shoot the shit out of this bitch.
- Where you aiming at?
- Cock shots?
Cock shots.
We shot you in the balls, cunt nugget.
well' it's my job to get shot in the balls, so
- Oh, they're gone.
Excuse me.
Didn't you used to work at the Bean-N-Gone in Monroeville?
I sure as shit hope this pays better, I tell you.
So why don't they just shoot you with a puck?
What do you mean?
I mean, what does paintball got to do with hockey?
Nothing, I guess.
- So ain't no prizes or-?
- No, no.
So, what are they paying $5 for?
To shoot a Broad Street Bully in the balls.
White people are fucked up.
Yup' they sure are.
It's a living.
You've been getting the checks I've been sending?
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Probably didn't save you from a brutal tongue-lashing, though, huh?
You know, the wife never found out about the camera, because I paid off the bills.
How did you manage that?
- Because now I'm Oprah rich.
- No way.
- The post office fucking settled?
- Hundred-sixty large' son.
- Nice, man.
Congratulations.
- A beautiful day, thank you very much.
I thought you made that whole thing up.
No, no.
It was very real.
You can believe it.
Even though she's spending all of it.
well' since you ain't gonna ask me, I'll just go ahead and tell you.
- No, I have not seen Miri.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.
Oh' I suppose you weren't gonna ask about your movie, neither?
Look, that's why I came down here.
I need you to come take a look at it.
- I'm not interested.
Sorry.
- You'd better get interested
- because you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?
The story doesn't make sense.
- The story?
- The story doesn't make sense.
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?
It's a movie, dog, and a movie's gotta have an ending, which we don't have at the moment.
Come shot, credits.
There's your fucking ending.
Do me this favor, okay?
When you're done getting your nuts blown off' come back to humble Monroeville to my crib for a couple hours' check out the flick, you tell me what's missing.
No.
I'll tell you what, you do that, you don't owe me shit no more.
- Really?
- Really.
- Is your wife home?
- Yes.
- Maybe I should leave the pads on.
- You got some extra ones?
Hey, honey.
Where the fuck you been?
And who in the fuck is this now?
Would you calm down, woman?
Goddamn.
You already left one white boy down in my basement while you off gallivanting and shit.
What if this motherfucker
- was all grabby on me?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
Oh' what in the fuck is that supposed to mean?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
WIFE:
White boys love me.
White boy.
- I said, white boy.
- Yeah?
You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?
- Should I say yes?
- Just say yes.
Yeah.
- Why don't you, uh, head downstairs?
- Oh, okay.
It's just through this hallway.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
What the fuck you looking at?
Why you gotta be yelling at me in front of my director?
- Oh, he's a director?
- Yeah.
I didn't know that.
Shit, he's a director.
well' why don't he direct my ass to a new husband?
How about that shit?
- That's the bedroom.
Keep talking, maybe he will.
Oh' don't nobody want them saggy-ass balls!
Saggy balls?
Look at these sagging-ass titties you got around here.
- You could tie these together.
- Motherfucker, we match.
Oh' shit.
Where's my paintball gun at?
Look at you, editor and DP.
You got your shit covered, man.
Please, don't ever say "shit-covered" to me again.
Roll the film for the man, please, so we can see what he thinks.
Just jump through it.
I ain't got all night.
The bitch is on me.
"Nigga Rich Productions. " Classy.
- Yeah, DreamWorks was taken.
- Was it?
Plus' it sounds like an underground gay fuck club.
"I met a guy at DreamWorks. " Yeah.
All right, so we got Lester and Stacey fucking.
Then we got Barry and Bubbles fucking.
And then this boring bullshit.
Okay, just, uh, go to the next scene, would you?
Uh...
- What next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?
We never shot it.
- Why not?
- Because after you left that night,
Miri came out of the backroom and said she couldn't do it.
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped?
So...
- Wait, so Miri-
- Never fucked nobody.
Just you.
Now, I wonder why she did that.
- Hm.
- Hm.
You see, there was a time when I was just a bitter old fuck making coffees, and Stacey was just a lap dancer and Barry and Bubbles didn't know each other and this fool here, hell, I don't even know what he was.
- A white supremacist.
- Man' fuck you.
Then two people come along and showed us something we didn't know existed.
A world of possibilities where plain old people just like us could do something special.
Even if it's something as simple as filming people fucking.
Sometimes we just need someone to show us something we can't see for ourselves
and then we're changed forever.
So as you can see' our movie ain't got no ending.
Every movie needs an ending' don't it?
Peace.
Delaney, you're a slick cupid motherfucker.
Ain't love grand?
WIFE:
Why the fuck is this white boy running through my goddamn house?
Sometimes.
Miri.
- Miri.
Zack?
Miri.
I'm sorry.
Get out.
- Close the door.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over-
- Just close the fucking door' Zack.
I never slept with Stacey that night, okay?
I swear to God.
When we got into my room, you know what we did?
We talked about you, and us and how things were different and how I was too much of a fucking pussy to just tell you how I felt about you.
And I know
- I know that that's only because of all the stupid shit we said about how we wouldn't let sex change us, but it did.
It changed me.
That has to be love, right?
It has to be love and just so you know, I can't go back to being just friends anymore,
- because I just can't.
- Good.
And I think-
I think that you feel the same way.
Because that night after I left, you didn't fuck Lester.
What's up, Zack?
You know what?
I don't care that you're fucking Lester, okay?
How's that?
- Oh, shit.
- I don't wanna be with anyone but you.
So I will wait forever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life because I love you, and I have for as long as I can remember.
And I would rather die than be without you, Miriam Linky.
Miri's last name is Linky?
You're gonna fuck a guy who doesn't know your last name?
Or that you beat up Carl Roth in the sixth grade?
I know that.
Or what your senior prom dress would've looked like had we gone but we decided not to, and we got drunk alone instead.
Or that you washed your hair in the toilet.
We're not fucking' Zack.
Or that you're not fucking Zack- What?
I asked her to fuck me.
She wouldn't do it.
I even tried to talk her into giving me the fucking Dutch rudder.
Shot me down on that too.
- And a Dutch rudder is?
- Don't know what a Dutch rudder-?
All right, you grab your dick, then you have someone else work your arm.
Here, let me show you.
All right, grab my arm.
I'm grabbing my dick, you're grabbing my arm.
Now work it.
Work my arm.
See that shit?
Work it up and down.
It's like someone else is jerking you off.
Okay.
There's the double Dutch rudder, which' I grab my dick, you grab your dick, you work my arm, I work your arm' same time.
It's like jerking off together but not gay.
We're not touching dicks, each other's dicks anyway.
I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.
It feels good, sir.
Try me, come on.
Sorry to change the subject on you, Lester, but if you're not fucking Miri, why is your dick out right now?
Because I live here now, and I like to be naked.
- What?
- When you moved out, she couldn't afford to pay her rent by herself, so I moved in to help.
But you just came out of her room.
That's my room now.
She moved in your old room.
Wait, wait, wait.
She changed rooms?
Yeah, she said she did it because she missed the smell of you or some shit.
I don't smell anything.
But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.
- Night, Zack.
- Night.
Do you?
Then why are you crying?
Because I missed you so much.
Me too.
I love you.
- I love you, I love you.
I love you.
I don't mean to alarm you but I think I just jerked off Lester a little bit.
- The Dutch rudder?
- Yeah, it's ingenious, right?
If you ask me nicely, I will Dutch-rudder you the rest of our lives.
Good.
I'm getting tired of fucking the Fleshlight.
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.
- What'd it feel like?
- Like fucking a flashlight.
Wrong room.
- Oh, God.
That's gross.
Let us fuck.
Hello.
Welcome to Nigga Rich Productions' home of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, the production house for the couple looking to put a little spice in their sex life.
- Shall we take a look around?
- Fuck me so hard.
Oh, God.
First, you'll meet for a consultation with one of our romance-ologists, who'II coach you through that initial awkward stage before you're camera-ready.
So we will start off with some erotic massage and some-
Dude.
Some light petting.
That sounds good.
Are you guys sure you don't wanna do some, uh, butt-sack work too?
- Uh, let's move on' shall we?
- Why?
From their break-out hit, Swallow My Cockuccino, to the multi-million selling Swallow My Cockuccino ll and the award-winning Star Whores saga, including Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter,
Zack and Miri have proven time and again that they know how to shoot hot sex.
As an actor, I've sometimes brought my work home with me inappropriately.
When you're telling your real-life lover in the bedroom' to' you know' bend over while you cake your hand in K-Y, it is a sign that the romance is dead, I think.
Then we turned to the professionals at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
Oh' my God, they totally saved our civil union.
They filmed what was inside of us and not what was coming out of us necessarily.
It helped me see his asshole as not just a come dumpster, but a sign of his beauty' his flower.
It became a, uh, gorgeous orchid.
Orchids grow in sort of the filthiest conditions.
That's what his asshole became to me.
This beautiful flower amidst shit.
- Honey, they get the metaphor.
- I don't think they do.
Let's just say, thank you to Zack and Miri.
It's helped us out, it's helped our friends.
Enrique?
Park?
Park?
Enrique?
Can we get a little love for Zack and Miri?
They don't even know what's going on, they're so pilled up.
But don't take his word for it.
Just ask our co-founders.
- Hi.
I'm Miri Linky Brown.
- I'm Zack Linky Brown.
Here at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, we're dedicated
- to committing your love-
- Or lust.
- to high-end, quality production digital video.
A forever keepsake of your passion.
That's right, Miri.
Why set up a camera at the end of your bed and settle for one unflattering angle, when you could let the professionals dazzle and delight your senses with an array of shots so masterfully rendered you'll swear Martin Scorsese snuck into your room
and caught you fucking?
And remember' we're not just the presidents of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
We're also clients.
Call now to set up your appointment
Way to fuck, Zack.
Get up Zack.
Come on, I don't wanna be late from work.
- Get out!
- Jesus, why not close the fucking door if you're gonna take a shit?
- It was closed!
- No, it was closed over, it was not closed.
-Shut the fucking door!
- Okay, okay.
- What's that thing?
- It's a hand warmer.
We're going now.
Do you smell that?
Is that the car?
- Oh, God.
- What?
-Oh, no.
- What?
-What?
- It's stuck in my balls.
What's happening?
-Pull over, pull over.
- Okay, alright!
Oh fuck.
I think I burned my ball hair off.
It's not funny.
Can you help me pick out an outfit for tonight?
I'm working till six.
Well, I can try stuff on at the store.
The store?
No, how about instead you get a friend?
But you are my friend.
- I meant a girl friend.
-Can you work for me tomorrow?
- Tomorrow is Thanksgiving.
-Then you must come in the next day, I tell you.
-It's Black Friday.
- Black Friday?
It's the biggest mall shopping day of the year.
And since the mall is just up in the street, I would like you to come and work.
-On Black Friday?
- Oh yeah.
-And we work on Movie Monday too?
- Sorry?
How about "Nigger Tuesday"?
Nigger Tuesday?
Is this a new day holiday?
You come to brother and tell him he gotta work on Black Friday
You got any idea how racist that sounds?
Telling me to come here and work, what do you think you own me?
-I never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?
You thought to yourself:
Oh I'm gonna for this nigger, cause I put food on his table and clothes on his little nigger baby backs and he ain't gonna say shit.
-To say I'm a star.
- You shut up.
You're God damn right to say I'm a star.
Can't wait until the post office settle my disability suit, cause Deann I will be out this mother fucker.
-You can kiss my ass.
- You know what?
Fuck you, fuck you and suck cock.
The hell with you.
- The hell with you.
-Zack, my boy.
- Yeah?
A customer with a hair lip speak me say you've been watching baseball here the other night.
Football.
And no, that wasn't me.
Maybe the hair lip makes it sound like baseball.
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe you hear it with an accent.
Fuck you, okay?
One day I'm gonna put a camera there and I can tell, I know, everything you do when I'm gone.
Everything.
Scratch your balls, take a shit.
Everything, I tell you.
Okay?
Fucker.
I hear both of you mother fuckers, I tell you.
-Why is he so fucking ice trunk?
- Fuck off, I tell you.
Very good, hmm?
Ghandi mother fucker telling me I gotta work on Black Friday, and do some shit.
Like I don't wanna do some shopping too.
Biggest sales day of the year.
I'm getting me a flat screen TV, you couldn't believe that.
That is actually my fault, I should tell you.
I asked for Friday morning off, so..
-Sorry about that.
- For what?
I actually just need a lot of recovery time.
Tonight is me and Miri's ten-year-high school reunion
I'm just gonna get fucking alcohol poisoning.
-Reunion?
- Yeah.
-Tomorrow is Thanksgiving.
- I know, isn't that fucked up when they do that?
Like, they say it is the best chance to get everyone together.
People come back to the town for holidays..
But you know what?
They can have it in the middle of the summer at a fucking blow job contest that I was judging, and it would still be retarded.
-So why are you going there?
- Miri is making me go.
Listen to him, why are you always bend over backwards for the girl, knowing she ain't getting annoyance.
We got a good thing going, man.
She pays out the rent, she does the dishes she wakes me up in the morning.
Why complicate that with sex?
Besides man, I've know her since the first grade.
You don't fuck someone you've met in the first grade.
Excuse me, I've met my wife in kinder garden
We got married in Senior year and she has been the queen of my world ever since.
-But what if you could do it all over again?
- I would jerk off and live by myself.
- That woman is the ban of my existence.
- See!
Excuse me, can I get a cup of coffee?
-Black.
- Can't you see we're talking, White?
If you're gonna continue to emasculate me with this barbie dress up shit
-I'm using your laptop.
- Don't forget to smack it when you turn it on otherwise the screen doesn't come on.
-Why don't you spring get a new one of these?
- Same reason I don't spring for clothes for tonight:
I'm broke.
There's a chick who works at Teen Juice at the mall, you know
And I gave her a good deal in Yearn's so she's letting me borrow this stuff for tonight.
What?
A vibrator online.
-What's wrong with the one you have?
- It died last week.
Look at the size of those fucking panties.
Shoot that shit, shoot it.
Who even knew Amazon sold shit like this.
This is incredible!
Those are fucking granny panties.
Okay, A:
I don't appreciate you violating the sanctity of my Amazon wish list page
And B:
I'm not buying that thing on Amazon, because turns out the over credit card they take
Oh shit.
I'm sorry guys, am I in the way?
You're fucking fagot alright.
Let's go to Starbucks.
And he throws like a bitch.
You know what else I throw: my nuts sacking your coffees, so how does that taste fucker?
We saw your girl friend in her under wear.
Well, too bad she's not my girl friend you little fucker..
Are you still talking to me?
Just said I'm gonna look up more fuck toys on Amazon.
Holy shit, at least they have a flash light here too.
-What's that?
- It's a fucking pocket pussy
That is shaped like a flash light for discretionary jacking off.
That when you get caught no-one thinks it's weird, you're just a guy who likes to fuck his flash light.
-I'm totally buying this shit.
- Wow, if you got money to burn..
How about paying the electric bill?
-It's due already?
- Well, November's probably but I was talking about September's.
Tell me, this doesn't rock.
Kinda look like you're fucking Ronald McDonald.
That makes me want some McNuggets.
Why would you wanna buy a pocket pussy anyway?
That is so sad.
What?
Excuse me, I forgot about the nobility that a company is coming with a fucking vibrator.
Real, seal, action..
Oh my God, if you start fucking little machines
I'm moving out.
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a little machine.
How come you get to fuck something with a motor in it, and I can't?
Cause I've never met a man who can make me come like a vibrator does.
That is fucking bullshit.
...ball of jerkings in the bathroom?
Holy Jesus, you do not use my jerkings to jack in our bathroom.
No you know what I do actually, is I light bunch of candles
And I sprawl out on my sheets and I listen to Sting.
Now I'm a guy..
Give me two popsicle sticks and a rubber band, I'll find a way to fuck it
Like a filthy McGyver.
- Oh my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.
-How about this?
- I don't get why you're putting so much effort in this thing anyway?
I thought we were like, just gonna go sit around and make fun of everybody.
Well, I can't wear anything that I've already on and expect to bring home Bobby Long.
Bobby fucking Long?
No way!
Didn't that guy call you Stinky Linky?
Yeah that was then, okay?
Maybe now he can save me a fortune in Amazon bills.
Maybe you can fuck our landlord, so we can at least keep roof over our heads.
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.
Hey, I bought skates with last week's pay check and I need those, to skate with.
And this week's I'll barely cover the past two water bills so..
Is this sexy?
Yeah, in like to a catch a predator kind of way it is pretty fucking sexy.
Then we're done.
Zack.
You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?
They shut it off.
- Oh shit, just..
Help me get this shit out off my hair.
Just use the water out of the toilet.
There's poo in there.
Not that part!
The back part of the toilet thing.
Take that cup there and then put in, there you go.
Here I'll just lean back if you could just
You know, pour it down like that.
Don't look, don't look.
Alright, one hour tops and then we're gone.
Or I had an idea, we could just not go at all, which would rock.
Look, even though we're broke and we've never gone to anything, we're still better than these people, right?
No, not at all.
We're probably not even as good as most of them, unless one of them is crackhead or something.
Just tell me I'm prettier than when we graduated.
You look about the same.
Definitely not prettier.
But around the same.
I'm thinner though right, little?
Not really.
Well, good pep talk.
Fuck!
-Tadaa!
- Tadaa.
-You don't recognize us, do you?
- No, sorry.
Zack Brown and Miri Linky.
-Are you the one they called Stinky Linky?
- Oh no, no-one ever called me that.
Oh great, what does yours say?
-What the fuck?
!
Come on, I'm sure I had a nickname.
-Nothing?
- Alright, well you guys have a great time.
And before you go, don't forget your copy of the Roving Roe-Ver.
-What the fuck is this shit?
- That is not shit.
That would be our bimonthly newsletter.
You know, it updates you on what everyone's doing in their lives.
-Finally!
- I love your enthusiasm.
Here you go, write your e-mail address down on that and I'll be sure to add you to our 800-hundred-member strong mailing list.
We had 800 people in our graduating class?
Yes, and only 250 RSVP.
-Doesn't that suck, Mary?
- Miri.
-Are you married, Beths?
- I am.
Two kids.
-Wow, that's beautiful.
- Awesome.
Wanna fuck me later?
-Oh no, I'm married.
- OK, cool.
Well, if you change your mind I'll be there getting shit face.
Just so you know, I eat the pussy.
Tempting..
Again, no.
-Show we?
- Sir.
Bye Beths.
Think about it.
I love your pussy.
Can I get two beers, please?
-You want a beer?
- Yeah.
Three beers.
Thank you.
Is that Zack?
Or am I Zack?
-Never gets old, huh?
-The other Zack.
- In my world nobody calls me the other Zack.
Now that this guy is not around anymore, huh?
-Get the fuck off of me.
- There can be only one.
-What?
- Do not you remember?
Remember?
I yelled at you when we passed each other at the hall way.
Like it was yesterday, man.
Awesome, awesome.
-Awesome.
God!
You guys have so much to catch up on.
-I'm gonna let you get to it.
- Bitch.
See that big blow up picture they have of me?
My hair is terrible.
I can't believe I wore my hair like that.
It's before I knew about styling products.
Makes a big difference in life.
You live and learn though, right?
I mean, ten years ago.
It's before we knew anything about fashion.
Back in the day.
Or hairstyle.
Hey, stranger.
-Whoah, Stinky Linky?
- Yeah.
Although, it's just Miri now.
- Give me a hug.
-Hi.
- Hi.
Wow.
-How have you been?
- Great, great.
-Yeah?
- You look fantastic.
Wow, that is not something that you would've said to me ten years ago.
Well, I've grown up.
Yes.
Yes you have.
You just look..
Listen to you..
Thank you.
No don't thank me, just fuck me.
Roxanne.
Someone I like, what are the odds, huh?
Zack Brown, we had four years Spanish together.
Why does no-one recognize me?
Am I thinner, is that it?
Look at him.
-Who?
- My stupid husband.
No fucking shit!
John Butterfield, you actually married John Butterfield!
-That's amazing!
- Don't ever get married, it sucks.
You stop appreciating each other and you runs us up to talk about it first year.
But look at him now.
Flirting up with that cheerleader named Monica Vahn.
You want me to maybe flirt with you so he can see?
Even it up a bit?
I don't wanna get even.
If I was gonna do anything I wanna wine up the asshole.
You can give me a hand job in the girls' locker room.
-Fine, but make it fast.
- Fuck yeah!
Are you staying in town for a while?
Just tonight.
I fly back to L.A. tomorrow.
Wow, Los Angeles!
Gosh, Bobby Long.
Coming up in the world.
With Mrs. Long, I bet.
No, No, no, No Mrs. Long for me.
-Can I be honest with you?
- Sure.
I think I need a drink.
Do you need a drink?
Cause I need a drink to say this.
-I've got a beer already so..
- Oh great, thank you.
I think there's a cigarette butt in there.
Yup.
Sorry about the elbow.
I can be only one.
A beer, please.
Thank you very much.
Oh Jesus Christ, my friend is making a total ass of herself ending her old high school crush.
Oh God, that's so sad.
It's so Miri, that's what it is.
I'm Zack by the way.
Brandon.
Oh don't worry we weren't at the same class or anything.
Okay, lucky you.
-Oh, you went Rover?
- Well, I went here.
Let's just leave it at that, I guess.
-Do you have one of the large flown pictures of yourself hanging around here ?
- I do.
Kind of, right there.
-Gorgeous.
- Good times.
What do you do?
What brings you here?
Oh, I came with somebody who went school here.
Bobby Long.
No shit!
That's who my friend is hitting on right now!
See, right there.
-Really?
- There the one dressed up like Hannah Montana.
In L.A. we call that look deglodion chŽek.
-L.A.?
Los Angeles?
- California.
That's awesome man.
What do you do out there?
I'm an actor.
-Wow, that's really impressive.
- Thank you, thank you.
-And fucking movies?
- Fucking movies, pretty much.
Look at you.
What, anything I've seen?
-What movies?
- Oh, all sorts of movies with all male cast.
All male cast.
Like Glenn Gary and Ross?
Like "Glenn and Gary suck Ross' midi cock and drop their hairy nuts in his eager mouth".
-Like a seakwell?
- Sort off.
It is a re-imagining.
- Ah, like the whiz.
More erotic and with less women.
No women, to be exact.
I apologize in advance if I'm out of line here,
But are you in gay porn?
-Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?
I thought you recognized me at first, that's why..
-Oh, okay I get it.
- You're not my demographic so I'm not insulted.
-Not really.
Who is your demographic?
- Do you love pussy?
-I do.
- Then not you.
I came here tonight hoping to seduce you and bring back to my apartment and sleep with you
to get back at you for calling me Stinky Linky all those years ago.
Wow, that is a weird revenge flat.
-You must be a terrible lay for that..
- What?
No, I'm great.
I mean I've had enough practice and everything..
Wow, that sounded not good.
I fuck a lot.
That's what I meant to say.
That doesn't sound good either.
Wow.
You're a lot funnier than I remembered.
Thank you.
Gosh, you turned out to be such a nice guy.
Wow, it's just.. you know, it makes even easier to just say this..
Would you like to come back to my place and maybe open a bottle of wine and..
have ourselves a high school reunion?
- I..
-Hello Miriam.
- Beat it, we're talking.
-I just wanted to introduce you to Brandon.
- Salutations.
-Bobby's boyfriend.
-Bobby who?
- Bobby me.
Bobby Long.
Brandon is the star of such adult fair..
What was that one called again?
"You'd better shut your mouth or I'm gonna fuck it"
That's right.
I'm surprised I forgot that.
-Are you fucking with me?
- No, they are fucking with each other.
Oh my God.
-No!
- What?
-Granny Panties?
- Excuse me?
-How can you tell?
- This is so crazy.
I was literally just watching you like right before we got here.
This is so crazy.
This is you, right?
- My name's Granny Panties and nobody wants to fuck me.
Nothing's whiter than my big gay ass.
-Where did you get that?
- Oh, I entered gay and ass, and it was the top hit.
It's had 200 thousand views in three hours.
Honey, you are like..
I'm actually jealous right now, cause you are like super famous.
Baby, please take our picture.
I need a picture with Granny Panties.
This is awesome.
Alright, smile.
Did you get it?
Oh thank you, baby.
-E-mail me that.
- Yeah, cause he's the worst photographer.
Okay, good.
-You're gay?
- Yeah.
And I'm on the internet wearing.. a diaper?
Who knew you'd come to Pittsburgh and meet a celebrity?
-I'm gonna drink now till I pass out.
- Okay.
She'll be fine.
So you guys suck each other's cocks?
Oh, like crazy.
-Okay, that's enough.
- Oh, I'm embarrassing him.
I love when he gets embarrassed.
He's not living out loud you know, so he gets all like..
-You guys are totally in love, aren't you?
- Zackhary, we are.
Oh god, I just want..
I just wanna eat him up.
I can't keep my hands off him.
You know what, although he does most of the eating in the sack, if you know what I mean
-In the sack and off the sack.
- Alright, that's enough.
Look, you've drank too much.
You do this every time.
You can't contain yourself.
Oh, I'm sorry.
And by containing myself, you mean containing myself in the closet?
In the closet of denial?
Is that..?
No, no, no.
-Oh shit, this is real.
- No, but this is exactly why you haven't met my mother.
Because you don't know how to ease people into this situation.
-Baby.
- ..just force your way in, every time.
Baby, I thought maybe for one second in this town I could be myself.
I'm so sorry.
No, you're right..
I should just butch up and pretend that I don't love it
When you shove your dick in my mouth.
This is the best night of my life.
Am I making a spectacle, cause I could make a much bigger scene.
- Really are
I'm sorry.
Pittsburgh, listen up Man-Rovers..
My name is
-Brandon St.Randy and I love Bobby Long.
- Fucking A!
Is that enough for you?
Is that enough for a scene?
Cause I could start do a lot worst than that
And the reason, the reason you haven't taken me to your mother's.
Your mother with a make-up and all her drinking
She's in the closet, too.
-They fight just like real people.
- I thought, I could be a conduit for you.
-Thank you.
- Are you being sarcastic?
-No, I'm not.
Thank you.
- I love you.
-I'll e-mail you, Brandon.
- Zack, it was so nice to meet you.
And I will be patient with you, I will be there on your journey.
I will be your ship up the mountain of gayness.
Well, about to see what Granny Panties is up to, huh?
Do you hear that?
What kind of evil fucks turn off your power the day..
No, the night before Thanksgiving.
-Who does that?
- Can you get advance on your credit card?
Flash light.
Back stab my 200-dollar women.
Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.
This is bad.
If we don't come up some rent we're gonna be locked out the apartment.
So, who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.
Which means, by the time we get home, there's no heat either.
Well, I think it's time we put what we always talked about into effect.
You're gonna have to start hooking.
You know, these are the exact circumstances people find themselves in right before they start having sex for money.
Or making porn.
Sexy.
-Oh my God, yeah.
- What?
You got an idea?
We could make a porno.
Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?
No, yeah that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me?
That's a great idea.
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend
He said he makes a hundred grand a year, because he shoots and distributes his own porno films.
If it's so easy, how come everybody doesn't do it?
Because other people have options and dignity.
Which we do not have.
Which puts us in amazingly adventitious position.
Fuck you, I have dignity.
- Where?
Is it hidden in your gigantic under pants that are blasted all over the internet?
-Is that were you hide your dignity?
- Every woman has a pair of those period panties.
That's like a fact.
- OK, families.
I bet most people don't make porno, because they have families.
But luckily, your parents are dead
Sorry.
My grandparents are dead.
- Sorry.
Thank you.
So who we're gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone main stream now, it's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks in it.
Look at Paris Hilton.
Now she's selling fragrances to Tween's.
And I'm pretty sure she's legally retarded.
-Tween's?
- Have you seen that Jul Francis guy who made Girl Gone Wild?
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot piece of shit in the world, and he has a jet and a fucking island.
Look, there's gotta be a less extreme solution to our financial whoas here.
-Give me a better option.
- Get a paper out.
-I don't have bike.
- You could be a waiter.
No-one wants me around their food.
-Would you eat food that I gave you?
- Not if you gave me it, that's true.
Nobody wants so see us fuck, Zack.
- Everybody wants to see anybody fuck
I hate Rosie O'Donnell, but if someone said
"I got a tape of Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid", I would be like why the fuck aren't we watching that right now?
-Cause she's famous, hello?
- So are you, you're fucking granny panties.
My underwear and your ass are famous, we're not.
-So who the f would want to watch us fuck?
- At least 800 people.
You jerk went to school?
Are you serious?
Of course, I'm serious.
If you heard this one we graduated with
Was in a fucking porno movie, you watch it, right?
I'd watch the Brandon guy suck a cock.
I just met him.
With this mailing list, we have almost a thousand people
That would definitely buy a porno we arranged, just to be like "hey, I sit next to that guy in Civic's.
Look at his fucking dick!"
We sold a thousand copies at 25 bucks a pop.
Bam!
We have payed off our bills.
-So, what do you think?
- Nah, I don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.
Oh, wow.
Like you've never done that before.
How many guys have you met in a bar, taken home..
Banged..
with your mouth and then never talked to again?
-That's what we call a stranger.
- Dude, I don't one night mouth fuck anybody that I pick up in bars.
Okay, fine.
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in porno movie
For some weird reason..
I guess..
-We could fuck.
- Yuck.
-Fuck you.
- I mean, you're nice enough looking guy and everything..
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're old enough looking girl.
How does that feel?
Dude, I'm just saying it would be weird and wrong, you know, like fucking my brother.
Ok, seriously.
We're just talking about sex, okay?
And it's for a purpose, if we're getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.
And you just explain to your private before hand.
Look, this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash.
-Oh my God.
- What?
You're just doing this, cause you've always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?
Yes, I've gone my whole life pretending that I want nothing to do with you.
Just hoping, one day we'd be in such dinar financial straight
So I could use it to finally make my move on you.
-You're just being sarcastic.
- I am.
See, I was pretending cry right there.
I guess it's not gonna be like creepy.
Like if we just got way too drunk one night and accidentally fucked.
No.
We would be going in with the understanding that it's..
-A business decision.
-Strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.
Right.
And by end, I mean I'll be waxing your ass.
Oh fuck you!
I'm not even letting you see my ass.
I've seen your ass and the rest of you naked around a billion times already.
Well, that goes both ways, buddy.
You've never seen my dick.
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.
Are you kidding!
That part when we went to, where you got blasted
And then we all watched you try for like an hour.
Thanks by the way for fucking letting me do that, thank you.
Oh God, we really do know too much about each other.
This would really just be one more thing.
I mean, look at us, it's Thanksgiving we're hulling around flaming
Fucking garbage can like a couple of steno bums.
I mean, this could give us chance to pay off our debt, pay our bills, get a fucking nice apartment with a heat in it maybe.
What is wrong?
Miriam Linky, will you have sex with me on camera for money?
I will.
Who's the producer?
He's the guy who gets to finance the movie.
Hell, what made you think I got that kind of money?
We just need that.
We just need what you're about to spend on the flat screen.
And I can't get my flat screen!
Fuck that.
No, no, no, no.
Dude, with your kind of profits, you can get two flat screens you have one in your living room, and one in your bath room.
One in the bath room?
That has always been my dream..
Watched it while I shit.
Everyone with an ass loves to watch it while they shit.
-I'm gonna make that happen for you, man.
- I don't know, man.
What else does the producer do?
They help with the casting.
-What's casting?
- It's finding the people to be in the movie.
-Oh, so I get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.
Like I can look at the titties and make sure there ain't no moles on them?
-You can look both titties, man.
- Oh man..
I'm looking at the same busted titties for the past almost 20 years.
-I'm due for another new tittie.
- Please, help us.
Yes!
Yes, I love you.
Well, don't mind that smell.
But we had some homeless people squatting in here.
You know what, they would avoid their balls everywhere but the bathroom.
Anyway, you pick up the poop and you got yourself a movie studio.
Or we could just shoot this thing in your apartment?
No power.
You wanna pay the electric bill?
-You mother fuckers.
- We'll take it.
Come on, come on, come on.
Oh Jesus.
Come on.
Why the fuck do I have to do everything?
Fucking God..
They fucking suck.
I'm gonna hate fuck the shit out of you Reff.
-Dude.
- It's cool.
He's my cousin.
Didn't you use to video tape the varsity basketball games in high school, or something?
Just the away games.
I did it, cause I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.
-Which one?
- Every one who wanted to fuck a guy who taped the varsity games.
You still have your video camera?
Who cares what the title is?
The porn I liked, when I was a kid, it was always like a spoof of a popular movie.
Like..
Edward Penis Hands.
-Okay, so we need a mildly clever dirty title, that sounds like a real movie and will basically sum up what you're gonna say.
-"An American Werewolf and Brenda" - "Fuck Back Mountain"
Too soon?
-Next.
-Jerk my crayon and let me color your white.
I need talking, I need it now.
-I'm fucking you in the puss.
- I'm fucking you in the puss..
-It's puss as in pussy.
- Oh, because I was like..
Who would wanna fuck puss.
I want to slam my ham in your canvaman.
Scene.
-This guy is amazing.
- This guy is great looking too.
Hi, My name is Delaney and I'm a producer, if you know what I mean.
Let's be honest, my first time.
You don't have to worry..
-I'm gonna touch you, nothing like that.
- Alright.
I have a wife, we're happy..
We're not happy but it's cool.
Just so you know, there will be some fucking but uh..
We'll talk about that if you get the part.
-Okay.
- I mean, not we won't be fucking.
There will be fucking in the movie.
Like I said I got a wife and she don't play that shit.
She's crazy bitch.
-Yup.
- It's my job as the producer to see what you got.
So..
To make sure you're comfortable in any way.
You don't have to show me anything you don't wanna show me, cause..
I love the movies.
-"Lawrence of a Labia"
- No.
-"Dawn of the Dick"
- Yeah, but how are zombies doing it all sexy.
- I want to eat your brain and your ass.
-Dude..
-Scifi, yeah!
Closing counters with a turk from behind.
-I don't know what that means.
- Just asses.
Fucking keeping asses.
-What?
- We're making a porno
And we just need to know what you would be or would not be interested in doing.
-If anything..
- No anal.
-Oh, definitely not anal.
- Anal and hugging.
-I don't do ass stuff.
- Anal.
Oh fuck.
Oh wait oral, I like anal.
Okay, so do you have any special skills?
Special skills?
I can get balling really quick, and it sticks straight up.
-Is that really special skills?
- I think it is.
Can you show us what you mean?
Sure.
Oh, that is special.
Yeah, you're hired.
Mr..
Who are you again?
Lester, Lester the Molester Cocking Stuff.
Wow, that is the best porn name I've ever heard, man.
I can have a porn name?
Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.
Are you Granny Panties?
-She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The Granny Panties are actually in the house, I'll get them.
"Star Sex II"
We never made our "Star Sex I".
I guess we'll lose the "Star Sex III" "The Search For Cock" then.
-Cock-ant
- What's that?
It's cuckoon with a cant.
So, Delaney told us you have a special talent of some sort.
I don't know if I call it a special talent, but it's a little something I picked up during bachelor parties.
-It would probably be easier if I just showed you.
- The floor is yours.
So a movie, huh?
That could be fun.
Fuck.
Her name Bubbles.
-"Vas-ion of the party snatches"
- It's like mad magazines.
Oh fuck you, okay.
You try to think of a good scifi porno title, it's hard.
There's gotta be one we haven't thought of.
That would say it all, not be ridiculously filthy and off putting.
And still have in some recognition with our audience.
I got it!
-"Star Whores"?
- Yeah, funny right?
See, we figured this opens us up to even bigger sales market.
Beyond the people we went school with, people who like comics and scifi.
Comics?
Like Ziggy?
Ziggy?
Is that even in fucking papers anymore?
No, man.
Fuck you.
Ziggy is a comic.
It's right next to Family Circus.
No,like Spider Man and shit, you know.
There's always a shit load of those Star Wars nerds at those car-pic shows.
So we sell them a Princess Leia, that they can really fuck and jerk off, too.
That would be me, Princess Lay Her.
-Who am I planned?
- You, my friend, are the lead role of Luke the Guy Baller.
Oh man, he gonna be balling dudes?
I thought you said it was just boys on girls.
If I had to fuck a guy, okay, but I would rather fuck a girl.
-What's wrong with you, boy?
- We'll change the name to uh..
to Sky Baller.
I will be Hung Solo.
Delaney my friend,
-You are On Your Knees Bend Over.
- Man, I can't be in no porno movie
-My wife will kill me.
- Hump me, On Your Knees Bend Over, your my only hump.
On the other hand, fuck my wife.
Unfortunately, On Your Knees Bend Over is not having sex in the movie, but the drawings do.
ICUP and R2T fag.
-I robot.
- And Stacey over here is gonna play
Darth Vibrator.
- I'm the bad guy?
-It's not a guy, Zack.
- I know that, cause I'm not a fucking idiot.
In our movie, the Darth Vibrator is a bad girl who wants to fuck the galaxy, literally.
And it's up to Luke and Hung to stop her.
-With their cocks.
- See, you and me get to have sex then.
- Cool.
- Yeah, I know.
Hold up, so who are having sex with who, in this movie?
I was about to say I was having sex with Zack.
What?
Hung Solo ain't never had no sex with Princess Leia
In the Star Wars.
Oh, guys look, this isn't a literal adaptation here
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.
Kind of like the Whiz.
With lots of anal.
- Cool.
I have a question.
Do Princess Lay Her and Luke Sky Baller have sex?
No.
Because they're brother and sister.
And according to Miri brother and sister can't fuck.
But you actually said that this wasn't literal translation so that means, Lester's character could have sex with Miri's character.
Cause I would love to fuck and eat her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.
Well, dream on Pall, cause it's never gonna happen, okay?
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See, she's fine..
Wait, what?
Yup.
I mean, everyone else is having sex with more than one person in this movie all the sudden
So, I think it's, you know, not fair if I'm only fucking you.
Guys, read them up to yourselves.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Look Mir, we got plenty of sex going on in this thing already.
You don't have to do that.
Zack, it's fine.
I mean, I have slept with way worse looking guys than Lester.
And I just want to do my part for the movie like everyone else.
You're having sex in the movie already, so you don't need to fuck someone else, you're good.
I'm only fucking you though so, don't we need to vary it up
Keep it fair?
- Fair for who?
What are these blood diamonds we're talking about.
I mean, come on!
Fair for everyone else who is fucking more than one person..
A.k.a you, in the movie.
I mean fine.
- Alright then.
-If you don't care.
- I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
I don't give a shit.
Like you said fuck
Holy shit.
Are we really gonna shoot this in out of space?
Maybe not bigger idiots.
Star Whores
Cut.
Alright guys, that's it.
So everyone just make sure you leave costumes, so we know they're here for tomorrow, okay?
But mostly, everybody, thank you so much for helping us get ready.
Cleaning this place out, building the sets and sowing the costumes.
-It's really amazing, thank you.
- Seriously, thanks.
But this is just the beginning guys.
If Star Whores works,
And it will.
We're set up for..
"The Empire Strikes Ass" - "The Return of the Brown Eye"
-"The Phantom Man Ass"
- And The Revenge of the Shit
The all anal final chapter.
-Okay.
- The Revenge of the Shit, you got it?
Yeah, no, we got it.
We'll talk about that one.
We're gonna have a lot of fun, but more importantly,
We're gonna make a lot of fucking money, okay?
So get ready for greatness people.
Tomorrow we start
Alright.
Good night, you guys.
-What?
- Nothing.
I just think someone should
Knowledge how completely insane and amazing this is.
And it's all because of you.
Ah, no.
It's just a porno.
You know what I mean.
You're really coming to your own.
Shut the fuck up.
So, speaking off coming in things, ready for tomorrow?
20 years finally getting to know what it's like to have sex with each other.
Wow, you say that like you've been wondering what it'd be like sleep with me for a while now.
Why the fuck do you think I started hanging out with you?
I knew it.
Here, help me.
Let's just promise that, this is not gonna change anything between us, okay?
-Like what?
- I don't know.
Some guys can't keep sex in prospective.
If anyone is gonna keep this in prospective, it's you.
I don't want you to get all mooshie and gooey on me after I give you the best orgasm you've ever had in your life.
Oh right, like you know what you're doing down there at all.
I actually don't.
Where's the clitoris, is it in your ass?
Just so you know, make sure you kind of whoop it up and act like I'm a stud, who knows what he's doing.
Just be a pall.
Oh, dude.
I'm gonna marital street the fuck out of this,
You watch.
-Thanks.
- You're welcome.
No really..
Thank you.
For everything.
You're welcome.
Less than 12 hours, we make Monroewill history.
I hope nothing goes wrong.
It's a movie, what could go wrong?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What the fuck is going on?
No, you gotta stop it now!
We rented this place for a month
From Mr. Jenkings.
Nah, sounds like your Mr. Jenkings is full of shit.
I'm gonna kill that lying old fuck!
You're gonna have to go down to Florida to do so.
That's where he moved.
We got thousands of dollars of equipment there, man.
Please.
Hey, if you wanna shift trough this ravel, be my guest.
Hey, get that fucking beam down!
I know this is probably the last thing you wanna hear right now, but
If you don't get an advance on your salary,
I don't think we're gonna keep a roof over our heads.
I got an advance already-
Went it all on the costumes.
- So all our money is gone?
All your money?
Never mind, what my wife is gonna do to me when there ain't no new snow tires
But when she sees a charged video camera-
Sorry I dragged you into this, man.
I just wanted to see some free titties.
That's all.
But there's no such thing as free titties..
Is there, Zack?
Is there?
Fuck this noise.
Why we don't just get another camera and shoot something else?
Where we gonna do that?
You got another sound stage?
What sound stage?
We had a shit covered garage we turned into a sound stage.
We find some place new, and we do it again.
How?
I'm broke, man.
No, make that I was broke..
Now I'm really tapped out.
I'll have to get another job just to pay Delaney back, so please tell me, how can I afford to start over?
-What can I get ya?
- Yeah, can I get..
Too fucking late.
Cappuccino, $ 3.50.
Honestly, I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
I'm a total loser in every single other aspect of my life.
What made you think, I could do as simple as filming
People fucking.
We have no money left, no where to shoot, we have no sets
We have no fucking cameras.
Here!
It's time I go back to my old regular life
Where I'm a quiet fuck, who does not cost anybody any money
And knows his God damn position behind this fucking counter
Making cappuccinos for this fucking guy.
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
Yeah.
Fuck yes!
You sneaky Indian mother fucker, I tell you.
Yes!
-Swallow My Cockacino!
- What?
That's it.
That's the movie.
Why didn't I think it before.
We don't need sets
Or a stage.
Look at all this production value.
Waiting to have balls on it!
Hold up.
You wanna shoot the movie here,
-Where we work?
- Yes!
Fuck.
Yes I do!
Do you know how many stories I have from working here?
How many times I've been laid right there after hours?
You've never got laid here after hours.
I know!
Thank you for reminding me.
But I always wish I had.
And that's what porno is.
A fantasy.
If taking the normal, and making it abnormal
By fucking it.
- Don't do that.
Little dog don't like that.
- How the fuck did you get a camera?
By being a terrible, untrustworthy employee.
That's how!
Give me a day, I'll bang out a script.
Meet me here after closing.
We're gonna load gism all over this mother fucker!
Peace!
I like that guy.
But if he tries to fuck that little dog tonight for real, I'm calling Humane Society.
Called Bean-n-Gone, so get the fuck out of here.
Vamos, Stacey.
Is already recording
Swallow My Cockacino,
Scene 12, take 1.
And action.
I'd like a double espresso, so I could stay up all night,
Cause I'm in the mood to fuck.
I'm Hornista, so I love to fuck.
Would you like to fuck me?
Holy fuck.
You mean, after you're done with your shift?
I mean during my shift.
Keep going, keep going.
With your shaft.
Let us fuck!
Music.
Okay, open up the tamer guys.
Let us see it.
More tongue.
Little less tongue.
See, I told you it's work.
Look, it's amazing.
Incredible.
Pull out of it actually.
No, not you Lester.
Can you slap ass and not be a pervert, dude.
Yeah!
Stir it.
-Hey.
You guys still open?
No.
We close at nine.
I need coffee so I can drive home.
That's a cute kitty.
You guys see the game?
I was at it.
The quarter back was all fucking..
-All night!
- Okay, pall.
Here, on the house!
-I love you, man
- Love you too.
Have a good one, okay?
Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- I said have a good one.
You and your little dog.
-Action!
- Oh, yes!
Oh God, this is good.
Take it!
You take it!
Take it Barry!
-Take it.
- I'm disturbed how turned on I am by this.
Oh shit, there's someone.
Okay, that's a wrap everybody.
Yeah!
Let's give a hand to hottest with the bodies form last night.
Stacey, Lester, Bubbles, Barry.
Okay.
We come back tonight
We finish up the scene and then we get to me and Miri stuff.
Again..
Amazing first night everybody.
Thank you so much.
Let's us fuck.
-Hey, how did it look?
- How do you think it looked?
Looked like shit going in other shit.
What an artist.
That was careless motto: shit going in other shit.
Oh man, I can't believe you gotta work now.
It's okay.
You know what?
Honestly, I don't think I could sleep.
I pretty like pumped up right now.
- Right?
It was amazing.
It was awesome.
I think the cast and crew had a good time.
- We we're getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.
I wanna keep shooting people boning all fucking day.
I don't think I've ever met the ambitious Zack Brown before.
Well, trying to pay the bill so..
It's not a bad thing.
I think it looks good on you.
Come on, hurry!
Wait a minute, you guys never did it before?
It's fine, you know..
We talked about it.
And it's just for the movie.
We're friends, you know.
We're just friends.
We will always just be just friends so..
Listen, I have some extra loop from last night..
I mean, I understand it's hard to get wet when everyone's watching.
At least it was for Barry.
I don't know if I'm gonna need it
- Really?
Yeah, I think I'm just..
Excited.
Of the idea people watching, not because of Zack.
Oh my God.
Zack Brown could never had that effect on me in a million years.
- Hello Miriam.
- Oh, hi..
-Your Face.
- Yeah.
Weird, huh?
I don't think I've seen your face since Senior year.
I think, I made a mistake.
I did it for you, you know, so you didn't get a road rash
During our scene, but I should've asked first.
I look like fucking baloogle whale.
-I think I'll be going now.
- Okay..
All I keep thinking, we should've done a trial run a home.
-Oh my God, right?
- Yeah, I know.
-You're still cool to do it, right?
- Yeah, totally.
-Are you?
- Yeah.
Honestly, I'm a little nervous I guess.
It's..
-It's kind of a big deal.
- It is?
Yeah, you know.
It's..
Our first time together.
Since our auspicious debut on viral video.
-Yeah.
- That's a fuck load of pressure for a director.
As a director?
Please.
What about the anxiety I'm feeling as an actress?
-Then I picked the right project.
- Yeah, right.
What about this follow-up here?
I mean, Julia Roberts followed
Pretty Woman with Sleeping With the Enemy, you know?
I'm following Granny Panties with Swallow My Cockacino.
True.
The only difference is, this movie is about cock sucking
-And her movie just sucked cock.
Period.
- Yeah, the only difference.
The end was pretty rag.
I like that.
She kills them..
- With a gun.
Yeah, it was so awesome.
So I guess we should do this.
I think we should probably wait
Just until I lose another 20-30 pounds.
-Stop it.
You look good.
- Thanks.
So, what about me?
How do I look?
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful so..
I guess it's not a big deal.
But you look amazing.
Okay.
Let's go to make a pointer.
Swallow My Cockacino.
Scene 8, take 1.
Alright, settle.
Action.
Who could it be?
-Hi.
- Hi.
I'm the delivery man, and I have some cream for you.
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.
I work out.
So..
Do you want me to give you your cream now?
I've been waiting for it all day.
-Oops.
- I spilled my cream.
-Do you mind?
- I don't mind.
Especially if you spill it on my face.
Let us fuck!
Let me see them, titties.
Actually, you know what, sorry I don't think we should show 'em.
-What?
- We shouldn't show your breasts.
-Are you gonna take your shirt off?
- I ain't take my shirt off.
I'm just gonna open it actually.
You're not gonna take it off?
Why not?
My tits are bigger than yours for fuck sake.
It'd look weird.
I don't wanna show that.
She's not gonna show her tits?
I shoved my cock in my asshole.
-Where's that delivery?
- I can't believe this.
I was delivering cream and look what's happening.
Jesus, what is that?
A rumba?
-What's a rumba?
- That akword movement.
Should we take your pants off?
- Yeah.
Oh, fuck.
How does this work?
You know what, I'll do it.
I'll do mine.
I'm gonna fuck you with my pecker.
Dude, that's really dirty.
-That's too dirty?
- Yeah, it offends me.
-I'm gonna fuck you with my penis.
- I can't wait.
For my penis.
Be careful, Miri.
Okay.
Just keep rolling.
Fucking cream is coming.
This is the worst porno I've ever seen.
-Get over here, delivery man.
- Let's fuck on these beans.
Just leave 'em.
- It's really distracting.
It's all good?
We'll start kissing on three, okay?
-1, 2, 3.
Go.
-Deacon
- What?
Did you see Lost this week?
I missed it.
What happened?
Oh dude.
They're on the island, they off the island.
Who can follow that shit.
I think they're in hell.
- Would you shut the fuck up.
-Cut.
- That's it?
It's over?
Ain't it supposed to come with titties?
Well, it wasn't what we adjusted but that was nice.
-You were so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack!
Thanks, Lester.
Wasn't just me though guys.
Give it up
For my radiant co-star here, Miri.
Show's over in here.
Let's move it on to a fourth lying scene.
Alright.
Let's do it.
-You look beautiful.
- I thought they would be
-Fucking hard.
- But it was pretty.
-Good job.
- Thanks.
-You're good Mir?
You need anything?
- I'm just gonna take a minute, okay?
-Okay.
I'll just be up there.
- Yeah.
-That was fun.
- Yeah.
Fun..
- Hey, are you alright?
- Yeah.
Just for tonight scene, I'm ready to go when you are though.
You know, before we go..
I'm thinking
It's a good idea if we
Talk about what happened last night.
I mean, we don't have to but..
Okay, yeah.
I kind of dropped the ball in that I guess, huh?
-No, no.
It's..
- To be honest..
It was..
I didn't know how weird it would be for me.
Weird?
Weird like how?
Acting and directing at the same time.
It's a lot to process..
First time I thought my balls didn't have enough hair on them.
-That's not what I meant.
- I know what you meant.
How are you feeling about it?
I guess..
I feel like..
Like we..
-Holy fuck!
- The light is on!
-Did you do this?
- No, I burned the bills how come..
- The water.
Come on, come on.
Yeah!
-We can shower in our home again!
- We got liquid.
Greetings!
Have you heard the good news about
Our Lord of savior Jesus Christ?
Oh my God, did you guys do this?
We got tired of you guys taking showers at our places all the time.
So we took up a collection amongs ourselves.
And shipped away your a mountain of debt.
You guys paid off our massive utilities bills?
How did you afford that?
I stole my old lady's bingo winnings.
And mistress Bubbles did a bachelor party tonight which yours truly
Was a guest star.
Thank you very much.
But don't get too excited, cause we didn't pay off your whole bill
Just a month of each.
And they agreed to turn everything back on?
Yeah nine at night?
How does that work?
Stacey knows somebody that works at power and light.
-You guys..
- This is amazing..
You didn't have to do this.
And you guys didn't have to put us in your movie either.
-Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.
-Or put us in your movie either.
- We said that already.
Guys, honestly..
I don't know what to say.
Well, you could start off by saying we could take tonight off so we could
Have our rap party right now.
Guys, we're not wrapped though.
We still have four days of shootings left.
Um, excuse me.
In my producorial capacity,
I'm shutting the movie down for tonight
So we can get lost silly.
Go, go, go, go!
-Yeah!
- Yes!
Is it just amazing after all those years not knowing?
It was.. weird.
But good.
I have my next scene with Zack tomorrow.
- You don't say?
But I'm little nervous.
-I was thinking about trying to get with him tonight.
- Really?
I mean if you don't mind.
You guys are just friends and all.
So I didn't think it would be a biggie..
It wouldn't be a biggie, would it?
No, no.
It's not a biggie.
Why?
No.
-Are you sure?
- Yes, Stacey.
I'm not married to the guy so..
I don't know.
You guys just looked kind of intimate last night.
-We did?
- Yeah.
Well, we're just better actors than I thought, I think.
You know what?
If you want to get with him, you should just go and ask him.
- He'd be really excited to hear that.
- Yeah?
-Yeah.
- For real?
You don't mind?
Cool.
All the quarters are on the ground.
Come on, you guys playing or what?
Well, I'm bummed.
But I totally get it and it's no problem to work with Lester again.
-He has a nice cock.
- Oh.
Well, you're a trooper Stass.
Oh, but if I start making weird faces during the scene, it's just cause I've been constipated all day.
Oh shit.
We don't have to shoot this scene tonight.
No I want to.
It feels great when you're constipated.
It totally loosens yo up.
I use exlax, but good to know.
Okay.
Never thought I'd have that conversation.
So are we starting with Lester and Stacey tonight,
Cause we were supposed to start with Lester and Miri.
Oh, yeah.
We're not gonna do that anymore.
I don't think Miri's gonna..
wanna..
Do that.
So where are we shooting this?
Over here?
-What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.
Our scene is tonight, right?
Can I talk you for a minute in the back?
Sure.
What do you want me to shoot here, Zack?
Just start with the close-ups of Lester and Stacey.
Give me a second!
What an artist.
Did I do something wrong to you?
-Then why are you here?
- I'm here for the same reason you're here.
To make the movie.
Okay, just like for your own personal information..
You're acting really fucking weird right now.
I'm acting weird?
Cause I think you're acting fucking weird right now.
How exactly am I acting weird?
Well, for one thing, you've been trying to keep me from fucking
Anybody but you since we started this thing.
Maybe, I was thinking about your feelings.
Were you thinking about my feelings last night
When you were banging Stacey, cause that would be really sad for Stacey?
She told me, that you told her that it was okay.
I told it was okay, to ask you.
Holy shit.
I get it!
I fucking get it.
It was a test.
That whole fucking thing was a test.
Is that it?
If it was, how do you think you did?
We had a discussion.
We actually had many discussions..
About how, it was just sex and how we wouldn't let it get weird.
-Then I'm not acting weird.
- No, you're acting like a jealous
-Fucking girl friend is what he fuck you're acting like.
- I'm not your girlfriend.
-Oh, I know that.
- And you're not my boyfriend
So why the fuck are we having this conversation right now?
Because you're about to fuck Lester to spite me!
-It seems like.
- Did you fuck Stacey to spite me?
No, you fucked her just like you fucked every other stupid bitch
And never gave a shit how I felt about it.
-That was before
- Before what?
Don't fucking pretend, that the other night you and me there..
That that didn't mean anything to you.
That you didn't feel it too.
Oh, you're not getting all gooey on me here, are you Zack?
You know what?
If you were any other bitch,
I wouldn't give a rat's ass about, I would tell you to go fuck yourself right now,
Because, I fucking hate this game playing shit.
But you, you mean more to me than that.
So I'm just gonna lay this out on the front street.
I know you feel something big, something real the other night when we were together
Because I felt it too.
We tried to fuck, and instead
We wound out making love.
So if this is it what you need to hear
In order to keep you from fucking Lester.
If this is what you need, fine.
Here it is.
I'm gonna say it.
I love you, Miri.
-Happy?
- Oh Jesus.
You better get hold of yourself, Zack, cause we just fucked.
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?
-But you did.
- You know what..
Oh shit.
What?
Alright guys, don't forget I'm down here watch that pull out, huh?
This is some damn good coffee.
Hey man, where are you going?
- Get the fuck out of here.
We gotta finish this movie.
Can you believe this shit?
-Do you believe this shit?
- What the fuck just happened in there?
I'll tell you what just happened in there..
That chick frosted me, like a fucking cake!
Three Months Later...
Seriously, we shoot the shit out of this bitch.
-Cock shots?
- Cock shots.
We shot you in the balls!
Well, it's my job to get shot in the balls so..
Excuse me..
Didn't you use to work in the Bean-N-Gone coffee shop?
I sure shit hope this pays better, I tell you.
So why don't they just shoot you with a puck?
-What do you mean?
- I mean, what does paintball gotta do with hockey?
Nothing, I guess..
So, ain't no prices or..?
In the balls.
Yeah, they sure are.
It's a living though..
Oh, you get the checks I've been senting you?
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Well, I didn't save you from the brutal tongue lashing though, huh?
Well, you know, the wife never found out about the camera, cause
-I payed off the bills.
- How did you manage that?
-Because now I'm rich.
- No way!
-The post office fucking settled?
-Hundred and sixty large, son.
Nice man!
Congratulations.
It's a beautiful day, thank you very much.
- I thought you made that all thing up.
It's very real, you can believe it.
No, she's spending off.
Well, since you ain't gonna ask me..
I just go ahead and tell you..
No, I have not seen Miri.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.
Oh.
I suppose you weren't gonna ask about your movie either.
Look, that's why I came down here, cause
I need you to come and take a look at it.
-I'm not interested, man
- Well, you better get interested,
Cause you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?
-The story doesn't make sense.
- The story?
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?
It's a movie, dog.
And a movie's gotta have an ending.
-Which we don't have at the moment.
- Credits.
-There's your fucking ending.
- Do me this favor, okay?
When you're done getting your nuts blown off, come back to humble Mornoewill to my crib for couple hours.
Check out the flick, you tell me what's missing.
I'll tell you what.
You do that, you don't know me shit no more.
-Really?
- Really.
-Is your wife home?
- Yes.
Maybe I should leave the patch on, huh?
You got some extra ones?
-Hey honey.
- Where the fuck you've been?
-And who the fuck is this now?
- Would you calm down woman?
God damn!
You already left one white boy down in my basement.
What if that mother fucker was grabby on me?
-Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
- Oh, what in the fuck was that supposed to mean?
!
-Ain't nobody wanna grab on you!
- White boys love me!
White boy?
-I said white boy!
- Yeah?
-You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?
- Should I say yes?
-Say yes.
- Yes.
Why don't you uh..?
Head down stairs..
-It's through this hall way.
- Nice to meet you.
You too.
What the fuck are you looking at?
Why you gotta be up in here yelling at me in front of my director?
-Oh, he's the director?
- Yeah.
I didn't know he's the director.
Okay, well, why don't he direct my ass into a new mother fucking husband.
How about that shit?
Oh, don't nobody want them saggy ass balls!
- Saggy balls?
Look how saggy ass titties you got run around here?
Oh, then mother fucker we match!
Oh shit.
-Where's my paintball gun at?
- Look at you, editor and DP
You got your shit covered, man
Please, don't ever say shit covered to me again.
Roll the film for the man please, so we can see what he thinks.
Just jump to it though, I ain't gotta all night.
The bitch is on me.
Nigga Rich Productions, classy
-Yeah, Dream Works was taken.
- Was it?
Plus it sounds like underground gay fuck club.
"I met a guy at Dream Works" Yeah.
Alright, so we got Lester and Stacey fucking.
And then we got Barry and Bubbles fucking.
And then this boring bullshit.
Okay, just go to the next scene would you?
-Ah, what next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?
-We never shot it.
- Why not?
Because, after you left that night
Miri came out of the back room and said she couldn't do it.
-We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped?
So..
-Wait..
So Miri..?
- Never fucked nobody.
Just you.
Now, I wonder why she did that.
You see, there was the time when I was just a bitter old fuck
Making coffees.
And stacey was just a lap dancer.
And Barry and Bubbles didn't know each other.
And this fool here, hell, I don't even know what he was!
-A white supremacist.
- Ah, fuck you.
Then two people come along
And showed us something, we didn't know existed.
A world of possibilities
Where plain old people, just like us
Can do something special.
Even if it's someone filming people fucking.
Sometimes..
We just need someone to show us something
We can't see for ourselves.
And it will change for ever.
So as you can see, our movie ain't got no ending.
And every movie needs an ending, don't it?
Thanks.
Delaney, you're a slick cupid mother fucker
Ain't love grand?
- Why the fuck is this white boy doing in our God damn house?
Sometimes.
-No, get out!
- I'm sorry..
Close the door for once.
-It was closed over
- Just close the fucking door, Zack
I never slept with Stacey that night, okay?
I swear to God.
But when we got into my room, you know what we did?
We talked about you
And us
And how things were different and how I was too much of a fucking pussy
To just tell you how I felt about you.
And I know, I know that's only because of all the stupid shit we said about how we wouldn't let sex change us, but it did
It changed me.
That has to be love, right?
It has to be love, and..
Just so you know, I can't go back being just friends anymore because..
I just can't.
And I think you feel the same way.
Because that night after I left, you didn't fuck Lester
What's up, Zack?
You know what?
I do not care that you're fucking Lester, okay?
How's that?
Because I don't wanna be with anyone but you
So I will wait for ever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life.
Because I love you and I have for as long as I can remember
And I would rather die than be without you, Miriam Linky.
Miri's lastname is Linky?
You're gonna fuck a guy who doesn't know your lastname?
Or that you beat Cole Rothen in the sixth grade?
- I know that
Or what your senior prom dress would've looked like, had we gone, but we decided not to and we got drunk alone instead.
Or that you wash your hair in the toilet.
-We're not fucking, Zack
- Or that you're not fucking Zack
-What?
- Yeah I mean, I asked her to fuck me but she wouldn't do it.
Then I even tried to talk her in to give me the fucking Dutch Rider
Shut me down on that, too.
-And the Dutch Rider is..?
- You don't know what Dutch Rider is?
Oh look, you grab your dick, and then you have someone else work you arm
Let me show you
You grab my arm, I'll grab my dick You grab my arm now work it.
Work my arm.
See that shit?
Work it up and down.
See?
It's like someone else striking you off.
And of course, there's the double Dutch Rider.
Which I grab my dick, you grab your dick, you work my arm, I'll work your arm.
Same time
Same time, it's like jerking off together but not gay
We're not touching dicks
Each other's dicks anyway, I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.
It feels good.
Try me, come on.
Sorry to change the subject on you Lester, but
If you're not fucking Miri, why is your dick out right now?
Cause I live here now and I like to be naked.
- Huh?
When you moved out, she couldn't afford to pay the rent by herself so I moved in to help.
- But who's keeping her room?
That's my room now, she moved in your old room.
She changed rooms?
Yeah, she said she did it, cause she missed the smell of yours or some shit.
I don't smell anything.
But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.
-Goodnight, Zack
- Good night
Do you?
-Why are you crying?
- Because I missed you so much!
I love you.
-I love you, I love you
- I love you
I don't mean to alarm you, but I think I just jerked off Lester a little bit.
-The Dutch Rider?
- Yeah, it's genius, right?
If you ask me that, I say I will Dutch Rider you for the rest of our lives.
Oh, good.
I'm getting tired of fucking the flash light.
-You fucked it?
- Yeah.
-How did it feel like?
- Feels like fucking a flash light.
You little motherfucker!
Get up, Zack.
Come on, I don't wanna be late for work.
- Ahh!
Get out!
- Jesus, fuck!
Close the door if you're gonna take a shit.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over, it was not closed.
- Close the door, Zack!
- Okay, okay.
- God.
- Fine.
- What's that thing?
- It's a hand warmer.
We're going now.
- You smell that?
Is that the car?
Fuck.
- Oh, goddamn it.
- What?
What?
- Oh, it's wedged in my taint.
- What is?
- It got wedged in my taint.
- What?
- It's stuck under my balls.
- It's between my balls and my leg.
- What's happening?
- Please, pull over.
Pull the fuck over!
- All right, all right!
Jesus, all right!
It's about to move up to my ass.
What?
The movement makes it hotter.
It's tucked under them.
It's stuck under them.
Oh, fuck.
I think I burned my ball hair off.
It's not funny.
Can you help me pick out an outfit for tonight?
I'm working till 6.
- Well, I can try stuff on at the store.
- The store?
No, how about instead, you get a friend?
But you are my friend.
I mean a girl friend, jeez.
Mr. Delaney, can you work for me tomorrow?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
Then you must come in the next day, I tell you.
- It's Black Friday.
- Black Friday?
It's the biggest mall-shopping day of the year.
And since the mall is just up the street, I would like you to come out and work.
- On Black Friday.
- Oh, yeah.
All right, you want me to work on Moolie Monday too?
- I'm sorry?
- How about Nigga Tuesday?
- Nigga Tuesday?
Is this a new holiday?
- You come to a brother and tell him he gotta work on Black Friday.
You got any idea how racist that sounds?
Telling me to work.
What, you think you own me?
- I never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?
You thought,
"I'm gonna lay down the law for this nigga, I put food on his table, clothes on his nigga baby backs, and he ain't gonna say shit. "
- This ain't Amistad.
- You shut up.
You goddamn right this ain't Amistad.
I can't wait till the post office settles my disability suit because then I'm gonna be out this motherfucker.
I'm gonna be Oprah rich.
Y'all can kiss my ass.
You know what?
Fuck you.
Fuck you, and suck cock.
- To hell with you.
- To hell with you.
- Zachary will work.
Zack, my boy.
- Yeah.
- The customer with the harelip...
- Oh, yeah.
- speak me, say you were playing baseball here the other night.
Wiffle ball.
And, uh, no, that wasn't me.
Maybe the harelip makes it sound like "baseball. "
Yeah, maybe you hear with an accent.
- Fuck you, okay?
- Okay.
One day, I'm gonna put a camera over there, and then I can tell...
I'll know everything you do when I'm gone.
Everything.
Scratch your balls, take a shit, everything, I tell you, okay?
Okay.
Fucker.
I hate both of you ebony and ivory motherfuckers, I tell you.
- Why is he so fucking high-strung?
- "Fuck off, I tell you.
Very good. "
Can you believe that Gandhi motherfucker, telling me I gotta work on Black Friday?
Ain't that some shit?
- Yeah.
- Like I don't wanna do shopping.
Biggest sales day of the year.
I'm getting a flat-screen TV, believe that.
That's my fault, I should tell you.
I asked for Friday morning off, I'm sorry.
- For what?
- I actually need a lot of recovery time.
Tonight is me and Miri's ten-year high school reunion.
I'm just gonna get fucking alcohol poisoning.
- Reunion?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
- Isn't that fucked up that they do that?
They say it's the best chance to get everyone together.
People come back in town for the holidays.
But they could have it in the middle of the summer at a blowjob contest that I was judging' and it would still be retarded.
- So why you going, then?
- Miri's making me go.
Why you always bending over backwards for that girl'
- knowing she ain't giving up no ass?
- We got a good thing going.
She pays half the rent, does dishes, she wakes me up in the morning.
Why complicate that with sex?
Besides, man, I've known her since the first grade.
You don't fuck someone you met in the first grade.
Excuse me, I met my wife in kindergarten.
We got married senior year, and she has been the queen of my world ever since.
- What if you could do it all over again?
- I'd jerk off and live by myself.
That woman is the bane of my existence.
- See?
- Excuse me, can I get a coffee, black?
Can't you see we talking, white?
If you're gonna continue to emasculate me with this Barbie dress-up shit'
I'm using your laptop.
Don't forget to smack it when you turn it on, otherwise the screen doesn't come on.
Why don't you spring and get a new one?
Same reason I don't spring for clothes for tonight, I'm broke.
There's a chick who works at Teen Juice at the mall, you know.
I gave her a good deal on yarn,
- so she's letting me borrow this stuff.
- Yo, bro.
What?
- You're buying a vibrator online.
- What's wrong with the one you have?
It died last week.
Look at the size of those fucking panties.
Shoot that shit.
Shoot it.
My God, who even knew Amazon sold shit like this?
This is incredible.
- Those are fucking granny panties.
Okay,
A, I don't appreciate you violating the sanctity of my Amazon Wish List page' and B, I'm not buying that thing from Amazon, because it turns out I don't have a credit card they take.
- Oh, shit.
- I'm sorry, guys.
Am I in the way?
You're a fucking faggot, all right?
Let's go to Starbucks.
- He's a shitty barista anyways.
- Cock.
- And he throws like a bitch.
You know what else I throw?
My nut sack in your coffees, so how did that taste, fucker?
We saw your girlfriend in her underwear, cunt nugget.
Well, too bad she's not my girlfriend, you little fuck...
Oh, they're gone.
Are you still talking to me?
Uh, just said, I'm gonna look up more fuck toys on Amazon.
Oh, holy shit.
- They sell the Fleshlight here too.
- What's that?
It's a fucking pocket pussy that is shaped like a flashlight
"for discretionary jacking off. "
That way if you get caught, no one thinks it's weird.
You're just a guy who likes to fuck his flashlight.
I am totally buying this shit.
Whoa, if you've got money to burn, how about paying the electric bill?
- That's due already?
- November's is probably due now, but I was talking about September's.
Tell me this doesn't rock.
You kind of look like Ronald McDonald.
That makes me want some McNuggets.
Why would you wanna buy a pocket pussy anyway?
That is so sad.
What?
Excuse me, I forgot about the nobility that accompanies coming with a fucking vibrator.
Think a kid in Darfur gets saved every time a vibrator makes you come?
No.
- "Real feel action"?
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
If you start fucking machines, I'm moving out.
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a machine.
How come you get to fuck something with a motor in it?
I've never met a man who can make me come like a vibrator does.
That's bullshit.
You get to be Buck Rogers having sex in the 25th century with fucking Twiki and Dr. Theopolis.
I'm stuck to a bottle of Jergens in the bathroom.
Holy bejesus.
You do not use my Jergens to jack it in our bathroom.
No, you know what I do actually, is I light a bunch of candles and I sprawl out on my sheets and I listen to Sting.
No, I'm a guy.
Give me two Popsicle sticks and a rubber band,
I'll find a way to fuck it, like a filthy MacGyver.
Oh, my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.
How about this?
I don't get why you're putting so much effert into this thing.
I thought we were just gonna go to sit around and make fun of everybody.
I can't wear anything that I already own and expect to bring home Bobby Long.
Bobby fucking Long?
No way.
Didn't that guy call you "Stinky Linky"?
Yeah, that was then, okay?
Maybe now he can save me a fortune in Amazon bills.
Maybe you can fuck our landlord so we can at least keep a roof over our heads.
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.
Hey, I bought skates with last week's paycheck
- and I need those to skate with.
- Oh.
And this week's will barely cover the past two water bills, so...
Is this sexy?
Yeah, in like a To Catch a Predator kind of way, it is pretty fucking sexy.
Then we're done.
What the fuck?
Zack.
- You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?
- They shut it off.
- Oh, shit.
Just, uh...
Help me get this shit out of my hair.
Just use the water out of the toilet.
- There's poo in there.
- Not that part.
- The back part of the toilet thing.
- Oh, that makes sense.
Take the cup there and then scoop it in, there you go.
Here, I'll lean back and you can just' you know, pour it down like...
Like that.
You're harshing my buzz, you know.
This is so lame.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Whoa!
All right, one hour tops, then we're gone.
Or I had an idea.
We could just not go at all, which would rock.
Even though we're broke and we've never amounted to anything, we're still better than these people, right?
No.
Not at all.
We're probably not even as good as most of them, unless one of them is a crackhead or something.
Just tell me I'm prettier than when we graduated.
You look about the same.
Definitely not prettier, but around the same.
I'm thinner, though, right?
A little?
Not really.
Well, good pep talk.
Fuck.
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.
- You don't recognize us, do you?
- Um, no, sorry.
Zack Brown, Miri Linky.
Were you the one they called Stinky Linky?
Oh, no, no one ever called me that.
Oh.
- Great.
What does yours say?
- What the fuck?
Come on.
- I'm sure I had a nickname.
Nothing?
- All right, you have a great time' and before you go, don't forget your copy of The Roving Roe-Ver.
What the fuck's this shit?
That is not shit, that would be our bi-monthly newsletter.
- Awesome.
- It updates you
- on what everyone's doing.
- Finally.
I love your enthusiasm.
Here you go.
Write your e-mail address on that and I'll be sure to add you to our 800-member-strong mailing list.
We had 800 people in our graduating class?
Yes, and only 250 R.S.V.P.'d.
Doesn't that suck, Mary?
- Miri.
- You married, Bets?
- I am.
Two kids.
- Wow, that's beautiful.
- Awesome.
- You wanna fuck me later?
- Uh, no, I'm married.
- Okay, cool.
If you change your mind,
- I'll be in there getting shitfaced.
- He will.
- Just so you know, I eat the pussy.
- He does.
Ah, tempting.
Again, no.
- Shall we?
- Sir.
Bye, Bets.
Think about it.
Enjoy.
Can I get two beers, please?
You want a beer?
- Yeah.
- Three beers.
- Thank you.
- Here you go.
Is that Zack?
Or am I Zack?
Whoa, ho, ho.
Oh, wow.
- Never gets old, huh?
- The other Zack.
Oh, in my world, nobody calls me "the other Zack,"
now that this guy's not around anymore, huh?
- Get the fuck off of me.
- There can be only one.
- What?
- Highlander, man?
The Kurgan.
Remember?
I'd yell it at you whenever we passed each other in the hallway?
Like it was yesterday, man.
Awesome.
Awesome.
Awesome.
God, you guys have so much to catch up on.
Whoo.
- No.
- I'm gonna let you get to it.
Bitch.
Have you seen that big blowup picture they have of me?
Yeah, it's...
My hair is terrible.
I can't believe I even wore my hair like that.
That's before I knew about styling products, you know.
It makes a big difference in life.
But you live and learn, though, right?
I mean, ten years ago, Pittsburgh, who knew anything about fashion?
Back in the day, our hairstyle, oh...
Hey, stranger.
- Whoa.
Stinky Linky.
- Yeah.
Although it's just Miri now.
- Give me a hug.
- Oh, okay.
- Hi, heh, heh, heh.
- Hi.
Wow.
- How have you been?
- Great, great.
- Yeah?
- You look fantastic.
Wow, that is not something that you would have said to me ten years ago.
- Well, I've grown up.
- Yes.
Yes, you have.
You just look...
Ooh, heh, heh.
- Well, listen to you.
Thank you.
- No, don't thank me, just fuck me.
Roxanne.
Hey.
Someone I like, what are the odds' huh?
Zack Brown, we had four years of Spanish together.
Why does no one recognize me?
- Am I thinner?
Is that it?
- Look at him.
- Who?
- My stupid husband.
No fucking shit.
John Butterfield?
You actually married John Butterfield?
- That's amazing.
- Don't ever get married.
It sucks.
You stop appreciating each other and run out of shit to talk about after the first year.
But look at him now, chatty as fuck.
Flirting up a storm with that cheerleader nimrod Monica Von.
You want me to maybe flirt with you so he can see it, even it up a bit?
I don't wanna get even.
If I was gonna do anything, I'd wanna one-up the asshole.
You can give me a handjob in the girls' locker room.
- Fine, but make it fast.
- Fuck, yeah.
Are you staying in town for a while or...?
Just tonight.
I fly back to L.A. tomorrow.
L.A., wow, Los Angeles.
Gosh, Bobby Long, coming up in the world.
- With Mrs. Long, I bet, huh?
- No, no, no.
No Mrs. Long for me.
- Then can I be honest with you?
- Sure.
Um...
Whew.
I think I need a drink.
Do you need a drink?
Because I need a drink to say this.
- I've got a beer already, so...
- Oh, great, thank you.
I think there's a cigarette butt in there.
Yup.
Sorry about the elbow.
There can be only one.
Can I get a beer, please?
Thank you very much.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
My friend's making an ass of herself hitting on her high school crush.
Oh, God, that's so sad.
It's so Miri, is what it is.
I'm Zack, by the way.
Brandon.
Don't worry, we weren't in the same class or anything.
- Okay.
Lucky you.
- Are you a Monroe-ver?
Well, I went here' let's just leave it at that, I guess.
Do you have one of the large blown-up pictures of your younger self
- hanging around here?
- I do, kind of.
Right there.
Gorgeous.
- Good times.
What do you do?
What brings you here?
I came with somebody who went to school here.
- Really?
- Bobby Long.
No shit.
That's who my friend's hitting on right now.
See right there?
- Really.
- One dressed like Hannah Montana?
In L.A., we call that look "Nickelodeon chic. "
- Wait, L.A.?
Los Angeles?
- California.
That's awesome, man.
What do you do out there?
- I'm an actor.
- Wow, that's really impressive.
- Thank you, thank you.
- In fucking movies?
"Fucking movies. " Pretty much.
Look at you.
What...?
Anything I've seen?
What movies?
Oh, all sorts of movies with all-male casts.
All-male casts.
Like Glengarry Glen Ross?
Like that?
Like Glen and Gary Suck Ross' Meaty Cock and Drop Their Hairy Nuts in His Eager Mouth.
- Is that like a sequel?
- Sort of.
- It's a re-imagining.
- Oh, like The Wiz.
More erotic and with less women.
No women, to be exact.
I apologize in advance if I am out of line here, but are you in gay porn?
- Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?
- I thought you recognized me, that's...
- Oh, okay, I get it.
You're not in my demographic' so I'm not insulted.
- Not really.
Who's your demographic?
- Do you love pussy?
- I do.
- Then not you.
Oh, okay.
I came here tonight hoping to seduce you and bring you back to my apartment and sleep with you to, uh, get back at you, you know, for calling me Stinky Linky all those years ago.
Wow.
That is a weird revenge plot.
- You must be a terrible lay for that.
- What?
No, I'm great.
I mean, I've had enough practice and everything.
That...
Wow, that sounded not good.
I fuck a lot.
That's what I meant to say.
That doesn't sound good either.
Wow.
You're a lot funnier than I remember.
Thank you.
Gosh, you turned out to be such a nice guy.
It just...
You know, it makes it even easier to just...
To just say this.
Would you like to come back to my place and maybe open a bottle of wine and have ourselves a real high school reunion?
- I...
- Hello, Miriam.
Beat it, we're talking.
- I wanted to introduce you to Brandon.
- Salutations.
- Bobby's boyfriend.
- Bobby who?
- Bobby me.
- Bobby Long.
Brandon is the star of such adult fare as
- What was that one called again?
You Better Shut Your Mouth or I'm Gonna Fuck It.
That's right.
I'm surprised I forgot that.
Are you fucking with me?
No, they're fucking with each other.
Oh, my God.
- No.
- What?
Granny Panties?
- Excuse me?
- How can you tell?
This is so crazy.
I was literally just watching you, like, right before we got here.
This is so crazy.
This is you, right?
TEEN 1 My name's Granny Panties, and nobody wants to fuck me.
Nothing's whiter than my big gay ass...
Where'd you get that?
Oh, I entered "gay" and "ass," and it was the top hit.
It's had 200,000 views in three hours.
Honey, you are, like...
I'm jealous right now because you're, like, super famous.
Baby, please take our picture.
I get a picture with Granny Panties.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is awesome.
- All right, smile.
Okay, got it.
- Did you get it?
- Oh, thank you very much.
- E-mail me that.
Oh, because he's the worst photographer.
Okay, good.
- You're gay?
- Yeah.
And I'm on the Internet wearing a diaper?
Who knew you'd come to Pittsburgh and meet a celebrity?
I'm gonna binge-drink now until I pass out.
Okay.
She'll be fine.
So you guys suck each other's cocks, huh?
Oh, like crazy.
Okay, that's enough, I think.
I'm embarrassing him.
I love when he's embarrassed.
He's not living out loud, so he gets all like, ooh.
- You are totally in love, aren't you?
- Zachary, we are.
Wow, I...
Oh, God, I just wanna eat him up, yum, yum.
Save some for me, yum, yum, yum.
- I can't keep my hands off him.
- You've had one too many.
Although he does most of the eating in the sack.
In the sack and of the sack.
All right, that's enough.
Look, you've drunk too much.
You do this every time.
You get too Mary for everybody in the room
- and you can't contain yourself.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
And by containing myself, do you mean containing myself in a closet?
In a closet of denial?
Is that...?
No, no, no.
Holy shit, this just got real.
This is exactly why you haven't met my mother.
You don't know how to ease people into this situation.
- You just force your way in every time.
- I thought, maybe for one second in this godforsaken town, I could be myself.
I'm so sorry.
No, you're right, I should just butch up and pretend that I don't love it when you shove your dick in my mouth.
- This is the best night of my life.
Am I making a spectacle?
- I could make a much bigger scene.
- You really are.
I'm sorry.
Pittsburgh.
Listen up, Monroe-vers.
My name is Brandon St. Randy' and I love Bobby Long.
- Fucking A.
- Is that enough?
Is that enough of a scene?
I could start doing worse than that.
The reason you haven't taken me to your mother's...
Your mother with her makeup and all her drinking, she's in the closet too.
- They fight just like real people.
- I thought I'd be a conduit for you-
Thank you.
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm not.
- Thank you.
- I love you.
- I'll e-mail you.
- Zack, it was so nice to meet you.
And I will be patient with you.
I will be there on your journey.
I will be your Sherpa up the mountain of gayness.
Well, might as well see how many hits Granny Panties is up to, huh?
Did I do that?
Thanks, George.
What kind of evil fucks turn off your power the day...?
No, the night before Thanksgiving?
Who does that?
Can you get an advance on your card?
Fleshlight maxed-out my $200 limit.
Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.
This is bad.
If we don't come up with rent, we're gonna get locked out.
Who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.
Which means by the time we get home, there's no heat either.
Well, I think it's time we put what we always talked about into effect.
- You're gonna have to start hooking.
- You know, you jest, but these are the exact circumstances people find themselves in right before they start having sex for money.
- Yeah.
- Or making porn.
Oh, my God, yeah.
- What?
You got an idea?
We could make a porno.
- Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?
No, that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me?
That's a rad idea.
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend, he said he makes a hundred grand a year because he shoots and distributes his own porno flicks.
If it's so easy, how come everybody doesn't do it?
Because other people have options and dignity, which we do not have, which puts us in an amazingly advantageous position.
Fuck you, I have dignity.
Where?
Is it hidden in your gigantic underpants that are plastered all over the Internet?
Is that where you hide your dignity?
Every woman has a pair of those period panties.
That's, like, a fact.
Okay.
Families.
I bet people don't make porno, because they have families.
But luckily, your parents are dead.
Sorry.
My grandparents are dead.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
So who are we gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone mainstream now.
It's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks in it.
Look at Paris Hilton.
She throat-fucks a guy in night vision, now she's selling fragrances to tweens.
And I'm pretty sure she's legally retarded.
That's for tweens?
Have you seen that Joe Francis guy who made Girls Gone Wild?
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot piece of shit in the world and he has a jet and a fucking island.
Look, there's got to be a less extreme solution to our financial woes here.
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper route.
- I don't have a bike.
- Be a waiter.
No one wants me around their food.
Would you eat food that I gave you?
I would not eat food that you gave me, that's true.
I mean, nobody wants to see us fuck, Zack.
Everybody wants to see anybody fuck.
I hate Rosie O'Donnell, but if someone said, "I got a tape of Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid,"
I'd be like, "Why aren't we watching that right now?"
Because she's famous.
Hello.
So are you.
You're fucking Granny Panties.
My underwear and your ass are famous, we're not.
So who the F would wanna watch us fuck?
- At least 800 people.
- The jerks we went to school with?
- Are you serious?
- Of course.
If you heard that someone we graduated with was in a fucking porno movie, you'd watch it, right?
I'd watch that guy Brandon suck a cock, I just met him.
With this mailing list, we have almost a thousand people that would definitely buy a porno we were in just to be like,
"Hey, I sat next to that guy in Civics.
Look at his fucking dick. "
We sell a thousand copies at 20 bucks a pop, bam, we have paid off our bills.
So, what do you think?
- I don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.
Oh, wow, like you've never done that before.
How many guys have you met in a bar, taken home, banged with your mouth and then never talked to again?
That's what we call a stranger.
Dude, I don't one-night mouth-fuck anybody that I pick up in bars.
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in the porno movie for some weird reason.
I guess...
We could fuck.
- Ew.
- Fuck you.
I mean, you're a nice-enough-looking guy and everything...
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're an all-right-enough-looking girl.
- How does that feel?
- Dude, I'm just saying it'd be weird and wrong, you know, like fucking my brother.
Okay, seriously, we're just talking about sex, okay?
It's for a purpose.
It's for getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.
- Wow.
- Just explain to your private beforehand,
"Look, this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash. "
- Oh, my God.
- What?
You're just doing this because you've always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?
Yes.
I've gone my whole life pretending that I want nothing to do with you, just hoping one day we'd be in such dire financial straits that I could use it to finally make my move on you.
You're just being sarcastic.
- I am.
See, I was pretending to cry right there.
I guess it's not like it'd be creepy, like if we got way too drunk one night and accidentally fucked, you know?
No.
We'd be going in with the understanding that it's...
A business decision.
Strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.
- Right.
- And by end,
I mean, I'll be waxing your ass.
Fuck you.
I'm not even letting you see my ass.
I've seen your ass and the rest of you naked around a billion times already.
- That goes both ways, buddy.
- You've never seen my dick.
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.
Are you kidding?
That party we went to where you got blasted, and Houls dared you to give yourself head, and we all watched you try for, like, an hour.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks by the way, for fucking letting me do that.
Thank you.
Oh, God.
We really do know too much about each other.
See, and this would really just be one more thing.
I mean, look at us.
It's Thanksgiving and we're huddled around a flaming fucking garbage can like a couple of steno bums.
I mean, this could give us a chance to pay off our debt, pay our bills, get a fucking nicer apartment with heat in it maybe.
What are you doing?
Miriam Linky, will you have sex with me on camera for money?
I will.
A producer?
Yeah.
- Guy who gets to finance the movie.
- You think I got that kind of money?
We just need that.
What you're about to spend on the flat screen.
Now I can't get my flat screen?
Fuck that.
No, no, no.
With your cut of the profits, you're gonna get two flat screens.
One in your living room, one in your bathroom.
One in the bathroom?
You know, it's always been my dream to watch shit while I shit.
Everyone with an ass loves to watch shit while they shit.
- I'm gonna make that happen for you.
- I don't know, man.
What else the producer do?
- Um, they help with the casting.
- What's casting?
Finding the people to be in the movie.
- I get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.
Like, I can look at a titty, make sure there ain't no moles on there?
- You can look at both titties, man.
- Man.
I've been looking at the same busted titties for the past almost 20 years.
- I'm due for another new titty.
- Please help us.
Please.
Please.
Yes.
Yes.
I love you.
Well, don't mind that smell.
We had some homeless people squatting in here.
You know, they'd void their bowels everywhere but the bathroom.
Anyway, you pick up the poop and you've got yourself a movie studio.
Why don't we shoot in your apartment?
No power.
You wanna pay our electric bill?
- You motherfuckers...
- We'll take it.
Bring it back.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, God.
Come on.
Why the fuck do I have to do everything?
Fuckers.
Hey, what is that?
Fucking guys.
This fucking team, man.
They fucking suck.
I'm gonna hatefuck the shit out of you, ref.
- Dude.
- It's cool.
- He's my cousin.
- Hey.
Didn't you used to videotape the varsity basketball games in high school?
Just the away games.
I did it because I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.
Which one?
Whichever one wanted to fuck the guy who taped the varsity games.
- Aw.
- Still know how to work a camera?
- Who cares what the title is?
- The porn I liked when I was a kid, it was always, like, a spoof of a popular movie, you know?
Like, um, Edward Penishands.
Okay, so we need a mildly clever, vaguely dirty title, that sounds like a real movie
- and sums up what you're gonna see.
- Correct.
An American Werewolf in Brenda?
Fuckback Mountain?
- Too soon?
A Cock-in-Lips Now?
Next.
Cradle the balls.
Work the shaft.
Jerk my come-crayon and let me color you white.
I need cock and I need it now.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
It's "puss" as in pussy.
Oh, because I was like' who would wanna fuck puss?
I want to slam my ham in your can, woman.
Scene.
- This guy is amazing.
- This guy's great-looking too.
I wanna fuck him.
Hi, my name's Delaney and I'm a producer.
I really don't know what it means.
I'm gonna be honest, this is my first time.
You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna touch you or nothing like that.
- All right.
- I have a wife, you know.
We're happy.
I mean, not happy' but it's cool, you know.
Just so you know, there will be some fucking.
- We'll talk about that if you get the part.
- Okay.
I mean, not
- We won't be fucking, there'll be fucking in the movie.
Like I said, I got a wife.
She don't play that shit.
- She is a crazy bitch.
- Yep.
It's my job as the producer to see what you got.
So if that makes you uncomfortable in any way, you don't have to show me anything you don't wanna show me, because...
I love the movies.
- Lawrence of a Labia.
- No.
- Oh, come on.
- Dawn of the Dick.
Yeah, but how are zombies doing it at all sexy?
I want to eat your brain and your ass.
- Dude.
- Sci-fi.
Yeah.
Close Encounters With a Turd From Behind.
- I don't know what that means.
- Just asses.
Fucking deep in asses.
What?
We're making a porno and we just need to know what you would be or would not be interested in doing.
If anything.
- No anal.
- Oh, definitely no anal.
Anal and hugging.
I don't do ass stuff.
- Anal.
- Ah, fuck.
- Oh, wait, oral.
I like anal.
- Yay.
Okay, well, so, uh, do you have any special skills?
Special skills?
I can get a boner really quick and it sticks straight up.
- Is that really a special skill?
- I think.
- Can you show us what you mean?
- Sure.
Oh, that is special.
Yeah, you're hired, Mr....
- Who are you again?
- Lester.
Lester "The Molester" Cockinshtuff.
- No.
- Wow.
That is the best porn name I've ever heard, man.
I can have a porn name?
- Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.
Are you Granny Panties?
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The panties are actually in the house.
- I'll get them.
- Whoa.
- Star Sex 2:
The Wrath of Cunt.
- We never made a Star Sex 1.
I guess we can lose Star Sex 3:
The Search for Cock, then.
- Cocunt.
- What's that?
It's Cocoon with a cunt.
So Delaney tells us you have a special talent of some sort.
I don't know if I'd call it a special talent, but it's a little something I picked up doing bachelor parties.
It would probably be easier if I just showed you.
- Great.
- The floor is yours.
So a movie, huh?
That could be fun.
Holy fuck.
Her name's Bubbles.
- Invasion of the Potty-Snatchers?
- That's like MAD Magazine stupid.
Well, fuck you, okay?
You try to think of a good sci-fi porno title.
It's hard.
There's gotta be one we haven't thought of that would say it all' not be ridiculously filthy and off-putting, and still have instant recognition with our audience.
- I got it.
- I got it.
- Star Whores.
- Yeah.
It's funny, right?
See, we figured this opens us up to an even bigger sales market beyond the people we went to school with.
People who like comics and sci-fi.
Comics?
Like "Ziggy"?
"Ziggy"?
Is that even in fucking papers anymore?
No, man.
Fuck you. "Ziggy" is a comic' right next to "Family Circus. "
No, like Spider-Man and shit, you know?
There's always a shitload of Star Wars nerds at those comic-book shows.
So we sell them a Princess Leia they can really fucking jerk off to.
- That'd be me, Princess Lay-Her.
- Who am I playing?
You, my friend, are the lead role of Lubed Guy-Baller.
Man, he's gonna be balling dudes?
I thought you said this was boys on girls.
If I have to fuck a guy, okay, but I'd rather fuck a girl.
What's wrong with you, boy?
- We'll change the name to Sky-Baller.
- Sky-Baller.
I will be Hung So-low.
Delaney, my friend, you are On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
Man, I can't be in no porno.
My wife will kill me.
Hump me, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
You're my only hump.
On the other hand, fuck my wife.
Unfortunately, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over does not have any sex in the movie but the droids do, I-CUP and R2-T-Bag.
I robot.
And Stacey over here is gonna play Darth Vibrator.
- I'm the bad guy?
- She's not a guy, Zack.
I know that because I'm not a fucking idiot.
In our movie, Darth Vibrator is a bad girl who wants to fuck the galaxy, literally, and it's up to Lubed and Hung to stop her with their cocks.
- You and me get to have sex, then?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- I know.
Isn't that awesome?
Hold up, hold up.
So who's all having sex with who in this movie?
As of last night, I was having sex with Zack.
What?
Han Solo ain't never had no sex with Princess Leia in the Star Wars.
Guys, this isn't a literal adaptation here.
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.
Kind of like The Wiz or like a parody.
With lots of anal.
- Cool.
- I know, isn't that awesome?
I have a question, do Princess Lay-Her and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?
Uh, no, because they're brother and sister, and according to Miri' brothers and sisters can't fuck.
But you said, that this wasn't a literal translation, so that means Lester's character could have sex with Miri's character.
Because I would love to fucking eat her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.
Dream on, pal, it's never gonna happen, okay?
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See, she's fine...
Wait, what?
Yep.
I mean, everyone else is having sex with more than one person in this movie all of a sudden, so I think it's, you know, not fair if I'm only fucking you.
Guys, read amongst yourselves, okay?
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Look, Miri, we got plenty of sex going on in this thing, you don't have to do that.
Zack, it's fine.
I mean I have slept with way worse-looking guys than Lester.
I just wanna do my part for the movie like everyone else.
You're having sex in the movie, you don't need to fuck someone else.
- You're good.
- I'm only fucking you, though.
So don't we need to vary it up to keep it fair?
Fair for...?
I don't...
What?
Fair for who?
What are these, blood diamonds we're talking about?
Fair for everyone else who is fucking more than one person, a. k.a. you, in the movie.
- I mean, fine...
- All right.
I mean, if you don't care...
I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
Fuck.
I don't give a shit.
Like you said, you know, you've fucked bigger idiots than Lester.
Holy shit.
Are we really gonna shoot this in outer space?
Maybe not bigger idiots.
Thank you.
- Cut.
All right, guys, that's it.
- Yeah.
Make sure you leave your costume so we know they're here for tomorrow.
Mostly, everybody, thank you so much for helping us get ready, you know.
Cleaning this place out, building the sets, sewing the costumes, it's just...
I mean, it's really amazing.
Thank you.
Seriously, thanks.
But this is just the beginning, guys.
If Star Whores works, and it will' we are set up for sequels galore.
The Empire Strikes Ass.
- Return of the Brown-Eye.
- The Phantom Man-Ass.
And Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter.
- Okay.
- Revenge of the Shit.
- You got it?
- Yeah, no, we got it.
Ew.
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.
- We'll talk about that one.
We're gonna have a lot of fun' but more importantly, we're gonna make a lot of fucking money, okay?
- Yeah.
- So get ready for greatness, people.
Tomorrow we start principal photography.
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
- All right, good night, you guys.
- We got a movie.
- What?
- Nothing.
I think someone should acknowledge how insane and amazing this is
- and it's all because of you.
- I don't know.
It's just a porno.
You know what I mean.
You've really come into your own.
Shut the fuck up.
So speaking of coming into things' ready for tomorrow?
Twenty years' we're finally gonna know what it's like to have sex with each other.
You say that like you've been wondering what it'd be like to sleep with me for a while now.
Why the fuck do you think I started hanging out with you?
I knew it.
Here, help.
Let's just promise that it's not gonna change anything between us, okay?
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Some guys can't keep sex in perspective.
If anyone's gotta keep this in perspective, it's you, okay?
I don't want you getting all mushy and gooey on me after I give you the best orgasm you've ever had.
Oh, like you know what you're doing down there at all.
I actually don't.
Where's the clitoris?
Is it in your ass?
Just, you know, make sure you kind of whoop it up and act like I'm a stud who knows what he's doing, okay?
Just be a pal.
Oh, dude, I am gonna Meryl Streep the fuck out of this tomorrow, you watch.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
No.
Really, thank you.
For everything.
You're welcome.
Less than 12 hours and we make Monroeville history.
- I really hope nothing goes wrong.
- It's a movie.
What could go wrong?
What are you doing?
What's up?
- What the fuck?
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait.
- Wait.
- Stop.
Stop.
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck is going on?
Condos is what's going on, as soon as this shit-hole's demo'd.
No, you gotta stop it right now.
We rented this place for a month from Mr. Jenkins.
Sounds like your Mr. Jenkins was full of shit.
Luxury Homesteads bought this place a month ago.
I'm gonna kill that lying old fuck.
You're gonna have to go Florida, that's where he moved.
We've got thousands of dollars of equipment in there.
- Please.
- If you wanna sift through this rubble when we're done, be my guest.
Hey, get that fucking beam down.
This is the last thing you wanna hear.
If you don't get an advance,
I don't think we're gonna keep a roof over our heads.
I got an advance already.
It went into all the costumes.
- So all our money's gone?
- All your money?
Never mind what my wife's gonna do when there ain't no new snow tires, or when she sees I charged a video camera.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this, man.
I just wanted to see some free titties.
That's all.
But there's no such thing as free titties, is there, Zack?
- Is there?
- Fuck this noise.
Why don't we get another camera, and shoot something else?
Where are we gonna do that?
Got another sound stage?
Sound stage?
We had a shit-covered garage we turned into a sound stage.
We find someplace new and we do it again.
How?
Okay, I'm broke, man.
No, make that, I was broke.
Now I am really tapped out.
I have to get another job to pay Delaney back.
So please tell me, how can I afford to start over?
- What can I get you?
- Yeah, can I get a, uh...?
Too fucking late.
Cappuccino, 3.50.
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
I mean, I'm a total loser in every single other aspect of my life.
What made me think I could do something as simple as filming people fucking?
We have no money left, nowhere to shoot, no sets, we have no fucking cameras.
Here.
It's time I go back to my regular life where I am a quiet fuckup who doesn't cost anybody any money and knows his goddamn position behind this fucking counter making cappuccinos for this fucking guy.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Fuck, yes.
Zack.
You sneaky Indian motherfucker.
I tell you, yes.
Swallow My Cockuccino.
- What?
- That's it.
That's the movie.
Why didn't I think of it before?
We don't need sets or a stage.
Look at all this production value, waiting to have balls on it.
Hold up.
You wanna shoot a dirty movie here, where we work?
Yes.
Fuck, yes, I do.
You know how many stories I have from working here?
How many times I've been laid right there after hours?
You've never gotten laid here after hours.
I know.
Thank you for reminding me.
But I always wish I had, and that's what porno is.
It's fantasy.
It's taking the normal and making it abnormal by fucking it.
Don't do that.
The little dog don't like that.
How did you get a camera?
By being a terrible, untrustworthy employee, that's how.
Give me today, I'll bang out a script.
Meet me back here after closing.
We're gonna launch arching ropes of jism all over this motherfucker.
Peace.
I like that guy but if he tries to fuck that little dog tonight for real,
I'm calling the Humane Society.
It's called Bean-N-Gone, so get the fuck out of here.
Hey, Barry.
Stand by, Stace, picture's up.
- Okay.
Roll tape.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 12, Take 1.
And action.
I'd like a double espresso so I can stay up all night because I'm in the mood to fuck.
Well, I am a whore-ista, so I love to fuck.
Would you like to fuck me?
Holy fuck.
You mean, after you're done with your shift?
I mean during my shift.
- Sorry.
- Keep going, keep going.
With your shaft.
Let us fuck.
Cue music.
Okay, open up to camera, guys.
Let us see it.
More tongue.
Little less tongue.
Oh, that was good.
Cue effects.
Oh, yeah, like that.
Oh, yeah.
See, I told you it would work.
Didn't I tell you?
It looks amazing.
It's incredible.
Oh, the beans hurt.
Easy.
- Move in for coverage.
- Nice.
That's why we got him.
- Nice.
I'm impressed.
- Get in there, Deacon.
- Come on.
- Like that?
Like that.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
- Pull out a bit, actually.
- That's hot.
No, not you, Lester.
Put it back in.
Kiss the muscle.
- I kiss the muscle.
- You kiss the muscle.
- Can he slap her ass a little?
- Don't be a fucking pervert, dude.
- Stir, come on.
Stir.
- Yeah, stir it.
Stir it, baby.
Hey.
- Holy.
- Shit.
Are you guys still open?
No.
We close at 9.
I need coffee so I'm drive home.
- Okay.
Yeah.
Thank you.
That's a cute kitty.
Okay.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You guys see the game?
I was at it.
Fucking Roethlisberger, the quarterback, was all fucking'
"Hug it, chug it, football.
All night. " Heh-heh.
Okay, pal, here you go.
On the house.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Have a good one.
- Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- I said, have a good one.
Oh.
- Okay.
Keep moving.
You and your little dog.
Go Steelers.
Action.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, like that.
Oh, fuck it, chuck it, football.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, God, this is good.
You take it.
You take it.
Take it, Barry.
Oh, take it.
Take it, Barry.
Take it.
I'm disturbed at how turned on I am by this.
- Shit, dude, it's almost 6.
- Oh, fuck.
Okay, that's a wrap, everybody, yeah.
Let's give a hand to our hotties with the bodies from last night.
Stacey, Lester, Bubbles, Barry, whoo.
Yeah.
Nice.
Okay, when we come back tonight, we finish up the venti-vulva scene, and then we get into me and Miri's stuff.
Again, amazing first night, everybody.
Thank you so much.
Let us fuck.
- Hey, how'd it look?
- How do you think it looked?
It looked like shit going into other shit, in focus.
What an artist.
That was Kurosawa's motto. "Shit going into other shit. "
Oh, man, I can't believe you gotta work now.
It's okay.
You know, honestly, I don't think I could sleep.
- I'm pretty, like, pumped up right now.
- Right?
It was amazing.
It was awesome.
I think the cast and crew had a good time.
- We were getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.
I just wanna keep shooting people boning all day.
I don't think I've ever met the ambitious Zack Brown before.
- Well, I'm trying to pay the bills, so...
- It's not a bad thing.
I think it looks good on you.
Come on, hurry.
Come on, come on, come on.
Wait a minute.
- You guys never did it before?
It's fine.
You know, we talked about it and it's just for the movie.
We're friends, you know' we're just friends.
And we will always just be just friends, so...
Listen, I have some extra lube from last night.
I understand it's kind of hard getting wet when everyone's watching.
At least it was for Barry.
- I don't know if I am gonna need it.
- Really?
Yeah, I think I'm just excited.
Uh-huh.
At the idea of people watching' not because of Zack.
Oh, God.
Zack could never have that effect on me in a million years.
- Hello, Miriam.
- Oh, hey.
Wow.
- Your face.
- Yeah.
Weird, huh?
I don't think I've seen your face since senior year.
I think I made a mistake.
I did it for you so you wouldn't get road rash during our scene, but I should have asked first' I look like a fucking beluga whale.
I think I'll be going now.
Okay.
All I keep thinking is we should've done a trial run at home last week or something.
- Oh, my God.
Right?
- I know.
- You're still cool to do it, though, right?
- Yeah, um.
Totally.
Are you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I'm, uh...
- Honestly, I'm a little nervous, I guess.
- You are?
- It's kind of a big deal.
- It is?
Yeah, you know, it's our first time together since our auspicious debut on viral video.
Oh, yeah.
That's a fuckload of pressure for a director.
As a director, please.
What about the anxiety I'm feeling as an actress?
- Did I pick the right project?
- Yeah.
What about this follow-up?
Julia Roberts followed Pretty Waman with Sleeping With the Enemy.
I'm following Granny Panties with Swallow My Cockuccino.
Only difference is this movie's about cock-sucking and her movie just sucked cock, period.
- The only difference, yeah.
- The end was pretty rad.
I liked that.
- When she kills him.
- With a gun.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- She calls the cops first.
- She calls it in first.
- It was so awesome.
- Awesome, yeah.
So I guess we should do this.
I think we should probably wait just until I lose another 20 or 30 pounds.
Stop it.
You look good.
Thanks.
So, what about me?
How do I look?
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful, so I guess it's not a big deal, but you look amazing.
- Okay.
Let's go make a porno.
- Okay.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 8, Take 1.
- Come here.
- I'm over...?
All right, settle.
Action.
Who could it be?
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm a delivery man and I have some cream for you.
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.
I work out.
So do you want me to give you your cream now?
I've been waiting for it all day.
- Fuck.
Come on.
- Oops.
Keep going.
I spilled my cream.
Do you mind?
I don't mind.
Especially if you spill it on my face.
Let us fuck.
- Fix my shirt.
Think I should?
- Okay.
Let me see them titties.
Actually, you know what?
Sorry, I don't think we should show them.
- What?
- We shouldn't show your breasts.
- Aren't you gonna take your shirt off?
- I'm just gonna open it.
You're not gonna take it off?
Why not?
My tits are bigger than yours.
I don't wanna show that.
She's not gonna show her tits?
I showed my cock and my asshole.
- Okay, I'll do your pants.
- Back and forth. okay.
- Holy shit.
- Where's that delivery?
I can't believe this.
I was delivering cream, and look what's happening.
- Jesus, what is that, a rumba?
- What's a rumba?
That awkward movement.
- Should I take your underpants off?
- Yeah, take them off.
What the fuck?
How does this work?
They're just like...
I'll do it.
- I'll do mine, you just...
You do yours.
- I'll do my pants.
Granny panties.
Just get on with it already.
I'm gonna fuck you with my pecker.
Dude, that's really dirty.
- That's too dirty?
- That offends me.
- Penis?
- Fine.
- I'm gonna fuck you with my penis.
- I can't wait.
For my penis.
Be careful, Miri.
Okay, there we go.
Just keep rolling, keep rolling.
- I'll walk forward.
- Fucking cream is coming.
This is the worst porno I've ever seen.
Get over here, delivery man.
Let's fuck on these beans.
- You okay?
- Yup.
Okay, all right.
- Just leave them.
Just leave them.
- They're really distracting.
- You should leave them.
- You gotta get your...
There you go.
Okay, okay.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.
This okay?
Okay.
Okay, uh.
- We'll start kissing on three, okay?
- Okay.
One, two, three.
Go.
I'm ready.
- I'm ready.
- Okay.
Deacon.
- Deacon.
Deacon.
- What?
Did you see Lost this week, man?
I missed it.
What happened?
They're on the island, off the island.
Who can follow that?
I think they're in hell.
Would you all shut the motherfuck up?
I want you to come.
- I want you to come with me.
- Okay.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Cut.
That's it?
It's over?
Ain't he supposed to come on her titties?
Well, it wasn't what we'd shot-listed' but that was nice.
- It was so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack.
Thanks, Lester, uh.
It wasn't just me, though, guys.
Give it up for my radiant costar here, Miri.
Nice.
- Um, show's over in here.
Let's move out' start lighting the next scene.
- All right.
- Let's do it.
- You looked so beautiful.
- Thanks.
I thought they were gonna be fucking hard.
- It was pretty.
- Pretty don't sell.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
You good, Mir?
You need anything?
I'm just gonna take a minute, okay?
Okay, uh.
I'll just be out there.
Yeah.
- That was fun.
- Yeah, fun.
ZACK "Fun. " You fucking douche.
Wow.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You working on a rewrite?
- Yeah, just for tonight's scene.
- I'm ready to go when you are, though.
- Okay.
You know, before we go, I...
I'm thinking that, uh, it's a good idea if we talk about what happened last night.
- Oh.
- I mean, we don't have to, but I think...
Okay, yeah, uh.
I kind of dropped the ball on that, I guess, huh?
- No, no.
It's...
- To be honest, it was...
You know, I didn't realize how weird it would be for me.
Weird?
Like...
Weird how?
Acting and directing at the same time.
It's a lot to process, you know.
For the first time, I thought my balls didn't have enough hair on them.
That's not what I meant.
I know what you meant.
How you feeling about it?
I guess, um...
I feel like...
Like we...
- Holy fuck.
- The power's on.
Did you do this?
How did this happen?
I burned the bills.
How could we have done that?
- The water.
- The water.
Come on, come on, come on.
Yeah!
- We can shower in our home again.
- We are liquid.
Greetings.
Have you heard the good news about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?
Oh, my God, did you guys do this?
We got tired of you taking showers at our places all the time.
So we took up a collection amongst ourselves.
And chipped away at your mountain of debt.
You guys paid off our massive utilities bills?
- How did you afford that?
- I stole my old lady's bingo winnings.
And Mistress Bubbles did a bachelor party tonight at which yours truly was a guest star, thank you very much.
- Oh.
- Whoa.
Don't get too excited.
We didn't pay off your whole bill.
Just a month of each.
They agreed to turn everything back on?
At 9 at night?
How does that work?
Stacey knows somebody that works at Power and Light.
- You guys...
- This is amazing.
You didn't have to do this.
You didn't have to put us in your movie.
- Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.
- Or put us in your movie either.
- We said that already.
Guys, honestly, I don't know what to say.
You can start by saying we can take tonight off so we can have our wrap party right now.
Guys, we're not wrapped.
We still have four days of shooting left.
Excuse me.
In my "producorial" capacity,
I'm shutting the movie down for a night so we can get a little silly.
Go, go, go.
- Yes.
- Yes.
You all drink.
Was it just amazing with him, after all those years of not knowing?
It was, um, weird.
- But good.
- My scene with Zack's tomorrow.
You don't say.
But I'm a little nervous.
I was thinking about trying to get with him tonight.
- Really?
- I mean, if you don't mind.
You are just friends and all' so I didn't think it would be a biggie.
- It wouldn't be a biggie, would it?
- No.
No, no.
It's not a biggie.
What?
No.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Stacey' I'm not married to the guy, so...
I don't know.
You guys just looked kind of intimate last night.
- We did?
- Yeah.
Well, we're just better actors than I thought, I think, so you know what?
If you wanna get with him' you should just go ask him.
- He'd be really excited to hear that.
- Yeah?
For real, you don't mind?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
All the quarters are on the ground.
- Hey, Stace.
- Hey, Zack.
Come on, are you guys playing or what?
Well, I'm bummed, but I totally get it.
It's no problem to work with Lester again.
He has a nice cock.
Well, you're a trouper, Stace.
Oh, but if I start making weird faces or anything during the scene' it's just because I've been constipated all day.
Oh, shit, uh.
We don't have to shoot the scene tonight.
No, I want to.
Anal's great for when you're constipated.
It totally loosens you up.
I use ex-lax, but good to know.
Okay, I never thought I would have that conversation.
So are we starting with Lester and Stacey tonight?
We were supposed to start with Lester and Miri.
I know.
She...
We're not gonna do that.
I don't think Miri's gonna do that.
Hey.
So where are we shooting this?
Over here?
- What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.
Our scene's tonight, right?
Can I talk to you for a minute in the back?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
What do you want me to shoot here?
Start with the close-ups of Lester and Stacey.
Give me a second, man.
What an artist.
Okay, uh.
Did I do something wrong to you?
No.
Then why are you here?
I'm here for the same reason you're here.
To make the movie.
Okay, just, like' for your own personal information, you're acting really weird right now.
I'm acting weird?
I think you're acting weird right now.
Oh, I'm acting...
How exactly am I acting weird?
You've been trying to keep me from fucking anybody but you since we started this thing.
Maybe I was thinking about your feelings.
Were you thinking of my feelings when you were banging Stacey?
Because that'd be really sad for Stacey.
She told me that you told her that that was okay.
I told her that it was okay to ask you.
Holy shit.
I get it.
I fucking get it.
It was a test.
That whole thing was a fucking test, is that it?
If it was, how do you think you did?
We had a discussion, Miri.
We had...
Actually, we had many discussions about how it was just sex
- and how we wouldn't let it get weird.
- I'm not acting weird.
You're acting like a jealous girlfriend is what the fuck you're acting like.
- I am not your girlfriend.
- I know that.
You're not my boyfriend, so why are we having this conversation right now?
Because you're about to fuck Lester to spite me, it seems like.
Did you fuck Stacey to spite me?
No.
You fucked her like you fucked every other bitch and never gave a shit how I felt about it.
- Well, that was before.
- Before what?
Look, don't fucking pretend that the other night, you and me, right there, that that didn't mean anything to you, that you didn't feel it too.
Oh.
You're not getting all gooey on me here, are you, Zack?
You know what?
If you were any other bitch I didn't give a rat's ass about,
I would tell you to go fuck yourself right now because I fucking hate this game-playing shit.
But you, you mean more to me than that' so I'm just gonna lay this out on front street.
I know you felt something big, something real the other night when we were together because I felt it too.
We tried to fuck and instead, we wound up making love.
So if this is what you need to hear in order to keep you from fucking Lester, if this is what you need, then fine.
Here it is, I'm gonna say it.
I love you, Miri.
Happy?
Oh, Jesus.
You better get a hold of yourself, Zack, because we just fucked.
Okay.
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?
But you did.
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.
Wait...
All right, don't forget I'm down here.
Watch that pullout, huh?
Yeah.
Mmm.
This is some damn good coffee.
- Where you going?
- Getting the fuck out of here.
We gotta finish this movie.
Yo!
You believe this shit?
Do you believe this shit?
What the fuck just happened in there?
I'll tell you what just happened in there.
That chick frosted me like I was a fucking cake.
Zack.
Okay, seriously' get a picture of me right now.
I'm hunting humans.
- Dude, check it out.
Ooh.
- Oh, shit.
Seriously, let's shoot the shit out of this bitch.
- Where you aiming at?
- Cock shots?
Cock shots.
We shot you in the balls, cunt nugget.
Well, it's my job to get shot in the balls, so...
Oh, they're gone.
Excuse me.
Didn't you used to work at the Bean-N-Gone in Monroeville?
I sure as shit hope this pays better, I tell you.
So why don't they just shoot you with a puck?
What do you mean?
I mean, what does paintball got to do with hockey?
Nothing, I guess.
- So ain't no prizes or...?
- No, no.
So, what are they paying $5 for?
To shoot a Broad Street Bully in the balls.
White people are fucked up.
Yup, they sure are.
It's a living.
You've been getting the checks I've been sending?
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Probably didn't save you from a brutal tongue-lashing, though, huh?
You know, the wife never found out about the camera, because I paid off the bills.
How did you manage that?
- Because now I'm Oprah rich.
- No way.
- The post office fucking settled?
- Hundred-sixty large, son.
- Nice, man.
Congratulations.
- A beautiful day, thank you very much.
I thought you made that whole thing up.
No, no.
It was very real.
You can believe it.
Even though she's spending all of it.
Well, since you ain't gonna ask me, I'll just go ahead and tell you.
- No, I have not seen Miri.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.
Oh, I suppose you weren't gonna ask about your movie, neither?
Look, that's why I came down here.
I need you to come take a look at it.
- I'm not interested.
Sorry.
- You'd better get interested
- because you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?
The story doesn't make sense.
- The story?
- The story doesn't make sense.
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?
It's a movie, dog, and a movie's gotta have an ending, which we don't have at the moment.
Come shot, credits.
There's your fucking ending.
Do me this favor, okay?
When you're done getting your nuts blown off' come back to humble Monroeville to my crib for a couple hours' check out the flick, you tell me what's missing.
No.
I'll tell you what, you do that, you don't owe me shit no more.
- Really?
- Really.
- Is your wife home?
- Yes.
- Maybe I should leave the pads on.
- You got some extra ones?
Hey, honey.
Where the fuck you been?
And who in the fuck is this now?
Would you calm down, woman?
Goddamn.
You already left one white boy down in my basement while you off gallivanting and shit.
What if this motherfucker
- was all grabby on me?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
Oh, what in the fuck is that supposed to mean?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
- White boys love me.
White boy.
- I said, white boy.
- Yeah?
You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?
- Should I say yes?
- Just say yes.
Yeah.
- Why don't you, uh, head downstairs?
- Oh, okay.
It's just through this hallway.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
What the fuck you looking at?
Why you gotta be yelling at me in front of my director?
- Oh, he's a director?
- Yeah.
I didn't know that.
Shit, he's a director.
Well, why don't he direct my ass to a new husband?
How about that shit?
- That's the bedroom.
Keep talking, maybe he will.
Oh, don't nobody want them saggy-ass balls!
Saggy balls?
Look at these sagging-ass titties you got around here.
- You could tie these together.
- Motherfucker, we match.
Oh, shit.
Where's my paintball gun at?
Look at you, editor and DP.
You got your shit covered, man.
Please, don't ever say "shit-covered" to me again.
Roll the film for the man, please, so we can see what he thinks.
Just jump through it.
I ain't got all night.
The bitch is on me.
"Nigga Rich Productions. " Classy.
- Yeah, DreamWorks was taken.
- Was it?
Plus, it sounds like an underground gay fuck club.
"I met a guy at DreamWorks. " Yeah.
All right, so we got Lester and Stacey fucking.
Then we got Barry and Bubbles fucking.
And then this boring bullshit.
Okay, just, uh, go to the next scene, would you?
Uh...
- What next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?
We never shot it.
- Why not?
- Because after you left that night,
Miri came out of the backroom and said she couldn't do it.
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped?
So...
- Wait, so Miri...
- Never fucked nobody.
Just you.
Now, I wonder why she did that.
- Hm.
- Hm.
You see, there was a time when I was just a bitter old fuck making coffees, and Stacey was just a lap dancer and Barry and Bubbles didn't know each other and this fool here, hell, I don't even know what he was.
- A white supremacist.
- Man, fuck you.
Then two people come along and showed us something we didn't know existed.
A world of possibilities where plain old people just like us could do something special.
Even if it's something as simple as filming people fucking.
Sometimes we just need someone to show us something we can't see for ourselves
and then we're changed forever.
So as you can see' our movie ain't got no ending.
Every movie needs an ending' don't it?
Peace.
Delaney, you're a slick cupid motherfucker.
Ain't love grand?
Why the fuck is this white boy running through my goddamn house?
Sometimes.
Miri.
- Miri.
- Zack?
Miri.
I'm sorry.
Get out.
- Close the door.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over...
- Just close the fucking door, Zack.
I never slept with Stacey that night, okay?
I swear to God.
When we got into my room, you know what we did?
We talked about you, and us and how things were different and how I was too much of a fucking pussy to just tell you how I felt about you.
And I know...
I know that that's only because of all the stupid shit we said about how we wouldn't let sex change us, but it did.
It changed me.
That has to be love, right?
It has to be love and just so you know, I can't go back to being just friends anymore,
- because I just can't.
- Good.
And I think...
I think that you feel the same way.
Because that night after I left, you didn't fuck Lester.
What's up, Zack?
You know what?
I don't care that you're fucking Lester, okay?
How's that?
- Oh, shit.
- I don't wanna be with anyone but you.
So I will wait forever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life because I love you, and I have for as long as I can remember.
And I would rather die than be without you, Miriam Linky.
Miri's last name is Linky?
You're gonna fuck a guy who doesn't know your last name?
Or that you beat up Carl Roth in the sixth grade?
I know that.
Or what your senior prom dress would've looked like had we gone but we decided not to, and we got drunk alone instead.
Or that you washed your hair in the toilet.
We're not fucking, Zack.
Or that you're not fucking Zack...
What?
I asked her to fuck me.
She wouldn't do it.
I even tried to talk her into giving me the fucking Dutch rudder.
Shot me down on that too.
- And a Dutch rudder is?
- Don't know what a Dutch rudder...?
All right, you grab your dick, then you have someone else work your arm.
Here, let me show you.
All right, grab my arm.
I'm grabbing my dick, you're grabbing my arm.
Now work it.
Work my arm.
See that shit?
Work it up and down.
It's like someone else is jerking you off.
Okay.
There's the double Dutch rudder, which, I grab my dick, you grab your dick, you work my arm, I work your arm' same time.
It's like jerking off together but not gay.
We're not touching dicks, each other's dicks anyway.
I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.
It feels good, sir.
Try me, come on.
Sorry to change the subject on you, Lester, but if you're not fucking Miri, why is your dick out right now?
Because I live here now, and I like to be naked.
- What?
- When you moved out, she couldn't afford to pay her rent by herself, so I moved in to help.
But you just came out of her room.
That's my room now.
She moved in your old room.
Wait, wait, wait.
She changed rooms?
Yeah, she said she did it because she missed the smell of you or some shit.
I don't smell anything.
But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.
- Night, Zack.
- Night.
Do you?
Then why are you crying?
Because I missed you so much.
Me too.
I love you.
- I love you, I love you.
I love you.
I don't mean to alarm you but I think I just jerked off Lester a little bit.
- The Dutch rudder?
- Yeah, it's ingenious, right?
If you ask me nicely, I will Dutch-rudder you the rest of our lives.
Good.
I'm getting tired of fucking the Fleshlight.
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.
- What'd it feel like?
- Like fucking a flashlight.
- Wrong room.
- Oh, God.
That's gross.
Let us fuck.
Hello.
Welcome to Nigga Rich Productions' home of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, the production house for the couple looking to put a little spice in their sex life.
- Shall we take a look around?
- Fuck me so hard.
Oh, God.
First, you'll meet for a consultation with one of our romance-ologists, who'll coach you through that initial awkward stage before you're camera-ready.
So we will start off with some erotic massage and some...
Dude.
Some light petting.
That sounds good.
Are you guys sure you don't wanna do some, uh, butt-sack work too?
- Uh, let's move on, shall we?
- Why?
From their break-out hit, Swallow My Cockuccino, to the multi-million selling Swallow My Cockuccino II and the award-winning Star Whores saga, including Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter,
Zack and Miri have proven time and again that they know how to shoot hot sex.
As an actor, I've sometimes brought my work home with me inappropriately.
When you're telling your real-life lover in the bedroom' to, you know, bend over while you cake your hand in K-Y, it is a sign that the romance is dead, I think.
Then we turned to the professionals at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
Oh, my God, they totally saved our civil union.
They filmed what was inside of us and not what was coming out of us necessarily.
It helped me see his asshole as not just a come dumpster, but a sign of his beauty, his flower.
It became a, uh, gorgeous orchid.
Orchids grow in sort of the filthiest conditions.
That's what his asshole became to me.
This beautiful flower amidst shit.
- Honey, they get the metaphor.
- I don't think they do.
Let's just say, thank you to Zack and Miri.
It's helped us out, it's helped our friends.
Enrique?
Park?
Park?
Enrique?
Can we get a little love for Zack and Miri?
They don't even know what's going on, they're so pilled up.
But don't take his word for it.
Just ask our co-founders.
- Hi.
I'm Miri Linky Brown.
- I'm Zack Linky Brown.
Here at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, we're dedicated
- to committing your love...
- Or lust.
- to high-end, quality production digital video.
A forever keepsake of your passion.
That's right, Miri.
Why set up a camera at the end of your bed and settle for one unflattering angle, when you could let the professionals dazzle and delight your senses with an array of shots so masterfully rendered you'll swear Martin Scorsese snuck into your room
and caught you fucking?
And remember' we're not just the presidents of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
We're also clients.
Call now to set up your appointment
Way to fuck, Zack.
You little motherfucker!
Get up, Zack.
Come on, I don't wanna be late for work.
- Ahh!
Get out!
- Jesus, fuck!
Close the door if you're gonna take a shit.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over, it was not closed.
- Close the door, Zack!
- Okay, okay.
- God.
- Fine.
- What's that thing?
- It's a hand warmer.
We're going now.
- You smell that?
Is that the car?
Fuck.
- Oh, goddamn it.
- What?
What?
- Oh, it's wedged in my taint.
- What is?
- It got wedged in my taint.
- What?
- It's stuck under my balls.
- It's between my balls and my leg.
- What's happening?
- Please, pull over.
Pull the fuck over!
- All right, all right!
Jesus, all right!
It's about to move up to my ass.
What?
The movement makes it hotter.
It's tucked under them.
It's stuck under them.
Oh, fuck.
I think I burned my ball hair off.
It's not funny.
Can you help me pick out an outfit for tonight?
I'm working till 6.
- Well, I can try stuff on at the store.
- The store?
No, how about instead, you get a friend?
But you are my friend.
I mean a girl friend, jeez.
Mr. Delaney, can you work for me tomorrow?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
Then you must come in the next day, I tell you.
- It's Black Friday.
- Black Friday?
It's the biggest mall-shopping day of the year.
And since the mall is just up the street, I would like you to come out and work.
- On Black Friday.
- Oh, yeah.
All right, you want me to work on Moolie Monday too?
- I'm sorry?
- How about Nigga Tuesday?
- Nigga Tuesday?
Is this a new holiday?
- You come to a brother and tell him he gotta work on Black Friday.
You got any idea how racist that sounds?
Telling me to work.
What, you think you own me?
- I never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?
You thought,
"I'm gonna lay down the law for this nigga, I put food on his table, clothes on his nigga baby backs, and he ain't gonna say shit. "
- This ain't Amistad.
- You shut up.
You goddamn right this ain't Amistad.
I can't wait till the post office settles my disability suit because then I'm gonna be out this motherfucker.
I'm gonna be Oprah rich.
Y'all can kiss my ass.
You know what?
Fuck you.
Fuck you, and suck cock.
- To hell with you.
- To hell with you.
- Zachary will work.
Zack, my boy.
- Yeah.
- The customer with the harelip...
- Oh, yeah.
- speak me, say you were playing baseball here the other night.
Wiffle ball.
And, uh, no, that wasn't me.
Maybe the harelip makes it sound like "baseball. "
Yeah, maybe you hear with an accent.
- Fuck you, okay?
- Okay.
One day, I'm gonna put a camera over there, and then I can tell...
I'll know everything you do when I'm gone.
Everything.
Scratch your balls, take a shit, everything, I tell you, okay?
Okay.
Fucker.
I hate both of you ebony and ivory motherfuckers, I tell you.
- Why is he so fucking high-strung?
- "Fuck off, I tell you.
Very good. "
Can you believe that Gandhi motherfucker, telling me I gotta work on Black Friday?
Ain't that some shit?
- Yeah.
- Like I don't wanna do shopping.
Biggest sales day of the year.
I'm getting a flat-screen TV, believe that.
That's my fault, I should tell you.
I asked for Friday morning off, I'm sorry.
- For what?
- I actually need a lot of recovery time.
Tonight is me and Miri's ten-year high school reunion.
I'm just gonna get fucking alcohol poisoning.
- Reunion?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
- Isn't that fucked up that they do that?
They say it's the best chance to get everyone together.
People come back in town for the holidays.
But they could have it in the middle of the summer at a blowjob contest that I was judging' and it would still be retarded.
- So why you going, then?
- Miri's making me go.
Why you always bending over backwards for that girl'
- knowing she ain't giving up no ass?
- We got a good thing going.
She pays half the rent, does dishes, she wakes me up in the morning.
Why complicate that with sex?
Besides, man, I've known her since the first grade.
You don't fuck someone you met in the first grade.
Excuse me, I met my wife in kindergarten.
We got married senior year, and she has been the queen of my world ever since.
- What if you could do it all over again?
- I'd jerk off and live by myself.
That woman is the bane of my existence.
- See?
- Excuse me, can I get a coffee, black?
Can't you see we talking, white?
If you're gonna continue to emasculate me with this Barbie dress-up shit'
I'm using your laptop.
Don't forget to smack it when you turn it on, otherwise the screen doesn't come on.
Why don't you spring and get a new one?
Same reason I don't spring for clothes for tonight, I'm broke.
There's a chick who works at Teen Juice at the mall, you know.
I gave her a good deal on yarn,
- so she's letting me borrow this stuff.
- Yo, bro.
What?
- You're buying a vibrator online.
- What's wrong with the one you have?
It died last week.
Look at the size of those fucking panties.
Shoot that shit.
Shoot it.
My God, who even knew Amazon sold shit like this?
This is incredible.
- Those are fucking granny panties.
Okay,
A, I don't appreciate you violating the sanctity of my Amazon Wish List page' and B, I'm not buying that thing from Amazon, because it turns out I don't have a credit card they take.
- Oh, shit.
- I'm sorry, guys.
Am I in the way?
You're a fucking faggot, all right?
Let's go to Starbucks.
- He's a shitty barista anyways.
- Cock.
- And he throws like a bitch.
You know what else I throw?
My nut sack in your coffees, so how did that taste, fucker?
We saw your girlfriend in her underwear, cunt nugget.
Well, too bad she's not my girlfriend, you little fuck...
Oh, they're gone.
Are you still talking to me?
Uh, just said, I'm gonna look up more fuck toys on Amazon.
Oh, holy shit.
- They sell the Fleshlight here too.
- What's that?
It's a fucking pocket pussy that is shaped like a flashlight
"for discretionary jacking off. "
That way if you get caught, no one thinks it's weird.
You're just a guy who likes to fuck his flashlight.
I am totally buying this shit.
Whoa, if you've got money to burn, how about paying the electric bill?
- That's due already?
- November's is probably due now, but I was talking about September's.
Tell me this doesn't rock.
You kind of look like Ronald McDonald.
That makes me want some McNuggets.
Why would you wanna buy a pocket pussy anyway?
That is so sad.
What?
Excuse me, I forgot about the nobility that accompanies coming with a fucking vibrator.
Think a kid in Darfur gets saved every time a vibrator makes you come?
No.
- "Real feel action"?
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
If you start fucking machines, I'm moving out.
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a machine.
How come you get to fuck something with a motor in it?
I've never met a man who can make me come like a vibrator does.
That's bullshit.
You get to be Buck Rogers having sex in the 25th century with fucking Twiki and Dr. Theopolis.
I'm stuck to a bottle of Jergens in the bathroom.
Holy bejesus.
You do not use my Jergens to jack it in our bathroom.
No, you know what I do actually, is I light a bunch of candles and I sprawl out on my sheets and I listen to Sting.
No, I'm a guy.
Give me two Popsicle sticks and a rubber band,
I'll find a way to fuck it, like a filthy MacGyver.
Oh, my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.
How about this?
I don't get why you're putting so much effert into this thing.
I thought we were just gonna go to sit around and make fun of everybody.
I can't wear anything that I already own and expect to bring home Bobby Long.
Bobby fucking Long?
No way.
Didn't that guy call you "Stinky Linky"?
Yeah, that was then, okay?
Maybe now he can save me a fortune in Amazon bills.
Maybe you can fuck our landlord so we can at least keep a roof over our heads.
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.
Hey, I bought skates with last week's paycheck
- and I need those to skate with.
- Oh.
And this week's will barely cover the past two water bills, so...
Is this sexy?
Yeah, in like a To Catch a Predator kind of way, it is pretty fucking sexy.
Then we're done.
What the fuck?
Zack.
- You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?
- They shut it off.
- Oh, shit.
Just, uh...
Help me get this shit out of my hair.
Just use the water out of the toilet.
- There's poo in there.
- Not that part.
- The back part of the toilet thing.
- Oh, that makes sense.
Take the cup there and then scoop it in, there you go.
Here, I'll lean back and you can just' you know, pour it down like...
Like that.
You're harshing my buzz, you know.
This is so lame.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Whoa!
All right, one hour tops, then we're gone.
Or I had an idea.
We could just not go at all, which would rock.
Even though we're broke and we've never amounted to anything, we're still better than these people, right?
No.
Not at all.
We're probably not even as good as most of them, unless one of them is a crackhead or something.
Just tell me I'm prettier than when we graduated.
You look about the same.
Definitely not prettier, but around the same.
I'm thinner, though, right?
A little?
Not really.
Well, good pep talk.
Fuck.
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.
- You don't recognize us, do you?
- Um, no, sorry.
Zack Brown, Miri Linky.
Were you the one they called Stinky Linky?
Oh, no, no one ever called me that.
Oh.
- Great.
What does yours say?
- What the fuck?
Come on.
- I'm sure I had a nickname.
Nothing?
- All right, you have a great time' and before you go, don't forget your copy of The Roving Roe-Ver.
What the fuck's this shit?
That is not shit, that would be our bi-monthly newsletter.
- Awesome.
- It updates you
- on what everyone's doing.
- Finally.
I love your enthusiasm.
Here you go.
Write your e-mail address on that and I'll be sure to add you to our 800-member-strong mailing list.
We had 800 people in our graduating class?
Yes, and only 250 R.S.V.P.'d.
Doesn't that suck, Mary?
- Miri.
- You married, Bets?
- I am.
Two kids.
- Wow, that's beautiful.
- Awesome.
- You wanna fuck me later?
- Uh, no, I'm married.
- Okay, cool.
If you change your mind,
- I'll be in there getting shitfaced.
- He will.
- Just so you know, I eat the pussy.
- He does.
Ah, tempting.
Again, no.
- Shall we?
- Sir.
Bye, Bets.
Think about it.
Enjoy.
Can I get two beers, please?
You want a beer?
- Yeah.
- Three beers.
- Thank you.
- Here you go.
Is that Zack?
Or am I Zack?
Whoa, ho, ho.
Oh, wow.
- Never gets old, huh?
- The other Zack.
Oh, in my world, nobody calls me "the other Zack,"
now that this guy's not around anymore, huh?
- Get the fuck off of me.
- There can be only one.
- What?
- Highlander, man?
The Kurgan.
Remember?
I'd yell it at you whenever we passed each other in the hallway?
Like it was yesterday, man.
Awesome.
Awesome.
Awesome.
God, you guys have so much to catch up on.
Whoo.
- No.
- I'm gonna let you get to it.
Bitch.
Have you seen that big blowup picture they have of me?
Yeah, it's...
My hair is terrible.
I can't believe I even wore my hair like that.
That's before I knew about styling products, you know.
It makes a big difference in life.
But you live and learn, though, right?
I mean, ten years ago, Pittsburgh, who knew anything about fashion?
Back in the day, our hairstyle, oh...
Hey, stranger.
- Whoa.
Stinky Linky.
- Yeah.
Although it's just Miri now.
- Give me a hug.
- Oh, okay.
- Hi, heh, heh, heh.
- Hi.
Wow.
- How have you been?
- Great, great.
- Yeah?
- You look fantastic.
Wow, that is not something that you would have said to me ten years ago.
- Well, I've grown up.
- Yes.
Yes, you have.
You just look...
Ooh, heh, heh.
- Well, listen to you.
Thank you.
- No, don't thank me, just fuck me.
Roxanne.
Hey.
Someone I like, what are the odds' huh?
Zack Brown, we had four years of Spanish together.
Why does no one recognize me?
- Am I thinner?
Is that it?
- Look at him.
- Who?
- My stupid husband.
No fucking shit.
John Butterfield?
You actually married John Butterfield?
- That's amazing.
- Don't ever get married.
It sucks.
You stop appreciating each other and run out of shit to talk about after the first year.
But look at him now, chatty as fuck.
Flirting up a storm with that cheerleader nimrod Monica Von.
You want me to maybe flirt with you so he can see it, even it up a bit?
I don't wanna get even.
If I was gonna do anything, I'd wanna one-up the asshole.
You can give me a handjob in the girls' locker room.
- Fine, but make it fast.
- Fuck, yeah.
Are you staying in town for a while or...?
Just tonight.
I fly back to L.A. tomorrow.
L.A., wow, Los Angeles.
Gosh, Bobby Long, coming up in the world.
- With Mrs. Long, I bet, huh?
- No, no, no.
No Mrs. Long for me.
- Then can I be honest with you?
- Sure.
Um...
Whew.
I think I need a drink.
Do you need a drink?
Because I need a drink to say this.
- I've got a beer already, so...
- Oh, great, thank you.
I think there's a cigarette butt in there.
Yup.
Sorry about the elbow.
There can be only one.
Can I get a beer, please?
Thank you very much.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
My friend's making an ass of herself hitting on her high school crush.
Oh, God, that's so sad.
It's so Miri, is what it is.
I'm Zack, by the way.
Brandon.
Don't worry, we weren't in the same class or anything.
- Okay.
Lucky you.
- Are you a Monroe-ver?
Well, I went here' let's just leave it at that, I guess.
Do you have one of the large blown-up pictures of your younger self
- hanging around here?
- I do, kind of.
Right there.
Gorgeous.
- Good times.
What do you do?
What brings you here?
I came with somebody who went to school here.
- Really?
- Bobby Long.
No shit.
That's who my friend's hitting on right now.
See right there?
- Really.
- One dressed like Hannah Montana?
In L.A., we call that look "Nickelodeon chic. "
- Wait, L.A.?
Los Angeles?
- California.
That's awesome, man.
What do you do out there?
- I'm an actor.
- Wow, that's really impressive.
- Thank you, thank you.
- In fucking movies?
"Fucking movies. " Pretty much.
Look at you.
What...?
Anything I've seen?
What movies?
Oh, all sorts of movies with all-male casts.
All-male casts.
Like Glengarry Glen Ross?
Like that?
Like Glen and Gary Suck Ross' Meaty Cock and Drop Their Hairy Nuts in His Eager Mouth.
- Is that like a sequel?
- Sort of.
- It's a re-imagining.
- Oh, like The Wiz.
More erotic and with less women.
No women, to be exact.
I apologize in advance if I am out of line here, but are you in gay porn?
- Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?
- I thought you recognized me, that's...
- Oh, okay, I get it.
You're not in my demographic' so I'm not insulted.
- Not really.
Who's your demographic?
- Do you love pussy?
- I do.
- Then not you.
Oh, okay.
I came here tonight hoping to seduce you and bring you back to my apartment and sleep with you to, uh, get back at you, you know, for calling me Stinky Linky all those years ago.
Wow.
That is a weird revenge plot.
- You must be a terrible lay for that.
- What?
No, I'm great.
I mean, I've had enough practice and everything.
That...
Wow, that sounded not good.
I fuck a lot.
That's what I meant to say.
That doesn't sound good either.
Wow.
You're a lot funnier than I remember.
Thank you.
Gosh, you turned out to be such a nice guy.
It just...
You know, it makes it even easier to just...
To just say this.
Would you like to come back to my place and maybe open a bottle of wine and have ourselves a real high school reunion?
- I...
- Hello, Miriam.
Beat it, we're talking.
- I wanted to introduce you to Brandon.
- Salutations.
- Bobby's boyfriend.
- Bobby who?
- Bobby me.
- Bobby Long.
Brandon is the star of such adult fare as
- What was that one called again?
You Better Shut Your Mouth or I'm Gonna Fuck It.
That's right.
I'm surprised I forgot that.
Are you fucking with me?
No, they're fucking with each other.
Oh, my God.
- No.
- What?
Granny Panties?
- Excuse me?
- How can you tell?
This is so crazy.
I was literally just watching you, like, right before we got here.
This is so crazy.
This is you, right?
TEEN 1 My name's Granny Panties, and nobody wants to fuck me.
Nothing's whiter than my big gay ass...
Where'd you get that?
Oh, I entered "gay" and "ass," and it was the top hit.
It's had 200,000 views in three hours.
Honey, you are, like...
I'm jealous right now because you're, like, super famous.
Baby, please take our picture.
I get a picture with Granny Panties.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is awesome.
- All right, smile.
Okay, got it.
- Did you get it?
- Oh, thank you very much.
- E-mail me that.
Oh, because he's the worst photographer.
Okay, good.
- You're gay?
- Yeah.
And I'm on the Internet wearing a diaper?
Who knew you'd come to Pittsburgh and meet a celebrity?
I'm gonna binge-drink now until I pass out.
Okay.
She'll be fine.
So you guys suck each other's cocks, huh?
Oh, like crazy.
Okay, that's enough, I think.
I'm embarrassing him.
I love when he's embarrassed.
He's not living out loud, so he gets all like, ooh.
- You are totally in love, aren't you?
- Zachary, we are.
Wow, I...
Oh, God, I just wanna eat him up, yum, yum.
Save some for me, yum, yum, yum.
- I can't keep my hands off him.
- You've had one too many.
Although he does most of the eating in the sack.
In the sack and of the sack.
All right, that's enough.
Look, you've drunk too much.
You do this every time.
You get too Mary for everybody in the room
- and you can't contain yourself.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
And by containing myself, do you mean containing myself in a closet?
In a closet of denial?
Is that...?
No, no, no.
Holy shit, this just got real.
This is exactly why you haven't met my mother.
You don't know how to ease people into this situation.
- You just force your way in every time.
- I thought, maybe for one second in this godforsaken town, I could be myself.
I'm so sorry.
No, you're right, I should just butch up and pretend that I don't love it when you shove your dick in my mouth.
- This is the best night of my life.
Am I making a spectacle?
- I could make a much bigger scene.
- You really are.
I'm sorry.
Pittsburgh.
Listen up, Monroe-vers.
My name is Brandon St. Randy' and I love Bobby Long.
- Fucking A.
- Is that enough?
Is that enough of a scene?
I could start doing worse than that.
The reason you haven't taken me to your mother's...
Your mother with her makeup and all her drinking, she's in the closet too.
- They fight just like real people.
- I thought I'd be a conduit for you-
Thank you.
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm not.
- Thank you.
- I love you.
- I'll e-mail you.
- Zack, it was so nice to meet you.
And I will be patient with you.
I will be there on your journey.
I will be your Sherpa up the mountain of gayness.
Well, might as well see how many hits Granny Panties is up to, huh?
Did I do that?
Thanks, George.
What kind of evil fucks turn off your power the day...?
No, the night before Thanksgiving?
Who does that?
Can you get an advance on your card?
Fleshlight maxed-out my $200 limit.
Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.
This is bad.
If we don't come up with rent, we're gonna get locked out.
Who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.
Which means by the time we get home, there's no heat either.
Well, I think it's time we put what we always talked about into effect.
- You're gonna have to start hooking.
- You know, you jest, but these are the exact circumstances people find themselves in right before they start having sex for money.
- Yeah.
- Or making porn.
Oh, my God, yeah.
- What?
You got an idea?
We could make a porno.
- Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?
No, that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me?
That's a rad idea.
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend, he said he makes a hundred grand a year because he shoots and distributes his own porno flicks.
If it's so easy, how come everybody doesn't do it?
Because other people have options and dignity, which we do not have, which puts us in an amazingly advantageous position.
Fuck you, I have dignity.
Where?
Is it hidden in your gigantic underpants that are plastered all over the Internet?
Is that where you hide your dignity?
Every woman has a pair of those period panties.
That's, like, a fact.
Okay.
Families.
I bet people don't make porno, because they have families.
But luckily, your parents are dead.
Sorry.
My grandparents are dead.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
So who are we gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone mainstream now.
It's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks in it.
Look at Paris Hilton.
She throat-fucks a guy in night vision, now she's selling fragrances to tweens.
And I'm pretty sure she's legally retarded.
That's for tweens?
Have you seen that Joe Francis guy who made Girls Gone Wild?
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot piece of shit in the world and he has a jet and a fucking island.
Look, there's got to be a less extreme solution to our financial woes here.
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper route.
- I don't have a bike.
- Be a waiter.
No one wants me around their food.
Would you eat food that I gave you?
I would not eat food that you gave me, that's true.
I mean, nobody wants to see us fuck, Zack.
Everybody wants to see anybody fuck.
I hate Rosie O'Donnell, but if someone said, "I got a tape of Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid,"
I'd be like, "Why aren't we watching that right now?"
Because she's famous.
Hello.
So are you.
You're fucking Granny Panties.
My underwear and your ass are famous, we're not.
So who the F would wanna watch us fuck?
- At least 800 people.
- The jerks we went to school with?
- Are you serious?
- Of course.
If you heard that someone we graduated with was in a fucking porno movie, you'd watch it, right?
I'd watch that guy Brandon suck a cock, I just met him.
With this mailing list, we have almost a thousand people that would definitely buy a porno we were in just to be like,
"Hey, I sat next to that guy in Civics.
Look at his fucking dick. "
We sell a thousand copies at 20 bucks a pop, bam, we have paid off our bills.
So, what do you think?
- I don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.
Oh, wow, like you've never done that before.
How many guys have you met in a bar, taken home, banged with your mouth and then never talked to again?
That's what we call a stranger.
Dude, I don't one-night mouth-fuck anybody that I pick up in bars.
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in the porno movie for some weird reason.
I guess...
We could fuck.
- Ew.
- Fuck you.
I mean, you're a nice-enough-looking guy and everything...
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're an all-right-enough-looking girl.
- How does that feel?
- Dude, I'm just saying it'd be weird and wrong, you know, like fucking my brother.
Okay, seriously, we're just talking about sex, okay?
It's for a purpose.
It's for getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.
- Wow.
- Just explain to your private beforehand,
"Look, this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash. "
- Oh, my God.
- What?
You're just doing this because you've always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?
Yes.
I've gone my whole life pretending that I want nothing to do with you, just hoping one day we'd be in such dire financial straits that I could use it to finally make my move on you.
You're just being sarcastic.
- I am.
See, I was pretending to cry right there.
I guess it's not like it'd be creepy, like if we got way too drunk one night and accidentally fucked, you know?
No.
We'd be going in with the understanding that it's...
A business decision.
Strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.
- Right.
- And by end,
I mean, I'll be waxing your ass.
Fuck you.
I'm not even letting you see my ass.
I've seen your ass and the rest of you naked around a billion times already.
- That goes both ways, buddy.
- You've never seen my dick.
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.
Are you kidding?
That party we went to where you got blasted, and Houls dared you to give yourself head, and we all watched you try for, like, an hour.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks by the way, for fucking letting me do that.
Thank you.
Oh, God.
We really do know too much about each other.
See, and this would really just be one more thing.
I mean, look at us.
It's Thanksgiving and we're huddled around a flaming fucking garbage can like a couple of steno bums.
I mean, this could give us a chance to pay off our debt, pay our bills, get a fucking nicer apartment with heat in it maybe.
What are you doing?
Miriam Linky, will you have sex with me on camera for money?
I will.
A producer?
Yeah.
- Guy who gets to finance the movie.
- You think I got that kind of money?
We just need that.
What you're about to spend on the flat screen.
Now I can't get my flat screen?
Fuck that.
No, no, no.
With your cut of the profits, you're gonna get two flat screens.
One in your living room, one in your bathroom.
One in the bathroom?
You know, it's always been my dream to watch shit while I shit.
Everyone with an ass loves to watch shit while they shit.
- I'm gonna make that happen for you.
- I don't know, man.
What else the producer do?
- Um, they help with the casting.
- What's casting?
Finding the people to be in the movie.
- I get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.
Like, I can look at a titty, make sure there ain't no moles on there?
- You can look at both titties, man.
- Man.
I've been looking at the same busted titties for the past almost 20 years.
- I'm due for another new titty.
- Please help us.
Please.
Please.
Yes.
Yes.
I love you.
Well, don't mind that smell.
We had some homeless people squatting in here.
You know, they'd void their bowels everywhere but the bathroom.
Anyway, you pick up the poop and you've got yourself a movie studio.
Why don't we shoot in your apartment?
No power.
You wanna pay our electric bill?
- You motherfuckers...
- We'll take it.
Bring it back.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, God.
Come on.
Why the fuck do I have to do everything?
Fuckers.
Hey, what is that?
Fucking guys.
This fucking team, man.
They fucking suck.
I'm gonna hatefuck the shit out of you, ref.
- Dude.
- It's cool.
- He's my cousin.
- Hey.
Didn't you used to videotape the varsity basketball games in high school?
Just the away games.
I did it because I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.
Which one?
Whichever one wanted to fuck the guy who taped the varsity games.
- Aw.
- Still know how to work a camera?
- Who cares what the title is?
- The porn I liked when I was a kid, it was always, like, a spoof of a popular movie, you know?
Like, um, Edward Penishands.
Okay, so we need a mildly clever, vaguely dirty title, that sounds like a real movie
- and sums up what you're gonna see.
- Correct.
An American Werewolf in Brenda?
Fuckback Mountain?
- Too soon?
A Cock-in-Lips Now?
Next.
Cradle the balls.
Work the shaft.
Jerk my come-crayon and let me color you white.
I need cock and I need it now.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
It's "puss" as in pussy.
Oh, because I was like' who would wanna fuck puss?
I want to slam my ham in your can, woman.
Scene.
- This guy is amazing.
- This guy's great-looking too.
I wanna fuck him.
Hi, my name's Delaney and I'm a producer.
I really don't know what it means.
I'm gonna be honest, this is my first time.
You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna touch you or nothing like that.
- All right.
- I have a wife, you know.
We're happy.
I mean, not happy' but it's cool, you know.
Just so you know, there will be some fucking.
- We'll talk about that if you get the part.
- Okay.
I mean, not
- We won't be fucking, there'll be fucking in the movie.
Like I said, I got a wife.
She don't play that shit.
- She is a crazy bitch.
- Yep.
It's my job as the producer to see what you got.
So if that makes you uncomfortable in any way, you don't have to show me anything you don't wanna show me, because...
I love the movies.
- Lawrence of a Labia.
- No.
- Oh, come on.
- Dawn of the Dick.
Yeah, but how are zombies doing it at all sexy?
I want to eat your brain and your ass.
- Dude.
- Sci-fi.
Yeah.
Close Encounters With a Turd From Behind.
- I don't know what that means.
- Just asses.
Fucking deep in asses.
What?
We're making a porno and we just need to know what you would be or would not be interested in doing.
If anything.
- No anal.
- Oh, definitely no anal.
Anal and hugging.
I don't do ass stuff.
- Anal.
- Ah, fuck.
- Oh, wait, oral.
I like anal.
- Yay.
Okay, well, so, uh, do you have any special skills?
Special skills?
I can get a boner really quick and it sticks straight up.
- Is that really a special skill?
- I think.
- Can you show us what you mean?
- Sure.
Oh, that is special.
Yeah, you're hired, Mr....
- Who are you again?
- Lester.
Lester "The Molester" Cockinshtuff.
- No.
- Wow.
That is the best porn name I've ever heard, man.
I can have a porn name?
- Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.
Are you Granny Panties?
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The panties are actually in the house.
- I'll get them.
- Whoa.
- Star Sex 2:
The Wrath of Cunt.
- We never made a Star Sex 1.
I guess we can lose Star Sex 3:
The Search for Cock, then.
- Cocunt.
- What's that?
It's Cocoon with a cunt.
So Delaney tells us you have a special talent of some sort.
I don't know if I'd call it a special talent, but it's a little something I picked up doing bachelor parties.
It would probably be easier if I just showed you.
- Great.
- The floor is yours.
So a movie, huh?
That could be fun.
Holy fuck.
Her name's Bubbles.
- Invasion of the Potty-Snatchers?
- That's like MAD Magazine stupid.
Well, fuck you, okay?
You try to think of a good sci-fi porno title.
It's hard.
There's gotta be one we haven't thought of that would say it all' not be ridiculously filthy and off-putting, and still have instant recognition with our audience.
- I got it.
- I got it.
- Star Whores.
- Yeah.
It's funny, right?
See, we figured this opens us up to an even bigger sales market beyond the people we went to school with.
People who like comics and sci-fi.
Comics?
Like "Ziggy"?
"Ziggy"?
Is that even in fucking papers anymore?
No, man.
Fuck you. "Ziggy" is a comic' right next to "Family Circus. "
No, like Spider-Man and shit, you know?
There's always a shitload of Star Wars nerds at those comic-book shows.
So we sell them a Princess Leia they can really fucking jerk off to.
- That'd be me, Princess Lay-Her.
- Who am I playing?
You, my friend, are the lead role of Lubed Guy-Baller.
Man, he's gonna be balling dudes?
I thought you said this was boys on girls.
If I have to fuck a guy, okay, but I'd rather fuck a girl.
What's wrong with you, boy?
- We'll change the name to Sky-Baller.
- Sky-Baller.
I will be Hung So-low.
Delaney, my friend, you are On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
Man, I can't be in no porno.
My wife will kill me.
Hump me, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
You're my only hump.
On the other hand, fuck my wife.
Unfortunately, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over does not have any sex in the movie but the droids do, I-CUP and R2-T-Bag.
I robot.
And Stacey over here is gonna play Darth Vibrator.
- I'm the bad guy?
- She's not a guy, Zack.
I know that because I'm not a fucking idiot.
In our movie, Darth Vibrator is a bad girl who wants to fuck the galaxy, literally, and it's up to Lubed and Hung to stop her with their cocks.
- You and me get to have sex, then?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- I know.
Isn't that awesome?
Hold up, hold up.
So who's all having sex with who in this movie?
As of last night, I was having sex with Zack.
What?
Han Solo ain't never had no sex with Princess Leia in the Star Wars.
Guys, this isn't a literal adaptation here.
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.
Kind of like The Wiz or like a parody.
With lots of anal.
- Cool.
- I know, isn't that awesome?
I have a question, do Princess Lay-Her and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?
Uh, no, because they're brother and sister, and according to Miri' brothers and sisters can't fuck.
But you said, that this wasn't a literal translation, so that means Lester's character could have sex with Miri's character.
Because I would love to fucking eat her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.
Dream on, pal, it's never gonna happen, okay?
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See, she's fine...
Wait, what?
Yep.
I mean, everyone else is having sex with more than one person in this movie all of a sudden, so I think it's, you know, not fair if I'm only fucking you.
Guys, read amongst yourselves, okay?
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Look, Miri, we got plenty of sex going on in this thing, you don't have to do that.
Zack, it's fine.
I mean I have slept with way worse-looking guys than Lester.
I just wanna do my part for the movie like everyone else.
You're having sex in the movie, you don't need to fuck someone else.
- You're good.
- I'm only fucking you, though.
So don't we need to vary it up to keep it fair?
Fair for...?
I don't...
What?
Fair for who?
What are these, blood diamonds we're talking about?
Fair for everyone else who is fucking more than one person, a. k.a. you, in the movie.
- I mean, fine...
- All right.
I mean, if you don't care...
I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
Fuck.
I don't give a shit.
Like you said, you know, you've fucked bigger idiots than Lester.
Holy shit.
Are we really gonna shoot this in outer space?
Maybe not bigger idiots.
Thank you.
- Cut.
All right, guys, that's it.
- Yeah.
Make sure you leave your costume so we know they're here for tomorrow.
Mostly, everybody, thank you so much for helping us get ready, you know.
Cleaning this place out, building the sets, sewing the costumes, it's just...
I mean, it's really amazing.
Thank you.
Seriously, thanks.
But this is just the beginning, guys.
If Star Whores works, and it will' we are set up for sequels galore.
The Empire Strikes Ass.
- Return of the Brown-Eye.
- The Phantom Man-Ass.
And Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter.
- Okay.
- Revenge of the Shit.
- You got it?
- Yeah, no, we got it.
Ew.
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.
- We'll talk about that one.
We're gonna have a lot of fun' but more importantly, we're gonna make a lot of fucking money, okay?
- Yeah.
- So get ready for greatness, people.
Tomorrow we start principal photography.
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
- All right, good night, you guys.
- We got a movie.
- What?
- Nothing.
I think someone should acknowledge how insane and amazing this is
- and it's all because of you.
- I don't know.
It's just a porno.
You know what I mean.
You've really come into your own.
Shut the fuck up.
So speaking of coming into things' ready for tomorrow?
Twenty years' we're finally gonna know what it's like to have sex with each other.
You say that like you've been wondering what it'd be like to sleep with me for a while now.
Why the fuck do you think I started hanging out with you?
I knew it.
Here, help.
Let's just promise that it's not gonna change anything between us, okay?
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Some guys can't keep sex in perspective.
If anyone's gotta keep this in perspective, it's you, okay?
I don't want you getting all mushy and gooey on me after I give you the best orgasm you've ever had.
Oh, like you know what you're doing down there at all.
I actually don't.
Where's the clitoris?
Is it in your ass?
Just, you know, make sure you kind of whoop it up and act like I'm a stud who knows what he's doing, okay?
Just be a pal.
Oh, dude, I am gonna Meryl Streep the fuck out of this tomorrow, you watch.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
No.
Really, thank you.
For everything.
You're welcome.
Less than 12 hours and we make Monroeville history.
- I really hope nothing goes wrong.
- It's a movie.
What could go wrong?
What are you doing?
What's up?
- What the fuck?
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait.
- Wait.
- Stop.
Stop.
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck is going on?
Condos is what's going on, as soon as this shit-hole's demo'd.
No, you gotta stop it right now.
We rented this place for a month from Mr. Jenkins.
Sounds like your Mr. Jenkins was full of shit.
Luxury Homesteads bought this place a month ago.
I'm gonna kill that lying old fuck.
You're gonna have to go Florida, that's where he moved.
We've got thousands of dollars of equipment in there.
- Please.
- If you wanna sift through this rubble when we're done, be my guest.
Hey, get that fucking beam down.
This is the last thing you wanna hear.
If you don't get an advance,
I don't think we're gonna keep a roof over our heads.
I got an advance already.
It went into all the costumes.
- So all our money's gone?
- All your money?
Never mind what my wife's gonna do when there ain't no new snow tires, or when she sees I charged a video camera.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this, man.
I just wanted to see some free titties.
That's all.
But there's no such thing as free titties, is there, Zack?
- Is there?
- Fuck this noise.
Why don't we get another camera, and shoot something else?
Where are we gonna do that?
Got another sound stage?
Sound stage?
We had a shit-covered garage we turned into a sound stage.
We find someplace new and we do it again.
How?
Okay, I'm broke, man.
No, make that, I was broke.
Now I am really tapped out.
I have to get another job to pay Delaney back.
So please tell me, how can I afford to start over?
- What can I get you?
- Yeah, can I get a, uh...?
Too fucking late.
Cappuccino, 3.50.
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
I mean, I'm a total loser in every single other aspect of my life.
What made me think I could do something as simple as filming people fucking?
We have no money left, nowhere to shoot, no sets, we have no fucking cameras.
Here.
It's time I go back to my regular life where I am a quiet fuckup who doesn't cost anybody any money and knows his goddamn position behind this fucking counter making cappuccinos for this fucking guy.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Fuck, yes.
Zack.
You sneaky Indian motherfucker.
I tell you, yes.
Swallow My Cockuccino.
- What?
- That's it.
That's the movie.
Why didn't I think of it before?
We don't need sets or a stage.
Look at all this production value, waiting to have balls on it.
Hold up.
You wanna shoot a dirty movie here, where we work?
Yes.
Fuck, yes, I do.
You know how many stories I have from working here?
How many times I've been laid right there after hours?
You've never gotten laid here after hours.
I know.
Thank you for reminding me.
But I always wish I had, and that's what porno is.
It's fantasy.
It's taking the normal and making it abnormal by fucking it.
Don't do that.
The little dog don't like that.
How did you get a camera?
By being a terrible, untrustworthy employee, that's how.
Give me today, I'll bang out a script.
Meet me back here after closing.
We're gonna launch arching ropes of jism all over this motherfucker.
Peace.
I like that guy but if he tries to fuck that little dog tonight for real,
I'm calling the Humane Society.
It's called Bean-N-Gone, so get the fuck out of here.
Hey, Barry.
Stand by, Stace, picture's up.
- Okay.
Roll tape.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 12, Take 1.
And action.
I'd like a double espresso so I can stay up all night because I'm in the mood to fuck.
Well, I am a whore-ista, so I love to fuck.
Would you like to fuck me?
Holy fuck.
You mean, after you're done with your shift?
I mean during my shift.
- Sorry.
- Keep going, keep going.
With your shaft.
Let us fuck.
Cue music.
Okay, open up to camera, guys.
Let us see it.
More tongue.
Little less tongue.
Oh, that was good.
Cue effects.
Oh, yeah, like that.
Oh, yeah.
See, I told you it would work.
Didn't I tell you?
It looks amazing.
It's incredible.
Oh, the beans hurt.
Easy.
- Move in for coverage.
- Nice.
That's why we got him.
- Nice.
I'm impressed.
- Get in there, Deacon.
- Come on.
- Like that?
Like that.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
- Pull out a bit, actually.
- That's hot.
No, not you, Lester.
Put it back in.
Kiss the muscle.
- I kiss the muscle.
- You kiss the muscle.
- Can he slap her ass a little?
- Don't be a fucking pervert, dude.
- Stir, come on.
Stir.
- Yeah, stir it.
Stir it, baby.
Hey.
- Holy.
- Shit.
Are you guys still open?
No.
We close at 9.
I need coffee so I'm drive home.
- Okay.
Yeah.
Thank you.
That's a cute kitty.
Okay.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You guys see the game?
I was at it.
Fucking Roethlisberger, the quarterback, was all fucking'
"Hug it, chug it, football.
All night. " Heh-heh.
Okay, pal, here you go.
On the house.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Have a good one.
- Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- I said, have a good one.
Oh.
- Okay.
Keep moving.
You and your little dog.
Go Steelers.
Action.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, like that.
Oh, fuck it, chuck it, football.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, God, this is good.
You take it.
You take it.
Take it, Barry.
Oh, take it.
Take it, Barry.
Take it.
I'm disturbed at how turned on I am by this.
- Shit, dude, it's almost 6.
- Oh, fuck.
Okay, that's a wrap, everybody, yeah.
Let's give a hand to our hotties with the bodies from last night.
Stacey, Lester, Bubbles, Barry, whoo.
Yeah.
Nice.
Okay, when we come back tonight, we finish up the venti-vulva scene, and then we get into me and Miri's stuff.
Again, amazing first night, everybody.
Thank you so much.
Let us fuck.
- Hey, how'd it look?
- How do you think it looked?
It looked like shit going into other shit, in focus.
What an artist.
That was Kurosawa's motto. "Shit going into other shit. "
Oh, man, I can't believe you gotta work now.
It's okay.
You know, honestly, I don't think I could sleep.
- I'm pretty, like, pumped up right now.
- Right?
It was amazing.
It was awesome.
I think the cast and crew had a good time.
- We were getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.
I just wanna keep shooting people boning all day.
I don't think I've ever met the ambitious Zack Brown before.
- Well, I'm trying to pay the bills, so...
- It's not a bad thing.
I think it looks good on you.
Come on, hurry.
Come on, come on, come on.
Wait a minute.
- You guys never did it before?
It's fine.
You know, we talked about it and it's just for the movie.
We're friends, you know' we're just friends.
And we will always just be just friends, so...
Listen, I have some extra lube from last night.
I understand it's kind of hard getting wet when everyone's watching.
At least it was for Barry.
- I don't know if I am gonna need it.
- Really?
Yeah, I think I'm just excited.
Uh-huh.
At the idea of people watching' not because of Zack.
Oh, God.
Zack could never have that effect on me in a million years.
- Hello, Miriam.
- Oh, hey.
Wow.
- Your face.
- Yeah.
Weird, huh?
I don't think I've seen your face since senior year.
I think I made a mistake.
I did it for you so you wouldn't get road rash during our scene, but I should have asked first' I look like a fucking beluga whale.
I think I'll be going now.
Okay.
All I keep thinking is we should've done a trial run at home last week or something.
- Oh, my God.
Right?
- I know.
- You're still cool to do it, though, right?
- Yeah, um.
Totally.
Are you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I'm, uh...
- Honestly, I'm a little nervous, I guess.
- You are?
- It's kind of a big deal.
- It is?
Yeah, you know, it's our first time together since our auspicious debut on viral video.
Oh, yeah.
That's a fuckload of pressure for a director.
As a director, please.
What about the anxiety I'm feeling as an actress?
- Did I pick the right project?
- Yeah.
What about this follow-up?
Julia Roberts followed Pretty Waman with Sleeping With the Enemy.
I'm following Granny Panties with Swallow My Cockuccino.
Only difference is this movie's about cock-sucking and her movie just sucked cock, period.
- The only difference, yeah.
- The end was pretty rad.
I liked that.
- When she kills him.
- With a gun.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- She calls the cops first.
- She calls it in first.
- It was so awesome.
- Awesome, yeah.
So I guess we should do this.
I think we should probably wait just until I lose another 20 or 30 pounds.
Stop it.
You look good.
Thanks.
So, what about me?
How do I look?
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful, so I guess it's not a big deal, but you look amazing.
- Okay.
Let's go make a porno.
- Okay.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 8, Take 1.
- Come here.
- I'm over...?
All right, settle.
Action.
Who could it be?
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm a delivery man and I have some cream for you.
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.
I work out.
So do you want me to give you your cream now?
I've been waiting for it all day.
- Fuck.
Come on.
- Oops.
Keep going.
I spilled my cream.
Do you mind?
I don't mind.
Especially if you spill it on my face.
Let us fuck.
- Fix my shirt.
Think I should?
- Okay.
Let me see them titties.
Actually, you know what?
Sorry, I don't think we should show them.
- What?
- We shouldn't show your breasts.
- Aren't you gonna take your shirt off?
- I'm just gonna open it.
You're not gonna take it off?
Why not?
My tits are bigger than yours.
I don't wanna show that.
She's not gonna show her tits?
I showed my cock and my asshole.
- Okay, I'll do your pants.
- Back and forth. okay.
- Holy shit.
- Where's that delivery?
I can't believe this.
I was delivering cream, and look what's happening.
- Jesus, what is that, a rumba?
- What's a rumba?
That awkward movement.
- Should I take your underpants off?
- Yeah, take them off.
What the fuck?
How does this work?
They're just like...
I'll do it.
- I'll do mine, you just...
You do yours.
- I'll do my pants.
Granny panties.
Just get on with it already.
I'm gonna fuck you with my pecker.
Dude, that's really dirty.
- That's too dirty?
- That offends me.
- Penis?
- Fine.
- I'm gonna fuck you with my penis.
- I can't wait.
For my penis.
Be careful, Miri.
Okay, there we go.
Just keep rolling, keep rolling.
- I'll walk forward.
- Fucking cream is coming.
This is the worst porno I've ever seen.
Get over here, delivery man.
Let's fuck on these beans.
- You okay?
- Yup.
Okay, all right.
- Just leave them.
Just leave them.
- They're really distracting.
- You should leave them.
- You gotta get your...
There you go.
Okay, okay.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.
This okay?
Okay.
Okay, uh.
- We'll start kissing on three, okay?
- Okay.
One, two, three.
Go.
I'm ready.
- I'm ready.
- Okay.
Deacon.
- Deacon.
Deacon.
- What?
Did you see Lost this week, man?
I missed it.
What happened?
They're on the island, off the island.
Who can follow that?
I think they're in hell.
Would you all shut the motherfuck up?
I want you to come.
- I want you to come with me.
- Okay.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Cut.
That's it?
It's over?
Ain't he supposed to come on her titties?
Well, it wasn't what we'd shot-listed' but that was nice.
- It was so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack.
Thanks, Lester, uh.
It wasn't just me, though, guys.
Give it up for my radiant costar here, Miri.
Nice.
- Um, show's over in here.
Let's move out' start lighting the next scene.
- All right.
- Let's do it.
- You looked so beautiful.
- Thanks.
I thought they were gonna be fucking hard.
- It was pretty.
- Pretty don't sell.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
You good, Mir?
You need anything?
I'm just gonna take a minute, okay?
Okay, uh.
I'll just be out there.
Yeah.
- That was fun.
- Yeah, fun.
ZACK "Fun. " You fucking douche.
Wow.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You working on a rewrite?
- Yeah, just for tonight's scene.
- I'm ready to go when you are, though.
- Okay.
You know, before we go, I...
I'm thinking that, uh, it's a good idea if we talk about what happened last night.
- Oh.
- I mean, we don't have to, but I think...
Okay, yeah, uh.
I kind of dropped the ball on that, I guess, huh?
- No, no.
It's...
- To be honest, it was...
You know, I didn't realize how weird it would be for me.
Weird?
Like...
Weird how?
Acting and directing at the same time.
It's a lot to process, you know.
For the first time, I thought my balls didn't have enough hair on them.
That's not what I meant.
I know what you meant.
How you feeling about it?
I guess, um...
I feel like...
Like we...
- Holy fuck.
- The power's on.
Did you do this?
How did this happen?
I burned the bills.
How could we have done that?
- The water.
- The water.
Come on, come on, come on.
Yeah!
- We can shower in our home again.
- We are liquid.
Greetings.
Have you heard the good news about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?
Oh, my God, did you guys do this?
We got tired of you taking showers at our places all the time.
So we took up a collection amongst ourselves.
And chipped away at your mountain of debt.
You guys paid off our massive utilities bills?
- How did you afford that?
- I stole my old lady's bingo winnings.
And Mistress Bubbles did a bachelor party tonight at which yours truly was a guest star, thank you very much.
- Oh.
- Whoa.
Don't get too excited.
We didn't pay off your whole bill.
Just a month of each.
They agreed to turn everything back on?
At 9 at night?
How does that work?
Stacey knows somebody that works at Power and Light.
- You guys...
- This is amazing.
You didn't have to do this.
You didn't have to put us in your movie.
- Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.
- Or put us in your movie either.
- We said that already.
Guys, honestly, I don't know what to say.
You can start by saying we can take tonight off so we can have our wrap party right now.
Guys, we're not wrapped.
We still have four days of shooting left.
Excuse me.
In my "producorial" capacity,
I'm shutting the movie down for a night so we can get a little silly.
Go, go, go.
- Yes.
- Yes.
You all drink.
Was it just amazing with him, after all those years of not knowing?
It was, um, weird.
- But good.
- My scene with Zack's tomorrow.
You don't say.
But I'm a little nervous.
I was thinking about trying to get with him tonight.
- Really?
- I mean, if you don't mind.
You are just friends and all' so I didn't think it would be a biggie.
- It wouldn't be a biggie, would it?
- No.
No, no.
It's not a biggie.
What?
No.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Stacey' I'm not married to the guy, so...
I don't know.
You guys just looked kind of intimate last night.
- We did?
- Yeah.
Well, we're just better actors than I thought, I think, so you know what?
If you wanna get with him' you should just go ask him.
- He'd be really excited to hear that.
- Yeah?
For real, you don't mind?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
All the quarters are on the ground.
- Hey, Stace.
- Hey, Zack.
Come on, are you guys playing or what?
Well, I'm bummed, but I totally get it.
It's no problem to work with Lester again.
He has a nice cock.
Well, you're a trouper, Stace.
Oh, but if I start making weird faces or anything during the scene' it's just because I've been constipated all day.
Oh, shit, uh.
We don't have to shoot the scene tonight.
No, I want to.
Anal's great for when you're constipated.
It totally loosens you up.
I use ex-lax, but good to know.
Okay, I never thought I would have that conversation.
So are we starting with Lester and Stacey tonight?
We were supposed to start with Lester and Miri.
I know.
She...
We're not gonna do that.
I don't think Miri's gonna do that.
Hey.
So where are we shooting this?
Over here?
- What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.
Our scene's tonight, right?
Can I talk to you for a minute in the back?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
What do you want me to shoot here?
Start with the close-ups of Lester and Stacey.
Give me a second, man.
What an artist.
Okay, uh.
Did I do something wrong to you?
No.
Then why are you here?
I'm here for the same reason you're here.
To make the movie.
Okay, just, like' for your own personal information, you're acting really weird right now.
I'm acting weird?
I think you're acting weird right now.
Oh, I'm acting...
How exactly am I acting weird?
You've been trying to keep me from fucking anybody but you since we started this thing.
Maybe I was thinking about your feelings.
Were you thinking of my feelings when you were banging Stacey?
Because that'd be really sad for Stacey.
She told me that you told her that that was okay.
I told her that it was okay to ask you.
Holy shit.
I get it.
I fucking get it.
It was a test.
That whole thing was a fucking test, is that it?
If it was, how do you think you did?
We had a discussion, Miri.
We had...
Actually, we had many discussions about how it was just sex
- and how we wouldn't let it get weird.
- I'm not acting weird.
You're acting like a jealous girlfriend is what the fuck you're acting like.
- I am not your girlfriend.
- I know that.
You're not my boyfriend, so why are we having this conversation right now?
Because you're about to fuck Lester to spite me, it seems like.
Did you fuck Stacey to spite me?
No.
You fucked her like you fucked every other bitch and never gave a shit how I felt about it.
- Well, that was before.
- Before what?
Look, don't fucking pretend that the other night, you and me, right there, that that didn't mean anything to you, that you didn't feel it too.
Oh.
You're not getting all gooey on me here, are you, Zack?
You know what?
If you were any other bitch I didn't give a rat's ass about,
I would tell you to go fuck yourself right now because I fucking hate this game-playing shit.
But you, you mean more to me than that' so I'm just gonna lay this out on front street.
I know you felt something big, something real the other night when we were together because I felt it too.
We tried to fuck and instead, we wound up making love.
So if this is what you need to hear in order to keep you from fucking Lester, if this is what you need, then fine.
Here it is, I'm gonna say it.
I love you, Miri.
Happy?
Oh, Jesus.
You better get a hold of yourself, Zack, because we just fucked.
Okay.
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?
But you did.
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.
Wait...
All right, don't forget I'm down here.
Watch that pullout, huh?
Yeah.
Mmm.
This is some damn good coffee.
- Where you going?
- Getting the fuck out of here.
We gotta finish this movie.
Yo!
You believe this shit?
Do you believe this shit?
What the fuck just happened in there?
I'll tell you what just happened in there.
That chick frosted me like I was a fucking cake.
Zack.
Okay, seriously' get a picture of me right now.
I'm hunting humans.
- Dude, check it out.
Ooh.
- Oh, shit.
Seriously, let's shoot the shit out of this bitch.
- Where you aiming at?
- Cock shots?
Cock shots.
We shot you in the balls, cunt nugget.
Well, it's my job to get shot in the balls, so...
Oh, they're gone.
Excuse me.
Didn't you used to work at the Bean-N-Gone in Monroeville?
I sure as shit hope this pays better, I tell you.
So why don't they just shoot you with a puck?
What do you mean?
I mean, what does paintball got to do with hockey?
Nothing, I guess.
- So ain't no prizes or...?
- No, no.
So, what are they paying $5 for?
To shoot a Broad Street Bully in the balls.
White people are fucked up.
Yup, they sure are.
It's a living.
You've been getting the checks I've been sending?
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Probably didn't save you from a brutal tongue-lashing, though, huh?
You know, the wife never found out about the camera, because I paid off the bills.
How did you manage that?
- Because now I'm Oprah rich.
- No way.
- The post office fucking settled?
- Hundred-sixty large, son.
- Nice, man.
Congratulations.
- A beautiful day, thank you very much.
I thought you made that whole thing up.
No, no.
It was very real.
You can believe it.
Even though she's spending all of it.
Well, since you ain't gonna ask me, I'll just go ahead and tell you.
- No, I have not seen Miri.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.
Oh, I suppose you weren't gonna ask about your movie, neither?
Look, that's why I came down here.
I need you to come take a look at it.
- I'm not interested.
Sorry.
- You'd better get interested
- because you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?
The story doesn't make sense.
- The story?
- The story doesn't make sense.
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?
It's a movie, dog, and a movie's gotta have an ending, which we don't have at the moment.
Come shot, credits.
There's your fucking ending.
Do me this favor, okay?
When you're done getting your nuts blown off' come back to humble Monroeville to my crib for a couple hours' check out the flick, you tell me what's missing.
No.
I'll tell you what, you do that, you don't owe me shit no more.
- Really?
- Really.
- Is your wife home?
- Yes.
- Maybe I should leave the pads on.
- You got some extra ones?
Hey, honey.
Where the fuck you been?
And who in the fuck is this now?
Would you calm down, woman?
Goddamn.
You already left one white boy down in my basement while you off gallivanting and shit.
What if this motherfucker
- was all grabby on me?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
Oh, what in the fuck is that supposed to mean?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
- White boys love me.
White boy.
- I said, white boy.
- Yeah?
You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?
- Should I say yes?
- Just say yes.
Yeah.
- Why don't you, uh, head downstairs?
- Oh, okay.
It's just through this hallway.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
What the fuck you looking at?
Why you gotta be yelling at me in front of my director?
- Oh, he's a director?
- Yeah.
I didn't know that.
Shit, he's a director.
Well, why don't he direct my ass to a new husband?
How about that shit?
- That's the bedroom.
Keep talking, maybe he will.
Oh, don't nobody want them saggy-ass balls!
Saggy balls?
Look at these sagging-ass titties you got around here.
- You could tie these together.
- Motherfucker, we match.
Oh, shit.
Where's my paintball gun at?
Look at you, editor and DP.
You got your shit covered, man.
Please, don't ever say "shit-covered" to me again.
Roll the film for the man, please, so we can see what he thinks.
Just jump through it.
I ain't got all night.
The bitch is on me.
"Nigga Rich Productions. " Classy.
- Yeah, DreamWorks was taken.
- Was it?
Plus, it sounds like an underground gay fuck club.
"I met a guy at DreamWorks. " Yeah.
All right, so we got Lester and Stacey fucking.
Then we got Barry and Bubbles fucking.
And then this boring bullshit.
Okay, just, uh, go to the next scene, would you?
Uh...
- What next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?
We never shot it.
- Why not?
- Because after you left that night,
Miri came out of the backroom and said she couldn't do it.
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped?
So...
- Wait, so Miri...
- Never fucked nobody.
Just you.
Now, I wonder why she did that.
- Hm.
- Hm.
You see, there was a time when I was just a bitter old fuck making coffees, and Stacey was just a lap dancer and Barry and Bubbles didn't know each other and this fool here, hell, I don't even know what he was.
- A white supremacist.
- Man, fuck you.
Then two people come along and showed us something we didn't know existed.
A world of possibilities where plain old people just like us could do something special.
Even if it's something as simple as filming people fucking.
Sometimes we just need someone to show us something we can't see for ourselves
and then we're changed forever.
So as you can see' our movie ain't got no ending.
Every movie needs an ending' don't it?
Peace.
Delaney, you're a slick cupid motherfucker.
Ain't love grand?
Why the fuck is this white boy running through my goddamn house?
Sometimes.
Miri.
- Miri.
- Zack?
Miri.
I'm sorry.
Get out.
- Close the door.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over...
- Just close the fucking door, Zack.
I never slept with Stacey that night, okay?
I swear to God.
When we got into my room, you know what we did?
We talked about you, and us and how things were different and how I was too much of a fucking pussy to just tell you how I felt about you.
And I know...
I know that that's only because of all the stupid shit we said about how we wouldn't let sex change us, but it did.
It changed me.
That has to be love, right?
It has to be love and just so you know, I can't go back to being just friends anymore,
- because I just can't.
- Good.
And I think...
I think that you feel the same way.
Because that night after I left, you didn't fuck Lester.
What's up, Zack?
You know what?
I don't care that you're fucking Lester, okay?
How's that?
- Oh, shit.
- I don't wanna be with anyone but you.
So I will wait forever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life because I love you, and I have for as long as I can remember.
And I would rather die than be without you, Miriam Linky.
Miri's last name is Linky?
You're gonna fuck a guy who doesn't know your last name?
Or that you beat up Carl Roth in the sixth grade?
I know that.
Or what your senior prom dress would've looked like had we gone but we decided not to, and we got drunk alone instead.
Or that you washed your hair in the toilet.
We're not fucking, Zack.
Or that you're not fucking Zack...
What?
I asked her to fuck me.
She wouldn't do it.
I even tried to talk her into giving me the fucking Dutch rudder.
Shot me down on that too.
- And a Dutch rudder is?
- Don't know what a Dutch rudder...?
All right, you grab your dick, then you have someone else work your arm.
Here, let me show you.
All right, grab my arm.
I'm grabbing my dick, you're grabbing my arm.
Now work it.
Work my arm.
See that shit?
Work it up and down.
It's like someone else is jerking you off.
Okay.
There's the double Dutch rudder, which, I grab my dick, you grab your dick, you work my arm, I work your arm' same time.
It's like jerking off together but not gay.
We're not touching dicks, each other's dicks anyway.
I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.
It feels good, sir.
Try me, come on.
Sorry to change the subject on you, Lester, but if you're not fucking Miri, why is your dick out right now?
Because I live here now, and I like to be naked.
- What?
- When you moved out, she couldn't afford to pay her rent by herself, so I moved in to help.
But you just came out of her room.
That's my room now.
She moved in your old room.
Wait, wait, wait.
She changed rooms?
Yeah, she said she did it because she missed the smell of you or some shit.
I don't smell anything.
But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.
- Night, Zack.
- Night.
Do you?
Then why are you crying?
Because I missed you so much.
Me too.
I love you.
- I love you, I love you.
I love you.
I don't mean to alarm you but I think I just jerked off Lester a little bit.
- The Dutch rudder?
- Yeah, it's ingenious, right?
If you ask me nicely, I will Dutch-rudder you the rest of our lives.
Good.
I'm getting tired of fucking the Fleshlight.
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.
- What'd it feel like?
- Like fucking a flashlight.
- Wrong room.
- Oh, God.
That's gross.
Let us fuck.
Hello.
Welcome to Nigga Rich Productions' home of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, the production house for the couple looking to put a little spice in their sex life.
- Shall we take a look around?
- Fuck me so hard.
Oh, God.
First, you'll meet for a consultation with one of our romance-ologists, who'll coach you through that initial awkward stage before you're camera-ready.
So we will start off with some erotic massage and some...
Dude.
Some light petting.
That sounds good.
Are you guys sure you don't wanna do some, uh, butt-sack work too?
- Uh, let's move on, shall we?
- Why?
From their break-out hit, Swallow My Cockuccino, to the multi-million selling Swallow My Cockuccino II and the award-winning Star Whores saga, including Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter,
Zack and Miri have proven time and again that they know how to shoot hot sex.
As an actor, I've sometimes brought my work home with me inappropriately.
When you're telling your real-life lover in the bedroom' to, you know, bend over while you cake your hand in K-Y, it is a sign that the romance is dead, I think.
Then we turned to the professionals at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
Oh, my God, they totally saved our civil union.
They filmed what was inside of us and not what was coming out of us necessarily.
It helped me see his asshole as not just a come dumpster, but a sign of his beauty, his flower.
It became a, uh, gorgeous orchid.
Orchids grow in sort of the filthiest conditions.
That's what his asshole became to me.
This beautiful flower amidst shit.
- Honey, they get the metaphor.
- I don't think they do.
Let's just say, thank you to Zack and Miri.
It's helped us out, it's helped our friends.
Enrique?
Park?
Park?
Enrique?
Can we get a little love for Zack and Miri?
They don't even know what's going on, they're so pilled up.
But don't take his word for it.
Just ask our co-founders.
- Hi.
I'm Miri Linky Brown.
- I'm Zack Linky Brown.
Here at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, we're dedicated
- to committing your love...
- Or lust.
- to high-end, quality production digital video.
A forever keepsake of your passion.
That's right, Miri.
Why set up a camera at the end of your bed and settle for one unflattering angle, when you could let the professionals dazzle and delight your senses with an array of shots so masterfully rendered you'll swear Martin Scorsese snuck into your room
and caught you fucking?
And remember' we're not just the presidents of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
We're also clients.
Call now to set up your appointment
Way to fuck, Zack.

Jesus, all right!
ZACK:
It's about to move up to my ass.
MlRl:
What?
ZACK:
The movement makes it hotter.
It's tucked under them.
It's stuck under them.
[GRUNTlNG]
Oh' fuck.
I think I burned my ball hair off.
[laughing]
It's not funny.
Can you help me pick out an outfit for tonight?
I'm working till 6.
- Well' l can try stuff on at the store.
- The store?
No, how about instead, you get a friend?
But you are my friend.
I mean a girl friend, jeez.
[JAZZ music playing OVER SPEAKERS]
Mr. Delaney, can you work for me tomorrow?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
Then you must come in the next day, I tell you.
- lt's black Friday.
- Black Friday?
It's the biggest mall-shopping day of the year.
And since the mall is just up the street, I would like you to come out and work.
- On Black Friday.
- Oh, yeah.
All right, you want me to work on Moolie Monday too?
- l'm sorry?
- How about Nigga Tuesday?
- Nigga Tuesday?
Is this a new holiday?
- You come to a brother and tell him he gotta work on Black Friday.
You got any idea how racist that sounds?
Telling me to work.
What, you think you own me?
- l never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?
You thought,
"l'm gonna lay down the law for this nigga, I put food on his table, clothes on his nigga baby backs, and he ain't gonna say shit."
- This ain't Amistad.
- You shut up.
You goddamn right this ain't Amistad.
I can't wait till the post office settles my disability suit because then I'm gonna be out this motherfucker.
I'm gonna be Oprah rich.
Y'all can kiss my ass.
You know what?
Fuck you.
Fuck you, and suck cock.
- To hell with you.
DELANEY:
To hell with you.
- Zachary will work.
Zack' my boy.
- Yeah.
- The customer with the hareIip--
- Oh, yeah.
--speak me, say you were playing baseball here the other night.
Wiffle ball.
And' uh' no' that wasn't me.
Maybe the harelip makes it sound like "baseball."
ZACK:
Yeah, maybe you hear with an accent.
- Fuck you, okay?
- Okay.
One day' l'm gonna put a camera over there' and then I can tell--
I'll know everything you do when I'm gone.
Everything.
Scratch your balls, take a shit, everything, I tell you, okay?
Okay.
Fucker.
I hate both of you ebony and ivory motherfuckers, I tell you.
- Why is he so fucking high-strung?
- "Fuck off, I tell you.
Very good."
Can you believe that Gandhi motherfucker, telling me I gotta work on Black Friday?
Ain't that some shit?
- Yeah.
- Like I don't wanna do shopping.
Biggest sales day of the year. I'm getting a flat-screen TV, believe that.
That's my fault, I should tell you. I asked for Friday morning off, I'm sorry.
- For what?
- l actually need a lot of recovery time.
Tonight is me and Miri's ten-year high school reunion.
I'm just gonna get fucking alcohol poisoning.
- Reunion?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
- lsn't that fucked up that they do that?
They say it's the best chance to get everyone together.
People come back in town for the holidays.
But they could have it in the middle of the summer at a blowjob contest that I was judging' and it would still be retarded.
- So why you going, then?
- Miri's making me go.
Why you always bending over backwards for that girI'
- knowing she ain't giving up no ass?
- We got a good thing going.
She pays half the rent, does dishes, she wakes me up in the morning.
Why complicate that with sex?
Besides, man, I've known her since the first grade.
You don't fuck someone you met in the first grade.
Excuse me, I met my wife in kindergarten.
We got married senior year, and she has been the queen of my world ever since.
- What if you could do it all over again?
- l'd jerk off and live by myself.
That woman is the bane of my existence.
- See?
- Excuse me, can I get a coffee, black?
Can't you see we talking, white?
ZACK:
If you're gonna continue to emasculate me with this Barbie dress-up shit'
I'm using your laptop.
Don't forget to smack it when you turn it on, otherwise the screen doesn't come on.
[COMPUTER PLAYS FANFARE]
Why don't you spring and get a new one?
Same reason I don't spring for clothes for tonight, I'm broke.
There's a chick who works at Teen Juice at the mall, you know.
I gave her a good deal on yarn,
- so she's letting me borrow this stuff.
- Yo, bro.
[ZACK laughing]
MlRl:
What?
- You're buying a vibrator online.
- What's wrong with the one you have?
MlRl:
It died last week.
Look at the size of those fucking panties.
Shoot that shit.
Shoot it.
ZACK:
My God, who even knew Amazon sold shit like this?
This is incredible.
- Those are fucking granny panties.
MlRl:
Okay,
A, I don't appreciate you violating the sanctity of my Amazon Wish List page' and B, I'm not buying that thing from Amazon, because it turns out I don't have a credit card they take.
[ZACK GRUNTS]
- Oh, shit.
- l'm sorry, guys.
Am I in the way?
You're a fucking faggot, all right?
Let's go to Starbucks.
- He's a shitty barista anyways.
- Cock.
- And he throws like a bitch.
ZACK:
You know what else I throw?
My nut sack in your coffees, so how did that taste, fucker?
We saw your girlfriend in her underwear, cunt nugget.
well' too bad she's not my girlfriend, you little fuck-
- Oh, they're gone.
MlRl:
Are you still talking to me?
Uh, just said, I'm gonna look up more fuck toys on Amazon.
Oh' holy shit.
- They sell the fleshlight here too.
- What's that?
It's a fucking pocket pussy that is shaped like a flashlight
"for discretionary jacking off."
That way if you get caught, no one thinks it's weird.
You're just a guy who likes to fuck his flashlight.
I am totally buying this shit.
Whoa, if you've got money to burn, how about paying the electric bill?
- That's due already?
- November's is probably due now, but I was talking about September's.
Tell me this doesn't rock.
You kind of look like Ronald McDonald.
That makes me want some McNuggets.
Why would you wanna buy a pocket pussy anyway?
That is so sad.
What?
Excuse me, I forgot about the nobility that accompanies coming with a fucking vibrator.
Think a kid in Darfur gets saved every time a vibrator makes you come?
No.
- "Real feel action"?
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
If you start fucking machines, I'm moving out.
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a machine.
How come you get to fuck something with a motor in it?
I've never met a man who can make me come like a vibrator does.
That's bullshit.
You get to be Buck Rogers having sex in the 25th century with fucking Twiki and Dr. Theopolis.
I'm stuck to a bottle of Jergens in the bathroom.
Holy bejesus.
You do not use my Jergens to jack it in our bathroom.
ZACK:
No, you know what I do actually, is I light a bunch of candles and I sprawl out on my sheets and I listen to Sting.
No, I'm a guy.
Give me two Popsicle sticks and a rubber band,
I'll find a way to fuck it, like a filthy MacGyver.
Oh' my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.
How about this?
I don't get why you're putting so much effert into this thing.
I thought we were just gonna go to sit around and make fun of everybody.
I can't wear anything that I already own and expect to bring home Bobby Long.
Bobby fucking Long?
No way.
Didn't that guy call you "Stinky Linky"?
Yeah, that was then, okay?
Maybe now he can save me a fortune in Amazon bills.
Maybe you can fuck our landlord so we can at least keep a roof over our heads.
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.
Hey, I bought skates with last week's paycheck
- and I need those to skate with.
- Oh.
And this week's will barely cover the past two water bills, so. ..
Is this sexy?
Yeah, in like a To Catch a Predator kind of way' it is pretty fucking sexy.
Then we're done.
[SHOWER splashing AND pipes CREAKlNG]
What the fuck?
Zack.
- You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?
- They shut it off.
- Oh, shit.
Just, uh--
Help me get this shit out of my hair.
Just use the water out of the toilet.
- There's poo in there.
- Not that part.
- The back part of the toilet thing.
- Oh, that makes sense.
MlRl:
Take the cup there and then scoop it in, there you go.
Here, I'll lean back and you can just' you know, pour it down like-
- Like that.
ZACK:
You're harshing my buzz' you know.
This is so lame.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Whoa!
All right, one hour tops, then we're gone.
Or I had an idea.
We could just not go at all, which would rock.
Even though we're broke and we've never amounted to anything, we're still better than these people, right?
No.
Not at all.
We're probably not even as good as most of them, unless one of them is a crackhead or something.
Just tell me I'm prettier than when we graduated.
You look about the same.
Definitely not prettier, but around the same.
I'm thinner, though' right?
A little?
Not really.
well' good pep talk.
Fuck.
[inaudible dialogue]
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.
- You don't recognize us' do you?
- Um, no, sorry.
Zack Brown, Miri Linky.
Were you the one they called Stinky Linky?
Oh' no' no one ever called me that.
Oh.
- Great.
What does yours say?
- What the fuck?
Come on.
- l'm sure I had a nickname.
Nothing?
- All right, you have a great time' and before you go, don't forget your copy of The Roving Roe-Ver.
What the fuck's this shit?
That is not shit, that would be our bi-monthly newsletter.
- Awesome.
BETSY:
It updates you
- on what everyone's doing.
- Finally.
I love your enthusiasm.
Here you go.
Write your e-mail address on that and I'll be sure to add you to our 800-member-strong mailing list.
We had 800 people in our graduating class?
Yes, and only 250 R.S.V.P .'d.
Doesn't that suck, Mary?
- Miri.
- You married, Bets?
- l am.
Two kids.
- Wow, that's beautiful.
- Awesome.
- You wanna fuck me later?
- Uh, no, I'm married.
- Okay, cool. lf you change your mind,
- l'll be in there getting shitfaced.
- He will.
- Just so you know, I eat the pussy.
- He does.
Ah, tempting.
Again, no.
- Shall we?
- Sir.
Bye, Bets.
Think about it.

- Get the fuck off of me.

Yeah, it's--
My hair is terrible. I can't believe I even wore my hair like that.
That's before I knew about styling products' you know.
It makes a big difference in life.
But you live and learn, though' right?
I mean, ten years ago, Pittsburgh, who knew anything about fashion?
Back in the day' our hairstyle, oh. ..
Hey, stranger.

- My stupid husband.
No fucking shit.

You actually married John Butterfield?
- That's amazing.
- Don't ever get married.
It sucks.
You stop appreciating each other and run out of shit to talk about after the first year.
But look at him now, chatty as fuck.
flirting up a storm with that cheerleader nimrod Monica Von.
You want me to maybe flirt with you so he can see it, even it up a bit?
I don't wanna get even.
If I was gonna do anything, I'd wanna one-up the asshole.
You can give me a handjob in the girls' locker room.
- Fine, but make it fast.
- Fuck, yeah.
Are you staying in town for a while or--?
Just tonight. I fly back to L.A. tomorrow.
L.A., wow, Los Angeles.

Do you need a drink?

Like Glen and Gary Suck Ross' Meaty Cock and Drop Their Hairy Nuts in His Eager Mouth.
- ls that like a sequel?
- Sort of.
- lt's a re-imagining.
- Oh, like The Wiz.
More erotic and with less women.
No women' to be exact.
I apologize in advance if I am out of line here, but are you in gay porn?
- Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?
- l thought you recognized me, that's--
- Oh, okay, I get it.
You're not in my demographic' so I'm not insulted.
- Not really.
Who's your demographic?
- Do you love pussy?
- l do.
- Then not you.
Oh' okay.
I came here tonight hoping to seduce you and bring you back to my apartment and sleep with you to, uh, get back at you, you know, for calling me Stinky Linky all those years ago.
Wow .
That is a weird revenge plot.
- You must be a terrible lay for that.
- What?
No, I'm great.
I mean, I've had enough practice and everything.
That--
Wow, that sounded not good.
I fuck a lot.
That's what I meant to say.
That doesn't sound good either.
Wow.
You're a lot funnier than I remember.
Thank you.
Gosh, you turned out to be such a nice guy.
It just-
- You know' it makes it even easier to just-
- To just say this.
Would you like to come back to my place and maybe open a bottle of wine and have ourselves a real high school reunion?

Wow, l--
Oh' God' l just wanna eat him up, yum, yum.
Save some for me' yum, yum, yum.
- l can't keep my hands off him.
- You've had one too many.
Although he does most of the eating in the sack.
In the sack and of the sack.
All right, that's enough.
Look, you've drunk too much.
You do this every time.
You get too Mary for everybody in the room
- and you can't contain yourself.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
And by containing myself, do you mean containing myself in a closet?
In a closet of denial?
is that--?
No, no, no.
Holy shit, this just got real.
This is exactly why you haven't met my mother.
You don't know how to ease people into this situation.
- You just force your way in every time.
- l thought, maybe for one second in this godforsaken town, I could be myself. I'm so sorry.
No, you're right' l should just butch up and pretend that I don't love it when you shove your dick in my mouth.
- This is the best night of my life.
BRANDON:
Am I making a spectacle?
- l could make a much bigger scene.
- You really are.
I'm sorry.
Pittsburgh.
Listen up' Monroe-vers.
My name is Brandon St. Randy' and I love Bobby Long.
- Fucking A. BRANDON:
is that enough?
Is that enough of a scene?
I could start doing worse than that.
The reason you haven't taken me to your mother's--
Your mother with her makeup and all her drinking, she's in the closet too.
- They fight just like real people.
- l thought I'd be a conduit for you--
Thank you.
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm not.
- Thank you.
- l Iove you.
- l'll e-mail you.
- Zack, it was so nice to meet you.
And I will be patient with you.
I will be there on your journey.
I will be your Sherpa up the mountain of gayness.
well' might as well see how many hits Granny Panties is up to, huh?
[COMPUTER PLAYS FANFARE]
Did I do that?
[music PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]
Thanks, George.
What kind of evil fucks turn off your power the day--?
No, the night before Thanksgiving?
Who does that?
Can you get an advance on your card?
fleshlight maxed-out my $200 limit.
Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.
This is bad. lf we don't come up with rent, we're gonna get locked out.
Who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.
Which means by the time we get home, there's no heat either.
well' l think it's time we put what we always talked about into effect.
- You're gonna have to start hooking.
- You know, you jest, but these are the exact circumstances people find themselves in right before they start having sex for money.
- Yeah.
- Or making porn.
ZACK:
Oh, my God, yeah.
- What?
You got an idea?
We could make a porno.
- Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?
No, that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me?
That's a rad idea.
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend, he said he makes a hundred grand a year because he shoots and distributes his own porno flicks.
If it's so easy, how come everybody doesn't do it?
Because other people have options and dignity, which we do not have, which puts us in an amazingly advantageous position.
Fuck you, I have dignity.
Where?
is it hidden in your gigantic underpants that are plastered all over the Internet?
Is that where you hide your dignity?
Every woman has a pair of those period panties.
That's, like, a fact.
Okay.
families.
I bet people don't make porno, because they have families.
But luckily, your parents are dead.
Sorry.
My grandparents are dead.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
So who are we gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone mainstream now.
It's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks in it.
Look at Paris Hilton.
She throat-fucks a guy in night vision, now she's selling fragrances to tweens.
And I'm pretty sure she's legally retarded.
That's for tweens?
Have you seen that Joe Francis guy who made Girls Gone Wild?
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot piece of shit in the world and he has a jet and a fucking island.
Look, there's got to be a less extreme solution to our financial woes here.
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper route.
- l don't have a bike.
- Be a waiter.
No one wants me around their food.
Would you eat food that I gave you?
I would not eat food that you gave me, that's true.
MlRl:
I mean, nobody wants to see us fuck, Zack.
ZACK:
Everybody wants to see anybody fuck.
I hate Rosie O'Donnell, but if someone said' "l got a tape of Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid,"
I'd be like, "Why aren't we watching that right now?"
Because she's famous.
Hello.
So are you.
You're fucking Granny Panties.
My underwear and your ass are famous' we're not.
So who the F would wanna watch us fuck?
- At least 800 people.
- The jerks we went to school with?
- Are you serious?
- Of course.
If you heard that someone we graduated with was in a fucking porno movie, you'd watch it, right?
I'd watch that guy Brandon suck a cock, I just met him.
With this mailing list, we have almost a thousand people that would definitely buy a porno we were in just to be like,
"Hey, I sat next to that guy in Civics.
Look at his fucking dick."
We sell a thousand copies at 20 bucks a pop, bam' we have paid off our bills.
ZACK:
So' what do you think?
- l don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.
Oh' wow, like you've never done that before.
How many guys have you met in a bar, taken home, banged with your mouth and then never talked to again?
That's what we call a stranger.
Dude, I don't one-night mouth-fuck anybody that I pick up in bars.
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in the porno movie for some weird reason.
I guess...
We could fuck.
- Ew.
- Fuck you.
I mean, you're a nice-enough-looking guy and everything--
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're an all-right-enough-looking girl.
- How does that feel?
- Dude' l'm just saying it'd be weird and wrong, you know, like fucking my brother.
Okay, seriously, we're just talking about sex, okay?
It's for a purpose. lt's for getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.
- Wow.
- Just explain to your private beforehand,
"Look' this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash."
- Oh, my God.
- What?
You're just doing this because you've always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?
Yes. I've gone my whole life pretending that I want nothing to do with you, just hoping one day we'd be in such dire financial straits that I could use it to finally make my move on you.
MlRl:
You're just being sarcastic.
- l am.
See' l was pretending to cry right there.
MlRl:
I guess it's not like it'd be creepy, like if we got way too drunk one night and accidentally fucked, you know?
No.
We'd be going in with the understanding that it's--
A business decision.
strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.
- Right.
- And by end,
I mean, I'll be waxing your ass.
Fuck you.
I'm not even letting you see my ass.
I've seen your ass and the rest of you naked around a billion times already.
- That goes both ways, buddy.
- You've never seen my dick.
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.
Are you kidding?
That party we went to where you got blasted, and Houls dared you to give yourself head, and we all watched you try for, like, an hour.
Oh' yeah.
Thanks by the way, for fucking letting me do that.
Thank you.
Oh' God.
We really do know too much about each other.
See' and this would really just be one more thing.
I mean, look at us. lt's Thanksgiving and we're huddled around a flaming fucking garbage can like a couple of steno bums.
I mean, this could give us a chance to pay off our debt, pay our bills, get a fucking nicer apartment with heat in it maybe.
What are you doing?
Miriam Linky, will you have sex with me on camera for money?
I will.
DELANEY:
A producer?
ZACK:
Yeah.
- Guy who gets to finance the movie.
- You think I got that kind of money?
We just need that.
What you're about to spend on the flat screen.
Now I can't get my flat screen?
Fuck that.
No, no, no.
With your cut of the profits, you're gonna get two flat screens.
One in your living room, one in your bathroom.
One in the bathroom?
You know, it's always been my dream to watch shit while I shit.
Everyone with an ass loves to watch shit while they shit.
- l'm gonna make that happen for you.
- l don't know, man.
What else the producer do?
- Um, they help with the casting.
- What's casting?
Finding the people to be in the movie.
- l get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.
Like, I can look at a titty, make sure there ain't no moles on there?
- You can look at both titties, man.
- Man.
I've been looking at the same busted titties for the past almost 20 years.
- l'm due for another new titty.
- Please help us.
Please.
Please.
Yes.
Yes. I love you.
well' don't mind that smell.
We had some homeless people squatting in here.
You know, they'd void their bowels everywhere but the bathroom.
Anyway, you pick up the poop and you've got yourself a movie studio.
Why don't we shoot in your apartment?
No power.
You wanna pay our electric bill?
- You motherfuckers...
- We'll take it.
[whistle BLOWS]
MAN 1 :
Bring it back.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
DEACON:
Oh' Jesus.
Oh' Jesus.
Oh' God.
Come on.
Why the fuck do I have to do everything?
Fuckers.
[CROWD CHEERS]
MAN 2:
Hey, what is that?
DEACON:
Fucking guys.
This fucking team, man.
They fucking suck.
[MAN 2 shouting INDlSTlNCTLY]
I'm gonna hatefuck the shit out of you, ref.
- Dude.
- lt's cool.
- He's my cousin.
- Hey.
Didn't you used to videotape the varsity basketball games in high school?
Just the away games. I did it because I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.
Which one?
Whichever one wanted to fuck the guy who taped the varsity games.
- Aw .
- Still know how to work a camera?
- Who cares what the title is?
- The porn I liked when I was a kid, it was always, Iike, a spoof of a popular movie, you know?
Like, um, Edward Penishands.
Okay, so we need a mildly clever, vaguely dirty title, that sounds like a real movie
- and sums up what you're gonna see.
- Correct.
An American Werewolf in Brenda?
Fuckback Mountain?
- Too soon?
A Cock-in-Lips Now?
MlRl:
Next.
cradle the balls.
Work the shaft.
Jerk my come-crayon and let me color you white.
I need cock and I need it now.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
It's "puss" as in pussy.
Oh' because I was like' who would wanna fuck puss?
I want to slam my ham in your can, woman.
Scene.
- This guy is amazing.
- This guy's great-looking too.
I wanna fuck him.
DELANEY:
Hi, my name's Delaney and I'm a producer.
I really don't know what it means. I'm gonna be honest' this is my first time.
You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna touch you or nothing like that.
- All right.
- l have a wife, you know.
We're happy. I mean, not happy' but it's cool, you know.
Just so you know, there will be some fucking.
- We'll talk about that if you get the part.
- Okay.
I mean, not-
- We won't be fucking, there'll be fucking in the movie.
Like I said' l got a wife.
She don't play that shit.
- She is a crazy bitch.
- Yep.
It's my job as the producer to see what you got.
So if that makes you uncomfortable in any way, you don't have to show me anything you don't wanna show me, because--
I love the movies.
- Lawrence of a Labia.
- No.
- Oh, come on.
- Dawn of the Dick.
Yeah, but how are zombies doing it at all sexy?
I want to eat your brain and your ass.
[groaning]
- Dude.
- Sci-fi.
Yeah.
Close Encounters With a Turd From Behind.
- l don't know what that means.
- Just asses.
Fucking deep in asses.
[TECHNO music playing OVER SPEAKERS]
What?
We're making a porno and we just need to know what you would be or would not be interested in doing.
If anything.
- No anal.
- Oh, definitely no anal.
Anal and hugging.
I don't do ass stuff.
- Anal.
- Ah, fuck.
- Oh, wait, oral. I like anal.
- Yay.
Okay, well, so, uh, do you have any special skills?
Special skills?
I can get a boner really quick and it sticks straight up.
- ls that really a special skill?
- l think.
- Can you show us what you mean?
- Sure.
Oh' that is special.
[ZACK CHUCKLES]
Yeah, you're hired, Mr.--
- Who are you again?
- Lester.
Lester "The Molester" Cockinshtuff.
- No.
- Wow.
That is the best porn name I've ever heard' man.
I can have a porn name?
- Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.
Are you Granny Panties?
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The panties are actually in the house.
- l'll get them.
- Whoa.
- Star Sex 2:
The Wrath of Cunt.
MlRl:
We never made a Star Sex 1 .
I guess we can lose Star Sex 3:
The Search for Cock, then.
- Cocunt.
- What's that?
It's Cocoon with a cunt.
[laughing]
So Delaney tells us you have a special talent of some sort.
I don't know if I'd call it a special talent, but it's a little something I picked up doing bachelor parties.
It would probably be easier if I just showed you.
- Great.
- The floor is yours.
So a movie, huh?
That could be fun.
Holy fuck.
Her name's Bubbles.
- lnvasion of the Potty-Snatchers?
- That's like MAD Magazine stupid.
well' fuck you' okay?
You try to think of a good sci-fi porno title. lt's hard.
MlRl:
There's gotta be one we haven't thought of that would say it all' not be ridiculously filthy and off-putting, and still have instant recognition with our audience.
- l got it.
- l got it.
- Star Whores.
- Yeah. lt's funny' right?
See' we figured this opens us up to an even bigger sales market beyond the people we went to school with.
People who like comics and sci-fi.
Comics?
Like "Ziggy"?
"Ziggy"?
is that even in fucking papers anymore?
No, man.
Fuck you. "Ziggy" is a comic' right next to "Family Circus."
No, Iike Spider-Man and shit, you know?
There's always a shitload of Star Wars nerds at those comic-book shows.
So we sell them a Princess Leia they can really fucking jerk off to.
- That'd be me, Princess Lay-Her.
- Who am I playing?
You' my friend, are the lead role of Lubed Guy-Baller.
Man' he's gonna be bailing dudes?
I thought you said this was boys on girls.
If I have to fuck a guy' okay, but I'd rather fuck a girl.
What's wrong with you, boy?
- We'll change the name to Sky-Baller.
- Sky-Baller.
I will be Hung So-low.
Delaney, my friend, you are On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
Man' l can't be in no porno.
My wife will kill me.
Hump me, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
You're my only hump.
On the other hand, fuck my wife.
Unfortunately, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over does not have any sex in the movie but the droids do, I-CUP and R2-T-Bag.
I robot.
And Stacey over here is gonna play Darth Vibrator.
- l'm the bad guy?
- She's not a guy, Zack.
I know that because I'm not a fucking idiot.
In our movie, Darth Vibrator is a bad girl who wants to fuck the galaxy, literally' and it's up to Lubed and Hung to stop her with their cocks.
- You and me get to have sex, then?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- l know. lsn't that awesome?
Hold up, hold up.
So who's all having sex with who in this movie?
As of last night, I was having sex with Zack.
What?
Han Solo ain't never had no sex with Princess Leia in the Star Wars.
ZACK:
Guys' this isn't a literal adaptation here.
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.
Kind of like The Wiz or like a parody.
With lots of anal.
- Cool.
- l know, isn't that awesome?
I have a question, do Princess Lay-Her and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?
Uh, no, because they're brother and sister, and according to Miri' brothers and sisters can't fuck.
But you said, that this wasn't a literal translation, so that means Lester's character could have sex with Miri's character.
Because I would love to fucking eat her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.
Dream on, pal, it's never gonna happen, okay?
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See' she's fine-
- Wait, what?
Yep. I mean, everyone else is having sex with more than one person in this movie all of a sudden, so I think it's' you know' not fair if I'm only fucking you.
Guys, read amongst yourselves, okay?
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Look, Miri, we got plenty of sex going on in this thing, you don't have to do that.
Zack, it's fine. I mean I have slept with way worse-looking guys than Lester.
I just wanna do my part for the movie like everyone else.
You're having sex in the movie, you don't need to fuck someone else.
- You're good.
- l'm only fucking you' though.
So don't we need to vary it up to keep it fair?
Fair for--?
I don't-
- What?
Fair for who?
What are these, blood diamonds we're talking about?
Fair for everyone else who is fucking more than one person, a.k.a. you' in the movie.
- l mean, fine--
- All right. I mean, if you don't care--
I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
Fuck. I don't give a shit.
Like you said, you know, you've fucked bigger idiots than Lester.
Holy shit.
Are we really gonna shoot this in outer space?
Maybe not bigger idiots.
[MOUTHS] Thank you.
- Cut.
All right, guys, that's it.
- Yeah.
Make sure you leave your costume so we know they're here for tomorrow.
mostly, everybody, thank you so much for helping us get ready' you know.
Cleaning this place out, building the sets, sewing the costumes, it's just--
I mean, it's really amazing.
Thank you.
ZACK:
seriously, thanks.
But this is just the beginning, guys.
If Star Whores works, and it wilI' we are set up for sequels galore.
The Empire Strikes Ass.
- Return of the Brown-Eye.
- The Phantom Man-Ass.
And Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter.
- Okay.
- Revenge of the Shit.
- You got it?
- Yeah, no, we got it.
Ew.
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.
- We'll talk about that one.
We're gonna have a lot of fun' but more importantly, we're gonna make a lot of fucking money' okay?
- Yeah.
- So get ready for greatness, people.
Tomorrow we start principal photography.
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
- All right, good night, you guys.
- We got a movie.
- What?
- Nothing.
I think someone should acknowledge how insane and amazing this is
- and it's all because of you.
- l don't know. lt's just a porno.
You know what I mean.
You've really come into your own.
Shut the fuck up.
So speaking of coming into things' ready for tomorrow?
Twenty years' we're finally gonna know what it's like to have sex with each other.
You say that like you've been wondering what it'd be like to sleep with me for a while now.
Why the fuck do you think I started hanging out with you?
I knew it.
Here, help.
Let's just promise that it's not gonna change anything between us, okay?
- Like what?
- l don't know.
Some guys can't keep sex in perspective.
If anyone's gotta keep this in perspective, it's you, okay?
I don't want you getting all mushy and gooey on me after I give you the best orgasm you've ever had.
Oh' like you know what you're doing down there at all.
I actually don't.
Where's the clitoris?
Is it in your ass?
Just, you know, make sure you kind of whoop it up and act like I'm a stud who knows what he's doing' okay?
Just be a pal.
Oh' dude, I am gonna Meryl Streep the fuck out of this tomorrow, you watch.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
No.
Really, thank you.
For everything.
You're welcome.
Less than 1 2 hours and we make Monroeville history.
- l really hope nothing goes wrong.
- lt's a movie.
What could go wrong?
ZACK:
What are you doing?
DELANEY:
What's up?
- What the fuck?
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait.
- Wait.
- Stop.
Stop.
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck is going on?
Condos is what's going on, as soon as this shit-hole's demo'd.
No, you gotta stop it right now.
We rented this place for a month from Mr. Jenkins.
Sounds like your Mr. Jenkins was full of shit.
Luxury Homesteads bought this place a month ago.
I'm gonna kill that lying old fuck.
You're gonna have to go Florida, that's where he moved.
We've got thousands of dollars of equipment in there.
- Please.
- lf you wanna sift through this rubble when we're done, be my guest.
Hey, get that fucking beam down.
MlRl:
This is the last thing you wanna hear.
If you don't get an advance,
I don't think we're gonna keep a roof over our heads.
I got an advance already.
It went into all the costumes.
- So all our money's gone?
- All your money?
Never mind what my wife's gonna do when there ain't no new snow tires, or when she sees I charged a video camera.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this' man.
DELANEY:
I just wanted to see some free titties.
That's all.
But there's no such thing as free titties' is there, Zack?
- ls there?
- Fuck this noise.
Why don't we get another camera, and shoot something else?
Where are we gonna do that?
Got another sound stage?
Sound stage?
We had a shit-covered garage we turned into a sound stage.
We find someplace new and we do it again.
[DOOR SQUEAKS]
How?
Okay, I'm broke, man.
No, make that' l was broke.
Now I am really tapped out.
I have to get another job to pay Delaney back.
So please tell me, how can I afford to start over?
- What can I get you?
- Yeah, can I get a, uh--?
Too fucking late.
Cappuccino, 3.50.
I don't know what the fuck i was thinking.
I mean, I'm a total loser in every single other aspect of my life.
What made me think I could do something as simple as filming people fucking?
We have no money left, nowhere to shoot, no sets, we have no fucking cameras.
Here.
It's time I go back to my regular life where l am a quiet fuckup who doesn't cost anybody any money and knows his goddamn position behind this fucking counter making cappuccinos for this fucking guy.
Oh' yeah.
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
ZACK:
Oh' yeah.
Yeah.
Fuck, yes.
Zack.
[CHUCKLES]
You sneaky Indian motherfucker.
I tell you, yes.
Swallow My Cockuccino.
- What?
- That's it.
That's the movie.
Why didn't I think of it before?
We don't need sets or a stage.
Look at all this production value, waiting to have balls on it.
Hold up.
You wanna shoot a dirty movie here, where we work?
Yes.
Fuck, yes, I do.
You know how many stories I have from working here?
How many times I've been laid right there after hours?
You've never gotten laid here after hours.
I know.
Thank you for reminding me.
But I always wish I had, and that's what porno is.
It's fantasy.
It's taking the normal and making it abnormal by fucking it.
Don't do that.
The little dog don't like that.
How did you get a camera?
By being a terrible, untrustworthy employee, that's how.
Give me today, I'll bang out a script.
Meet me back here after closing.
We're gonna launch arching ropes of jism all over this motherfucker.
Peace.
I like that guy but if he tries to fuck that little dog tonight for real,
I'm calling the Humane Society.
It's called Bean-N-Gone, so get the fuck out of here.
Hey, Barry.
ZACK:
Stand by, Stace' picture's up.
- Okay.
ZACK:
Roll tape.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 1 2, Take 1 .
ZACK:
And action.
I'd like a double espresso so I can stay up all night because I'm in the mood to fuck.
well' l am a whore-ista, so I love to fuck.
Would you like to fuck me?
Holy fuck.
You mean, after you're done with your shift?
I mean during my shift.
- Sorry.
- Keep going, keep going.
With your shaft.
Let us fuck.
Cue music.
[FUNK music playing]
Okay, open up to camera, guys.
Let us see it.
More tongue.
little less tongue.
Oh' that was good.
[CASH register BEEPlNG]
Cue effects.
[moaning]
Oh' yeah, like that.
Oh' yeah.
See' l told you it would work.
Didn't I tell you?
It looks amazing.
It's incredible.
STACEY:
Oh' the beans hurt.
Easy.
- Move in for coverage.
- Nice.
That's why we got him.
- Nice. I'm impressed.
- Get in there, Deacon.
- Come on.
- Like that?
Like that.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
Look at that.

STACEY:
That's hot.
No, not you, Lester.
Put it back in.
Kiss the muscle.
- l kiss the muscle.
- You kiss the muscle.
- Can he slap her ass a little?
- Don't be a fucking pervert, dude.
- Stir, come on.
Stir.
- Yeah, stir it.
Stir it, baby.
Hey.
- Holy.
- Shit.
Are you guys still open?
No.
We close at 9.
I need coffee so I'm drive home.

That's a cute kitty.
Okay.
Hey.

"Hug it' chug it, football.
All night." Heh-heh.
Okay, pal' here you go.

Oh.

Keep moving.
MAN:
You and your little dog.
Go Steelers.
Action.
Oh' yeah.
Yeah, yeah, like that.
Oh' fuck it' chuck it' football.
Oh' yeah.
BARRY:
Oh' God' this is good.
[BARRY moaning]
You take it.
You take it.
Take it, Barry.
Oh, take it.
Take it, Barry.
Take it.
I'm disturbed at how turned on I am by this.
- Shit, dude' it's almost 6.
- Oh, fuck.
Okay, that's a wrap, everybody, yeah.
Let's give a hand to our hotties with the bodies from last night.
Stacey, Lester, Bubbles, Barry' whoo.
LESTER:
Yeah.
ZACK:
Nice.
Okay, when we come back tonight, we finish up the venti-vulva scene' and then we get into me and Miri's stuff.
Again' amazing first night, everybody.
Thank you so much.
Let us fuck.
- Hey' how'd it look?
- How do you think it looked?
It looked like shit going into other shit, in focus.
What an artist.
That was Kurosawa's motto. "Shit going into other shit."
Oh' man, I can't believe you gotta work now.
It's okay.
You know, honestly, I don't think I could sleep.
- l'm pretty, like, pumped up right now.
- Right?
It was amazing.
It was awesome.
I think the cast and crew had a good time.
- We were getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.
I just wanna keep shooting people boning all day.
I don't think I've ever met the ambitious Zack Brown before.
- Well' l'm trying to pay the bills, so...
- lt's not a bad thing.
I think it looks good on you.
ZACK:
Come on, hurry.
Come on, come on' come on.
BUBBLES:
Wait a minute.
- You guys never did it before?
MlRl:
It's fine.
You know, we talked about it and it's just for the movie.
We're friends' you know' we're just friends.
And we will always just be just friends, so...
Listen' l have some extra lube from last night.
I understand it's kind of hard getting wet when everyone's watching.
At least it was for Barry.
- l don't know if I am gonna need it.
- Really?
Yeah, I think I'm just excited.
Uh-huh.
At the idea of people watching' not because of Zack.
Oh' God.
Zack could never have that effect on me in a million years.
- Hello, Miriam.
- Oh, hey.
Wow .
- Your face.
- Yeah.
Weird, huh?
I don't think I've seen your face since senior year.
ZACK:
I think I made a mistake.
I did it for you so you wouldn't get road rash during our scene, but I should have asked first' I look like a fucking beluga whale.
I think I'll be going now.
ZACK:
Okay.
[clearing THROAT]
All I keep thinking is we should've done a trial run at home last week or something.
- Oh, my God.
Right?
- l know.
[laughing]
- You're still cool to do it, though, right?
- Yeah, um.
Totally.
Are you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I'm, uh.. .
- Honestly, I'm a little nervous, I guess.
- You are?
- lt's kind of a big deal.
- lt is?
Yeah, you know, it's our first time together since our auspicious debut on viral video.
Oh' yeah.
That's a fuckload of pressure for a director.
As a director, please.
What about the anxiety I'm feeling as an actress?
- Did I pick the right project?
- Yeah.
What about this follow-up?
Julia Roberts followed Pretty Waman with Sleeping With the Enemy.
I'm following Granny Panties with Swallow My Cockuccino.
Only difference is this movie's about cock-sucking and her movie just sucked cock, period.
- The only difference, yeah.
- The end was pretty rad.
I liked that.
- When she kills him.
- With a gun.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- She calls the cops first.
- She calls it in first.
- lt was so awesome.
- Awesome, yeah.
So I guess we should do this.
I think we should probably wait just until I lose another 20 or 30 pounds.
Stop it.
You look good.
Thanks.
So, what about me?
How do I look?
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful, so I guess it's not a big deal, but you look amazing.
- Okay.
Let's go make a porno.
- Okay.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 8, Take 1 .
DEACON:
Come here.
- l'm over--?
All right, settle.
Action.
[knocking ON DOOR]
Who could it be?
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm a delivery man and I have some cream for you.
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.
I work out.
So do you want me to give you your cream now?
I've been waiting for it all day.
- Fuck.
Come on.
- Oops.
[whispers] Keep going.
I spilled my cream.
Do you mind?
I don't mind.
especially if you spill it on my face.
Let us fuck.
[ROCK music playing]
- Fix my shirt.
Think I should?
- Okay.
Let me see them titties.
Actually, you know what?
Sorry, I don't think we should show them.
- What?
- We shouldn't show your breasts.
- Aren't you gonna take your shirt off?
- l'm just gonna open it.
You're not gonna take it off?
Why not?
My tits are bigger than yours.
I don't wanna show that.
She's not gonna show her tits?
I showed my cock and my asshole.
- Okay, I'lI do your pants.
- Back and forth. okay.
- Holy shit.
- Where's that delivery?
I can't believe this. I was delivering cream, and look what's happening.
- Jesus, what is that, a rumba?
- What's a rumba?
That awkward movement.
- Should I take your underpants off?
- Yeah, take them off.
ZACK:
What the fuck?
How does this work?
They're just like-- l'll do it.
- l'll do mine, you just-
- You do yours.
- l'll do my pants.
Granny panties.
Just get on with it already.
I'm gonna fuck you with my pecker.
Dude, that's really dirty.
- That's too dirty?
- That offends me.
- Penis?
- Fine.
- l'm gonna fuck you with my penis.
- l can't wait.
For my penis.
Be careful, Miri.
Okay, there we go.
Just keep rolling, keep rolling.
- l'll walk forward.
- Fucking cream is coming.
This is the worst porno I've ever seen.
MlRl:
Get over here, delivery man.
ZACK:
Let's fuck on these beans.
[GRUNTlNG]
- You okay?
- Yup.
ZACK:
Okay' all right.
- Just leave them.
Just leave them.
- They're really distracting.
- You should leave them.
- You gotta get your-
- There you go.
ZACK:
Okay' okay.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.
This okay?
Okay.
Okay, uh.
- We'll start kissing on three' okay?
- Okay.
One, two, three.
Go.
MlRl:
I'm ready.
- l'm ready.
- Okay.
Deacon.
- Deacon.
Deacon.
- What?
Did you see Lost this week, man?
I missed it.
What happened?
They're on the island, off the island.
Who can follow that?
I think they're in hell.
Would you all shut the motherfuck up?
[moaning]
I want you to come.
- l want you to come with me.
- Okay.
Oh' God.
ZACK:
Oh' God.
Cut.
That's it?
It's over?
Ain't he supposed to come on her titties?
well' it wasn't what we'd shot-listed' but that was nice.
- lt was so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack.
Thanks, Lester, uh.
It wasn't just me, though, guys.
Give it up for my radiant costar here, Miri.
[cheering]
LESTER:
Nice.
- Um, show's over in here.
Let's move out' start lighting the next scene.
- All right.
LESTER:
Let's do it.
BUBBLES:
You looked so beautiful.
- Thanks.
DELANEY:
I thought they were gonna be fucking hard.
- lt was pretty.
DELANEY:
Pretty don't sell.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
You good, Mir?
You need anything?
I'm just gonna take a minute, okay?
Okay, uh. I'll just be out there.
Yeah.
- That was fun.
- Yeah, fun.
ZACK [whispers]:
"Fun." You fucking douche.
[sighs]
Wow .
- Hey.
ZACK:
Hey.
- You working on a rewrite?
- Yeah, just for tonight's scene.
- l'm ready to go when you are, though.
- Okay.
You know, before we go, I...
I'm thinking that, uh, it's a good idea if we talk about what happened last night.
- Oh.
- l mean, we don't have to' but I think--
Okay, yeah, uh.
I kind of dropped the ball on that, I guess, huh?
- No, no.
It's. ..
- To be honest, it was...
You know, I didn't realize how weird it wouId be for me.
Weird?
Like-
- Weird how?
Acting and directing at the same time.
It's a lot to process, you know.
For the first time' l thought my balls didn't have enough hair on them.
That's not what I meant.
I know what you meant.
How you feeling about it?
I guess, um.. .
I feel like...
Like we. ..
- Holy fuck.
- The power's on.
Did you do this?
ZACK:
How did this happen?
I burned the bills.
How could we have done that?
- The water.
- The water.
MlRl:
Come on, come on' come on.
Yeah!
- We can shower in our home again.
- We are liquid.
[knocking ON DOOR]
Greetings.
Have you heard the good news about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?
Oh' my God, did you guys do this?
We got tired of you taking showers at our places all the time.
So we took up a collection amongst ourselves.
And chipped away at your mountain of debt.
You guys paid off our massive utilities bills?
- How did you afferd that?
- l stole my old lady's bingo winnings.
And Mistress Bubbles did a bachelor party tonight at which yours truly was a guest star, thank you very much.
- Oh.
- Whoa.
Don't get too excited.
We didn't pay off your whole bill.
Just a month of each.
They agreed to turn everything back on?
At 9 at night?
How does that work?
Stacey knows somebody that works at Power and Light.
- You guys...
- This is amazing.
You didn't have to do this.
You didn't have to put us in your movie.
- Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.
- Or put us in your movie either.
- We said that already.
Guys, honestly, I don't know what to say.
You can start by saying we can take tonight off so we can have our wrap party right now.
Guys, we're not wrapped.
We still have four days of shooting left.
Excuse me.
In my "producoriaI" capacity,
I'm shutting the movie down for a night so we can get a little silly.
[DMX'S "PARTY UP (UP in HERE)" playing OVER SPEAKERS]
[THE pixies' "HEY" playing OVER SPEAKERS]
[coin CLlNKlNG AND PEOPLE chattering]
Go' go' go.
- Yes.
- Yes.
[laughing]
You all drink.
Was it just amazing with him, after all those years of not knowing?
It was, um, weird.
- But good.
- My scene with Zack's tomorrow.
You don't say.
But I'm a little nervous. I was thinking about trying to get with him tonight.
- Really?
- l mean, if you don't mind.
You are just friends and all' so I didn't think it would be a biggie.
- lt wouldn't be a biggie, would it?
- No.
No, no. lt's not a biggie.
What?
No.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Stacey' I'm not married to the guy, so. ..
I don't know.
You guys just looked kind of intimate last night.
- We did?
- Yeah.
well' we're just better actors than I thought, I think, so you know what?
If you wanna get with him' you should just go ask him.
- He'd be really excited to hear that.
- Yeah?
For real, you don't mind?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
DEACON:
All the quarters are on the ground.
ZACK:
Hey, Stace.
- Hey' Zack.
[whispering]
DEACON:
Come on, are you guys playing or what?
[inaudible dialogue]
well' l'm bummed, but I totally get it.
It's no problem to work with Lester again.
He has a nice cock.
well' you're a trouper, Stace.
Oh' but if I start making weird faces or anything during the scene' it's just because I've been constipated all day.
Oh' shit' uh.
We don't have to shoot the scene tonight.
No, I want to.
anal's great for when you're constipated.
It totally loosens you up.
I use ex-lax' but good to know.
Okay, I never thought I would have that conversation.
So are we starting with Lester and Stacey tonight?
We were supposed to start with Lester and Miri.
I know.
She-
- We're not gonna do that.
I don't think Miri's gonna...
[knocking ON DOOR]
... dothat.
Hey.
So where are we shooting this?
Over here?
- What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.
Our scene's tonight, right?
Can I talk to you for a minute in the back?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
What do you want me to shoot here?
Start with the close-ups of Lester and Stacey.
Give me a second, man.
What an artist.
Okay, uh.
Did I do something wrong to you?
No.
Then why are you here?
I'm here for the same reason you're here.
To make the movie.
Okay, just, like' for your own personal information, you're acting really weird right now.
I'm acting weird?
I think you're acting weird right now.
Oh' l'm acting-- How exactly am I acting weird?
You've been trying to keep me from fucking anybody but you since we started this thing.
Maybe I was thinking about your feelings.
Were you thinking of my feelings when you were banging Stacey?
Because that'd be really sad for Stacey.
She told me that you told her that that was okay.
I told her that it was okay to ask you.
Holy shit. I get it. I fucking get it.
It was a test.
That whole thing was a fucking test, is that it?
If it was, how do you think you did?
We had a discussion, Miri.
We had-
- actually, we had many discussions about how it was just sex
- and how we wouldn't let it get weird.
- l'm not acting weird.
You're acting like a jealous girlfriend is what the fuck you're acting like.
- l am not your girlfriend.
- l know that.
You're not my boyfriend, so why are we having this conversation right now?
Because you're about to fuck Lester to spite me, it seems like.
Did you fuck Stacey to spite me?
No.
You fucked her like you fucked every other bitch and never gave a shit how I felt about it.
- Well' that was before.
- Before what?
Look, don't fucking pretend that the other night, you and me, right there, that that didn't mean anything to you, that you didn't feel it too.
Oh.
You're not getting all gooey on me here, are you, Zack?
You know what?
If you were any other bitch I didn't give a rat's ass about,
I would tell you to go fuck yourself right now because I fucking hate this game-pIaying shit.
But you, you mean more to me than that' so I'm just gonna lay this out on front street.
I know you felt something big, something real the other night when we were together because I felt it too.
We tried to fuck and instead, we wound up making love.
So if this is what you need to hear in order to keep you from fucking Lester, if this is what you need, then fine.
Here it is, I'm gonna say it.
I love you, Miri.
Happy?
Oh' Jesus.
You better get ahold of yourself, Zack, because we just fucked.
Okay.
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?
But you did.
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.
[whispers] Wait--
All right, don't forget I'm down here.
Watch that pullout, huh?
STACEY:
Yeah.
Mmm.
This is some damn good coffee.
- Where you going?
- Getting the fuck out of here.
We gotta finish this movie.
[GASPS]
Yo!
[coughing AND groaning]
You believe this shit?
Do you believe this shit?
What the fuck just happened in there?
I'll tell you what just happened in there.
That chick frosted me like I was a fucking cake.
Zack.
TEEN 1 :
Okay, seriously' get a picture of me right now.
I'm hunting humans.
- Dude' check it out.
Ooh.
- Oh, shit.
seriously, let's shoot the shit out of this bitch.
- Where you aiming at?
- Cock shots?
Cock shots.
[BUZZER rings]
[BUZZER rings]
We shot you in the balls, cunt nugget.
well' it's my job to get shot in the balls, so-
- Oh, they're gone.
MAN:
Excuse me.
Didn't you used to work at the Bean-N-Gone in Monroeville?
I sure as shit hope this pays better, I tell you.
[chattering]
So why don't they just shoot you with a puck?
What do you mean?
I mean, what does paintball got to do with hockey?
Nothing, I guess.
- So ain't no prizes or--?
- No, no.
So, what are they paying $5 for?
To shoot a Broad Street bully in the balls.
White people are fucked up.
Yup' they sure are.
It's a living.
You've been getting the checks I've been sending?
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Probably didn't save you from a brutal tongue-lashing, though, huh?
You know, the wife never found out about the camera, because I paid off the bills.
How did you manage that?
- Because now I'm Oprah rich.
- No way.
- The post office fucking settled?
- Hundred-sixty large' son.
- Nice, man.
Congratulations.
- A beautiful day, thank you very much.
I thought you made that whole thing up.
No, no. lt was very real.
You can believe it.
Even though she's spending all of it.
well' since you ain't gonna ask me, I'll just go ahead and tell you.
- No, I have not seen Miri.
- l wasn't gonna ask that.
Oh' l suppose you weren't gonna ask about your movie, neither?
Look, that's why I came down here.
I need you to come take a look at it.
- l'm not interested.
Sorry.
- You'd better get interested
- because you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?
The story doesn't make sense.
- The story?
- The story doesn't make sense.
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?
It's a movie, dog, and a movie's gotta have an ending, which we don't have at the moment.
Come shot, credits.
There's your fucking ending.
Do me this favor, okay?
When you're done getting your nuts blown off' come back to humble MonroeviIle to my crib for a couple hours' check out the flick, you tell me what's missing.
No.
I'll tell you what, you do that, you don't owe me shit no more.
- Really?
- Really.
- ls your wife home?
- Yes.
- Maybe I should leave the pads on.
- You got some extra ones?
Hey, honey.
Where the fuck you been?
And who in the fuck is this now?
Would you calm down, woman?
Goddamn.
You already left one white boy down in my basement while you off gallivanting and shit.
What if this motherfucker
- was all grabby on me?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
Oh' what in the fuck is that supposed to mean?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
wife:
White boys love me.
White boy.
- l said, white boy.
- Yeah?
You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?
- Should I say yes?
- Just say yes.
Yeah.
- Why don't you, uh, head downstairs?
- Oh, okay.
It's just through this hallway.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
What the fuck you looking at?
Why you gotta be yelling at me in front of my director?
- Oh, he's a director?
- Yeah.
I didn't know that.
Shit, he's a director.
well' why don't he direct my ass to a new husband?
How about that shit?
- That's the bedroom.
DELANEY:
Keep talking, maybe he will.
Oh' don't nobody want them saggy-ass balls!
Saggy balls?
Look at these sagging-ass titties you got around here.
- You could tie these together.
- Motherfucker, we match.
Oh' shit.
Where's my paintball gun at?
Look at you, editor and DP .
You got your shit covered, man.
Please, don't ever say "shit-covered" to me again.
Roll the film for the man, please, so we can see what he thinks.
Just jump through it. I ain't got all night.
The bitch is on me.
"Nigga Rich Productions." classy.
- Yeah, DreamWorks was taken.
- Was it?
Plus' it sounds like an underground gay fuck club.
"l met a guy at DreamWorks." Yeah.
All right, so we got Lester and Stacey fucking.
Then we got Barry and Bubbles fucking.
And then this boring bullshit.
Okay, just, uh, go to the next scene, would you?
Uh...
- What next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?
We never shot it.
- Why not?
- Because after you left that night,
Miri came out of the backroom and said she couldn't do it.
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped?
So...
- Wait, so Miri--
- Never fucked nobody.
Just you.
Now, I wonder why she did that.
- Hm.
- Hm.
You see, there was a time when I was just a bitter old fuck making coffees, and Stacey was just a lap dancer and Barry and Bubbles didn't know each other and this fool here, hell, I don't even know what he was.
- A white supremacist.
- Man' fuck you.
Then two people come along and showed us something we didn't know existed.
A world of possibilities where plain old people just like us could do something special.
Even if it's something as simple as filming people fucking.
Sometimes we just need someone to show us something we can't see for ourselves
and then we're changed forever.
So as you can see' our movie ain't got no ending.
Every movie needs an ending' don't it?
Peace.
Delaney, you're a slick cupid motherfucker.
Ain't love grand?
wife:
Why the fuck is this white boy running through my goddamn house?
[DOOR SLAMS]
Sometimes.
Miri.
- Miri.
MlRl:
Zack?
ZACK:
Miri. I'm sorry.
MlRl:
Get out.
- Close the door.
- lt was closed.
- lt was closed over--
- Just close the fucking door' Zack.
I never slept with Stacey that night, okay?
I swear to God.
When we got into my room, you know what we did?
We talked about you, and us and how things were different and how I was too much of a fucking pussy to just tell you how I felt about you.
And I know-- l know that that's only because of all the stupid shit we said about how we wouldn't let sex change us, but it did. lt changed me.
That has to be love, right?
It has to be love and just so you know, I can't go back to being just friends anymore,
- because I just can't.
- Good.
And I think--
I think that you feel the same way.
Because that night after I left, you didn't fuck Lester.
What's up, Zack?
You know what?
I don't care that you're fucking Lester, okay?
How's that?
- Oh, shit.
- l don't wanna be with anyone but you.
So I will wait forever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life because I love you, and I have for as long as I can remember.
And I would rather die than be without you, Miriam Linky.
Miri's last name is Linky?
You're gonna fuck a guy who doesn't know your last name?
Or that you beat up Carl Roth in the sixth grade?
I know that.
Or what your senior prom dress would've looked like had we gone but we decided not to, and we got drunk alone instead.
Or that you washed your hair in the toilet.
We're not fucking' Zack.
Or that you're not fucking Zack-- What?
I asked her to fuck me.
She wouldn't do it.
I even tried to talk her into giving me the fucking Dutch rudder.
Shot me down on that too.
- And a Dutch rudder is?
- Don't know what a Dutch rudder--?
All right, you grab your dick, then you have someone else work your arm.
Here, let me show you.
All right, grab my arm. I'm grabbing my dick, you're grabbing my arm.
Now work it.
Work my arm.
See that shit?
Work it up and down.
It's like someone else is jerking you off.
Okay.
There's the double Dutch rudder, which' l grab my dick, you grab your dick, you work my arm, I work your arm' same time.
It's like jerking off together but not gay.
We're not touching dicks, each other's dicks anyway.
I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.
It feels good, sir.
Try me, come on.
Sorry to change the subject on you, Lester, but if you're not fucking Miri, why is your dick out right now?
Because I live here now, and I like to be naked.
- What?
- When you moved out, she couldn't afford to pay her rent by herself, so I moved in to help.
But you just came out of her room.
That's my room now.
She moved in your old room.
Wait, wait, wait.
She changed rooms?
Yeah, she said she did it because she missed the smell of you or some shit.
[sniffs]
I don't smell anything.
But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.
- Night, Zack.
- Night.
Do you?
Then why are you crying?
Because I missed you so much.
ZACK:
Me too.
I love you.
- l Iove you, I love you.
ZACK:
I love you.
I don't mean to alarm you but I think I just jerked off Lester a little bit.
- The Dutch rudder?
- Yeah, it's ingenious, right?
If you ask me nicely, I will Dutch-rudder you the rest of our lives.
Good. I'm getting tired of fucking the Fleshlight.
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.
- What'd it feel like?
- Like fucking a flashlight.
LESTER:
Wrong room.
- Oh, God.
That's gross.
Let us fuck.
Hello.
Welcome to Nigga Rich Productions' home of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, the production house for the couple looking to put a little spice in their sex life.
- Shall we take a look around?
- Fuck me so hard.
Oh, God.
First, you'll meet for a consultation with one of our romance-ologists, who'lI coach you through that initial awkward stage before you're camera-ready.
So we will start off with some erotic massage and some--
Dude.
Some light petting.
That sounds good.
Are you guys sure you don't wanna do some, uh, butt-sack work too?
- Uh, let's move on' shall we?
- Why?
ANNOUNCER:
From their break-out hit, Swallow My Cockuccino, to the multi-million selling Swallow My Cockuccino ll and the award-winning Star Whores saga, including Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter,
Zack and Miri have proven time and again that they know how to shoot hot sex.
As an actor, I've sometimes brought my work home with me inappropriately.
When you're telling your real-life lover in the bedroom' to' you know' bend over while you cake your hand in K-Y, it is a sign that the romance is dead, I think.
Then we turned to the professionals at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
Oh' my God, they totally saved our civil union.
They filmed what was inside of us and not what was coming out of us necessarily.
It helped me see his asshole as not just a come dumpster, but a sign of his beauty' his flower.
It became a, uh, gorgeous orchid.
Orchids grow in sort of the filthiest conditions.
That's what his asshole became to me.
This beautiful flower amidst shit.
- Honey, they get the metaphor.
- l don't think they do.
Let's just say, thank you to Zack and Miri.
It's helped us out, it's helped our friends.
Enrique?
Park?
Park?
Enrique?
Can we get a little love for Zack and Miri?
They don't even know what's going on, they're so pilled up.
But don't take his word for it.
Just ask our co-founders.
- Hi. I'm Miri Linky Brown.
- l'm Zack Linky Brown.
Here at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, we're dedicated
- to committing your love--
- Or lust.
--to high-end, quality production digital video.
A forever keepsake of your passion.
That's right, Miri.
Why set up a camera at the end of your bed and settle for one unflattering angle, when you could let the professionals dazzle and delight your senses with an array of shots so masterfully rendered you'll swear Martin Scorsese snuck into your room
and caught you fucking?
And remember' we're not just the presidents of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
We're also clients.

You little motherfucker!
Get up' Zack.
Come on, I don't wanna be late for work.
MIRl:
Ahh!
Get out!
- Jesus, fuck!
Close the door if you're gonna take a shit.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over, it was not closed.
- Close the door' Zack!
- Okay, okay.
MIRl:
God.
- Fine.
- What's that thing?
- It's a hand warmer.
[SIGHS]
We're going now.
- You smell that?
Is that the car?
Fuck.
- Oh, goddamn it.
- What?
What?
- Oh, it's wedged in my taint.
- What is?
- It got wedged in my taint.
- What?
- It's stuck under my balls.
- It's between my balls and my leg.
- What's happening?
- Please, pull over.
Pull the fuck over!
- All right, all right!
Jesus, all right!
ZACK:
It's about to move up to my ass.
MIRl:
What?
ZACK:
The movement makes it hotter.
It's tucked under them.
It's stuck under them.
[GRUNTING]
Oh' fuck.
I think I burned my ball hair off.
[LAUGHING]
It's not funny.
Can you help me pick out an outfit for tonight?
I'm working till 6.
- Well' I can try stuff on at the store.
- The store?
No, how about instead, you get a friend?
But you are my friend.
I mean a girl friend, jeez.
[JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
Mr. Delaney, can you work for me tomorrow?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
Then you must come in the next day, I tell you.
- It's Black Friday.
- Black Friday?
It's the biggest mall-shopping day of the year.
And since the mall is just up the street, I would like you to come out and work.
- On Black Friday.
- Oh, yeah.
All right, you want me to work on Moolie Monday too?
- I'm sorry?
- How about Nigga Tuesday?
- Nigga Tuesday?
Is this a new holiday?
- You come to a brother and tell him he gotta work on Black Friday.
You got any idea how racist that sounds?
Telling me to work.
What, you think you own me?
- I never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?
You thought,
"I'm gonna lay down the law for this nigga, I put food on his table, clothes on his nigga baby backs, and he ain't gonna say shit. "
- This ain't Amistad.
- You shut up.
You goddamn right this ain't Amistad.
I can't wait till the post office settles my disability suit because then I'm gonna be out this motherfucker.
I'm gonna be Oprah rich.
Y'all can kiss my ass.
You know what?
Fuck you.
Fuck you, and suck cock.
- To hell with you.
DELANEY:
To hell with you.
- Zachary will work.
Zack' my boy.
- Yeah.
- The customer with the harelip-
- Oh, yeah.
- speak me, say you were playing baseball here the other night.
Wiffle ball.
And' uh' no' that wasn't me.
Maybe the harelip makes it sound like "baseball. "
ZACK:
Yeah, maybe you hear with an accent.
- Fuck you, okay?
- Okay.
One day' I'm gonna put a camera over there' and then I can tell-
I'll know everything you do when I'm gone.
Everything.
Scratch your balls, take a shit, everything, I tell you, okay?
Okay.
Fucker.
I hate both of you ebony and ivory motherfuckers, I tell you.
- Why is he so fucking high-strung?
- "Fuck off, I tell you.
Very good. "
Can you believe that Gandhi motherfucker, telling me I gotta work on Black Friday?
Ain't that some shit?
- Yeah.
- Like I don't wanna do shopping.
Biggest sales day of the year.
I'm getting a flat-screen TV, believe that.
That's my fault, I should tell you.
I asked for Friday morning off, I'm sorry.
- For what?
- I actually need a lot of recovery time.
Tonight is me and Miri's ten-year high school reunion.
I'm just gonna get fucking alcohol poisoning.
- Reunion?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
- Isn't that fucked up that they do that?
They say it's the best chance to get everyone together.
People come back in town for the holidays.
But they could have it in the middle of the summer at a blowjob contest that I was judging' and it would still be retarded.
- So why you going, then?
- Miri's making me go.
Why you always bending over backwards for that girI'
- knowing she ain't giving up no ass?
- We got a good thing going.
She pays half the rent, does dishes, she wakes me up in the morning.
Why complicate that with sex?
Besides, man, I've known her since the first grade.
You don't fuck someone you met in the first grade.
Excuse me, I met my wife in kindergarten.
We got married senior year, and she has been the queen of my world ever since.
- What if you could do it all over again?
- I'd jerk off and live by myself.
That woman is the bane of my existence.
- See?
- Excuse me, can I get a coffee, black?
Can't you see we talking, white?
ZACK:
If you're gonna continue to emasculate me with this Barbie dress-up shit'
I'm using your laptop.
Don't forget to smack it when you turn it on, otherwise the screen doesn't come on.
[COMPUTER PLAYS FANFARE]
Why don't you spring and get a new one?
Same reason I don't spring for clothes for tonight, I'm broke.
There's a chick who works at Teen Juice at the mall, you know.
I gave her a good deal on yarn,
- so she's letting me borrow this stuff.
- Yo, bro.
[ZACK LAUGHING]
MIRl:
What?
- You're buying a vibrator online.
- What's wrong with the one you have?
MIRl:
It died last week.
Look at the size of those fucking panties.
Shoot that shit.
Shoot it.
ZACK:
My God, who even knew Amazon sold shit like this?
This is incredible.
- Those are fucking granny panties.
MIRl:
Okay,
A, I don't appreciate you violating the sanctity of my Amazon Wish List page' and B, I'm not buying that thing from Amazon, because it turns out I don't have a credit card they take.
[ZACK GRUNTS]
- Oh, shit.
- I'm sorry, guys.
Am I in the way?
You're a fucking faggot, all right?
Let's go to Starbucks.
- He's a shitty barista anyways.
- Cock.
- And he throws like a bitch.
ZACK:
You know what else I throw?
My nut sack in your coffees, so how did that taste, fucker?
We saw your girlfriend in her underwear, cunt nugget.
well' too bad she's not my girlfriend, you little fuck
- Oh, they're gone.
MIRl:
Are you still talking to me?
Uh, just said, I'm gonna look up more fuck toys on Amazon.
Oh' holy shit.
- They sell the Fleshlight here too.
- What's that?
It's a fucking pocket pussy that is shaped like a flashlight
"for discretionary jacking off. "
That way if you get caught, no one thinks it's weird.
You're just a guy who likes to fuck his flashlight.
I am totally buying this shit.
Whoa, if you've got money to burn, how about paying the electric bill?
- That's due already?
- November's is probably due now, but I was talking about September's.
Tell me this doesn't rock.
You kind of look like Ronald McDonald.
That makes me want some McNuggets.
Why would you wanna buy a pocket pussy anyway?
That is so sad.
What?
Excuse me, I forgot about the nobility that accompanies coming with a fucking vibrator.
Think a kid in Darfur gets saved every time a vibrator makes you come?
No.
- "Real feel action"?
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
If you start fucking machines, I'm moving out.
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a machine.
How come you get to fuck something with a motor in it?
I've never met a man who can make me come like a vibrator does.
That's bullshit.
You get to be Buck Rogers having sex in the 25th century with fucking Twiki and Dr. Theopolis.
I'm stuck to a bottle of Jergens in the bathroom.
Holy bejesus.
You do not use my Jergens to jack it in our bathroom.
ZACK:
No, you know what I do actually, is I light a bunch of candles and I sprawl out on my sheets and I listen to Sting.
No, I'm a guy.
Give me two Popsicle sticks and a rubber band,
I'll find a way to fuck it, like a filthy MacGyver.
Oh' my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.
How about this?
I don't get why you're putting so much effert into this thing.
I thought we were just gonna go to sit around and make fun of everybody.
I can't wear anything that I already own and expect to bring home Bobby Long.
Bobby fucking Long?
No way.
Didn't that guy call you "Stinky Linky"?
Yeah, that was then, okay?
Maybe now he can save me a fortune in Amazon bills.
Maybe you can fuck our landlord so we can at least keep a roof over our heads.
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.
Hey, I bought skates with last week's paycheck
- and I need those to skate with.
- Oh.
And this week's will barely cover the past two water bills, so...
Is this sexy?
Yeah, in like a To Catch a Predator kind of way' it is pretty fucking sexy.
Then we're done.
[SHOWER SPLASHING AND PIPES CREAKING]
What the fuck?
Zack.
- You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?
- They shut it off.
- Oh, shit.
Just, uh-
Help me get this shit out of my hair.
Just use the water out of the toilet.
- There's poo in there.
- Not that part.
- The back part of the toilet thing.
- Oh, that makes sense.
MIRl:
Take the cup there and then scoop it in, there you go.
Here, I'll lean back and you can just' you know, pour it down like
- Like that.
ZACK:
You're harshing my buzz' you know.
This is so lame.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Whoa!
All right, one hour tops, then we're gone.
Or I had an idea.
We could just not go at all, which would rock.
Even though we're broke and we've never amounted to anything, we're still better than these people, right?
No.
Not at all.
We're probably not even as good as most of them, unless one of them is a crackhead or something.
Just tell me I'm prettier than when we graduated.
You look about the same.
Definitely not prettier, but around the same.
I'm thinner, though' right?
A little?
Not really.
well' good pep talk.
Fuck.
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.
- You don't recognize us' do you?
- Um, no, sorry.
Zack Brown, Miri Linky.
Were you the one they called Stinky Linky?
Oh' no' no one ever called me that.
Oh.
- Great.
What does yours say?
- What the fuck?
Come on.
- I'm sure I had a nickname.
Nothing?
- All right, you have a great time' and before you go, don't forget your copy of The Roving Roe-Ver.
What the fuck's this shit?
That is not shit, that would be our bi-monthly newsletter.
- Awesome.
BETSY:
It updates you
- on what everyone's doing.
- Finally.
I love your enthusiasm.
Here you go.
Write your e-mail address on that and I'll be sure to add you to our 800-member-strong mailing list.
We had 800 people in our graduating class?
Yes, and only 250 R.S.V.P.'d.
Doesn't that suck, Mary?
- Miri.
- You married, Bets?
- I am.
Two kids.
- Wow, that's beautiful.
- Awesome.
- You wanna fuck me later?
- Uh, no, I'm married.
- Okay, cool.
If you change your mind,
- I'll be in there getting shitfaced.
- He will.
- Just so you know, I eat the pussy.
- He does.
Ah, tempting.
Again, no.
- Shall we?
- Sir.
Bye, Bets.
Think about it.

You want a beer?

Or am I Zack?
Whoa, ho, ho.

Oh' wow.
- Never gets old, huh?
- The other Zack.
Oh' in my world, nobody calls me "the other Zack,"
now that this guy's not around anymore, huh?
- Get the fuck off of me.
- There can be only one.
- What?
- Highlander, man?

Remember?
I'd yell it at you whenever we passed each other in the hallway?
Like it was yesterday' man.
Awesome.
Awesome.
Awesome.

Whoo.
- No.
- I'm gonna let you get to it.

[MARCY PLAYGROUND'S "SEX AND CANDY" PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]
Have you seen that big blowup picture they have of me?
Yeah, it's-
My hair is terrible.
I can't believe I even wore my hair like that.
That's before I knew about styling products' you know.
It makes a big difference in life.
But you live and learn, though' right?
I mean, ten years ago, Pittsburgh, who knew anything about fashion?
Back in the day' our hairstyle, oh...
Hey, stranger.
- Whoa.
Stinky Linky.
- Yeah.
Although it's just Miri now.
- Give me a hug.
- Oh, okay.
- Hi, heh, heh, heh.
- Hi.
Wow.
- How have you been?
- Great, great.
- Yeah?
- You look fantastic.
Wow, that is not something that you would have said to me ten years ago.
- Well' I've grown up.
- Yes.
Yes, you have.
You just look...
Ooh, heh, heh.
- Well' listen to you.
Thank you.
- No, don't thank me, just fuck me.

Hey.
Someone I like, what are the odds' huh?
Zack Brown, we had four years of Spanish together.
Why does no one recognize me?
- Am I thinner?
Is that it?
- Look at him.
- Who?
- My stupid husband.
No fucking shit.
John Butterfield?
You actually married John Butterfield?
- That's amazing.
- Don't ever get married.
It sucks.
You stop appreciating each other and run out of shit to talk about after the first year.
But look at him now, chatty as fuck.
Flirting up a storm with that cheerleader nimrod Monica Von.
You want me to maybe flirt with you so he can see it, even it up a bit?
I don't wanna get even.
If I was gonna do anything, I'd wanna one-up the asshole.
You can give me a handjob in the girls' locker room.
- Fine, but make it fast.
- Fuck, yeah.
Are you staying in town for a while or-?
Just tonight.
I fly back to L.A. tomorrow.
L.A., wow, Los Angeles.
Gosh' Bobby Long' coming up in the world.
- With Mrs. Long, I bet, huh?
- No, no, no.
No Mrs. Long for me.
- Then can I be honest with you?
- Sure.
Um...
Whew.
I think I need a drink.
Do you need a drink?
Because I need a drink to say this.
- I've got a beer already, so-
- Oh, great, thank you.
I think there's a cigarette butt in there.
Yup.
Sorry about the elbow.

Oh' God' that's so sad.
It's so Miri, is what it is.
I'm Zack, by the way.
Brandon.
Don't worry, we weren't in the same class or anything.
- Okay.
Lucky you.
- Are you a Monroe-ver?
well' I went here' let's just leave it at that, I guess.
Do you have one of the large blown-up pictures of your younger self
- hanging around here?
- I do, kind of.
Right there.

Gorgeous.
- Good times.
What do you do?
What brings you here?
I came with somebody who went to school here.
- Really?
- Bobby Long.
No shit.
That's who my friend's hitting on right now.
See right there?
- Really.
- One dressed like Hannah Montana?
In L.A., we call that look "Nickelodeon chic. "
- Wait, L.A.?

- California.
That's awesome, man.
What do you do out there?
- I'm an actor.
- Wow, that's really impressive.
- Thank you, thank you.
- In fucking movies?
"Fucking movies. " Pretty much.
Look at you.
What-?
Anything I've seen?
What movies?
Oh' all sorts of movies with all-male casts.
All-male casts.
Like Glengarry Glen Ross?
Like that?
Like Glen and Gary Suck Ross' Meaty Cock and Drop Their Hairy Nuts in His Eager Mouth.
- Is that like a sequel?
- Sort of.
- It's a re-imagining.
- Oh, like The Wiz.
More erotic and with less women.
No women' to be exact.
I apologize in advance if I am out of line here, but are you in gay porn?
- Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?
- I thought you recognized me, that's-
- Oh, okay, I get it.
You're not in my demographic' so I'm not insulted.
- Not really.
Who's your demographic?
- Do you love pussy?
- I do.
- Then not you.
Oh' okay.
I came here tonight hoping to seduce you and bring you back to my apartment and sleep with you to, uh, get back at you, you know, for calling me Stinky Linky all those years ago.
Wow.
That is a weird revenge plot.
- You must be a terrible lay for that.
- What?
No, I'm great.
I mean, I've had enough practice and everything.
That-
Wow, that sounded not good.
I fuck a lot.
That's what I meant to say.
That doesn't sound good either.
Wow.
You're a lot funnier than I remember.
Thank you.
Gosh, you turned out to be such a nice guy.
It just
- You know' it makes it even easier to just
- To just say this.
Would you like to come back to my place and maybe open a bottle of wine and have ourselves a real high school reunion?
- I-

- I wanted to introduce you to Brandon.
- Salutations.

I'm surprised I forgot that.
Are you fucking with me?
No, they're fucking with each other.
Oh' my God.
- No.
- What?
Granny Panties?
- Excuse me?
- How can you tell?
This is so crazy.
I was literally just watching you, like, right before we got here.
This is so crazy.
This is you, right?
TEEN 1 [ON VIDEO]:
My name's Granny Panties, and nobody wants to fuck me.
TEEN 2:
Nothing's whiter than my big gay ass-
Where'd you get that?
Oh' I entered "gay" and "ass," and it was the top hit.
It's had 200,000 views in three hours.
Honey' you are, like-
I'm jealous right now because you're, like, super famous.
Baby, please take our picture.
I get a picture with Granny Panties.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is awesome.
- All right, smile.
Okay' got it.
- Did you get it?
- Oh, thank you very much.
- E-mail me that.
Oh' because he's the worst photographer.
Okay' good.
- You're gay?
- Yeah.
And I'm on the Internet wearing a diaper?
Who knew you'd come to Pittsburgh and meet a celebrity?
I'm gonna binge-drink now until I pass out.
Okay.
She'll be fine.
So you guys suck each other's cocks, huh?
Oh' like crazy.
[LAUGHING]
Okay, that's enough, I think.
I'm embarrassing him.
I love when he's embarrassed.
He's not living out loud, so he gets all like, ooh.
- You are totally in love, aren't you?
- Zachary' we are.
Wow, I-
Oh' God' I just wanna eat him up, yum, yum.
Save some for me' yum, yum, yum.
- I can't keep my hands off him.
- You've had one too many.
Although he does most of the eating in the sack.
In the sack and of the sack.
All right, that's enough.
Look, you've drunk too much.
You do this every time.
You get too Mary for everybody in the room
- and you can't contain yourself.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
And by containing myself, do you mean containing myself in a closet?
In a closet of denial?
Is that-?
No, no, no.
Holy shit, this just got real.
This is exactly why you haven't met my mother.
You don't know how to ease people into this situation.
- You just force your way in every time.
- I thought, maybe for one second in this godforsaken town, I could be myself.
I'm so sorry.
No, you're right' I should just butch up and pretend that I don't love it when you shove your dick in my mouth.
- This is the best night of my life.
BRANDON:
Am I making a spectacle?
- I could make a much bigger scene.
- You really are.
I'm sorry.
Pittsburgh.
Listen up' Monroe-vers.
My name is Brandon St. Randy' and I love Bobby Long.
- Fucking A. BRANDON:
Is that enough?
Is that enough of a scene?
I could start doing worse than that.
The reason you haven't taken me to your mother's-
Your mother with her makeup and all her drinking, she's in the closet too.
- They fight just like real people.
- I thought I'd be a conduit for you-
Thank you.
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm not.
- Thank you.
- I love you.
- I'll e-mail you.
- Zack, it was so nice to meet you.
And I will be patient with you.
I will be there on your journey.
I will be your Sherpa up the mountain of gayness.
well' might as well see how many hits Granny Panties is up to, huh?
[COMPUTER PLAYS FANFARE]
Did I do that?
[MUSIC PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]
Thanks, George.
What kind of evil fucks turn off your power the day-?
No, the night before Thanksgiving?
Who does that?
Can you get an advance on your card?
Fleshlight maxed-out my $200 limit.
Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.
This is bad.
If we don't come up with rent, we're gonna get locked out.
Who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.
Which means by the time we get home, there's no heat either.
well' I think it's time we put what we always talked about into effect.
- You're gonna have to start hooking.
- You know, you jest, but these are the exact circumstances people find themselves in right before they start having sex for money.
- Yeah.
- Or making porn.
ZACK:
Oh, my God, yeah.
- What?
You got an idea?
We could make a porno.
- Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?
No, that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me?
That's a rad idea.
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend, he said he makes a hundred grand a year because he shoots and distributes his own porno flicks.
If it's so easy, how come everybody doesn't do it?
Because other people have options and dignity, which we do not have, which puts us in an amazingly advantageous position.
Fuck you, I have dignity.
Where?
Is it hidden in your gigantic underpants that are plastered all over the Internet?
Is that where you hide your dignity?
Every woman has a pair of those period panties.
That's, like, a fact.
Okay.
Families.
I bet people don't make porno, because they have families.
But luckily, your parents are dead.
Sorry.
My grandparents are dead.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
So who are we gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone mainstream now.
It's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks in it.
Look at Paris Hilton.
She throat-fucks a guy in night vision, now she's selling fragrances to tweens.
And I'm pretty sure she's legally retarded.
That's for tweens?
Have you seen that Joe Francis guy who made Girls Gone Wild?
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot piece of shit in the world and he has a jet and a fucking island.
Look, there's got to be a less extreme solution to our financial woes here.
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper route.
- I don't have a bike.
- Be a waiter.
No one wants me around their food.
Would you eat food that I gave you?
I would not eat food that you gave me, that's true.
MIRl:
I mean, nobody wants to see us fuck, Zack.
ZACK:
Everybody wants to see anybody fuck.
I hate Rosie O'Donnell, but if someone said' "I got a tape of Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid,"
I'd be like, "Why aren't we watching that right now?"
Because she's famous.
Hello.
So are you.
You're fucking Granny Panties.
My underwear and your ass are famous' we're not.
So who the F would wanna watch us fuck?
- At least 800 people.
- The jerks we went to school with?
- Are you serious?
- Of course.
If you heard that someone we graduated with was in a fucking porno movie, you'd watch it, right?
I'd watch that guy Brandon suck a cock, I just met him.
With this mailing list, we have almost a thousand people that would definitely buy a porno we were in just to be like,
"Hey, I sat next to that guy in Civics.
Look at his fucking dick. "
We sell a thousand copies at 20 bucks a pop, bam' we have paid off our bills.
ZACK:
So' what do you think?
- I don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.
Oh' wow, like you've never done that before.
How many guys have you met in a bar, taken home, banged with your mouth and then never talked to again?
That's what we call a stranger.
Dude, I don't one-night mouth-fuck anybody that I pick up in bars.
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in the porno movie for some weird reason.
I guess...
We could fuck.
- Ew.
- Fuck you.
I mean, you're a nice-enough-looking guy and everything-
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're an all-right-enough-looking girl.
- How does that feel?
- Dude' I'm just saying it'd be weird and wrong, you know, like fucking my brother.
Okay, seriously, we're just talking about sex, okay?
It's for a purpose.
It's for getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.
- Wow.
- Just explain to your private beforehand,
"Look' this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash. "
- Oh, my God.
- What?
You're just doing this because you've always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?
Yes.
I've gone my whole life pretending that I want nothing to do with you, just hoping one day we'd be in such dire financial straits that I could use it to finally make my move on you.
MIRl:
You're just being sarcastic.
- I am.
See' I was pretending to cry right there.
MIRl:
I guess it's not like it'd be creepy, like if we got way too drunk one night and accidentally fucked, you know?
No.
We'd be going in with the understanding that it's-
A business decision.
Strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.
- Right.
- And by end,
I mean, I'll be waxing your ass.
Fuck you.
I'm not even letting you see my ass.
I've seen your ass and the rest of you naked around a billion times already.
- That goes both ways, buddy.
- You've never seen my dick.
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.
Are you kidding?
That party we went to where you got blasted, and Houls dared you to give yourself head, and we all watched you try for, like, an hour.
Oh' yeah.
Thanks by the way, for fucking letting me do that.
Thank you.
Oh' God.
We really do know too much about each other.
See' and this would really just be one more thing.
I mean, look at us.
It's Thanksgiving and we're huddled around a flaming fucking garbage can like a couple of steno bums.
I mean, this could give us a chance to pay off our debt, pay our bills, get a fucking nicer apartment with heat in it maybe.
What are you doing?
Miriam Linky, will you have sex with me on camera for money?
I will.
DELANEY:
A producer?
ZACK:
Yeah.
- Guy who gets to finance the movie.
- You think I got that kind of money?
We just need that.
What you're about to spend on the flat screen.
Now I can't get my flat screen?
Fuck that.
No, no, no.
With your cut of the profits, you're gonna get two flat screens.
One in your living room, one in your bathroom.
One in the bathroom?
You know, it's always been my dream to watch shit while I shit.
Everyone with an ass loves to watch shit while they shit.
- I'm gonna make that happen for you.
- I don't know, man.
What else the producer do?
- Um, they help with the casting.
- What's casting?
Finding the people to be in the movie.
- I get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.
Like, I can look at a titty, make sure there ain't no moles on there?
- You can look at both titties, man.
- Man.
I've been looking at the same busted titties for the past almost 20 years.
- I'm due for another new titty.
- Please help us.
Please.
Please.
Yes.
Yes.
I love you.
well' don't mind that smell.
We had some homeless people squatting in here.
You know, they'd void their bowels everywhere but the bathroom.
Anyway, you pick up the poop and you've got yourself a movie studio.
Why don't we shoot in your apartment?
No power.
You wanna pay our electric bill?
- You motherfuckers...
- We'll take it.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
MAN 1:
Bring it back.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
DEACON:
Oh' Jesus.
Oh' Jesus.
Oh' God.
Come on.
Why the fuck do I have to do everything?
Fuckers.
[CROWD CHEERS]
MAN 2:
Hey, what is that?
DEACON:
Fucking guys.
This fucking team, man.
They fucking suck.
[MAN 2 SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
I'm gonna hatefuck the shit out of you, ref.
- Dude.
- It's cool.
- He's my cousin.
- Hey.
Didn't you used to videotape the varsity basketball games in high school?
Just the away games.
I did it because I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.
Which one?
Whichever one wanted to fuck the guy who taped the varsity games.
- Aw.
- Still know how to work a camera?
- Who cares what the title is?
- The porn I liked when I was a kid, it was always, like, a spoof of a popular movie, you know?
Like, um, Edward Penishands.
Okay, so we need a mildly clever, vaguely dirty title, that sounds like a real movie
- and sums up what you're gonna see.
- Correct.
An American Werewolf in Brenda?
Fuckback Mountain?
- Too soon?
A Cock-in-Lips Now?
MIRl:
Next.
Cradle the balls.
Work the shaft.
Jerk my come-crayon and let me color you white.
I need cock and I need it now.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
It's "puss" as in pussy.
Oh' because I was like' who would wanna fuck puss?
I want to slam my ham in your can, woman.
Scene.
- This guy is amazing.
- This guy's great-looking too.
I wanna fuck him.
DELANEY:
Hi, my name's Delaney and I'm a producer.
I really don't know what it means.
I'm gonna be honest' this is my first time.
You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna touch you or nothing like that.
- All right.
- I have a wife, you know.
We're happy.
I mean, not happy' but it's cool, you know.
Just so you know, there will be some fucking.
- We'll talk about that if you get the part.
- Okay.
I mean, not
- We won't be fucking, there'll be fucking in the movie.
Like I said' I got a wife.
She don't play that shit.
- She is a crazy bitch.
- Yep.
It's my job as the producer to see what you got.
So if that makes you uncomfortable in any way, you don't have to show me anything you don't wanna show me, because-
I love the movies.
- Lawrence of a Labia.
- No.
- Oh, come on.
- Dawn of the Dick.
Yeah, but how are zombies doing it at all sexy?
I want to eat your brain and your ass.
[GROANING]
- Dude.
- Sci-fi.
Yeah.
Close Encounters With a Turd From Behind.
- I don't know what that means.
- Just asses.
Fucking deep in asses.
[TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
What?
We're making a porno and we just need to know what you would be or would not be interested in doing.
If anything.
- No anal.
- Oh, definitely no anal.
Anal and hugging.
I don't do ass stuff.
- Anal.
- Ah, fuck.
- Oh, wait, oral.
I like anal.
- Yay.
Okay, well, so, uh, do you have any special skills?
Special skills?
I can get a boner really quick and it sticks straight up.
- Is that really a special skill?
- I think.
- Can you show us what you mean?
- Sure.
Oh' that is special.
[ZACK CHUCKLES]
Yeah, you're hired, Mr. -
- Who are you again?
- Lester.
Lester "The Molester" Cockinshtuff.
- No.
- Wow.
That is the best porn name I've ever heard' man.
I can have a porn name?
- Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.
Are you Granny Panties?
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The panties are actually in the house.
- I'll get them.
- Whoa.
- Star Sex 2:
The Wrath of Cunt.
MIRl:
We never made a Star Sex 1.
I guess we can lose Star Sex 3:
The Search for Cock, then.
- Cocunt.
- What's that?
It's Cocoon with a cunt.
[LAUGHING]
So Delaney tells us you have a special talent of some sort.
I don't know if I'd call it a special talent, but it's a little something I picked up doing bachelor parties.
It would probably be easier if I just showed you.
- Great.
- The floor is yours.
So a movie, huh?
That could be fun.
Holy fuck.
Her name's Bubbles.
- Invasion of the Potty-Snatchers?
- That's like MAD Magazine stupid.
well' fuck you' okay?
You try to think of a good sci-fi porno title.
It's hard.
MIRl:
There's gotta be one we haven't thought of that would say it all' not be ridiculously filthy and off-putting, and still have instant recognition with our audience.
- I got it.
- I got it.
- Star Whores.
- Yeah.
It's funny' right?
See' we figured this opens us up to an even bigger sales market beyond the people we went to school with.
People who like comics and sci-fi.
Comics?
Like "Ziggy"?
"Ziggy"?
Is that even in fucking papers anymore?
No, man.
Fuck you. "Ziggy" is a comic' right next to "Family Circus. "
No, like Spider-Man and shit, you know?
There's always a shitload of Star Wars nerds at those comic-book shows.
So we sell them a Princess Leia they can really fucking jerk off to.
- That'd be me, Princess Lay-Her.
- Who am I playing?
You' my friend, are the lead role of Lubed Guy-Baller.
Man' he's gonna be balling dudes?
I thought you said this was boys on girls.
If I have to fuck a guy' okay, but I'd rather fuck a girl.
What's wrong with you, boy?
- We'll change the name to Sky-Baller.
- Sky-Baller.
I will be Hung So-low.
Delaney, my friend, you are On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
Man' I can't be in no porno.
My wife will kill me.
Hump me, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
You're my only hump.
On the other hand, fuck my wife.
Unfortunately, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over does not have any sex in the movie but the droids do, I
- CUP and R2-T-Bag.
I robot.
And Stacey over here is gonna play Darth Vibrator.
- I'm the bad guy?
- She's not a guy, Zack.
I know that because I'm not a fucking idiot.
In our movie, Darth Vibrator is a bad girl who wants to fuck the galaxy, literally' and it's up to Lubed and Hung to stop her with their cocks.
- You and me get to have sex, then?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- I know.
Isn't that awesome?
Hold up, hold up.
So who's all having sex with who in this movie?
As of last night, I was having sex with Zack.
What?
Han Solo ain't never had no sex with Princess Leia in the Star Wars.
ZACK:
Guys' this isn't a literal adaptation here.
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.
Kind of like The Wiz or like a parody.
With lots of anal.
- Cool.
- I know, isn't that awesome?
I have a question, do Princess Lay-Her and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?
Uh, no, because they're brother and sister, and according to Miri' brothers and sisters can't fuck.
But you said, that this wasn't a literal translation, so that means Lester's character could have sex with Miri's character.
Because I would love to fucking eat her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.
Dream on, pal, it's never gonna happen, okay?
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See' she's fine
- Wait, what?
Yep.
I mean, everyone else is having sex with more than one person in this movie all of a sudden, so I think it's' you know' not fair if I'm only fucking you.
Guys, read amongst yourselves, okay?
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Look, Miri, we got plenty of sex going on in this thing, you don't have to do that.
Zack, it's fine.
I mean I have slept with way worse-looking guys than Lester.
I just wanna do my part for the movie like everyone else.
You're having sex in the movie, you don't need to fuck someone else.
- You're good.
- I'm only fucking you' though.
So don't we need to vary it up to keep it fair?
Fair for-?
I don't
- What?
Fair for who?
What are these, blood diamonds we're talking about?
Fair for everyone else who is fucking more than one person, a. k. a. you' in the movie.
- I mean, fine-
- All right.
I mean, if you don't care-
I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
Fuck.
I don't give a shit.
Like you said, you know, you've fucked bigger idiots than Lester.
Holy shit.
Are we really gonna shoot this in outer space?
Maybe not bigger idiots.
[MOUTHS] Thank you.
- Cut.
All right, guys, that's it.
- Yeah.
Make sure you leave your costume so we know they're here for tomorrow.
Mostly, everybody, thank you so much for helping us get ready' you know.
Cleaning this place out, building the sets, sewing the costumes, it's just-
I mean, it's really amazing.
Thank you.
ZACK:
Seriously, thanks.
But this is just the beginning, guys.
If Star Whores works, and it wilI' we are set up for sequels galore.
The Empire Strikes Ass.
- Return of the Brown-Eye.
- The Phantom Man-Ass.
And Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter.
- Okay.
- Revenge of the Shit.
- You got it?
- Yeah, no, we got it.
Ew.
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.
- We'll talk about that one.
We're gonna have a lot of fun' but more importantly, we're gonna make a lot of fucking money' okay?
- Yeah.
- So get ready for greatness, people.
Tomorrow we start principal photography.
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
- All right, good night, you guys.
- We got a movie.
- What?
- Nothing.
I think someone should acknowledge how insane and amazing this is
- and it's all because of you.
- I don't know.
It's just a porno.
You know what I mean.
You've really come into your own.
Shut the fuck up.
So speaking of coming into things' ready for tomorrow?
Twenty years' we're finally gonna know what it's like to have sex with each other.
You say that like you've been wondering what it'd be like to sleep with me for a while now.
Why the fuck do you think I started hanging out with you?
I knew it.
Here, help.
Let's just promise that it's not gonna change anything between us, okay?
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Some guys can't keep sex in perspective.
If anyone's gotta keep this in perspective, it's you, okay?
I don't want you getting all mushy and gooey on me after I give you the best orgasm you've ever had.
Oh' like you know what you're doing down there at all.
I actually don't.
Where's the clitoris?
Is it in your ass?
Just, you know, make sure you kind of whoop it up and act like I'm a stud who knows what he's doing' okay?
Just be a pal.
Oh' dude, I am gonna Meryl Streep the fuck out of this tomorrow, you watch.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
No.
Really, thank you.
For everything.
You're welcome.
Less than 12 hours and we make Monroeville history.
- I really hope nothing goes wrong.
- It's a movie.
What could go wrong?
ZACK:
What are you doing?
DELANEY:
What's up?
- What the fuck?
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait.
- Wait.
- Stop.
Stop.
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck is going on?
Condos is what's going on, as soon as this shit-hole's demo'd.
No, you gotta stop it right now.
We rented this place for a month from Mr. Jenkins.
Sounds like your Mr. Jenkins was full of shit.
Luxury Homesteads bought this place a month ago.
I'm gonna kill that lying old fuck.
You're gonna have to go Florida, that's where he moved.
We've got thousands of dollars of equipment in there.
- Please.
- If you wanna sift through this rubble when we're done, be my guest.
Hey, get that fucking beam down.
MIRl:
This is the last thing you wanna hear.
If you don't get an advance,
I don't think we're gonna keep a roof over our heads.
I got an advance already.
It went into all the costumes.
- So all our money's gone?
- All your money?
Never mind what my wife's gonna do when there ain't no new snow tires, or when she sees I charged a video camera.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this' man.
DELANEY:
I just wanted to see some free titties.
That's all.
But there's no such thing as free titties' is there, Zack?
- Is there?
- Fuck this noise.
Why don't we get another camera, and shoot something else?
Where are we gonna do that?
Got another sound stage?
Sound stage?
We had a shit-covered garage we turned into a sound stage.
We find someplace new and we do it again.
[DOOR SQUEAKS]
How?
Okay, I'm broke, man.
No, make that' I was broke.
Now I am really tapped out.
I have to get another job to pay Delaney back.
So please tell me, how can I afford to start over?
- What can I get you?
- Yeah, can I get a, uh-?
Too fucking late.
Cappuccino, 3.50.
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
I mean, I'm a total loser in every single other aspect of my life.
What made me think I could do something as simple as filming people fucking?
We have no money left, nowhere to shoot, no sets, we have no fucking cameras.
Here.
It's time I go back to my regular life where I am a quiet fuckup who doesn't cost anybody any money and knows his goddamn position behind this fucking counter making cappuccinos for this fucking guy.
Oh' yeah.
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
ZACK:
Oh' yeah.
Yeah.
Fuck, yes.
Zack.
[CHUCKLES]
You sneaky Indian motherfucker.
I tell you, yes.
Swallow My Cockuccino.
- What?
- That's it.
That's the movie.
Why didn't I think of it before?
We don't need sets or a stage.
Look at all this production value, waiting to have balls on it.
Hold up.
You wanna shoot a dirty movie here, where we work?
Yes.
Fuck, yes, I do.
You know how many stories I have from working here?
How many times I've been laid right there after hours?
You've never gotten laid here after hours.
I know.
Thank you for reminding me.
But I always wish I had, and that's what porno is.
It's fantasy.
It's taking the normal and making it abnormal by fucking it.
Don't do that.
The little dog don't like that.
How did you get a camera?
By being a terrible, untrustworthy employee, that's how.
Give me today, I'll bang out a script.
Meet me back here after closing.
We're gonna launch arching ropes of jism all over this motherfucker.
Peace.
I like that guy but if he tries to fuck that little dog tonight for real,
I'm calling the Humane Society.
It's called Bean-N-Gone, so get the fuck out of here.
Hey, Barry.
ZACK:
Stand by, Stace' picture's up.
- Okay.
ZACK:
Roll tape.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 12, Take 1.
ZACK:
And action.
I'd like a double espresso so I can stay up all night because I'm in the mood to fuck.
well' I am a whore-ista, so I love to fuck.
Would you like to fuck me?
Holy fuck.
You mean, after you're done with your shift?
I mean during my shift.
- Sorry.
- Keep going, keep going.
With your shaft.
Let us fuck.
Cue music.
[FUNK MUSIC PLAYING]
Okay, open up to camera, guys.
Let us see it.
More tongue.
Little less tongue.
Oh' that was good.
[CASH REGISTER BEEPING]
Cue effects.
[MOANING]
Oh' yeah, like that.
Oh' yeah.
See' I told you it would work.
Didn't I tell you?
It looks amazing.
It's incredible.
STACEY:
Oh' the beans hurt.
Easy.
- Move in for coverage.
- Nice.
That's why we got him.
- Nice.
I'm impressed.
- Get in there, Deacon.
- Come on.
- Like that?
Like that.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
- Pull out a bit, actually.
STACEY:
That's hot.
No, not you, Lester.
Put it back in.
Kiss the muscle.
- I kiss the muscle.
- You kiss the muscle.
- Can he slap her ass a little?
- Don't be a fucking pervert, dude.
- Stir, come on.
Stir.
- Yeah, stir it.
Stir it, baby.
Hey.
- Holy.
- Shit.
Are you guys still open?
No.
We close at 9.
I need coffee so I'm drive home.
- Okay.
Yeah.
MAN:
Thank you.
That's a cute kitty.
Okay.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You guys see the game?
I was at it.
Fucking Roethlisberger, the quarterback, was all fucking'
"Hug it' chug it, football.
All night. " Heh-heh.
Okay, paI' here you go.
On the house.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Have a good one.
- Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- I said, have a good one.
Oh.
- Okay.
Keep moving.
MAN:
You and your little dog.
Go Steelers.
Action.
Oh' yeah.
Yeah, yeah, like that.
Oh' fuck it' chuck it' football.
Oh' yeah.
BARRY:
Oh' God' this is good.
[BARRY MOANING]
You take it.
You take it.
Take it, Barry.
Oh, take it.
Take it, Barry.
Take it.
I'm disturbed at how turned on I am by this.
- Shit, dude' it's almost 6.
- Oh, fuck.
Okay, that's a wrap, everybody, yeah.
Let's give a hand to our hotties with the bodies from last night.
Stacey, Lester, Bubbles, Barry' whoo.
LESTER:
Yeah.
ZACK:
Nice.
Okay, when we come back tonight, we finish up the venti-vulva scene' and then we get into me and Miri's stuff.
Again' amazing first night, everybody.
Thank you so much.
Let us fuck.
- Hey' how'd it look?
- How do you think it looked?
It looked like shit going into other shit, in focus.
What an artist.
That was Kurosawa's motto. "Shit going into other shit. "
Oh' man, I can't believe you gotta work now.
It's okay.
You know, honestly, I don't think I could sleep.
- I'm pretty, like, pumped up right now.
- Right?
It was amazing.
It was awesome.
I think the cast and crew had a good time.
- We were getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.
I just wanna keep shooting people boning all day.
I don't think I've ever met the ambitious Zack Brown before.
- Well' I'm trying to pay the bills, so...
- It's not a bad thing.
I think it looks good on you.
ZACK:
Come on, hurry.
Come on, come on' come on.
BUBBLES:
Wait a minute.
- You guys never did it before?
MIRl:
It's fine.
You know, we talked about it and it's just for the movie.
We're friends' you know' we're just friends.
And we will always just be just friends, so...
Listen' I have some extra lube from last night.
I understand it's kind of hard getting wet when everyone's watching.
At least it was for Barry.
- I don't know if I am gonna need it.
- Really?
Yeah, I think I'm just excited.
Uh-huh.
At the idea of people watching' not because of Zack.
Oh' God.
Zack could never have that effect on me in a million years.
- Hello, Miriam.
- Oh, hey.
Wow.
- Your face.
- Yeah.
Weird, huh?
I don't think I've seen your face since senior year.
ZACK:
I think I made a mistake.
I did it for you so you wouldn't get road rash during our scene, but I should have asked first' I look like a fucking beluga whale.
I think I'll be going now.
ZACK:
Okay.
[CLEARING THROAT]
All I keep thinking is we should've done a trial run at home last week or something.
- Oh, my God.
Right?
- I know.
[LAUGHING]
- You're still cool to do it, though, right?
- Yeah, um.
Totally.
Are you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I'm, uh...
- Honestly, I'm a little nervous, I guess.
- You are?
- It's kind of a big deal.
- It is?
Yeah, you know, it's our first time together since our auspicious debut on viral video.
Oh' yeah.
That's a fuckload of pressure for a director.
As a director, please.
What about the anxiety I'm feeling as an actress?
- Did I pick the right project?
- Yeah.
What about this follow-up?
Julia Roberts followed Pretty Waman with Sleeping With the Enemy.
I'm following Granny Panties with Swallow My Cockuccino.
Only difference is this movie's about cock-sucking and her movie just sucked cock, period.
- The only difference, yeah.
- The end was pretty rad.
I liked that.
- When she kills him.
- With a gun.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- She calls the cops first.
- She calls it in first.
- It was so awesome.
- Awesome, yeah.
So I guess we should do this.
I think we should probably wait just until I lose another 20 or 30 pounds.
Stop it.
You look good.
Thanks.
So, what about me?
How do I look?
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful, so I guess it's not a big deal, but you look amazing.
- Okay.
Let's go make a porno.
- Okay.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 8, Take 1.
DEACON:
Come here.
- I'm over-?
All right, settle.
Action.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Who could it be?
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm a delivery man and I have some cream for you.
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.
I work out.
So do you want me to give you your cream now?
I've been waiting for it all day.
- Fuck.
Come on.
- Oops.
[WHISPERS] Keep going.
I spilled my cream.
Do you mind?
I don't mind.
Especially if you spill it on my face.
Let us fuck.
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
- Fix my shirt.
Think I should?
- Okay.
Let me see them titties.
Actually, you know what?
Sorry, I don't think we should show them.
- What?
- We shouldn't show your breasts.
- Aren't you gonna take your shirt off?
- I'm just gonna open it.
You're not gonna take it off?
Why not?
My tits are bigger than yours.
I don't wanna show that.
She's not gonna show her tits?
I showed my cock and my asshole.
- Okay, I'll do your pants.
- Back and forth. okay.
- Holy shit.
- Where's that delivery?
I can't believe this.
I was delivering cream, and look what's happening.
- Jesus, what is that, a rumba?
- What's a rumba?
That awkward movement.
- Should I take your underpants off?
- Yeah, take them off.
ZACK:
What the fuck?
How does this work?
They're just like
- I'll do it.
- I'll do mine, you just
- You do yours.
- I'll do my pants.
Granny panties.
Just get on with it already.
I'm gonna fuck you with my pecker.
Dude, that's really dirty.
- That's too dirty?
- That offends me.
- Penis?
- Fine.
- I'm gonna fuck you with my penis.
- I can't wait.
For my penis.
Be careful, Miri.
Okay, there we go.
Just keep rolling, keep rolling.
- I'll walk forward.
- Fucking cream is coming.
This is the worst porno I've ever seen.
MIRl:
Get over here, delivery man.
ZACK:
Let's fuck on these beans.
[GRUNTING]
- You okay?
- Yup.
ZACK:
Okay' all right.
- Just leave them.
Just leave them.
- They're really distracting.
- You should leave them.
- You gotta get your
- There you go.
ZACK:
Okay' okay.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.
This okay?
Okay.
Okay, uh.
- We'll start kissing on three' okay?
- Okay.
One, two, three.
Go.
MIRl:
I'm ready.
- I'm ready.
- Okay.
Deacon.
- Deacon.
Deacon.
- What?
Did you see Lost this week, man?
I missed it.
What happened?
They're on the island, off the island.
Who can follow that?
I think they're in hell.
Would you all shut the motherfuck up?
[MOANING]
I want you to come.
- I want you to come with me.
- Okay.
Oh' God.
ZACK:
Oh' God.
Cut.
That's it?
It's over?
Ain't he supposed to come on her titties?
well' it wasn't what we'd shot-listed' but that was nice.
- It was so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack.
Thanks, Lester, uh.
It wasn't just me, though, guys.
Give it up for my radiant costar here, Miri.
[CHEERING]
LESTER:
Nice.
- Um, show's over in here.
Let's move out' start lighting the next scene.
- All right.
LESTER:
Let's do it.
BUBBLES:
You looked so beautiful.
- Thanks.
DELANEY:
I thought they were gonna be fucking hard.
- It was pretty.
DELANEY:
Pretty don't sell.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
You good, Mir?
You need anything?
I'm just gonna take a minute, okay?
Okay, uh.
I'll just be out there.
Yeah.
- That was fun.
- Yeah, fun.
ZACK [WHISPERS]:
"Fun. " You fucking douche.
[SIGHS]
Wow.
- Hey.
ZACK:
Hey.
- You working on a rewrite?
- Yeah, just for tonight's scene.
- I'm ready to go when you are, though.
- Okay.
You know, before we go, I...
I'm thinking that, uh, it's a good idea if we talk about what happened last night.
- Oh.
- I mean, we don't have to' but I think-
Okay, yeah, uh.
I kind of dropped the ball on that, I guess, huh?
- No, no.
It's...
- To be honest, it was...
You know, I didn't realize how weird it would be for me.
Weird?
Like
- Weird how?
Acting and directing at the same time.
It's a lot to process, you know.
For the first time' I thought my balls didn't have enough hair on them.
That's not what I meant.
I know what you meant.
How you feeling about it?
I guess, um...
I feel like...
Like we...
- Holy fuck.
- The power's on.
Did you do this?
ZACK:
How did this happen?
I burned the bills.
How could we have done that?
- The water.
- The water.
MIRl:
Come on, come on' come on.
Yeah!
- We can shower in our home again.
- We are liquid.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Greetings.
Have you heard the good news about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?
Oh' my God, did you guys do this?
We got tired of you taking showers at our places all the time.
So we took up a collection amongst ourselves.
And chipped away at your mountain of debt.
You guys paid off our massive utilities bills?
- How did you afferd that?
- I stole my old lady's bingo winnings.
And Mistress Bubbles did a bachelor party tonight at which yours truly was a guest star, thank you very much.
- Oh.
- Whoa.
Don't get too excited.
We didn't pay off your whole bill.
Just a month of each.
They agreed to turn everything back on?
At 9 at night?
How does that work?
Stacey knows somebody that works at Power and Light.
- You guys...
- This is amazing.
You didn't have to do this.
You didn't have to put us in your movie.
- Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.
- Or put us in your movie either.
- We said that already.
Guys, honestly, I don't know what to say.
You can start by saying we can take tonight off so we can have our wrap party right now.
Guys, we're not wrapped.
We still have four days of shooting left.
Excuse me.
In my "producoriaI" capacity,
I'm shutting the movie down for a night so we can get a little silly.
[DMX'S "PARTY UP (UP IN HERE)" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
[THE PIXIES' "HEY" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
[COIN CLINKING AND PEOPLE CHATTERING]
Go' go' go.
- Yes.
- Yes.
[LAUGHING]
You all drink.
Was it just amazing with him, after all those years of not knowing?
It was, um, weird.
- But good.
- My scene with Zack's tomorrow.
You don't say.
But I'm a little nervous.
I was thinking about trying to get with him tonight.
- Really?
- I mean, if you don't mind.
You are just friends and all' so I didn't think it would be a biggie.
- It wouldn't be a biggie, would it?
- No.
No, no.
It's not a biggie.
What?
No.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Stacey' I'm not married to the guy, so...
I don't know.
You guys just looked kind of intimate last night.
- We did?
- Yeah.
well' we're just better actors than I thought, I think, so you know what?
If you wanna get with him' you should just go ask him.
- He'd be really excited to hear that.
- Yeah?
For real, you don't mind?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
DEACON:
All the quarters are on the ground.
ZACK:
Hey, Stace.
- Hey' Zack.
[WHISPERING]
DEACON:
Come on, are you guys playing or what?
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
well' I'm bummed, but I totally get it.
It's no problem to work with Lester again.
He has a nice cock.
well' you're a trouper, Stace.
Oh' but if I start making weird faces or anything during the scene' it's just because I've been constipated all day.
Oh' shit' uh.
We don't have to shoot the scene tonight.
No, I want to.
anal's great for when you're constipated.
It totally loosens you up.
I use ex-lax' but good to know.
Okay, I never thought I would have that conversation.
So are we starting with Lester and Stacey tonight?
We were supposed to start with Lester and Miri.
I know.
She
- We're not gonna do that.
I don't think Miri's gonna...
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
...do that.
Hey.
So where are we shooting this?
Over here?
- What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.
Our scene's tonight, right?
Can I talk to you for a minute in the back?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
What do you want me to shoot here?
Start with the close-ups of Lester and Stacey.
Give me a second, man.
What an artist.
Okay, uh.
Did I do something wrong to you?
No.
Then why are you here?
I'm here for the same reason you're here.
To make the movie.
Okay, just, like' for your own personal information, you're acting really weird right now.
I'm acting weird?
I think you're acting weird right now.
Oh' I'm acting- How exactly am I acting weird?
You've been trying to keep me from fucking anybody but you since we started this thing.
Maybe I was thinking about your feelings.
Were you thinking of my feelings when you were banging Stacey?
Because that'd be really sad for Stacey.
She told me that you told her that that was okay.
I told her that it was okay to ask you.
Holy shit.
I get it.
I fucking get it.
It was a test.
That whole thing was a fucking test, is that it?
If it was, how do you think you did?
We had a discussion, Miri.
We had
- Actually, we had many discussions about how it was just sex
- and how we wouldn't let it get weird.
- I'm not acting weird.
You're acting like a jealous girlfriend is what the fuck you're acting like.
- I am not your girlfriend.
- I know that.
You're not my boyfriend, so why are we having this conversation right now?
Because you're about to fuck Lester to spite me, it seems like.
Did you fuck Stacey to spite me?
No.
You fucked her like you fucked every other bitch and never gave a shit how I felt about it.
- Well' that was before.
- Before what?
Look, don't fucking pretend that the other night, you and me, right there, that that didn't mean anything to you, that you didn't feel it too.
Oh.
You're not getting all gooey on me here, are you, Zack?
You know what?
If you were any other bitch I didn't give a rat's ass about,
I would tell you to go fuck yourself right now because I fucking hate this game-playing shit.
But you, you mean more to me than that' so I'm just gonna lay this out on front street.
I know you felt something big, something real the other night when we were together because I felt it too.
We tried to fuck and instead, we wound up making love.
So if this is what you need to hear in order to keep you from fucking Lester, if this is what you need, then fine.
Here it is, I'm gonna say it.
I love you, Miri.
Happy?
Oh' Jesus.
You better get ahold of yourself, Zack, because we just fucked.
Okay.
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?
But you did.
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.
[WHISPERS] Wait-
All right, don't forget I'm down here.
Watch that pullout, huh?
STACEY:
Yeah.
Mmm.
This is some damn good coffee.
- Where you going?
- Getting the fuck out of here.
We gotta finish this movie.
[GASPS]
Yo!
[COUGHING AND GROANING]
You believe this shit?
Do you believe this shit?
What the fuck just happened in there?
I'll tell you what just happened in there.
That chick frosted me like I was a fucking cake.
Zack.
TEEN 1:
Okay, seriously' get a picture of me right now.
I'm hunting humans.
- Dude' check it out.
Ooh.
- Oh, shit.
Seriously, let's shoot the shit out of this bitch.
- Where you aiming at?
- Cock shots?
Cock shots.
[BUZZER RINGS]
[BUZZER RINGS]
We shot you in the balls, cunt nugget.
well' it's my job to get shot in the balls, so
- Oh, they're gone.
MAN:
Excuse me.
Didn't you used to work at the Bean-N-Gone in Monroeville?
I sure as shit hope this pays better, I tell you.
[CHATTERING]
So why don't they just shoot you with a puck?
What do you mean?
I mean, what does paintball got to do with hockey?
Nothing, I guess.
- So ain't no prizes or-?
- No, no.
So, what are they paying $5 for?
To shoot a Broad Street Bully in the balls.
White people are fucked up.
Yup' they sure are.
It's a living.
You've been getting the checks I've been sending?
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Probably didn't save you from a brutal tongue-lashing, though, huh?
You know, the wife never found out about the camera, because I paid off the bills.
How did you manage that?
- Because now I'm Oprah rich.
- No way.
- The post office fucking settled?
- Hundred-sixty large' son.
- Nice, man.
Congratulations.
- A beautiful day, thank you very much.
I thought you made that whole thing up.
No, no.
It was very real.
You can believe it.
Even though she's spending all of it.
well' since you ain't gonna ask me, I'll just go ahead and tell you.
- No, I have not seen Miri.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.
Oh' I suppose you weren't gonna ask about your movie, neither?
Look, that's why I came down here.
I need you to come take a look at it.
- I'm not interested.
Sorry.
- You'd better get interested
- because you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?
The story doesn't make sense.
- The story?
- The story doesn't make sense.
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?
It's a movie, dog, and a movie's gotta have an ending, which we don't have at the moment.
Come shot, credits.
There's your fucking ending.
Do me this favor, okay?
When you're done getting your nuts blown off' come back to humble Monroeville to my crib for a couple hours' check out the flick, you tell me what's missing.
No.
I'll tell you what, you do that, you don't owe me shit no more.
- Really?
- Really.
- Is your wife home?
- Yes.
- Maybe I should leave the pads on.
- You got some extra ones?
Hey, honey.
Where the fuck you been?
And who in the fuck is this now?
Would you calm down, woman?
Goddamn.
You already left one white boy down in my basement while you off gallivanting and shit.
What if this motherfucker
- was all grabby on me?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
Oh' what in the fuck is that supposed to mean?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
WIFE:
White boys love me.
White boy.
- I said, white boy.
- Yeah?
You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?
- Should I say yes?
- Just say yes.
Yeah.
- Why don't you, uh, head downstairs?
- Oh, okay.
It's just through this hallway.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
What the fuck you looking at?
Why you gotta be yelling at me in front of my director?
- Oh, he's a director?
- Yeah.
I didn't know that.
Shit, he's a director.
well' why don't he direct my ass to a new husband?
How about that shit?
- That's the bedroom.
DELANEY:
Keep talking, maybe he will.
Oh' don't nobody want them saggy-ass balls!
Saggy balls?
Look at these sagging-ass titties you got around here.
- You could tie these together.
- Motherfucker, we match.
Oh' shit.
Where's my paintball gun at?
Look at you, editor and DP.
You got your shit covered, man.
Please, don't ever say "shit-covered" to me again.
Roll the film for the man, please, so we can see what he thinks.
Just jump through it.
I ain't got all night.
The bitch is on me.
"Nigga Rich Productions. " Classy.
- Yeah, DreamWorks was taken.
- Was it?
Plus' it sounds like an underground gay fuck club.
"I met a guy at DreamWorks. " Yeah.
All right, so we got Lester and Stacey fucking.
Then we got Barry and Bubbles fucking.
And then this boring bullshit.
Okay, just, uh, go to the next scene, would you?
Uh...
- What next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?
We never shot it.
- Why not?
- Because after you left that night,
Miri came out of the backroom and said she couldn't do it.
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped?
So...
- Wait, so Miri-
- Never fucked nobody.
Just you.
Now, I wonder why she did that.
- Hm.
- Hm.
You see, there was a time when I was just a bitter old fuck making coffees, and Stacey was just a lap dancer and Barry and Bubbles didn't know each other and this fool here, hell, I don't even know what he was.
- A white supremacist.
- Man' fuck you.
Then two people come along and showed us something we didn't know existed.
A world of possibilities where plain old people just like us could do something special.
Even if it's something as simple as filming people fucking.
Sometimes we just need someone to show us something we can't see for ourselves
and then we're changed forever.
So as you can see' our movie ain't got no ending.
Every movie needs an ending' don't it?
Peace.
Delaney, you're a slick cupid motherfucker.
Ain't love grand?
WIFE:
Why the fuck is this white boy running through my goddamn house?
[DOOR SLAMS]
Sometimes.
Miri.
- Miri.
MIRl:
Zack?
ZACK:
Miri.
I'm sorry.
MIRl:
Get out.
- Close the door.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over-
- Just close the fucking door' Zack.
I never slept with Stacey that night, okay?
I swear to God.
When we got into my room, you know what we did?
We talked about you, and us and how things were different and how I was too much of a fucking pussy to just tell you how I felt about you.
And I know
- I know that that's only because of all the stupid shit we said about how we wouldn't let sex change us, but it did.
It changed me.
That has to be love, right?
It has to be love and just so you know, I can't go back to being just friends anymore,
- because I just can't.
- Good.
And I think-
I think that you feel the same way.
Because that night after I left, you didn't fuck Lester.
What's up, Zack?
You know what?
I don't care that you're fucking Lester, okay?
How's that?
- Oh, shit.
- I don't wanna be with anyone but you.
So I will wait forever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life because I love you, and I have for as long as I can remember.
And I would rather die than be without you, Miriam Linky.
Miri's last name is Linky?
You're gonna fuck a guy who doesn't know your last name?
Or that you beat up Carl Roth in the sixth grade?
I know that.
Or what your senior prom dress would've looked like had we gone but we decided not to, and we got drunk alone instead.
Or that you washed your hair in the toilet.
We're not fucking' Zack.
Or that you're not fucking Zack- What?
I asked her to fuck me.
She wouldn't do it.
I even tried to talk her into giving me the fucking Dutch rudder.
Shot me down on that too.
- And a Dutch rudder is?
- Don't know what a Dutch rudder-?
All right, you grab your dick, then you have someone else work your arm.
Here, let me show you.
All right, grab my arm.
I'm grabbing my dick, you're grabbing my arm.
Now work it.
Work my arm.
See that shit?
Work it up and down.
It's like someone else is jerking you off.
Okay.
There's the double Dutch rudder, which' I grab my dick, you grab your dick, you work my arm, I work your arm' same time.
It's like jerking off together but not gay.
We're not touching dicks, each other's dicks anyway.
I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.
It feels good, sir.
Try me, come on.
Sorry to change the subject on you, Lester, but if you're not fucking Miri, why is your dick out right now?
Because I live here now, and I like to be naked.
- What?
- When you moved out, she couldn't afford to pay her rent by herself, so I moved in to help.
But you just came out of her room.
That's my room now.
She moved in your old room.
Wait, wait, wait.
She changed rooms?
Yeah, she said she did it because she missed the smell of you or some shit.
[SNIFFS]
I don't smell anything.
But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.
- Night, Zack.
- Night.
Do you?
Then why are you crying?
Because I missed you so much.
ZACK:
Me too.
I love you.
- I love you, I love you.
ZACK:
I love you.
I don't mean to alarm you but I think I just jerked off Lester a little bit.
- The Dutch rudder?
- Yeah, it's ingenious, right?
If you ask me nicely, I will Dutch-rudder you the rest of our lives.
Good.
I'm getting tired of fucking the Fleshlight.
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.
- What'd it feel like?
- Like fucking a flashlight.
LESTER:
Wrong room.
- Oh, God.
That's gross.
Let us fuck.
MAN:
You little motherfucker!
Get up, Zack.
Come on, I don't wanna be late for work.
MIRl:
Ahh!
Get out!
- Jesus, fuck!
Close the door if you're gonna take a shit.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over, it was not closed.
- Close the door, Zack!
- Okay, okay.
MIRl:
God.
- Fine.
- What's that thing?
- It's a hand warmer.
[SIGHS]
We're going now.
- You smell that?
Is that the car?
Fuck.
- Oh, goddamn it.
- What?
What?
- Oh, it's wedged in my taint.
- What is?
- It got wedged in my taint.
- What?
- It's stuck under my balls.
- It's between my balls and my leg.
- What's happening?
- Please, pull over.
Pull the fuck over!
- Okay, all right!
Jesus, okay.
ZACK:
It's about to move up to my ass.
MIRl:
What?
ZACK:
The movement makes it hotter.
It's tucked under them.
It's stuck under them.
[GRUNTING]
Oh, fuck.
I think I burned my ball hair off.
[LAUGHING]
It's not funny.
Can you help me pick out an outfit for tonight?
I'm working till 6.
- Well, I can try stuff on at the store.
- The store?
No, how about instead, you get a friend?
But you are my friend.
I mean a girl friend, jeez.
[JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING O VER SPEAKERS]
Mr. Delaney, can you work for me tomorrow?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
Then you must come in the next day, I tell you.
- It's Black Friday.
- Black Friday?
It's the biggest mall-shopping day of the year.
And since the mall is just up the street, I would like you to come out and work.
- On Black Friday.
- Oh, yeah.
All right, you want me to work on Moolie Monday too?
- I'm sorry?
- How about Nigga Tuesday?
- Nigga Tuesday?
This a new holiday?
- You come to a brother and tell him he gotta work on Black Friday.
You got any idea how racist that sounds?
Telling me to work.
What, you think you own me?
- I never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?
You thought,
"I'm gonna lay down the law for this nigga, I put food on his table, clothes on his nigga baby backs, and he ain't gonna say shit."
- This ain't Amistad.
- You shut up.
You goddamn right this ain't Amistad.
I can't wait till the post office settles my disability suit because then I'm gonna be out this motherfucker.
I'm gonna be Oprah rich.
Y'all can kiss my ass.
You know what?
Fuck you.
Fuck you, and suck cock.
- To hell with you.
DELANEY:
To hell with you.
- Zachary will work.
Zack, my boy.
- Yeah.
- The customer with the harelip...
- Oh, yeah.
- Speak me, say you were playing baseball here the other night.
Wiffle ball.
And, uh, no, that wasn't me.
Maybe the harelip makes it sound like "baseball."
ZACK:
Yeah, maybe you hear with an accent.
- Fuck you, okay?
- Okay.
One day, I'm gonna put a camera over there, and then I can tell...
I'll know everything you do when I'm gone.
Everything.
Scratch your balls, take a shit, everything, I tell you, okay?
Okay.
Fucker.
I hate both of you ebony and ivory motherfuckers, I tell you.
- Why is he so fucking high-strung?
- "Fuck off, I tell you.
Very good."
Can you believe that Gandhi, telling me I gotta work on Black Friday?
Ain't that some shit?
- Yeah.
- Like I don't wanna do shopping.
Biggest sales day of the year.
I'm getting a flat-screen TV, believe that.
That's my fault, I should tell you.
I asked for Friday morning off, I'm sorry.
- For what?
- I actually need a lot of recovery time.
Tonight is me and Miri's ten-year high school reunion.
I'm just gonna get fucking alcohol poisoning.
- Reunion?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
- Isn't that fucked up that they do that?
They say it's the best chance to get everyone together.
People come back in town for the holidays.
But they could have it in the middle of the summer at a blowjob contest that I was judging, and it would still be retarded.
- So why you going, then?
- Miri's making me go.
Why you always bending over backwards for that girl,
- knowing she ain't giving up no ass?
- We got a good thing going.
She pays half the rent, does dishes, she wakes me up in the morning.
Why complicate that with sex?
Besides, man, I've known her since the first grade.
You don't fuck someone you met in the first grade.
Excuse me, I met my wife in kindergarten.
We got married senior year, and she has been the queen of my world ever since.
- What if you could do it all over again?
- I'd jerk off and live by myself.
That woman is the bane of my existence.
- See?
- Excuse me, can I get a coffee, black?
Can't you see we talking, white?
ZACK:
If you're gonna continue to emasculate me with this Barbie dress-up shit,
I'm using your laptop.
Don't forget to smack it when you turn it on, otherwise the screen doesn't come on.
[COMPUTER PLAYS FANFARE]
Why don't you spring and get a new one?
Same reason I don't spring for clothes for tonight, I'm broke.
There's a chick who works at Teen Juice at the mall, you know.
I gave her a good deal on yarn,
- so she's letting me borrow this stuff.
- Yo, bro.
[ZACK LAUGHING]
MIRl:
What?
- You're buying a vibrator online.
- What's wrong with the one you have?
MIRl:
It died last week.
Look at the size of those fucking panties.
Shoot that shit.
Shoot it.
ZACK:
My God, who even knew Amazon sold shit like this?
This is incredible.
- Those are fucking granny panties.
MIRl:
Okay,
A, I don't appreciate you violating the sanctity of my Amazon Wish List page, and B, I'm not buying that thing from Amazon, because it turns out I don't have a credit card they take.
[ZACK GRUNTS]
- Oh, shit.
- I'm sorry, guys.
Am I in the way?
You're a fucking faggot, all right?
Let's go to Starbucks.
- He's a shitty barista anyways.
- Cock.
- And he throws like a bitch.
ZACK:
You know what else I throw?
My nut sack in your coffees, so how did that taste, fucker?
We saw your girlfriend in her underwear, cunt nugget.
Well, too bad she's not my girlfriend, you little fuck...
Oh, they're gone.
MIRl:
Are you still talking to me?
Uh, just said, I'm gonna look up more fuck toys on Amazon.
Oh, holy shit.
- They sell the Fleshlight here too.
- What's that?
It's a fucking pocket pussy that is shaped like a flashlight
"for discretionary jacking off."
That way if you get caught, no one thinks it's weird.
You're just a guy who likes to fuck his flashlight.
I am totally buying this shit.
Whoa, if you've got money to burn, how about paying the electric bill?
- That's due already?
- November's is probably due now, but I was talking about September's.
Tell me this doesn't rock.
You kind of look like Ronald McDonald.
That makes me want some McNuggets.
Why would you wanna buy a pocket pussy anyway?
That is so sad.
What?
Excuse me, I forgot about the nobility that accompanies coming with a fucking vibrator.
Think a kid in Darfur gets saved every time a vibrator makes you come?
No.
- "Real feel action"?
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
If you start fucking machines, I'm moving out.
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a machine.
How come you get to fuck something with a motor in it?
I've never met a man who can make me come like a vibrator does.
That's bullshit.
You get to be Buck Rogers having sex in the 25th century with fucking Twiki and Dr. Theopolis.
I'm stuck to a bottle of Jergens in the bathroom.
Holy bejesus.
You do not use my Jergens to jack it in our bathroom.
ZACK:
No, you know what I do actually, is I light a bunch of candles and I sprawl out on my sheets and I listen to Sting.
No, I'm a guy.
Give me two Popsicle sticks and a rubber band,
I'll find a way to fuck it, like a filthy MacGyver.
Oh, my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.
How about this?
I don't get why you're putting so much effort into this thing.
I thought we were just gonna go to sit around and make fun of everybody.
I can't wear anything that I already own and expect to bring home Bobby Long.
Bobby fucking Long?
No way.
Didn't that guy call you "Stinky Linky"?
Yeah, that was then, okay?
Maybe now he can save me a fortune in Amazon bills.
Maybe you can fuck our landlord so we can at least keep a roof over our heads.
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.
Hey, I bought skates with last week's paycheck
- and I need those to skate with.
- Oh.
And this week's will barely cover the past two water bills, so...
Is this sexy?
Yeah, in like a To Catch a Predator kind of way, it is pretty fucking sexy.
Then we're done.
[SHOWER SPLASHING AND PIPES CREAKING]
What the fuck?
Zack.
- You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?
- They shut it off.
- Oh, shit.
Just, uh...
Help me get this shit out of my hair.
Just use the water out of the toilet.
- There's poo in there.
- Not that part.
- The back part of the toilet thing.
- Oh, that makes sense.
MIRl:
Take the cup there and then scoop it in, there you go.
Here, I'll lean back and you can just, you know, pour it down like...
Like that.
ZACK:
You're harshing my buzz, you know.
This is so lame.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Whoa!
All right, one hour tops, then we're gone.
Or I had an idea.
We could just not go at all, which would rock.
Even though we're broke and we've never amounted to anything, we're still better than these people, right?
No.
Not at all.
We're probably not even as good as most of them, unless one of them is a crackhead or something.
Just tell me I'm prettier than when we graduated.
You look about the same.
Definitely not prettier, but around the same.
I'm thinner, though, right?
A little?
Not really.
Well, good pep talk.
Fuck.
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.
- You don't recognize us, do you?
- Um, no, sorry.
Zack Brown, Miri Linky.
Were you the one they called Stinky Linky?
Oh, no, no one ever called me that.
Oh.
- Great.
What does yours say?
- What the fuck?
Come on.
- I'm sure I had a nickname.
Nothing?
- All right, you have a great time, and before you go, don't forget your copy of The Roving Roe-ver.
What the fuck's this shit?
That is not shit, that would be our bi-monthly newsletter.
- Awesome.
BETSY:
It updates you
- on what everyone's doing.
- Finally.
I love your enthusiasm.
Here you go.
Write your e-mail address on that and I'll be sure to add you to our 800-member-strong mailing list.
We had 800 people in our graduating class?
Yes, and only 250 R.S.V.P.'d.
Doesn't that suck, Mary?
- Miri.
- You married, Bets?
- I am.
Two kids.
- Wow, that's beautiful.
- Awesome.
- You wanna fuck me later?
- Uh, no, I'm married.
- Okay, cool.
If you change your mind,
- I'll be in there getting shitfaced.
- He will.
- Just so you know, I eat the pussy.
- He does.
Ah, tempting.
Again, no.
- Shall we?
- Sir.
Bye, Bets.
Think about it.
[DJ KOOL'S "LET ME CLEAR MY THRO AT" PLAYS O VER SPEAKERS]

Can I get two beers, please?
You want a beer?
- Yeah.
- Three beers.
- Thank you.
BARTENDER:
Here you go.
Is that Zack?
Or am I Zack?
Whoa, ho, ho.
MIRl:
Oh, wow.
- Never gets old, huh?
- The other Zack.
Oh, in my world, nobody calls me "the other Zack,"
now that this guy's not around anymore, huh?
- Get the fuck off of me.
- There can be only one.
- What?
- Highlander, man?
The Kurgan.
Remember?
I'd yell it at you whenever we passed each other in the hallway?
Like it was yesterday, man.
Awesome.
Awesome.
Awesome.
God, you guys have so much to catch up on.
Whoo.
- No.
- I'm gonna let you get to it.
Bitch.
Bitch.
[MARC Y PLAYGROUND'S "SEX AND CAND Y" PLAYS O VER SPEAKERS]
Have you seen that big blowup picture they have of me?
Yeah, it's...
My hair is terrible.
I can't believe I even wore my hair like that.
That's before I knew about styling products, you know.
It makes a big difference in life.
But you live and learn, though, right?
I mean, ten years ago, Pittsburgh, who knew anything about fashion?
Back in the day, our hairstyle, oh...
Hey, stranger.
- Whoa.
Stinky Linky.
- Yeah.
Although it's just Miri now.
- Give me a hug.
- Oh, okay.
- Hi, heh, heh, heh.
- Hi.
Wow.
- How have you been?
- Great, great.
- Yeah?
- You look fantastic.
Wow, that is not something that you would have said to me ten years ago.
- Well, I've grown up.
- Yes.
Yes, you have.
You just look...
Ooh, heh, heh.
- Well, listen to you.
Thank you.
- No, don't thank me, just fuck me.
[LAUGHING]
[LEN'S "STEAL MY SUNSHINE" PLAYING O VER SPEAKERS]
Roxanne.
Hey.
Someone I like, what are the odds, huh?
Zack Brown, we had four years of Spanish together.
Why does no one recognize me?
- Am I thinner?
Is that it?
- Look at him.
- Who?
- My stupid husband.
No fucking shit.
John Butterfield?
You actually married John Butterfield?
- That's amazing.
- Don't ever get married.
It sucks.
You stop appreciating each other and run out of shit to talk about after the first year.
But look at him now, chatty as fuck.
Flirting up a storm with that cheerleader nimrod Monica Von.
You want me to maybe flirt with you so he can see it, even it up a bit?
I don't wanna get even.
If I was gonna do anything, I'd wanna one-up the asshole.
You can give me a handjob in the girls' locker room.
- Fine, but make it fast.
- Fuck, yeah.
Are you staying in town for a while or...?
Just tonight.
I fly back to L.A. Tomorrow.
L.A., wow, Los Angeles.
Gosh, Bobby Long, coming up in the world.
- With Mrs. Long, I bet, huh?
- No, no, no.
No Mrs. Long for me.
- Then can I be honest with you?
- Sure.
Um...
Whew.
I think I need a drink.
Do you need a drink?
Because I need a drink to say this.
- I've got a beer already, so...
- Oh, great, thank you.
I think there's a cigarette butt in there.
Yup.
Sorry about the elbow.
[BRONSKI BEAT'S "SMALLTOWN BO Y" PLAYS O VER SPEAKERS]
There can be only one.
Can I get a beer, please?
Thank you very much.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
My friend's making an ass of herself hitting on her high school crush.
Oh, God, that's so sad.
It's so Miri, is what it is.
I'm Zack, by the way.
Brandon.
Don't worry, we weren't in the same class or anything.
- Okay.
Lucky you.
- Are you a Monroe-ver?
Well, I went here, let's just leave it at that, I guess.
Do you have one of the large blown-up pictures of your younger self
- hanging around here?
- I do, kind of.
Right there.
BRANDON:
Gorgeous.
- Good times.
What do you do?
What brings you here?
I came with somebody who went to school here.
- Really?
- Bobby Long.
No shit.
That's who my friend's hitting on right now.
See right there?
- Really.
- One dressed like Hannah Montana?
In L.A., we call that look "Nickelodeon chic."
- Wait, L. A?
Los Angeles?
- California.
That's awesome, man.
What do you do out there?
- I'm an actor.
- Wow, that's really impressive.
- Thank you, thank you.
- In fucking movies?
"Fucking movies." Pretty much.
Look at you.
What...?
Anything I've seen?
What movies?
Oh, all sorts of movies with all-male casts.
All-male casts.
Like Glengarry Glen Ross?
Like that?
Like Glen and Gary Suck Ross' Meaty Cock and Drop Their Hairy Nuts in His Eager Mouth.
- Is that like a sequel?
- Sort of.
- It's a re-imagining.
- Oh, like The Wiz.
More erotic and with less women.
No women, to be exact.
I apologize in advance if I am out of line here, but are you in gay porn?
- Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?
- I thought you recognized me, that's...
- Oh, okay, I get it.
You're not in my demographic, so I'm not insulted.
- Not really.
Who's your demographic?
- Do you love pussy?
- I do.
- Then not you.
Oh, okay.
I came here tonight hoping to seduce you and bring you back to my apartment and sleep with you to, uh, get back at you, you know, for calling me Stinky Linky all those years ago.
Wow.
That is a weird revenge plot.
- You must be a terrible lay for that.
- What?
No, I'm great.
I mean, I've had enough practice and everything.
That...
Wow, that sounded not good.
I fuck a lot.
That's what I meant to say.
That doesn't sound good either.
Wow.
You're a lot funnier than I remember.
Thank you.
Gosh, you turned out to be such a nice guy.
It just...
You know, it makes it even easier to just...
To just say this.
Would you like to come back to my place and maybe open a bottle of wine and have ourselves a real high school reunion?
- L...
- Hello, Miriam.
Beat it, we're talking.
- I wanted to introduce you to Brandon.
- Salutations.
- Bobby's boyfriend.
- Bobby who?
- Bobby me.
- Bobby Long.
Brandon is the star of such adult fare as...
What was that one called again?
You Better Shut Your Mouth or I'm Gonna Fuck It.
That's right.
I'm surprised I forgot that.
Are you fucking with me?
No, they're fucking with each other.
Oh, my God.
- No.
- What?
Granny Panties?
- Excuse me?
- How can you tell?
This is so crazy.
I was literally just watching you, like, right before we got here.
This is so crazy.
This is you, right?
TEEN 1 [ON VIDEO]:
My name's Granny Panties, and nobody wants to fuck me.
TEEN 2:
Nothing's whiter than my big gay ass...
Where'd you get that?
Oh, I entered "gay" and "ass," and it was the top hit.
It's had 200,000 views in three hours.
Honey, you are, like...
I'm jealous right now because you're, like, super famous.
Baby, please take our picture.
I get a picture with Granny Panties.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is awesome.
- All right, smile.
Okay, got it.
- Did you get it?
- Oh, thank you very much.
- E-mail me that.
Oh, because he's the worst photographer.
Okay, good.
- You're gay?
- Yeah.
And I'm on the Internet wearing a diaper?
Who knew you'd come to Pittsburgh and meet a celebrity?
I'm gonna binge-drink now until I pass out.
Okay.
She'll be fine.
So you guys suck each other's cocks, huh?
Oh, like crazy.
[LAUGHING]
Okay, that's enough, I think.
I'm embarrassing him.
I love when he's embarrassed.
He's not living out loud, so he gets all like, ooh.
- You are totally in love, aren't you?
- Zachary, we are.
Wow, I...
Oh, God, I just wanna eat him up, yum, yum.
Save some for me, yum, yum, yum.
- I can't keep my hands off him.
- You've had one too many.
Although he does most of the eating in the sack.
In the sack and of the sack.
All right, that's enough.
Look, you've drunk too much.
You do this every time.
You get too Mary for everybody in the room
- and you can't contain yourself.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
And by containing myself, do you mean containing myself in a closet?
In a closet of denial?
Is that...?
No, no, no.
Holy shit, this just got real.
This is exactly why you haven't met my mother.
You don't know how to ease people into this situation.
- You just force your way in every time.
- I thought, maybe for one second in this godforsaken town, I could be myself.
I'm so sorry.
No, you're right, I should just butch up and pretend that I don't love it when you shove your dick in my mouth.
- This is the best night of my life.
BRANDON:
Am I making a spectacle?
- I could make a much bigger scene.
- You really are.
I'm sorry.
Pittsburgh.
Listen up, Monroe-vers.
My name is Brandon St. Randy, and I love Bobby Long.
- Fucking A. BRANDON:
Is that enough?
Is that enough of a scene?
I could start doing worse than that.
The reason you haven't taken me to your mother's...
Your mother with her makeup and all her drinking, she's in the closet too.
- They fight just like real people.
- I thought I'd be a conduit for you...
Thank you.
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm not.
- Thank you.
- I love you.
- I'll e-mail you.
- Zack, it was so nice to meet you.
And I will be patient with you.
I will be there on your journey.
I will be your Sherpa up the mountain of gayness.
Well, might as well see how many hits Granny Panties is up to, huh?
[COMPUTER PLAYS FANFARE]
Did I do that?
[MUSIC PLAYS O VER SPEAKERS]
Thanks, George.
What kind of evil fucks turn off your power the day...?
No, the night before Thanksgiving?
Who does that?
Can you get an advance on your card?
Fleshlight maxed-out my $200 limit.
Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.
This is bad.
If we don't come up with rent, we're gonna get locked out.
Who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.
Which means by the time we get home, there's no heat either.
Well, I think it's time we put what we always talked about into effect.
- You're gonna have to start hooking.
- You know, you jest, but these are the exact circumstances people find themselves in right before they start having sex for money.
- Yeah.
- Or making porn.
ZACK:
Oh, my God, yeah.
- What?
You got an idea?
We could make a porno.
- Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?
No, that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me?
That's a rad idea.
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend, he said he makes a hundred grand a year because he shoots and distributes his own porno flicks.
If it's so easy, how come everybody doesn't do it?
Because other people have options and dignity, which we do not have, which puts us in an amazingly advantageous position.
Fuck you, I have dignity.
Where?
Is it hidden in your gigantic underpants that are plastered all over the Internet?
Is that where you hide your dignity?
Every woman has a pair of those period panties.
That's, like, a fact.
Okay.
Families.
I bet people don't make porno, because they have families.
But luckily, your parents are dead.
Sorry.
My grandparents are dead.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
So who are we gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone mainstream now.
It's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks in it.
Look at Paris Hilton.
She throat-fucks a guy in night vision, now she's selling fragrances to tweens.
And I'm pretty sure she's legally retarded.
That's for tweens?
Have you seen that Joe Francis guy who made Girls Gone Wild?
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot piece of shit in the world and he has a jet and a fucking island.
Look, there's got to be a less extreme solution to our financial woes here.
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper route.
- I don't have a bike.
- Be a waiter.
No one wants me around their food.
Would you eat food that I gave you?
I would not eat food that you gave me, that's true.
MIRl:
I mean, nobody wants to see us fuck, Zack.
ZACK:
Everybody wants to see anybody fuck.
I hate Rosie O'Donnell, but if someone said, "I got a tape of Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid,"
I'd be like, "Why aren't we watching that right now?"
Because she's famous.
Hello.
So are you.
You're fucking Granny Panties.
My underwear and your ass are famous, we're not.
So who the F would wanna watch us fuck?
- At least 800 people.
- The jerks we went to school with?
- Are you serious?
- Of course.
If you heard that someone we graduated with was in a fucking porno movie, you'd watch it, right?
I'd watch that guy Brandon suck a cock, I just met him.
With this mailing list, we have almost a thousand people that would definitely buy a porno we were in just to be like,
"Hey, I sat next to that guy in Civics.
Look at his fucking dick."
We sell a thousand copies at 20 bucks a pop, bam, we have paid off our bills.
ZACK:
So, what do you think?
- I don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.
Oh, wow, like you've never done that before.
How many guys have you met in a bar, taken home, banged with your mouth and then never talked to again?
That's what we call a stranger.
Dude, I don't one-night mouth-fuck anybody that I pick up in bars.
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in the porno movie for some weird reason.
I guess...
We could fuck.
- Ew.
- Fuck you.
I mean, you're a nice-enough-looking guy and everything...
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're an all-right-enough-looking girl.
- How does that feel?
- Dude, I'm just saying it'd be weird and wrong, you know, like fucking my brother.
Okay, seriously, we're just talking about sex, okay?
It's for a purpose.
It's for getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.
- Wow.
- Just explain to your private beforehand,
"Look, this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash."
- Oh, my God.
- What?
You're just doing this because you've always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?
Yes.
I've gone my whole life pretending that I want nothing to do with you, just hoping one day we'd be in such dire financial straits that I could use it to finally make my move on you.
MIRl:
You're just being sarcastic.
- I am.
See, I was pretending to cry right there.
MIRl:
I guess it's not like it'd be creepy, like if we got way too drunk one night and accidentally fucked, you know?
No.
We'd be going in with the understanding that it's...
A business decision.
Strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.
- Right.
- And by end,
I mean, I'll be waxing your ass.
Fuck you.
I'm not even letting you see my ass.
I've seen your ass and the rest of you naked around a billion times already.
- That goes both ways, buddy.
- You've never seen my dick.
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.
Are you kidding?
That party we went to where you got blasted, and Houls dared you to give yourself head, and we all watched you try for, like, an hour.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks by the way, for fucking letting me do that.
Thank you.
Oh, God.
We really do know too much about each other.
See, and this would really just be one more thing.
I mean, look at us.
It's Thanksgiving and we're huddled around a flaming fucking garbage can like a couple of steno bums.
I mean, this could give us a chance to pay off our debt, pay our bills, get a fucking nicer apartment with heat in it maybe.
What are you doing?
Miriam Linky, will you have sex with me on camera for money?
I will.
DELANEY:
A producer?
ZACK:
Yeah.
- Guy who gets to finance the movie.
- You think I got that kind of money?
We just need that.
What you're about to spend on the flat screen.
Now I can't get my flat screen?
Fuck that.
No, no, no.
With your cut of the profits, you're gonna get two flat screens.
One in your living room, one in your bathroom.
One in the bathroom?
You know, it's always been my dream to watch shit while I shit.
Everyone with an ass loves to watch shit while they shit.
- I'm gonna make that happen for you.
- I don't know, man.
What else the producer do?
- Um, they help with the casting.
- What's casting?
Finding the people to be in the movie.
- I get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.
Like, I can look at a titty, make sure there ain't no moles on there?
- You can look at both titties, man.
- Man.
I've been looking at the same busted titties for the past almost 20 years.
- I'm due for another new titty.
- Please help us.
Please.
Please.
Yes.
Yes.
I love you.
Well, don't mind that smell.
We had some homeless people squatting in here.
You know, they'd void their bowels everywhere but the bathroom.
Anyway, you pick up the poop and you've got yourself a movie studio.
Why don't we shoot in your apartment?
No power.
You wanna pay our electric bill?
- You motherfuckers...
- We'll take it.

- It's cool.
- He's my cousin.
- Hey.
Didn't you used to videotape the varsity basketball games in high school?
Just the away games.
I did it because I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.
Which one?
Whichever one wanted to fuck the guy who taped the varsity games.
- Aw.
- Still know how to work a camera?
- Who cares what the title is?
- The porn I liked when I was a kid, it was always, like, a spoof of a popular movie, you know?
Like, um, Edward Penishands.
Okay, so we need a mildly clever, vaguely dirty title, that sounds like a real movie
- and sums up what you're gonna see.
- Correct.
An American Werewolf in Brenda?
Fuckback Mountain?
- Too soon?
A Cock-in-Lips Now?

Next.
- Too soon?
A Cock-in-Lips Now?
MIRl:
Next.
Cradle the balls.
Work the shaft.
Jerk my come-crayon and let me color you white.
I need cock and I need it now.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
It's "puss" as in pussy.
Oh, because I was like, who would wanna fuck puss?
I want to slam my ham in your can, woman.
Scene.
- This guy is amazing.
- This guy's great-looking too.
I wanna fuck him.
DELANEY:
Hi, my name's Delaney and I'm a producer.
I really don't know what it means.
I'm gonna be honest, this is my first time.
You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna touch you or nothing like that.
- All right.
- I have a wife, you know.
We're happy.
I mean, not happy, but it's cool, you know.
Just so you know, there will be some fucking.
- We'll talk about that if you get the part.
- Okay.
I mean, not...
We won't be fucking, there'll be fucking in the movie.
Like I said, I got a wife.
She don't play that shit.
- She is a crazy bitch.
- Yep.
It's my job as the producer to see what you got.
So if that makes you uncomfortable in any way, you don't have to show me anything you don't wanna show me, because...
I love the movies.
- Lawrence of a Labia.
- No.
- Oh, come on.
- Dawn of the Dick.
Yeah, but how are zombies doing it at all sexy?
I want to eat your brain and your ass.

We're making a porno and we just need to know what you would be or would not be interested in doing.
If anything.
- No anal.
- Oh, definitely no anal.
Anal and hugging.
I don't do ass stuff.
- Anal.
- Ah, fuck.
- Oh, wait, oral.
I like anal.
- Yay.
Okay, well, so, uh, do you have any special skills?
Special skills?
I can get a boner really quick and it sticks straight up.
- Is that really a special skill?
- I think.
- Can you show us what you mean?
- Sure.
Oh, that is special.
[ZACK CHUCKLES]
Yeah, you're hired, Mr...
- Who are you again?
- Lester.
Lester "The Molester" Cockinshtuff.
- No.
- Wow.
That is the best porn name I've ever heard, man.
I can have a porn name?
- Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.
Are you Granny Panties?
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The panties are actually in the house.
- I'll get them.
- Whoa.
- Star Sex 2:
The Wrath of Cunt.
MIRl:
We never made a Star Sex 1.
I guess we can lose Star Sex 3:
The Search for Cock, then.
- Cocunt.
- What's that?
It's Cocoon with a cunt.
[LAUGHING]
So Delaney tells us you have a special talent of some sort.
I don't know if I'd call it a special talent, but it's a little something I picked up doing bachelor parties.
It would probably be easier if I just showed you.
- Great.
- The floor is yours.
So a movie, huh?
That could be fun.
Holy fuck.
Her name, Bubbles.
- Invasion of the Potty-Snatchers?
- That's like MAD Magazine stupid.
Well, fuck you, okay?
You try to think of a good sci-fi porno title.
It's hard.
MIRl:
There's gotta be one we haven't thought of that would say it all, not be ridiculously filthy and off-putting, and still have instant recognition with our audience.
- I got it.
- I got it.
- Star Whores.
- Yeah.
It's funny, right?
See, we figured this opens us up to an even bigger sales market beyond the people we went to school with.
People who like comics and sci-fi.
Comics?
Like "Ziggy"?
"Ziggy"?
Is that even in fucking papers anymore?
No, man.
Fuck you. "Ziggy" is a comic, right next to "Family Circus."
No, like Spider-Man and shit, you know?
There's always a shitload of Star Wars nerds at those comic-book shows.
So we sell them a Princess Leia they can really fucking jerk off to.
- That'd be me, Princess Lay-Her.
- Who am I playing?
You, my friend, are the lead role of Lubed Guy-Baller.
Man, he's gonna be balling dudes?
I thought you said this was boys on girls.
If I have to fuck a guy, okay, but I'd rather fuck a girl.
What's wrong with you, boy?
- We'll change the name to Sky-Baller.
- Sky-Baller.
I will be Hung So-low.
Delaney, my friend, you are On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
Man, I can't be in no porno.
My wife will kill me.
Hump me, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
You're my only hump.
On the other hand, fuck my wife.
Unfortunately, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over does not have any sex in the movie but the droids do, l-CUP and R2-T-Bag.
I robot.
And Stacey over here is gonna play Darth Vibrator.
- I'm the bad guy?
- She's not a guy, Zack.
I know that because I'm not a fucking idiot.
In our movie, Darth Vibrator is a bad girl who wants to fuck the galaxy, literally, and it's up to Lubed and Hung to stop her with their cocks.
- You and me get to have sex, then?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- I know.
Isn't that awesome?
Hold up, hold up.
So who's all having sex with who in this movie?
As of last night, I was having sex with Zack.
What?
Han Solo ain't never had no sex with Princess Leia in the Star Wars.
ZACK:
Guys, this isn't a literal adaptation here.
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.
Kind of like The Wiz or like a parody.
With lots of anal.
- Cool.
- I know, isn't that awesome?
I have a question, do Princess Lay-Her and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?
Uh, no, because they're brother and sister, and according to Miri, brothers and sisters can't fuck.
But you said, that this wasn't a literal translation, so that means Lester's character could have sex with Miri's character.
Because I would love to fucking eat her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.
Dream on, pal, it's never gonna happen, okay?
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See, she's fine...
Wait, what?
Yep.
I mean, everyone else is having sex with more than one person in this movie all of a sudden, so I think it's, you know, not fair if I'm only fucking you.
Guys, read amongst yourselves, okay?
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Look, Miri, we got plenty of sex going on in this thing, you don't have to do that.
Zack, it's fine.
I mean I have slept with way worse-looking guys than Lester.
I just wanna do my part for the movie like everyone else.
You're having sex in the movie, you don't need to fuck someone else.
- You're good.
- I'm only fucking you, though.
So don't we need to vary it up to keep it fair?
Fair for...?
I don't...
What?
Fair for who?
What are these, blood diamonds we're talking about?
Fair for everyone else who is fucking more than one person, a.k.a. You, in the movie.
- I mean, fine...
- All right.
I mean, if you don't care...
I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
Fuck.
I don't give a shit.
Like you said, you know, you've fucked bigger idiots than Lester.
Holy shit.
Are we really gonna shoot this in outer space?
Maybe not bigger idiots.
[MOUTHS] Thank you.
- Cut.
All right, guys, that's it.
- Yeah.
Make sure you leave your costume so we know they're here for tomorrow.
Mostly, everybody, thank you so much for helping us get ready, you know.
Cleaning this place out, building the sets, sewing the costumes, it's just...
I mean, it's really amazing.
Thank you.
ZACK:
Seriously, thanks.
But this is just the beginning, guys.
If Star Whores works, and it will, we are set up for sequels galore.
The Empire Strikes Ass.
- Return of the Brown-Eye.
- The Phantom Man-Ass.
And Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter.
- Okay.
- Revenge of the Shit.
- You got it?
- Yeah, no, we got it.
Ew.
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.
- We'll talk about that one.
We're gonna have a lot of fun, but more importantly, we're gonna make a lot of fucking money, okay?
- Yeah.
- So get ready for greatness, people.
Tomorrow we start principal photography.
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
- All right, good night, you guys.
- We got a movie.
- What?
- Nothing.
I think someone should acknowledge how insane and amazing this is
- and it's all because of you.
- I don't know.
It's just a porno.
You know what I mean.
You've really come into your own.
Shut the fuck up.
So speaking of coming into things, ready for tomorrow?
Twenty years, we're finally gonna know what it's like to have sex with each other.
You say that like you've been wondering what it'd be like to sleep with me for a while now.
Why the fuck do you think I started hanging out with you?
I knew it.
Here, help.
Let's just promise that it's not gonna change anything between us, okay?
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Some guys can't keep sex in perspective.
If anyone's gotta keep this in perspective, it's you, okay?
I don't want you getting all mushy and gooey on me after I give you the best orgasm you've ever had.
Oh, like you know what you're doing down there at all.
I actually don't.
Where's the clitoris?
Is it in your ass?
Just, you know, make sure you kind of whoop it up and act like I'm a stud who knows what he's doing, okay?
Just be a pal.
Oh, dude, I am gonna Meryl Streep the fuck out of this tomorrow, you watch.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
No.
Really, thank you.
For everything.
You're welcome.
Less than 12 hours and we make Monroeville history.
- I really hope nothing goes wrong.
- It's a movie.
What could go wrong?
ZACK:
What are you doing?
DELANEY:
What's up?
- What the fuck?
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait.
- Wait.
- Stop.
Stop.
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck is going on?
Condos is what's going on, as soon as this shit-hole's demo'd.
No, you gotta stop it right now.
We rented this place for a month from Mr. Jenkins.
Sounds like your Mr. Jenkins was full of shit.
Luxury Homesteads bought this place a month ago.
I'm gonna kill that lying old fuck.
You're gonna have to go Florida, that's where he moved.
We've got thousands of dollars of equipment in there.
- Please.
- If you wanna sift through this rubble when we're done, be my guest.
Hey, get that fucking beam down.
MIRl:
This is the last thing you wanna hear.
If you don't get an advance,
I don't think we're gonna keep a roof over our heads.
I got an advance already.
It went into all the costumes.
- So all our money's gone?
- All your money?
Never mind what my wife's gonna do when there ain't no new snow tires, or when she sees I charged a video camera.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this, man.
DELANEY:
I just wanted to see some free titties.
That's all.
But there's no such thing as free titties, is there, Zack?
- Is there?
- Fuck this noise.
Why don't we get another camera, and shoot something else?
Where are we gonna do that?
Got another sound stage?
Sound stage?
We had a shit-covered garage we turned into a sound stage.
We find someplace new and we do it again.
[DOOR SQUEAKS]
How?
Okay, I'm broke, man.
No, make that, I was broke.
Now I am really tapped out.
I have to get another job to pay Delaney back.
So please tell me, how can I afford to start over?
- What can I get you?
- Yeah, can I get a, uh...?
Too fucking late.
Cappuccino, 3.50.
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
I mean, I'm a total loser in every single other aspect of my life.
What made me think I could do something as simple as filming people fucking?
We have no money left, nowhere to shoot, no sets, we have no fucking cameras.
Here.
It's time I go back to my regular life where I am a quiet fuckup who doesn't cost anybody any money and knows his goddamn position behind this fucking counter making cappuccinos for this fucking guy.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
ZACK:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Fuck, yes.
Zack.
[CHUCKLES]
You sneaky Indian motherfucker.
I tell you, yes.
Swallow My Cockuccino.
- What?
- That's it.
That's the movie.
Why didn't I think of it before?
We don't need sets or a stage.
Look at all this production value, waiting to have balls on it.
Hold up.
You wanna shoot a dirty movie here, where we work?
Yes.
Fuck, yes, I do.
You know how many stories I have from working here?
How many times I've been laid right there after hours?
You've never gotten laid here after hours.
I know.
Thank you for reminding me.
But I always wish I had, and that's what porno is.
It's fantasy.
It's taking the normal and making it abnormal by fucking it.
Don't do that.
The little dog don't like that.
How did you get a camera?
By being a terrible, untrustworthy employee, that's how.
Give me today, I'll bang out a script.
Meet me back here after closing.
We're gonna launch arching ropes of jism all over this motherfucker.
Peace.
I like that guy but if he tries to fuck that little dog tonight for real,
I'm calling the Humane Society.
It's called Bean-N-Gone, so get the fuck out of here.
Hey, Barry.
ZACK:
Stand by, Stace, picture's up.
- Okay.
ZACK:
Roll tape.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 12, Take 1.
ZACK:
And action.
I'd like a double espresso so I can stay up all night because I'm in the mood to fuck.
Well, I am a whore-ista, so I love to fuck.
Would you like to fuck me?
Holy fuck.
You mean, after you're done with your shift?
I mean during my shift.
- Sorry.
- Keep going, keep going.
With your shaft.
Let us fuck.
Cue music.
[FUNK MUSIC PLAYING]
Okay, open up to camera, guys.
Let us see it.
More tongue.
Little less tongue.
Oh, that was good.
[CASH REGISTER BEEPING]
Cue effects.
[MO ANING]
Oh, yeah, like that.
Oh, yeah.
See, I told you it would work.
Didn't I tell you?
It looks amazing.
It's incredible.
STACEY:
Oh, the beans hurt.
Easy.
- Move in for coverage.
- Nice.
That's why we got him.
- Nice.
I'm impressed.
- Get in there, Deacon.
- Come on.
- Like that?
Like that.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
- Pull out a bit, actually.
STACEY:
That's hot.
No, not you, Lester.
Put it back in.
Kiss the muscle.
- I kiss the muscle.
- You kiss the muscle.
- Can he slap her ass a little?
- Don't be a fucking pervert, dude.
- Stir, come on.
Stir.
- Yeah, stir it.
Stir it, baby.
Hey.
- Holy.
- Shit.
Are you guys still open?
No.
We close at 9.
I need coffee so I'm drive home.
- Okay.
Yeah.
MAN:
Thank you.
That's a cute kitty.
Okay.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You guys see the game?
I was at it.
Fucking Roethlisberger, the quarterback, was all fucking,
"Hug it, chug it, football.
All night." Heh-heh.
Okay, pal, here you go.
On the house.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Have a good one.
- Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- I said, have a good one.
Oh.
- Okay.
Keep moving.
MAN:
You and your little dog.
Go Steelers.
Action.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, like that.
Oh, fuck it, chuck it, football.
Oh, yeah.
BARRY:
Oh, God, this is good.
[BARRY MO ANING]
You take it.
You take it.
Take it, Barry.
Oh, take it.
Take it, Barry.
Take it.
I'm disturbed at how turned on I am by this.
- Shit, dude, it's almost 6.
- Oh, fuck.
Okay, that's a wrap, everybody, yeah.
Let's give a hand to our hotties with the bodies from last night.
Stacey, Lester, Bubbles, Barry, whoo.
LESTER:
Yeah.
ZACK:
Nice.
Okay, when we come back tonight, we finish up the venti-vulva scene, and then we get into me and Miri's stuff.
Again, amazing first night, everybody.
Thank you so much.
Let us fuck.
- Hey, how'd it look?
- How do you think it looked?
It looked like shit going into other shit, in focus.
What an artist.
That was Kurosawa's motto. "Shit going into other shit."
Oh, man, I can't believe you gotta work now.
It's okay.
You know, honestly, I don't think I could sleep.
- I'm pretty, like, pumped up right now.
- Right?
It was amazing.
I think the cast and crew had a good time.
- We were getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.
I just wanna keep shooting people boning all day.
I don't think I've ever met the ambitious Zack Brown before.
- Well, I'm trying to pay the bills, so...
- It's not a bad thing.
I think it looks good on you.
ZACK:
Come on, hurry.
Come on, come on, come on.
BUBBLES:
Wait a minute.
- You guys never did it before?
MIRl:
It's fine.
You know, we talked about it and it's just for the movie.
We're friends, you know, we're just friends.
And we will always just be just friends, so...
Listen, I have some extra lube from last night.
I understand it's kind of hard getting wet when everyone's watching.
At least it was for Barry.
- I don't know if I am gonna need it.
- Really?
Yeah, I think I'm just excited.
Uh-huh.
At the idea of people watching, not because of Zack.
Oh, God.
Zack could never have that effect on me in a million years.
- Hello, Miriam.
- Oh, hey.
Wow.
- Your face.
- Yeah.
Weird, huh?
I don't think I've seen your face since senior year.
ZACK:
I think I made a mistake.
I did it for you so you wouldn't get road rash during our scene, but I should have asked first, I look like a fucking beluga whale.
I think I'll be going now.
ZACK:
Okay.
[CLEARING THRO AT]
All I keep thinking is we should've done a trial run at home last week or something.
- Oh, my God.
Right?
- I know.
[LAUGHING]
- You're still cool to do it, though, right?
- Yeah, um.
Totally.
Are you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I'm, uh...
- Honestly, I'm a little nervous, I guess.
- You are?
- It's kind of a big deal.
- It is?
Yeah, you know, it's our first time together since our auspicious debut on viral video.
Oh, yeah.
That's a fuckload of pressure for a director.
As a director, please.
What about the anxiety I'm feeling as an actress?
- Did I pick the right project?
- Yeah.
What about this follow-up?
Julia Roberts followed Pretty Woman with Sleeping With the Enemy.
I'm following Granny Panties with Swallow My Cockuccino.
Only difference is this movie's about cock-sucking and her movie just sucked cock, period.
- The only difference, yeah.
- The end was pretty rad.
I liked that.
- When she kills him.
- With a gun.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- She calls the cops first.
- She calls it in first.
- It was so awesome.
- Awesome, yeah.
So I guess we should do this.
I think we should probably wait just until I lose another 20 or 30 pounds.
Stop it.
You look good.
Thanks.
So, what about me?
How do I look?
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful, so I guess it's not a big deal, but you look amazing.
- Okay.
Let's go make a porno.
- Okay.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 8, Take 1.
DEACON:
Come here.
- I'm over...?
All right, settle.
Action.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Who could it be?
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm a delivery man and I have some cream for you.
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.
I work out.
So do you want me to give you your cream now?
I've been waiting for it all day.
- Fuck.
Come on.
- Oops.
[WHISPERS] Keep going.
I spilled my cream.
Do you mind?
I don't mind.
Especially if you spill it on my face.
Let us fuck.
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
- Fix my shirt.
Think I should?
- Okay.
Let me see them titties.
Actually, you know what?
Sorry, I don't think we should show them.
- What?
- We shouldn't show your breasts.
- Aren't you gonna take your shirt off?
- I'm just gonna open it.
You're not gonna take it off?
Why not?
My tits are bigger than yours.
I don't wanna show that.
She's not gonna show her tits?
I showed my cock and my asshole.
- Okay, I'll do your pants.
- Back and forth.
Okay.
- Holy shit.
- Where's that delivery?
I can't believe this.
I was delivering cream, and look what's happening.
- Jesus, what is that, a rumba?
- What's a rumba?
That awkward movement.
- Should I take your underpants off?
- Yeah, take them off.
ZACK:
What the fuck?
How does this work?
They're just like...
I'll do it.
- I'll do mine, you just...
You do yours.
- I'll do my pants.
Granny panties.
Just get on with it already.
I'm gonna fuck you with my pecker.
Dude, that's really dirty.
- That's too dirty?
- That offends me.
- Penis?
- Fine.
- I'm gonna fuck you with my penis.
- I can't wait.
For my penis.
Be careful, Miri.
Okay, there we go.
Just keep rolling, keep rolling.
- I'll walk forward.
- Fucking cream is coming.
This is the worst porno I've ever seen.
MIRl:
Get over here, delivery man.
ZACK:
Let's fuck on these beans.
[GRUNTING]
- You okay?
- Yup.
ZACK:
Okay, all right.
- Just leave them.
Just leave them.
- They're really distracting.
- You should leave them.
- You gotta get your...
There you go.
ZACK:
Okay, okay.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.
This okay?
Okay.
Okay, uh.
- We'll start kissing on three, okay?
- Okay.
One, two, three.
Go.
MIRl:
I'm ready.
- I'm ready.
- Okay.
Deacon.
- Deacon.
Deacon.
- What?
Did you see Lost this week, man?
I missed it.
What happened?
They're on the island, off the island.
Who can follow that?
I think they're in hell.
Would you all shut the motherfuck up?
[MO ANING]
I want you to come.
- I want you to come with me.
- Okay.
Oh, God.
ZACK:
Oh, God.
Cut.
That's it?
It's over?
Ain't he supposed to come on her titties?
Well, it wasn't what we'd shot-listed, but that was nice.
- It was so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack.
Thanks, Lester, uh.
It wasn't just me, though, guys.
Give it up for my radiant costar here, Miri.
[CHEERING]
LESTER:
Nice.
- Um, show's over in here.
Let's move out, start lighting the next scene.
- All right.
LESTER:
Let's do it.
BUBBLES:
You looked so beautiful.
- Thanks.
DELANEY:
I thought they were gonna be fucking hard.
- It was pretty.
DELANEY:
Pretty don't sell.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
You good, Mir?
You need anything?
I'm just gonna take a minute, okay?
Okay, uh.
I'll just be out there.
Yeah.
- That was fun.
- Yeah, fun.
ZACK [WHISPERS]:
"Fun." You fucking douche.
[SIGHS]
Wow.
- Hey.
ZACK:
Hey.
- You working on a rewrite?
- Yeah, just for tonight's scene.
- I'm ready to go when you are, though.
- Okay.
You know, before we go, I...
I'm thinking that, uh, it's a good idea if we talk about what happened last night.
- Oh.
- I mean, we don't have to, but I think...
Okay, yeah, uh.
I kind of dropped the ball on that, I guess, huh?
- No, no.
It's...
- To be honest, it was...
You know, I didn't realize how weird it would be for me.
Weird?
Like...
Weird how?
Acting and directing at the same time.
It's a lot to process, you know.
For the first time, I thought my balls didn't have enough hair on them.
That's not what I meant.
I know what you meant.
How you feeling about it?
I guess, um...
I feel like...
Like we...
- Holy fuck.
- The power's on.
Did you do this?
ZACK:
How did this happen?
I burned the bills.
How could we have done that?
- The water.
- The water.
MIRl:
Come on, come on, come on.
Yeah!
- We can shower in our home again.
- We are liquid.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Greetings.
Have you heard the good news about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?
Oh, my God, did you guys do this?
We got tired of you taking showers at our places all the time.
So we took up a collection amongst ourselves.
And chipped away at your mountain of debt.
You guys paid off our massive utilities bills?
- How did you afford that?
- I stole my old lady's bingo winnings.
And Mistress Bubbles did a bachelor party tonight at which yours truly was a guest star, thank you very much.
- Oh.
- Whoa.
Don't get too excited.
We didn't pay off your whole bill.
Just a month of each.
They agreed to turn everything back on?
At 9 at night?
How does that work?
Stacey knows somebody that works at Power and Light.
- You guys...
- This is amazing.
You didn't have to do this.
You didn't have to put us in your movie.
- Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.
- Or put us in your movie either.
- We said that already.
Guys, honestly, I don't know what to say.
You can start by saying we can take tonight off so we can have our wrap party right now.
Guys, we're not wrapped.
We still have four days of shooting left.
Excuse me.
In my "producorial" capacity,
I'm shutting the movie down for a night so we can get a little silly.
[DMX'S "PARTY UP (UP IN HERE)" PLAYING O VER SPEAKERS]
[THE PIXIES' "HEY" PLAYING O VER SPEAKERS]
[COIN CLINKING AND PEOPLE CHATTERING]
Go, go, go.
Go, go, go.
- Yes.
- Yes.
[LAUGHING]
You all drink.
Was it just amazing with him, after all those years of not knowing?
It was, um, weird.
- But good.
- My scene with Zack's tomorrow.
You don't say.
But I'm a little nervous.
I was thinking about trying to get with him tonight.
- Really?
- I mean, if you don't mind.
You are just friends and all, so I didn't think it would be a biggie.
- It wouldn't be a biggie, would it?
- No.
No, no.
It's not a biggie.
What?
No.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Stacey, I'm not married to the guy, so...
I don't know.
You guys just looked kind of intimate last night.
- We did?
- Yeah.
Well, we're just better actors than I thought, I think, so you know what?
If you wanna get with him, you should just go ask him.
- He'd be really excited to hear that.
- Yeah?
For real, you don't mind?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
DEACON:
All the quarters are on the ground.
ZACK:
Hey, Stace.
- Hey, Zack.
[WHISPERING]
DEACON:
Come on, are you guys playing or what?
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
Well, I'm bummed, but I totally get it.
It's no problem to work with Lester again.
He has a nice cock.
Well, you're a trouper, Stace.
Oh, but if I start making weird faces or anything during the scene, it's just because I've been constipated all day.
Oh, shit, uh.
We don't have to shoot the scene tonight.
No, I want to.
Anal's great for when you're constipated.
It totally loosens you up.
I use ex-lax, but good to know.
Okay, I never thought I would have that conversation.
So are we starting with Lester and Stacey tonight?
We were supposed to start with Lester and Miri.
I know.
She...
We're not gonna do that.
I don't think Miri's gonna...
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
...do that.
Hey.
So where are we shooting this?
Over here?
- What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.
Our scene's tonight, right?
Can I talk to you for a minute in the back?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
What do you want me to shoot here?
Start with the close-ups of Lester and Stacey.
Give me a second, man.
What an artist.
Okay, uh.
Did I do something wrong to you?
No.
Then why are you here?
I'm here for the same reason you're here.
To make the movie.
Okay, just, like, for your own personal information, you're acting really weird right now.
I'm acting weird?
I think you're acting weird right now.
Oh, I'm acting...
How exactly am I acting weird?
You've been trying to keep me from fucking anybody but you since we started this thing.
Maybe I was thinking about your feelings.
Were you thinking of my feelings when you were banging Stacey?
Because that'd be really sad for Stacey.
She told me that you told her that that was okay.
I told her that it was okay to ask you.
Holy shit.
I get it.
I fucking get it.
It was a test.
That whole thing was a fucking test, is that it?
If it was, how do you think you did?
We had a discussion, Miri.
We had...
Actually, we had many discussions about how it was just sex
- and how we wouldn't let it get weird.
- I'm not acting weird.
You're acting like a jealous girlfriend is what the fuck you're acting like.
- I am not your girlfriend.
- I know that.
You're not my boyfriend, so why are we having this conversation right now?
Because you're about to fuck Lester to spite me, it seems like.
Did you fuck Stacey to spite me?
No.
You fucked her like you fucked every other bitch and never gave a shit how I felt about it.
- Well, that was before.
- Before what?
Look, don't fucking pretend that the other night, you and me, right there, that that didn't mean anything to you, that you didn't feel it too.
Oh.
You're not getting all gooey on me here, are you, Zack?
You know what?
If you were any other bitch I didn't give a rat's ass about,
I would tell you to go fuck yourself right now because I fucking hate this game-playing shit.
But you, you mean more to me than that, so I'm just gonna lay this out on front street.
I know you felt something big, something real the other night when we were together because I felt it too.
We tried to fuck and instead, we wound up making love.
So if this is what you need to hear in order to keep you from fucking Lester, if this is what you need, then fine.
Here it is, I'm gonna say it.
I love you, Miri.
Happy?
Oh, Jesus.
You better get ahold of yourself, Zack, because we just fucked.
Okay.
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?
But you did.
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.
[WHISPERS] Wait...
All right, don't forget I'm down here.
Watch that pullout, huh?
STACEY:
Yeah.
Mmm.
This is some damn good coffee.
- Where you going?
- Getting the fuck out of here.
We gotta finish this movie.
[GASPS]
Yo!
[COUGHING AND GRO ANING]
You believe this shit?
Do you believe this shit?
What the fuck just happened in there?
I'll tell you what just happened in there.
That chick frosted me like I was a fucking cake.
Zack.
TEEN 1:
Okay, seriously, get a picture of me right now.
I'm hunting humans.
- Dude, check it out.
Ooh.
- Oh, shit.
Seriously, let's shoot the shit out of this bitch.
- Where you aiming at?
- Cock shots?
Cock shots.
[BUZZER RINGS]
[BUZZER RINGS]
We shot you in the balls, cunt nugget.
Well, it's my job to get shot in the balls, so...
Oh, they're gone.
MAN:
Excuse me.
Didn't you used to work at the Bean-N-Gone in Monroeville?
I sure as shit hope this pays better, I tell you.
[CHATTERING]
So why don't they just shoot you with a puck?
What do you mean?
I mean, what does paintball got to do with hockey?
Nothing, I guess.
- So ain't no prizes or...?
- No, no.
So, what are they paying $5 for?
To shoot a Broad Street Bully in the balls.
White people are fucked up.
Yup, they sure are.
It's a living.
You've been getting the checks I've been sending?
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Probably didn't save you from a brutal tongue-lashing, though, huh?
You know, the wife never found out about the camera, because I paid off the bills.
How did you manage that?
- Because now I'm Oprah rich.
- No way.
- The post office fucking settled?
- Hundred-sixty large, son.
- Nice, man.
Congratulations.
- A beautiful day, thank you very much.
I thought you made that whole thing up.
No, no.
It was very real.
You can believe it.
Even though she's spending all of it.
Well, since you ain't gonna ask me, I'll just go ahead and tell you.
- No, I have not seen Miri.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.
Oh, I suppose you weren't gonna ask about your movie, neither?
Look, that's why I came down here.
I need you to come take a look at it.
- I'm not interested.
Sorry.
- You'd better get interested
- because you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?
The story doesn't make sense.
- The story?
- The story doesn't make sense.
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?
It's a movie, dog, and a movie's gotta have an ending, which we don't have at the moment.
Come shot, credits.
There's your fucking ending.
Do me this favor, okay?
When you're done getting your nuts blown off, come back to humble Monroeville to my crib for a couple hours, check out the flick, you tell me what's missing.
No.
I'll tell you what, you do that, you don't owe me shit no more.
- Really?
- Really.
- Is your wife home?
- Yes.
- Maybe I should leave the pads on.
- You got some extra ones?
Hey, honey.
Where the fuck you been?
And who in the fuck is this now?
Would you calm down, woman?
Goddamn.
You already left one white boy down in my basement while you off gallivanting and shit.
What if this motherfucker
- was all grabby on me?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
Oh, what in the fuck is that supposed to mean?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
WIFE:
White boys love me.
White boy.
- I said, white boy.
- Yeah?
You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?
- Should I say yes?
- Just say yes.
Yeah.
- Why don't you, uh, head downstairs?
- Oh, okay.
It's just through this hallway.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
What the fuck you looking at?
Why you gotta be yelling at me in front of my director?
- Oh, he's a director?
- Yeah.
I didn't know that.
Shit, he's a director.
Well, why don't he direct my ass to a new husband?
How about that shit?
- That's the bedroom.
DELANEY:
Keep talking, maybe he will.
Oh, don't nobody want them saggy-ass balls!
Saggy balls?
Look at these sagging-ass titties you got around here.
- You could tie these together.
- Motherfucker, we match.
Oh, shit.
Where's my paintball gun at?
Look at you, editor and DP.
You got your shit covered, man.
Please, don't ever say "shit-covered" to me again.
Roll the film for the man, please, so we can see what he thinks.
Just jump through it.
I ain't got all night.
The bitch is on me.
"Nigga Rich Productions." Classy.
- Yeah, DreamWorks was taken.
- Was it?
Plus, it sounds like an underground gay fuck club.
"I met a guy at DreamWorks." Yeah.
All right, so we got Lester and Stacey fucking.
Then we got Barry and Bubbles fucking.
And then this boring bullshit.
Okay, just, uh, go to the next scene, would you?
Uh...
- What next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?
We never shot it.
- Why not?
- Because after you left that night,
Miri came out of the backroom and said she couldn't do it.
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped?
So...
- Wait, so Miri...
- Never fucked nobody.
Just you.
Now, I wonder why she did that.
- Hm.
- Hm.
You see, there was a time when I was just a bitter old fuck making coffees, and Stacey was just a lap dancer and Barry and Bubbles didn't know each other and this fool here, hell, I don't even know what he was.
- A white supremacist.
- Man, fuck you.
Then two people come along and showed us something we didn't know existed.
A world of possibilities where plain old people just like us could do something special.
Even if it's something as simple as filming people fucking.
Sometimes we just need someone to show us something we can't see for ourselves
and then we're changed forever.
So as you can see, our movie ain't got no ending.
Every movie needs an ending, don't it?
Peace.
Delaney, you're a slick cupid motherfucker.
Ain't love grand?
WIFE:
Why the fuck is this white boy running through my goddamn house?
[DOOR SLAMS]
Sometimes.
Miri.
- Miri.
MIRl:
Zack?
ZACK:
Miri.
I'm sorry.
MIRl:
Get out.
- Close the door.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over...
- Just close the fucking door, Zack.
I never slept with Stacey that night, okay?
I swear to God.
When we got into my room, you know what we did?
We talked about you, and us and how things were different and how I was too much of a fucking pussy to just tell you how I felt about you.
And I know...
I know that that's only because of all the stupid shit we said about how we wouldn't let sex change us, but it did.
It changed me.
That has to be love, right?
It has to be love and just so you know, I can't go back to being just friends anymore,
- because I just can't.
- Good.
And I think...
I think that you feel the same way.
Because that night after I left, you didn't fuck Lester.
What's up, Zack?
You know what?
I don't care that you're fucking Lester, okay?
How's that?
- Oh, shit.
- I don't wanna be with anyone but you.
So I will wait forever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life because I love you, and I have for as long as I can remember.
And I would rather die than be without you, Miriam Linky.
Miri's last name is Linky?
You're gonna fuck a guy who doesn't know your last name?
Or that you beat up Carl Roth in the sixth grade?
I know that.
Or what your senior prom dress would've looked like had we gone but we decided not to, and we got drunk alone instead.
Or that you washed your hair in the toilet.
We're not fucking, Zack.
Or that you're not fucking Zack...
What?
I asked her to fuck me.
She wouldn't do it.
I even tried to talk her into giving me the fucking Dutch rudder.
Shot me down on that too.
- And a Dutch rudder is?
- Don't know what a Dutch rudder...?
All right, you grab your dick, then you have someone else work your arm.
Here, let me show you.
All right, grab my arm.
I'm grabbing my dick, you're grabbing my arm.
Now work it.
Work my arm.
See that shit?
Work it up and down.
It's like someone else is jerking you off.
Okay.
There's the double Dutch rudder, which, I grab my dick, you grab your dick, you work my arm, I work your arm, same time.
It's like jerking off together but not gay.
We're not touching dicks, each other's dicks anyway.
I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.
It feels good, sir.
Try me, come on.
Sorry to change the subject on you, Lester, but if you're not fucking Miri, why is your dick out right now?
Because I live here now, and I like to be naked.
- What?
- When you moved out, she couldn't afford to pay her rent by herself, so I moved in to help.
But you just came out of her room.
That's my room now.
She moved in your old room.
Wait, wait, wait.
She changed rooms?
Yeah, she said she did it because she missed the smell of you or some shit.
[SNIFFS]
I don't smell anything.
But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.
- Night, Zack.
- Night.
Do you?
Then why are you crying?
Because I missed you so much.
ZACK:
Me too.
I love you.
- I love you, I love you.
ZACK:
I love you.
I don't mean to alarm you but I think I just jerked off Lester a little bit.
- The Dutch rudder?
- Yeah, it's ingenious, right?
If you ask me nicely, I will Dutch-rudder you the rest of our lives.
Good.
I'm getting tired of fucking the Fleshlight.
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.
- What'd it feel like?
- Like fucking a flashlight.
LESTER:
Wrong room.
- Oh, God.
That's gross.
Let us fuck.
Hello.
Welcome to Nigga Rich Productions, home of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, the production house for the couple looking to put a little spice in their sex life.
- Shall we take a look around?
- Fuck me so hard.
Oh, God.
First, you'll meet for a consultation with one of our romance-ologists, who'll coach you through that initial awkward stage before you're camera-ready.
So we will start off with some erotic massage and some...
Dude.
Some light petting.
That sounds good.
Are you guys sure you don't wanna do some, uh, butt-sack work too?
- Uh, let's move on, shall we?
- Why?
- Uh, let's move on, shall we?
- Why?
ANNOUNCER:
From their break-out hit, Swallow My Cockuccino, to the multi-million selling Swallow My Cockuccino II and the award-winning Star Whores saga, including Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter,
Zack and Miri have proven time and again that they know how to shoot hot sex.
As an actor, I've sometimes brought my work home with me inappropriately.
When you're telling your real-life lover in the bedroom, to, you know, bend over while you cake your hand in K-Y, it is a sign that the romance is dead, I think.
Then we turned to the professionals at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
Oh, my God, they totally saved our civil union.
They filmed what was inside of us and not what was coming out of us necessarily.
It helped me see his asshole as not just a come Dumpster, but a sign of his beauty, his flower.
It became a, uh, gorgeous orchid.
Orchids grow in sort of the filthiest conditions.
That's what his asshole became to me.
This beautiful flower amidst shit.
- Honey, they get the metaphor.
- I don't think they do.
Let's just say, thank you to Zack and Miri.
It's helped us out, it's helped our friends.
Enrique?
Park?
Park?
Enrique?
Can we get a little love for Zack and Miri?
They don't even know what's going on, they're so pilled up.
But don't take his word for it.
Just ask our co-founders.
- Hi.
I'm Miri Linky Brown.
- I'm Zack Linky Brown.
Here at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, we're dedicated
- to committing your love...
- Or lust.
- To high-end, quality production digital video.
A forever keepsake of your passion.
That's right, Miri.
Why set up a camera at the end of your bed and settle for one unflattering angle, when you could let the professionals dazzle and delight your senses with an array of shots so masterfully rendered you'll swear Martin Scorsese snuck into your room
and caught you fucking?
And remember, we're not just the presidents of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
We're also clients.
ANNOUNCER:
Call now to set up your appointment
LESTER:
Way to fuck, Zack.
Get up' Zack.
Come on, I don't wanna be late for work.
Ahh!
Get out!
- Jesus, fuck!
Close the door if you're gonna take a shit.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over, it was not closed.
- Close the door' Zack!
- Okay, okay.
God.
- Fine.
- What's that thing?
- It's a hand warmer.
We're going now.
- You smell that?
Is that the car?
Fuck.
- Oh, goddamn it.
- What?
What?
- Oh, it's wedged in my taint.
- What is?
- It got wedged in my taint.
- What?
- It's stuck under my balls.
- It's between my balls and my leg.
- What's happening?
- Please, pull over.
Pull the fuck over!
- All right, all right!
Jesus, all right!
It's about to move up to my ass.
- What?
The movement makes it hotter.
It's tucked under them.
It's stuck under them.
Oh' fuck.
I think I burned my ball hair off.
It's not funny.
Can you help me pick out an outfit for tonight?
I'm working till 6.
- Well' I can try stuff on at the store.
- The store?
No, how about instead, you get a friend?
But you are my friend.
I mean a girl friend, jeez.
Mr. Delaney, can you work for me tomorrow?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
Then you must come in the next day, I tell you.
- It's Black Friday.
- Black Friday?
It's the biggest mall-shopping day of the year.
And since the mall is just up the street, I would like you to come out and work.
- On Black Friday.
- Oh, yeah.
All right, you want me to work on Moolie Monday too?
- I'm sorry?
- How about Nigga Tuesday?
- Nigga Tuesday?
Is this a new holiday?
- You come to a brother and tell him he gotta work on Black Friday.
You got any idea how racist that sounds?
Telling me to work.
What, you think you own me?
- I never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?
You thought,
"I'm gonna lay down the law for this nigga, I put food on his table, clothes on his nigga baby backs, and he ain't gonna say shit."
- This ain't Amistad.
- You shut up.
You goddamn right this ain't Amistad.
I can't wait till the post office settles my disability suit because then I'm gonna be out this motherfucker.
I'm gonna be Oprah rich.
Y'all can kiss my ass.
You know what?
Fuck you.
Fuck you, and suck cock.
- To hell with you.
- To hell with you.
- Zachary will work.
Zack' my boy.
- Yeah.
- The customer with the harelip...
- Oh, yeah.
- speak me, say you were playing baseball here the other night.
Wiffle ball.
And' uh' no' that wasn't me.
Maybe the harelip makes it sound like "baseball."
Yeah, maybe you hear with an accent.
- Fuck you, okay?
- Okay.
One day' I'm gonna put a camera over there' and then I can tell...
I'll know everything you do when I'm gone.
Everything.
Scratch your balls, take a shit, everything, I tell you, okay?
Okay.
Fucker.
I hate both of you ebony and ivory motherfuckers, I tell you.
- Why is he so fucking high-strung?
- "Fuck off, I tell you.
Very good."
Can you believe that Gandhi motherfucker, telling me I gotta work on Black Friday?
Ain't that some shit?
- Yeah.
- Like I don't wanna do shopping.
Biggest sales day of the year.
I'm getting a flat-screen TV, believe that.
That's my fault, I should tell you.
I asked for Friday morning off, I'm sorry.
- For what?
- I actually need a lot of recovery time.
Tonight is me and Miri's ten-year high school reunion.
I'm just gonna get fucking alcohol poisoning.
- Reunion?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
- Isn't that fucked up that they do that?
They say it's the best chance to get everyone together.
People come back in town for the holidays.
But they could have it in the middle of the summer at a blowjob contest that I was judging' and it would still be retarded.
- So why you going, then?
- Miri's making me go.
Why you always bending over backwards for that girl'
- knowing she ain't giving up no ass?
- We got a good thing going.
She pays half the rent, does dishes, she wakes me up in the morning.
Why complicate that with sex?
Besides, man, I've known her since the first grade.
You don't fuck someone you met in the first grade.
Excuse me, I met my wife in kindergarten.
We got married senior year, and she has been the queen of my world ever since.
- What if you could do it all over again?
- I'd jerk off and live by myself.
That woman is the bane of my existence.
- See?
- Excuse me, can I get a coffee, black?
Can't you see we talking, white?
If you're gonna continue to emasculate me with this Barbie dress-up shit'
I'm using your laptop.
Don't forget to smack it when you turn it on, otherwise the screen doesn't come on.
Why don't you spring and get a new one?
Same reason I don't spring for clothes for tonight, I'm broke.
There's a chick who works at Teen Juice at the mall, you know.
I gave her a good deal on yarn,
- so she's letting me borrow this stuff.
- Yo, bro.
What?
- You're buying a vibrator online.
- What's wrong with the one you have?
- It died last week.
Look at the size of those fucking panties.
Shoot that shit.
Shoot it.
My God, who even knew Amazon sold shit like this?
This is incredible.
- Those are fucking granny panties.
- Okay,
A, I don't appreciate you violating the sanctity of my Amazon Wish List page' and B, I'm not buying that thing from Amazon, because it turns out I don't have a credit card they take.
- Oh, shit.
- I'm sorry, guys.
Am I in the way?
You're a fucking faggot, all right?
Let's go to Starbucks.
- He's a shitty barista anyways.
- Cock.
- And he throws like a bitch.
- You know what else I throw?
My nut sack in your coffees, so how did that taste, fucker?
We saw your girlfriend in her underwear, cunt nugget.
Well' too bad she's not my girlfriend, you little fuck...
Oh, they're gone.
Are you still talking to me?
Uh, just said, I'm gonna look up more fuck toys on Amazon.
Oh' holy shit.
- They sell the Fleshlight here too.
- What's that?
It's a fucking pocket pussy that is shaped like a flashlight
"for discretionary jacking off."
That way if you get caught, no one thinks it's weird.
You're just a guy who likes to fuck his flashlight.
I am totally buying this shit.
Whoa, if you've got money to burn, how about paying the electric bill?
- That's due already?
- November's is probably due now, but I was talking about September's.
Tell me this doesn't rock.
You kind of look like Ronald McDonald.
That makes me want some McNuggets.
Why would you wanna buy a pocket pussy anyway?
That is so sad.
What?
Excuse me, I forgot about the nobility that accompanies coming with a fucking vibrator.
Think a kid in Darfur gets saved every time a vibrator makes you come?
No.
- "Real feel action"?
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
If you start fucking machines, I'm moving out.
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a machine.
How come you get to fuck something with a motor in it?
I've never met a man who can make me come like a vibrator does.
That's bullshit.
You get to be Buck Rogers having sex in the 25th century with fucking Twiki and Dr. Theopolis.
I'm stuck to a bottle of Jergens in the bathroom.
Holy bejesus.
You do not use my Jergens to jack it in our bathroom.
No, you know what I do actually, is I light a bunch of candles and I sprawl out on my sheets and I listen to Sting.
No, I'm a guy.
Give me two Popsicle sticks and a rubber band,
I'll find a way to fuck it, like a filthy MacGyver.
Oh' my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.
How about this?
I don't get why you're putting so much effort into this thing.
I thought we were just gonna go to sit around and make fun of everybody.
I can't wear anything that I already own and expect to bring home Bobby Long.
Bobby fucking Long?
No way.
Didn't that guy call you "Stinky Linky"?
Yeah, that was then, okay?
Maybe now he can save me a fortune in Amazon bills.
Maybe you can fuck our landlord so we can at least keep a roof over our heads.
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.
Hey, I bought skates with last week's paycheck
- and I need those to skate with.
- Oh.
And this week's will barely cover the past two water bills, so...
Is this sexy?
Yeah, in like a To Catch a Predator kind of way' it is pretty fucking sexy.
Then we're done.
What the fuck?
Zack.
- You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?
- They shut it off.
- Oh, shit.
Just, uh...
Help me get this shit out of my hair.
Just use the water out of the toilet.
- There's poo in there.
- Not that part.
- The back part of the toilet thing.
- Oh, that makes sense.
Take the cup there and then scoop it in, there you go.
Here, I'll lean back and you can just' you know, pour it down like...
Like that.
You're harshing my buzz' you know.
This is so lame.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Whoa!
All right, one hour tops, then we're gone.
Or I had an idea.
We could just not go at all, which would rock.
Even though we're broke and we've never amounted to anything, we're still better than these people, right?
No.
Not at all.
We're probably not even as good as most of them, unless one of them is a crackhead or something.
Just tell me I'm prettier than when we graduated.
You look about the same.
Definitely not prettier, but around the same.
I'm thinner, though' right?
A little?
Not really.
Well' good pep talk.
Fuck.
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.
- You don't recognize us' do you?
- Um, no, sorry.
Zack Brown, Miri Linky.
Were you the one they called Stinky Linky?
Oh' no' no one ever called me that.
Oh.
- Great.
What does yours say?
- What the fuck?
Come on.
- I'm sure I had a nickname.
Nothing?
- All right, you have a great time' and before you go, don't forget your copy of The Roving Roe-Ver.
What the fuck's this shit?
That is not shit, that would be our bi-monthly newsletter.
- Awesome.
- It updates you
- on what everyone's doing.
- Finally.
I love your enthusiasm.
Here you go.
Write your e-mail address on that and I'll be sure to add you to our 800-member-strong mailing list.
We had 800 people in our graduating class?
Yes, and only 250 R.S.V.P.'d.
Doesn't that suck, Mary?
- Miri.
- You married, Bets?
- I am.
Two kids.
- Wow, that's beautiful.
- Awesome.
- You wanna fuck me later?
- Uh, no, I'm married.
- Okay, cool.
If you change your mind,
- I'll be in there getting shitfaced.
- He will.
- Just so you know, I eat the pussy.
- He does.
Ah, tempting.
Again, no.
- Shall we?
- Sir.
Bye, Bets.
Think about it.
Enjoy.
Can I get two beers' please?
You want a beer?
- Yeah.
- Three beers.
- Thank you.
- Here you go.
Is that Zack?
Or am I Zack?
Whoa, ho, ho.
Oh' wow.
- Never gets old, huh?
- The other Zack.
Oh' in my world, nobody calls me "the other Zack, "
now that this guy's not around anymore, huh?
- Get the fuck off of me.
- There can be only one.
- What?
- Highlander, man?
The Kurgan.
Remember?
I'd yell it at you whenever we passed each other in the hallway?
Like it was yesterday' man.
Awesome.
Awesome.
Awesome.
God, you guys have so much to catch up on.
Whoo.
- No.
- I'm gonna let you get to it.
Bitch.
Have you seen that big blowup picture they have of me?
Yeah, it's...
My hair is terrible.
I can't believe I even wore my hair like that.
That's before I knew about styling products' you know.
It makes a big difference in life.
But you live and learn, though' right?
I mean, ten years ago, Pittsburgh, who knew anything about fashion?
Back in the day' our hairstyle, oh...
Hey, stranger.
- Whoa.
Stinky Linky.
- Yeah.
Although it's just Miri now.
- Give me a hug.
- Oh, okay.
- Hi, heh, heh, heh.
- Hi.
Wow.
- How have you been?
- Great, great.
- Yeah?
- You look fantastic.
Wow, that is not something that you would have said to me ten years ago.
- Well' I've grown up.
- Yes.
Yes, you have.
You just look...
Ooh, heh, heh.
- Well' listen to you.
Thank you.
- No, don't thank me, just fuck me.
Roxanne.
Hey.
Someone I like, what are the odds' huh?
Zack Brown, we had four years of Spanish together.
Why does no one recognize me?
- Am I thinner?
Is that it?
- Look at him.
- Who?
- My stupid husband.
No fucking shit.
John Butterfield?
You actually married John Butterfield?
- That's amazing.
- Don't ever get married.
It sucks.
You stop appreciating each other and run out of shit to talk about after the first year.
But look at him now, chatty as fuck.
Flirting up a storm with that cheerleader nimrod Monica Von.
You want me to maybe flirt with you so he can see it, even it up a bit?
I don't wanna get even.
If I was gonna do anything, I'd wanna one-up the asshole.
You can give me a handjob in the girls' locker room.
- Fine, but make it fast.
- Fuck, yeah.
Are you staying in town for a while or...?
Just tonight.
I fly back to L.A. tomorrow.
L.A., wow, Los Angeles.
Gosh' Bobby Long' coming up in the world.
- With Mrs. Long, I bet, huh?
- No, no, no.
No Mrs. Long for me.
- Then can I be honest with you?
- Sure.
Um...
Whew.
I think I need a drink.
Do you need a drink?
Because I need a drink to say this.
- I've got a beer already, so...
- Oh, great, thank you.
I think there's a cigarette butt in there.
Yup.
Sorry about the elbow.
There can be only one.
Can I get a beer, please?
Thank you very much.
Oh' Jesus Christ.
My friend's making an ass of herself hitting on her high school crush.
Oh' God' that's so sad.
It's so Miri, is what it is.
I'm Zack, by the way.
Brandon.
Don't worry, we weren't in the same class or anything.
- Okay.
Lucky you.
- Are you a Monroe-ver?
Well' I went here' let's just leave it at that, I guess.
Do you have one of the large blown-up pictures of your younger self
- hanging around here?
- I do, kind of.
Right there.
Gorgeous.
- Good times.
What do you do?
What brings you here?
I came with somebody who went to school here.
- Really?
- Bobby Long.
No shit.
That's who my friend's hitting on right now.
See right there?
- Really.
- One dressed like Hannah Montana?
In L.A., we call that look "Nickelodeon chic."
- Wait, L. A?
Los Angeles?
- California.
That's awesome, man.
What do you do out there?
- I'm an actor.
- Wow, that's really impressive.
- Thank you, thank you.
- In fucking movies?
"Fucking movies." Pretty much.
Look at you.
What...?
Anything I've seen?
What movies?
Oh' all sorts of movies with all-male casts.
All-male casts.
Like Glengarry Glen Ross?
Like that?
Like Glen and Gary Suck Ross' Meaty Cock and Drop Their Hairy Nuts in His Eager Mouth.
- Is that like a sequel?
- Sort of.
- It's a re-imagining.
- Oh, like The Wiz.
More erotic and with less women.
No women' to be exact.
I apologize in advance if I am out of line here, but are you in gay porn?
- Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?
- I thought you recognized me, that's...
- Oh, okay, I get it.
You're not in my demographic' so I'm not insulted.
- Not really.
Who's your demographic?
- Do you love pussy?
- I do.
- Then not you.
Oh' okay.
I came here tonight hoping to seduce you and bring you back to my apartment and sleep with you to, uh, get back at you, you know, for calling me Stinky Linky all those years ago.
Wow.
That is a weird revenge plot.
- You must be a terrible lay for that.
- What?
No, I'm great.
I mean, I've had enough practice and everything.
That...
Wow, that sounded not good.
I fuck a lot.
That's what I meant to say.
That doesn't sound good either.
Wow.
You're a lot funnier than I remember.
Thank you.
Gosh, you turned out to be such a nice guy.
It just...
You know' it makes it even easier to just...
To just say this.
Would you like to come back to my place and maybe open a bottle of wine and have ourselves a real high school reunion?
- I...
- Hello, Miriam.
Beat it, we're talking.
- I wanted to introduce you to Brandon.
- Salutations.
- Bobby's boyfriend.
- Bobby who?
- Bobby me.
- Bobby Long.
Brandon is the star of such adult fare as...
What was that one called again?
You Better Shut Your Mouth or I'm Gonna Fuck It.
That's right.
I'm surprised I forgot that.
Are you fucking with me?
No, they're fucking with each other.
Oh' my God.
- No.
- What?
Granny Panties?
- Excuse me?
- How can you tell?
This is so crazy.
I was literally just watching you, like, right before we got here.
This is so crazy.
This is you, right?
My name's Granny Panties, and nobody wants to fuck me.
Nothing's whiter than my big gay ass...
Where'd you get that?
Oh' I entered "gay" and "ass, " and it was the top hit.
It's had 200, 000 views in three hours.
Honey' you are, like...
I'm jealous right now because you're, like, super famous.
Baby, please take our picture.
I get a picture with Granny Panties.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is awesome.
- All right, smile.
Okay' got it.
- Did you get it?
- Oh, thank you very much.
- E-mail me that.
Oh' because he's the worst photographer.
Okay' good.
- You're gay?
- Yeah.
And I'm on the Internet wearing a diaper?
Who knew you'd come to Pittsburgh and meet a celebrity?
I'm gonna binge-drink now until I pass out.
Okay.
She'll be fine.
So you guys suck each other's cocks, huh?
Oh' like crazy.
Okay, that's enough, I think.
I'm embarrassing him.
I love when he's embarrassed.
He's not living out loud, so he gets all like, ooh.
- You are totally in love, aren't you?
- Zachary' we are.
Wow, I...
Oh' God' I just wanna eat him up, yum, yum.
Save some for me' yum, yum, yum.
- I can't keep my hands off him.
- You've had one too many.
Although he does most of the eating in the sack.
In the sack and of the sack.
All right, that's enough.
Look, you've drunk too much.
You do this every time.
You get too Mary for everybody in the room
- and you can't contain yourself.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
And by containing myself, do you mean containing myself in a closet?
In a closet of denial?
Is that...?
No, no, no.
Holy shit, this just got real.
This is exactly why you haven't met my mother.
You don't know how to ease people into this situation.
- You just force your way in every time.
- I thought, maybe for one second in this godforsaken town, I could be myself.
I'm so sorry.
No, you're right' I should just butch up and pretend that I don't love it when you shove your dick in my mouth.
- This is the best night of my life.
- Am I making a spectacle?
- I could make a much bigger scene.
- You really are.
I'm sorry.
Pittsburgh.
Listen up' Monroe-vers.
My name is Brandon St. Randy' and I love Bobby Long.
- Fucking A.
- Is that enough?
Is that enough of a scene?
I could start doing worse than that.
The reason you haven't taken me to your mother's...
Your mother with her makeup and all her drinking, she's in the closet too.
- They fight just like real people.
- I thought I'd be a conduit for you...
Thank you.
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm not.
- Thank you.
- I love you.
- I'll e-mail you.
- Zack, it was so nice to meet you.
And I will be patient with you.
I will be there on your journey.
I will be your Sherpa up the mountain of gayness.
Well' might as well see how many hits Granny Panties is up to, huh?
Did I do that?
Thanks, George.
What kind of evil fucks turn off your power the day...?
No, the night before Thanksgiving?
Who does that?
Can you get an advance on your card?
Fleshlight maxed-out my $200 limit.
Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.
This is bad.
If we don't come up with rent, we're gonna get locked out.
Who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.
Which means by the time we get home, there's no heat either.
Well' I think it's time we put what we always talked about into effect.
- You're gonna have to start hooking.
- You know, you jest, but these are the exact circumstances people find themselves in right before they start having sex for money.
- Yeah.
- Or making porn.
Oh, my God, yeah.
- What?
You got an idea?
We could make a porno.
- Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?
No, that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me?
That's a rad idea.
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend, he said he makes a hundred grand a year because he shoots and distributes his own porno flicks.
If it's so easy, how come everybody doesn't do it?
Because other people have options and dignity, which we do not have, which puts us in an amazingly advantageous position.
Fuck you, I have dignity.
Where?
Is it hidden in your gigantic underpants that are plastered all over the Internet?
Is that where you hide your dignity?
Every woman has a pair of those period panties.
That's, like, a fact.
Okay.
Families.
I bet people don't make porno, because they have families.
But luckily, your parents are dead.
Sorry.
My grandparents are dead.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
So who are we gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone mainstream now.
It's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks in it.
Look at Paris Hilton.
She throat-fucks a guy in night vision, now she's selling fragrances to tweens.
And I'm pretty sure she's legally retarded.
That's for tweens?
Have you seen that Joe Francis guy who made Girls Gone Wild?
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot piece of shit in the world and he has a jet and a fucking island.
Look, there's got to be a less extreme solution to our financial woes here.
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper route.
- I don't have a bike.
- Be a waiter.
No one wants me around their food.
Would you eat food that I gave you?
I would not eat food that you gave me, that's true.
I mean, nobody wants to see us fuck, Zack.
Everybody wants to see anybody fuck.
I hate Rosie O'Donnell, but if someone said' "I got a tape of Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid, "
I'd be like, "Why aren't we watching that right now? "
Because she's famous.
Hello.
So are you.
You're fucking Granny Panties.
My underwear and your ass are famous' we're not.
So who the F would wanna watch us fuck?
- At least 800 people.
- The jerks we went to school with?
- Are you serious?
- Of course.
If you heard that someone we graduated with was in a fucking porno movie, you'd watch it, right?
I'd watch that guy Brandon suck a cock, I just met him.
With this mailing list, we have almost a thousand people that would definitely buy a porno we were in just to be like,
"Hey, I sat next to that guy in Civics.
Look at his fucking dick."
We sell a thousand copies at 20 bucks a pop, bam' we have paid off our bills.
So' what do you think?
- I don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.
Oh' wow, like you've never done that before.
How many guys have you met in a bar, taken home, banged with your mouth and then never talked to again?
That's what we call a stranger.
Dude, I don't one-night mouth-fuck anybody that I pick up in bars.
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in the porno movie for some weird reason.
I guess...
We could fuck.
- Ew.
- Fuck you.
I mean, you're a nice-enough-looking guy and everything...
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're an all-right-enough-looking girl.
- How does that feel?
- Dude' I'm just saying it'd be weird and wrong, you know, like fucking my brother.
Okay, seriously, we're just talking about sex, okay?
It's for a purpose.
It's for getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.
- Wow.
- Just explain to your private beforehand,
"Look' this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash."
- Oh, my God.
- What?
You're just doing this because you've always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?
Yes.
I've gone my whole life pretending that I want nothing to do with you, just hoping one day we'd be in such dire financial straits that I could use it to finally make my move on you.
You're just being sarcastic.
- I am.
See' I was pretending to cry right there.
I guess it's not like it'd be creepy, like if we got way too drunk one night and accidentally fucked, you know?
No.
We'd be going in with the understanding that it's...
A business decision.
Strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.
- Right.
- And by end,
I mean, I'll be waxing your ass.
Fuck you.
I'm not even letting you see my ass.
I've seen your ass and the rest of you naked around a billion times already.
- That goes both ways, buddy.
- You've never seen my dick.
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.
Are you kidding?
That party we went to where you got blasted, and Houls dared you to give yourself head, and we all watched you try for, like, an hour.
Oh' yeah.
Thanks by the way, for fucking letting me do that.
Thank you.
Oh' God.
We really do know too much about each other.
See' and this would really just be one more thing.
I mean, look at us.
It's Thanksgiving and we're huddled around a flaming fucking garbage can like a couple of steno bums.
I mean, this could give us a chance to pay off our debt, pay our bills, get a fucking nicer apartment with heat in it maybe.
What are you doing?
Miriam Linky, will you have sex with me on camera for money?
I will.
A producer?
- Yeah.
- Guy who gets to finance the movie.
- You think I got that kind of money?
We just need that.
What you're about to spend on the flat screen.
Now I can't get my flat screen?
Fuck that.
No, no, no.
With your cut of the profits, you're gonna get two flat screens.
One in your living room, one in your bathroom.
One in the bathroom?
You know, it's always been my dream to watch shit while I shit.
Everyone with an ass loves to watch shit while they shit.
- I'm gonna make that happen for you.
- I don't know, man.
What else the producer do?
- Um, they help with the casting.
- What's casting?
Finding the people to be in the movie.
- I get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.
Like, I can look at a titty, make sure there ain't no moles on there?
- You can look at both titties, man.
- Man.
I've been looking at the same busted titties for the past almost 20 years.
- I'm due for another new titty.
- Please help us.
Please.
Please.
Yes.
Yes.
I love you.
Well' don't mind that smell.
We had some homeless people squatting in here.
You know, they'd void their bowels everywhere but the bathroom.
Anyway, you pick up the poop and you've got yourself a movie studio.
Why don't we shoot in your apartment?
No power.
You wanna pay our electric bill?
- You motherfuckers...
- We'll take it.
Bring it back.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Oh' Jesus.
Oh' Jesus.
Oh' God.
Come on.
Why the fuck do I have to do everything?
Fuckers.
Hey, what is that?
Fucking guys.
This fucking team, man.
They fucking suck.
I'm gonna hatefuck the shit out of you, ref.
- Dude.
- It's cool.
- He's my cousin.
- Hey.
Didn't you used to videotape the varsity basketball games in high school?
Just the away games.
I did it because I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.
Which one?
Whichever one wanted to fuck the guy who taped the varsity games.
- Aw.
- Still know how to work a camera?
- Who cares what the title is?
- The porn I liked when I was a kid, it was always, like, a spoof of a popular movie, you know?
Like, um, Edward Penishands.
Okay, so we need a mildly clever, vaguely dirty title, that sounds like a real movie
- and sums up what you're gonna see.
- Correct.
An American Werewolf in Brenda?
Fuckback Mountain?
- Too soon?
A Cock-in-Lips Now?
- Next.
Cradle the balls.
Work the shaft.
Jerk my come-crayon and let me color you white.
I need cock and I need it now.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
It's "puss" as in pussy.
Oh' because I was like' who would wanna fuck puss?
I want to slam my ham in your can, woman.
Scene.
- This guy is amazing.
- This guy's great-looking too.
I wanna fuck him.
Hi, my name's Delaney and I'm a producer.
I really don't know what it means.
I'm gonna be honest' this is my first time.
You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna touch you or nothing like that.
- All right.
- I have a wife, you know.
We're happy.
I mean, not happy' but it's cool, you know.
Just so you know, there will be some fucking.
- We'll talk about that if you get the part.
- Okay.
I mean, not...
We won't be fucking, there'll be fucking in the movie.
Like I said' I got a wife.
She don't play that shit.
- She is a crazy bitch.
- Yep.
It's my job as the producer to see what you got.
So if that makes you uncomfortable in any way, you don't have to show me anything you don't wanna show me, because...
I love the movies.
- Lawrence of a Labia.
- No.
- Oh, come on.
- Dawn of the Dick.
Yeah, but how are zombies doing it at all sexy?
I want to eat your brain and your ass.
- Dude.
- Sci-fi.
Yeah.
Close Encounters With a Turd From Behind.
- I don't know what that means.
- Just asses.
Fucking deep in asses.
What?
We're making a porno and we just need to know what you would be or would not be interested in doing.
If anything.
- No anal.
- Oh, definitely no anal.
Anal and hugging.
I don't do ass stuff.
- Anal.
- Ah, fuck.
- Oh, wait, oral.
I like anal.
- Yay.
Okay, well, so, uh, do you have any special skills?
Special skills?
I can get a boner really quick and it sticks straight up.
- Is that really a special skill?
- I think.
- Can you show us what you mean?
- Sure.
Oh' that is special.
Yeah, you're hired, Mr...
- Who are you again?
- Lester.
Lester "The Molester" Cockinshtuff.
- No.
- Wow.
That is the best porn name I've ever heard' man.
I can have a porn name?
- Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.
Are you Granny Panties?
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The panties are actually in the house.
- I'll get them.
- Whoa.
The Wrath of Cunt.
- We never made a Star Sex 1.
I guess we can lose Star Sex 3:
The Search for Cock, then.
- Cocunt.
- What's that?
It's Cocoon with a cunt.
So Delaney tells us you have a special talent of some sort.
I don't know if I'd call it a special talent, but it's a little something I picked up doing bachelor parties.
It would probably be easier if I just showed you.
- Great.
- The floor is yours.
So a movie, huh?
That could be fun.
Holy fuck.
Her name's Bubbles.
- Invasion of the Potty-Snatchers?
- That's like MAD Magazine stupid.
Well' fuck you' okay?
You try to think of a good sci-fi porno title.
It's hard.
There's gotta be one we haven't thought of that would say it all' not be ridiculously filthy and off-putting, and still have instant recognition with our audience.
- I got it.
- I got it.
- Star Whores.
- Yeah.
It's funny' right?
See' we figured this opens us up to an even bigger sales market beyond the people we went to school with.
People who like comics and sci-fi.
Comics?
Like "Ziggy"?
"Ziggy"?
Is that even in fucking papers anymore?
No, man.
Fuck you. "Ziggy" is a comic' right next to "Family Circus."
No, like Spider-Man and shit, you know?
There's always a shitload of Star Wars nerds at those comic-book shows.
So we sell them a Princess Leia they can really fucking jerk off to.
- That'd be me, Princess Lay-Her.
- Who am I playing?
You' my friend, are the lead role of Lubed Guy-Baller.
Man' he's gonna be balling dudes?
I thought you said this was boys on girls.
If I have to fuck a guy' okay, but I'd rather fuck a girl.
What's wrong with you, boy?
- We'll change the name to Sky-Baller.
- Sky-Baller.
I will be Hung So-low.
Delaney, my friend, you are On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
Man' I can't be in no porno.
My wife will kill me.
Hump me, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
You're my only hump.
On the other hand, fuck my wife.
Unfortunately, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over does not have any sex in the movie but the droids do, l-CUP and R2-T-Bag.
I robot.
And Stacey over here is gonna play Darth Vibrator.
- I'm the bad guy?
- She's not a guy, Zack.
I know that because I'm not a fucking idiot.
In our movie, Darth Vibrator is a bad girl who wants to fuck the galaxy, literally' and it's up to Lubed and Hung to stop her with their cocks.
- You and me get to have sex, then?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- I know.
Isn't that awesome?
Hold up, hold up.
So who's all having sex with who in this movie?
As of last night, I was having sex with Zack.
What?
Han Solo ain't never had no sex with Princess Leia in the Star Wars.
Guys' this isn't a literal adaptation here.
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.
Kind of like The Wiz or like a parody.
With lots of anal.
- Cool.
- I know, isn't that awesome?
I have a question, do Princess Lay-Her and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?
Uh, no, because they're brother and sister, and according to Miri' brothers and sisters can't fuck.
But you said, that this wasn't a literal translation, so that means Lester's character could have sex with Miri's character.
Because I would love to fucking eat her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.
Dream on, pal, it's never gonna happen, okay?
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See' she's fine...
Wait, what?
Yep.
I mean, everyone else is having sex with more than one person in this movie all of a sudden, so I think it's' you know' not fair if I'm only fucking you.
Guys, read amongst yourselves, okay?
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Look, Miri, we got plenty of sex going on in this thing, you don't have to do that.
Zack, it's fine.
I mean I have slept with way worse-looking guys than Lester.
I just wanna do my part for the movie like everyone else.
You're having sex in the movie, you don't need to fuck someone else.
- You're good.
- I'm only fucking you' though.
So don't we need to vary it up to keep it fair?
Fair for...?
I don't...
What?
Fair for who?
What are these, blood diamonds we're talking about?
Fair for everyone else who is fucking more than one person, a.k.a. you' in the movie.
- I mean, fine...
- All right.
I mean, if you don't care...
I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
Fuck.
I don't give a shit.
Like you said, you know, you've fucked bigger idiots than Lester.
Holy shit.
Are we really gonna shoot this in outer space?
Maybe not bigger idiots.
Thank you.
- Cut.
All right, guys, that's it.
- Yeah.
Make sure you leave your costume so we know they're here for tomorrow.
Mostly, everybody, thank you so much for helping us get ready' you know.
Cleaning this place out, building the sets, sewing the costumes, it's just...
I mean, it's really amazing.
Thank you.
Seriously, thanks.
But this is just the beginning, guys.
If Star Whores works, and it will' we are set up for sequels galore.
The Empire Strikes Ass.
- Return of the Brown-Eye.
- The Phantom Man-Ass.
And Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter.
- Okay.
- Revenge of the Shit.
- You got it?
- Yeah, no, we got it.
Ew.
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.
- We'll talk about that one.
We're gonna have a lot of fun' but more importantly, we're gonna make a lot of fucking money' okay?
- Yeah.
- So get ready for greatness, people.
Tomorrow we start principal photography.
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
- All right, good night, you guys.
- We got a movie.
- What?
- Nothing.
I think someone should acknowledge how insane and amazing this is
- and it's all because of you.
- I don't know.
It's just a porno.
You know what I mean.
You've really come into your own.
Shut the fuck up.
So speaking of coming into things' ready for tomorrow?
Twenty years' we're finally gonna know what it's like to have sex with each other.
You say that like you've been wondering what it'd be like to sleep with me for a while now.
Why the fuck do you think I started hanging out with you?
I knew it.
Here, help.
Let's just promise that it's not gonna change anything between us, okay?
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Some guys can't keep sex in perspective.
If anyone's gotta keep this in perspective, it's you, okay?
I don't want you getting all mushy and gooey on me after I give you the best orgasm you've ever had.
Oh' like you know what you're doing down there at all.
I actually don't.
Where's the clitoris?
Is it in your ass?
Just, you know, make sure you kind of whoop it up and act like I'm a stud who knows what he's doing' okay?
Just be a pal.
Oh' dude, I am gonna Meryl Streep the fuck out of this tomorrow, you watch.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
No.
Really, thank you.
For everything.
You're welcome.
Less than 12 hours and we make Monroeville history.
- I really hope nothing goes wrong.
- It's a movie.
What could go wrong?
What are you doing?
What's up?
- What the fuck?
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait.
- Wait.
- Stop.
Stop.
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck is going on?
Condos is what's going on, as soon as this shit-hole's demo'd.
No, you gotta stop it right now.
We rented this place for a month from Mr. Jenkins.
Sounds like your Mr. Jenkins was full of shit.
Luxury Homesteads bought this place a month ago.
I'm gonna kill that lying old fuck.
You're gonna have to go Florida, that's where he moved.
We've got thousands of dollars of equipment in there.
- Please.
- If you wanna sift through this rubble when we're done, be my guest.
Hey, get that fucking beam down.
This is the last thing you wanna hear.
If you don't get an advance,
I don't think we're gonna keep a roof over our heads.
I got an advance already.
It went into all the costumes.
- So all our money's gone?
- All your money?
Never mind what my wife's gonna do when there ain't no new snow tires, or when she sees I charged a video camera.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this' man.
I just wanted to see some free titties.
That's all.
But there's no such thing as free titties' is there, Zack?
- Is there?
- Fuck this noise.
Why don't we get another camera, and shoot something else?
Where are we gonna do that?
Got another sound stage?
Sound stage?
We had a shit-covered garage we turned into a sound stage.
We find someplace new and we do it again.
How?
Okay, I'm broke, man.
No, make that' I was broke.
Now I am really tapped out.
I have to get another job to pay Delaney back.
So please tell me, how can I afford to start over?
- What can I get you?
- Yeah, can I get a, uh...?
Too fucking late.
Cappuccino, 3.50.
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
I mean, I'm a total loser in every single other aspect of my life.
What made me think I could do something as simple as filming people fucking?
We have no money left, nowhere to shoot, no sets, we have no fucking cameras.
Here.
It's time I go back to my regular life where I am a quiet fuckup who doesn't cost anybody any money and knows his goddamn position behind this fucking counter making cappuccinos for this fucking guy.
Oh' yeah.
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
Oh' yeah.
Yeah.
Fuck, yes.
Zack.
You sneaky Indian motherfucker.
I tell you, yes.
Swallow My Cockuccino.
- What?
- That's it.
That's the movie.
Why didn't I think of it before?
We don't need sets or a stage.
Look at all this production value, waiting to have balls on it.
Hold up.
You wanna shoot a dirty movie here, where we work?
Yes.
Fuck, yes, I do.
You know how many stories I have from working here?
How many times I've been laid right there after hours?
You've never gotten laid here after hours.
I know.
Thank you for reminding me.
But I always wish I had, and that's what porno is.
It's fantasy.
It's taking the normal and making it abnormal by fucking it.
Don't do that.
The little dog don't like that.
How did you get a camera?
By being a terrible, untrustworthy employee, that's how.
Give me today, I'll bang out a script.
Meet me back here after closing.
We're gonna launch arching ropes of jism all over this motherfucker.
Peace.
I like that guy but if he tries to fuck that little dog tonight for real,
I'm calling the Humane Society.
It's called Bean-N-Gone, so get the fuck out of here.
Hey, Barry.
Stand by, Stace' picture's up.
- Okay.
Roll tape.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 12, Take 1.
And action.
I'd like a double espresso so I can stay up all night because I'm in the mood to fuck.
Well' I am a whore-ista, so I love to fuck.
Would you like to fuck me?
Holy fuck.
You mean, after you're done with your shift?
I mean during my shift.
- Sorry.
- Keep going, keep going.
With your shaft.
Let us fuck.
Cue music.
Okay, open up to camera, guys.
Let us see it.
More tongue.
Little less tongue.
Oh' that was good.
Cue effects.
Oh' yeah, like that.
Oh' yeah.
See' I told you it would work.
Didn't I tell you?
It looks amazing.
It's incredible.
Oh' the beans hurt.
Easy.
- Move in for coverage.
- Nice.
That's why we got him.
- Nice.
I'm impressed.
- Get in there, Deacon.
- Come on.
- Like that?
Like that.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
- Pull out a bit, actually.
- That's hot.
No, not you, Lester.
Put it back in.
Kiss the muscle.
- I kiss the muscle.
- You kiss the muscle.
- Can he slap her ass a little?
- Don't be a fucking pervert, dude.
- Stir, come on.
Stir.
- Yeah, stir it.
Stir it, baby.
Hey.
- Holy.
- Shit.
Are you guys still open?
No.
We close at 9.
I need coffee so I'm drive home.
- Okay.
Yeah.
- Thank you.
That's a cute kitty.
Okay.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You guys see the game?
I was at it.
Fucking Roethlisberger, the quarterback, was all fucking'
"Hug it' chug it, football.
All night." Heh-heh.
Okay, pal' here you go.
On the house.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Have a good one.
- Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- I said, have a good one.
Oh.
- Okay.
Keep moving.
- You and your little dog.
Go Steelers.
Action.
Oh' yeah.
Yeah, yeah, like that.
Oh' fuck it' chuck it' football.
Oh' yeah.
Oh' God' this is good.
You take it.
You take it.
Take it, Barry.
Oh, take it.
Take it, Barry.
Take it.
I'm disturbed at how turned on I am by this.
- Shit, dude' it's almost 6.
- Oh, fuck.
Okay, that's a wrap, everybody, yeah.
Let's give a hand to our hotties with the bodies from last night.
Stacey, Lester, Bubbles, Barry' whoo.
Yeah.
- Nice.
Okay, when we come back tonight, we finish up the venti-vulva scene' and then we get into me and Miri's stuff.
Again' amazing first night, everybody.
Thank you so much.
Let us fuck.
- Hey' how'd it look?
- How do you think it looked?
It looked like shit going into other shit, in focus.
What an artist.
That was Kurosawa's motto. "Shit going into other shit."
Oh' man, I can't believe you gotta work now.
It's okay.
You know, honestly, I don't think I could sleep.
- I'm pretty, like, pumped up right now.
- Right?
It was amazing.
It was awesome.
I think the cast and crew had a good time.
- We were getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.
I just wanna keep shooting people boning all day.
I don't think I've ever met the ambitious Zack Brown before.
- Well' I'm trying to pay the bills, so...
- It's not a bad thing.
I think it looks good on you.
Come on, hurry.
Come on, come on' come on.
Wait a minute.
- You guys never did it before?
- It's fine.
You know, we talked about it and it's just for the movie.
We're friends' you know' we're just friends.
And we will always just be just friends, so...
Listen' I have some extra lube from last night.
I understand it's kind of hard getting wet when everyone's watching.
At least it was for Barry.
- I don't know if I am gonna need it.
- Really?
Yeah, I think I'm just excited.
Uh-huh.
At the idea of people watching' not because of Zack.
Oh' God.
Zack could never have that effect on me in a million years.
- Hello, Miriam.
- Oh, hey.
Wow.
- Your face.
- Yeah.
Weird, huh?
I don't think I've seen your face since senior year.
I think I made a mistake.
I did it for you so you wouldn't get road rash during our scene, but I should have asked first' I look like a fucking beluga whale.
I think I'll be going now.
Okay.
All I keep thinking is we should've done a trial run at home last week or something.
- Oh, my God.
Right?
- I know.
- You're still cool to do it, though, right?
- Yeah, um.
Totally.
Are you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I'm, uh...
- Honestly, I'm a little nervous, I guess.
- You are?
- It's kind of a big deal.
- It is?
Yeah, you know, it's our first time together since our auspicious debut on viral video.
Oh' yeah.
That's a fuckload of pressure for a director.
As a director, please.
What about the anxiety I'm feeling as an actress?
- Did I pick the right project?
- Yeah.
What about this follow-up?
Julia Roberts followed Pretty Waman with Sleeping With the Enemy.
I'm following Granny Panties with Swallow My Cockuccino.
Only difference is this movie's about cock-sucking and her movie just sucked cock, period.
- The only difference, yeah.
- The end was pretty rad.
I liked that.
- When she kills him.
- With a gun.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- She calls the cops first.
- She calls it in first.
- It was so awesome.
- Awesome, yeah.
So I guess we should do this.
I think we should probably wait just until I lose another 20 or 30 pounds.
Stop it.
You look good.
Thanks.
So, what about me?
How do I look?
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful, so I guess it's not a big deal, but you look amazing.
- Okay.
Let's go make a porno.
- Okay.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 8, Take 1.
Come here.
- I'm over...?
All right, settle.
Action.
Who could it be?
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm a delivery man and I have some cream for you.
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.
I work out.
So do you want me to give you your cream now?
I've been waiting for it all day.
- Fuck.
Come on.
- Oops.
Keep going.
I spilled my cream.
Do you mind?
I don't mind.
Especially if you spill it on my face.
Let us fuck.
- Fix my shirt.
Think I should?
- Okay.
Let me see them titties.
Actually, you know what?
Sorry, I don't think we should show them.
- What?
- We shouldn't show your breasts.
- Aren't you gonna take your shirt off?
- I'm just gonna open it.
You're not gonna take it off?
Why not?
My tits are bigger than yours.
I don't wanna show that.
She's not gonna show her tits?
I showed my cock and my asshole.
- Okay, I'll do your pants.
- Back and forth. okay.
- Holy shit.
- Where's that delivery?
I can't believe this.
I was delivering cream, and look what's happening.
- Jesus, what is that, a rumba?
- What's a rumba?
That awkward movement.
- Should I take your underpants off?
- Yeah, take them off.
What the fuck?
How does this work?
They're just like...
I'll do it.
- I'll do mine, you just...
You do yours.
- I'll do my pants.
Granny panties.
Just get on with it already.
I'm gonna fuck you with my pecker.
Dude, that's really dirty.
- That's too dirty?
- That offends me.
- Penis?
- Fine.
- I'm gonna fuck you with my penis.
- I can't wait.
For my penis.
Be careful, Miri.
Okay, there we go.
Just keep rolling, keep rolling.
- I'll walk forward.
- Fucking cream is coming.
This is the worst porno I've ever seen.
Get over here, delivery man.
- Let's fuck on these beans.
- You okay?
- Yup.
Okay' all right.
- Just leave them.
Just leave them.
- They're really distracting.
- You should leave them.
- You gotta get your...
There you go.
- Okay' okay.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.
This okay?
Okay.
Okay, uh.
- We'll start kissing on three' okay?
- Okay.
One, two, three.
Go.
I'm ready.
- I'm ready.
- Okay.
Deacon.
- Deacon.
Deacon.
- What?
Did you see Lost this week, man?
I missed it.
What happened?
They're on the island, off the island.
Who can follow that?
I think they're in hell.
Would you all shut the motherfuck up?
I want you to come.
- I want you to come with me.
- Okay.
Oh' God.
Oh' God.
Cut.
That's it?
It's over?
Ain't he supposed to come on her titties?
Well' it wasn't what we'd shot-listed' but that was nice.
- It was so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack.
Thanks, Lester, uh.
It wasn't just me, though, guys.
Give it up for my radiant costar here, Miri.
Nice.
- Um, show's over in here.
Let's move out' start lighting the next scene.
- All right.
- Let's do it.
You looked so beautiful.
- Thanks.
I thought they were gonna be fucking hard.
- It was pretty.
- Pretty don't sell.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
You good, Mir?
You need anything?
I'm just gonna take a minute, okay?
Okay, uh.
I'll just be out there.
Yeah.
- That was fun.
- Yeah, fun.
"Fun." You fucking douche.
Wow.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You working on a rewrite?
- Yeah, just for tonight's scene.
- I'm ready to go when you are, though.
- Okay.
You know, before we go, I...
I'm thinking that, uh, it's a good idea if we talk about what happened last night.
- Oh.
- I mean, we don't have to' but I think...
Okay, yeah, uh.
I kind of dropped the ball on that, I guess, huh?
- No, no.
It's...
- To be honest, it was...
You know, I didn't realize how weird it would be for me.
Weird?
Like...
Weird how?
Acting and directing at the same time.
It's a lot to process, you know.
For the first time' I thought my balls didn't have enough hair on them.
That's not what I meant.
I know what you meant.
How you feeling about it?
I guess, um...
I feel like...
Like we...
- Holy fuck.
- The power's on.
Did you do this?
How did this happen?
I burned the bills.
How could we have done that?
- The water.
- The water.
Come on, come on' come on.
Yeah!
- We can shower in our home again.
- We are liquid.
Greetings.
Have you heard the good news about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?
Oh' my God, did you guys do this?
We got tired of you taking showers at our places all the time.
So we took up a collection amongst ourselves.
And chipped away at your mountain of debt.
You guys paid off our massive utilities bills?
- How did you afford that?
- I stole my old lady's bingo winnings.
And Mistress Bubbles did a bachelor party tonight at which yours truly was a guest star, thank you very much.
- Oh.
- Whoa.
Don't get too excited.
We didn't pay off your whole bill.
Just a month of each.
They agreed to turn everything back on?
At 9 at night?
How does that work?
Stacey knows somebody that works at Power and Light.
- You guys...
- This is amazing.
You didn't have to do this.
You didn't have to put us in your movie.
- Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.
- Or put us in your movie either.
- We said that already.
Guys, honestly, I don't know what to say.
You can start by saying we can take tonight off so we can have our wrap party right now.
Guys, we're not wrapped.
We still have four days of shooting left.
Excuse me.
In my "producorial" capacity,
I'm shutting the movie down for a night so we can get a little silly.
Go' go' go.
- Yes.
- Yes.
You all drink.
Was it just amazing with him, after all those years of not knowing?
It was, um, weird.
- But good.
- My scene with Zack's tomorrow.
You don't say.
But I'm a little nervous.
I was thinking about trying to get with him tonight.
- Really?
- I mean, if you don't mind.
You are just friends and all' so I didn't think it would be a biggie.
- It wouldn't be a biggie, would it?
- No.
No, no.
It's not a biggie.
What?
No.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Stacey' I'm not married to the guy, so...
I don't know.
You guys just looked kind of intimate last night.
- We did?
- Yeah.
Well' we're just better actors than I thought, I think, so you know what?
If you wanna get with him' you should just go ask him.
- He'd be really excited to hear that.
- Yeah?
For real, you don't mind?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
All the quarters are on the ground.
Hey, Stace.
- Hey' Zack.
Come on, are you guys playing or what?
Well' I'm bummed, but I totally get it.
It's no problem to work with Lester again.
He has a nice cock.
Well' you're a trouper, Stace.
Oh' but if I start making weird faces or anything during the scene' it's just because I've been constipated all day.
Oh' shit' uh.
We don't have to shoot the scene tonight.
No, I want to.
Anal's great for when you're constipated.
It totally loosens you up.
I use ex-lax' but good to know.
Okay, I never thought I would have that conversation.
So are we starting with Lester and Stacey tonight?
We were supposed to start with Lester and Miri.
I know.
She...
We're not gonna do that.
I don't think Miri's gonna do that.
Hey.
So where are we shooting this?
Over here?
- What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.
Our scene's tonight, right?
Can I talk to you for a minute in the back?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
What do you want me to shoot here?
Start with the close-ups of Lester and Stacey.
Give me a second, man.
What an artist.
Okay, uh.
Did I do something wrong to you?
No.
Then why are you here?
I'm here for the same reason you're here.
To make the movie.
Okay, just, like' for your own personal information, you're acting really weird right now.
I'm acting weird?
I think you're acting weird right now.
Oh' I'm acting...
How exactly am I acting weird?
You've been trying to keep me from fucking anybody but you since we started this thing.
Maybe I was thinking about your feelings.
Were you thinking of my feelings when you were banging Stacey?
Because that'd be really sad for Stacey.
She told me that you told her that that was okay.
I told her that it was okay to ask you.
Holy shit.
I get it.
I fucking get it.
It was a test.
That whole thing was a fucking test, is that it?
If it was, how do you think you did?
We had a discussion, Miri.
We had...
Actually, we had many discussions about how it was just sex
- and how we wouldn't let it get weird.
- I'm not acting weird.
You're acting like a jealous girlfriend is what the fuck you're acting like.
- I am not your girlfriend.
- I know that.
You're not my boyfriend, so why are we having this conversation right now?
Because you're about to fuck Lester to spite me, it seems like.
Did you fuck Stacey to spite me?
No.
You fucked her like you fucked every other bitch and never gave a shit how I felt about it.
- Well' that was before.
- Before what?
Look, don't fucking pretend that the other night, you and me, right there, that that didn't mean anything to you, that you didn't feel it too.
Oh.
You're not getting all gooey on me here, are you, Zack?
You know what?
If you were any other bitch I didn't give a rat's ass about,
I would tell you to go fuck yourself right now because I fucking hate this game-playing shit.
But you, you mean more to me than that' so I'm just gonna lay this out on front street.
I know you felt something big, something real the other night when we were together because I felt it too.
We tried to fuck and instead, we wound up making love.
So if this is what you need to hear in order to keep you from fucking Lester, if this is what you need, then fine.
Here it is, I'm gonna say it.
I love you, Miri.
Happy?
Oh' Jesus.
You better get ahold of yourself, Zack, because we just fucked.
Okay.
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?
But you did.
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.
Wait...
All right, don't forget I'm down here.
Watch that pullout, huh?
Yeah.
Mmm.
This is some damn good coffee.
- Where you going?
- Getting the fuck out of here.
We gotta finish this movie.
Yo!
You believe this shit?
Do you believe this shit?
What the fuck just happened in there?
I'll tell you what just happened in there.
That chick frosted me like I was a fucking cake.
Zack.
Okay, seriously' get a picture of me right now.
I'm hunting humans.
- Dude' check it out.
Ooh.
- Oh, shit.
Seriously, let's shoot the shit out of this bitch.
- Where you aiming at?
- Cock shots?
Cock shots.
We shot you in the balls, cunt nugget.
Well' it's my job to get shot in the balls, so... oh, they're gone.
Excuse me.
Didn't you used to work at the Bean-N-Gone in Monroeville?
I sure as shit hope this pays better, I tell you.
So why don't they just shoot you with a puck?
What do you mean?
I mean, what does paintball got to do with hockey?
Nothing, I guess.
- So ain't no prizes or...?
- No, no.
So, what are they paying $5 for?
To shoot a Broad Street Bully in the balls.
White people are fucked up.
Yup' they sure are.
It's a living.
You've been getting the checks I've been sending?
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Probably didn't save you from a brutal tongue-lashing, though, huh?
You know, the wife never found out about the camera, because I paid off the bills.
How did you manage that?
- Because now I'm Oprah rich.
- No way.
- The post office fucking settled?
- Hundred-sixty large' son.
- Nice, man.
Congratulations.
- A beautiful day, thank you very much.
I thought you made that whole thing up.
No, no.
It was very real.
You can believe it.
Even though she's spending all of it.
Well' since you ain't gonna ask me, I'll just go ahead and tell you.
- No, I have not seen Miri.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.
Oh' I suppose you weren't gonna ask about your movie, neither?
Look, that's why I came down here.
I need you to come take a look at it.
- I'm not interested.
Sorry.
- You'd better get interested
- because you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?
The story doesn't make sense.
- The story?
- The story doesn't make sense.
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?
It's a movie, dog, and a movie's gotta have an ending, which we don't have at the moment.
Come shot, credits.
There's your fucking ending.
Do me this favor, okay?
When you're done getting your nuts blown off' come back to humble Monroeville to my crib for a couple hours' check out the flick, you tell me what's missing.
No.
I'll tell you what, you do that, you don't owe me shit no more.
- Really?
- Really.
- Is your wife home?
- Yes.
- Maybe I should leave the pads on.
- You got some extra ones?
Hey, honey.
Where the fuck you been?
And who in the fuck is this now?
Would you calm down, woman?
Goddamn.
You already left one white boy down in my basement while you off gallivanting and shit.
What if this motherfucker
- was all grabby on me?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
Oh' what in the fuck is that supposed to mean?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
- White boys love me.
White boy.
- I said, white boy.
- Yeah?
You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?
- Should I say yes?
- Just say yes.
Yeah.
- Why don't you, uh, head downstairs?
- Oh, okay.
It's just through this hallway.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
What the fuck you looking at?
Why you gotta be yelling at me in front of my director?
- Oh, he's a director?
- Yeah.
I didn't know that.
Shit, he's a director.
Well' why don't he direct my ass to a new husband?
How about that shit?
- That's the bedroom.
- Keep talking, maybe he will.
Oh' don't nobody want them saggy-ass balls!
Saggy balls?
Look at these sagging-ass titties you got around here.
- You could tie these together.
- Motherfucker, we match.
Oh' shit.
Where's my paintball gun at?
Look at you, editor and DP.
You got your shit covered, man.
Please, don't ever say "shit-covered" to me again.
Roll the film for the man, please, so we can see what he thinks.
Just jump through it.
I ain't got all night.
The bitch is on me.
"Nigga Rich Productions." Classy.
- Yeah, DreamWorks was taken.
- Was it?
Plus' it sounds like an underground gay fuck club.
"I met a guy at DreamWorks." Yeah.
All right, so we got Lester and Stacey fucking.
Then we got Barry and Bubbles fucking.
And then this boring bullshit.
Okay, just, uh, go to the next scene, would you?
Uh...
- What next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?
We never shot it.
- Why not?
- Because after you left that night,
Miri came out of the backroom and said she couldn't do it.
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped?
So...
- Wait, so Miri...
- Never fucked nobody.
Just you.
Now, I wonder why she did that.
- Hm.
- Hm.
You see, there was a time when I was just a bitter old fuck making coffees, and Stacey was just a lap dancer and Barry and Bubbles didn't know each other and this fool here, hell, I don't even know what he was.
- A white supremacist.
- Man' fuck you.
Then two people come along and showed us something we didn't know existed.
A world of possibilities where plain old people just like us could do something special.
Even if it's something as simple as filming people fucking.
Sometimes we just need someone to show us something we can't see for ourselves and then we're changed forever.
So as you can see' our movie ain't got no ending.
Every movie needs an ending' don't it?
Peace.
Delaney, you're a slick cupid motherfucker.
Ain't love grand?
Why the fuck is this white boy running through my goddamn house?
Sometimes.
Miri.
- Miri.
- Zack?
Miri.
I'm sorry.
- Get out.
- Close the door.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over...
- Just close the fucking door' Zack.
I never slept with Stacey that night, okay?
I swear to God.
When we got into my room, you know what we did?
We talked about you, and us and how things were different and how I was too much of a fucking pussy to just tell you how I felt about you.
And I know...
I know that that's only because of all the stupid shit we said about how we wouldn't let sex change us, but it did.
It changed me.
That has to be love, right?
It has to be love and just so you know, I can't go back to being just friends anymore,
- because I just can't.
- Good.
And I think...
I think that you feel the same way.
Because that night after I left, you didn't fuck Lester.
What's up, Zack?
You know what?
I don't care that you're fucking Lester, okay?
How's that?
- Oh, shit.
- I don't wanna be with anyone but you.
So I will wait forever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life because I love you, and I have for as long as I can remember.
And I would rather die than be without you, Miriam Linky.
Miri's last name is Linky?
You're gonna fuck a guy who doesn't know your last name?
Or that you beat up Carl Roth in the sixth grade?
I know that.
Or what your senior prom dress would've looked like had we gone but we decided not to, and we got drunk alone instead.
Or that you washed your hair in the toilet.
We're not fucking' Zack.
Or that you're not fucking Zack...
What?
I asked her to fuck me.
She wouldn't do it.
I even tried to talk her into giving me the fucking Dutch rudder.
Shot me down on that too.
- And a Dutch rudder is?
- Don't know what a Dutch rudder...?
All right, you grab your dick, then you have someone else work your arm.
Here, let me show you.
All right, grab my arm.
I'm grabbing my dick, you're grabbing my arm.
Now work it.
Work my arm.
See that shit?
Work it up and down.
It's like someone else is jerking you off.
Okay.
There's the double Dutch rudder, which' I grab my dick, you grab your dick, you work my arm, I work your arm' same time.
It's like jerking off together but not gay.
We're not touching dicks, each other's dicks anyway.
I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.
It feels good, sir.
Try me, come on.
Sorry to change the subject on you, Lester, but if you're not fucking Miri, why is your dick out right now?
Because I live here now, and I like to be naked.
- What?
- When you moved out, she couldn't afford to pay her rent by herself, so I moved in to help.
But you just came out of her room.
That's my room now.
She moved in your old room.
Wait, wait, wait.
She changed rooms?
Yeah, she said she did it because she missed the smell of you or some shit.
I don't smell anything.
But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.
- Night, Zack.
- Night.
Do you?
Then why are you crying?
Because I missed you so much.
Me too.
I love you.
- I love you, I love you.
- I love you.
I don't mean to alarm you but I think I just jerked off Lester a little bit.
- The Dutch rudder?
- Yeah, it's ingenious, right?
If you ask me nicely, I will Dutch-rudder you the rest of our lives.
Good.
I'm getting tired of fucking the Fleshlight.
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.
- What'd it feel like?
- Like fucking a flashlight.
Wrong room.
- Oh, God.
That's gross.
Let us fuck.
Hello.
Welcome to Nigga Rich Productions' home of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, the production house for the couple looking to put a little spice in their sex life.
- Shall we take a look around?
- Fuck me so hard.
Oh, God.
First, you'll meet for a consultation with one of our romance-ologists, who'll coach you through that initial awkward stage before you're camera-ready.
So we will start off with some erotic massage and some...
Dude.
Some light petting.
That sounds good.
Are you guys sure you don't wanna do some, uh, butt-sack work too?
- Uh, let's move on' shall we?
- Why?
From their break-out hit, Swallow My Cockuccino, to the multi-million selling Swallow My Cockuccino II and the award-winning Star Whores saga, including Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter,
Zack and Miri have proven time and again that they know how to shoot hot sex.
As an actor, I've sometimes brought my work home with me inappropriately.
When you're telling your real-life lover in the bedroom' to' you know' bend over while you cake your hand in K-Y, it is a sign that the romance is dead, I think.
Then we turned to the professionals at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
Oh' my God, they totally saved our civil union.
They filmed what was inside of us and not what was coming out of us necessarily.
It helped me see his asshole as not just a come dumpster, but a sign of his beauty' his flower.
It became a, uh, gorgeous orchid.
Orchids grow in sort of the filthiest conditions.
That's what his asshole became to me.
This beautiful flower amidst shit.
- Honey, they get the metaphor.
- I don't think they do.
Let's just say, thank you to Zack and Miri.
It's helped us out, it's helped our friends.
Enrique?
Park?
Park?
Enrique?
Can we get a little love for Zack and Miri?
They don't even know what's going on, they're so pilled up.
But don't take his word for it.
Just ask our co-founders.
- Hi.
I'm Miri Linky Brown.
- I'm Zack Linky Brown.
Here at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, we're dedicated
- to committing your love...
- Or lust.
- to high-end, quality production digital video.
A forever keepsake of your passion.
That's right, Miri.
Why set up a camera at the end of your bed and settle for one unflattering angle, when you could let the professionals dazzle and delight your senses with an array of shots so masterfully rendered you'll swear Martin Scorsese snuck into your room
and caught you fucking?
And remember' we're not just the presidents of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
We're also clients.
Call now to set up your appointment
Way to fuck, Zack.
You little motherfucker!
Get up' Zack.
Come on, I don't wanna be late for work.
Ahh!
Get out!
- Jesus, fuck!
Close the door if you're gonna take a shit.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over, it was not closed.
- Close the door' Zack!
- Okay, okay.
God.
- Fine.
- What's that thing?
- It's a hand warmer.
We're going now.
- You smell that?
Is that the car?
Fuck.
- Oh, goddamn it.
- What?
What?
- Oh, it's wedged in my taint.
- What is?
- It got wedged in my taint.
- What?
- It's stuck under my balls.
- It's between my balls and my leg.
- What's happening?
- Please, pull over.
Pull the fuck over!
- All right, all right!
Jesus, all right!
It's about to move up to my ass.
What?
The movement makes it hotter.
It's tucked under them.
It's stuck under them.
Oh' fuck.
I think I burned my ball hair off.
It's not funny.
Can you help me pick out an outfit for tonight?
I'm working till 6.
- Well' I can try stuff on at the store.
- The store?
No, how about instead, you get a friend?
But you are my friend.
I mean a girl friend, jeez.
Mr. Delaney, can you work for me tomorrow?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
Then you must come in the next day, I tell you.
- It's Black Friday.
- Black Friday?
It's the biggest mall-shopping day of the year.
And since the mall is just up the street, I would like you to come out and work.
- On Black Friday.
- Oh, yeah.
All right, you want me to work on Moolie Monday too?
- I'm sorry?
- How about Nigga Tuesday?
- Nigga Tuesday?
Is this a new holiday?
- You come to a brother and tell him he gotta work on Black Friday.
You got any idea how racist that sounds?
Telling me to work.
What, you think you own me?
- I never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?
You thought,
"I'm gonna lay down the law for this nigga, I put food on his table, clothes on his nigga baby backs, and he ain't gonna say shit. "
- This ain't Amistad.
- You shut up.
You goddamn right this ain't Amistad.
I can't wait till the post office settles my disability suit because then I'm gonna be out this motherfucker.
I'm gonna be Oprah rich.
Y'all can kiss my ass.
You know what?
Fuck you.
Fuck you, and suck cock.
- To hell with you.
To hell with you.
- Zachary will work.
Zack' my boy.
- Yeah.
- The customer with the harelip-
- Oh, yeah.
- speak me, say you were playing baseball here the other night.
Wiffle ball.
And' uh' no' that wasn't me.
Maybe the harelip makes it sound like "baseball. "
Yeah, maybe you hear with an accent.
- Fuck you, okay?
- Okay.
One day' I'm gonna put a camera over there' and then I can tell-
I'll know everything you do when I'm gone.
Everything.
Scratch your balls, take a shit, everything, I tell you, okay?
Okay.
Fucker.
I hate both of you ebony and ivory motherfuckers, I tell you.
- Why is he so fucking high-strung?
- "Fuck off, I tell you.
Very good. "
Can you believe that Gandhi motherfucker, telling me I gotta work on Black Friday?
Ain't that some shit?
- Yeah.
- Like I don't wanna do shopping.
Biggest sales day of the year.
I'm getting a flat-screen TV, believe that.
That's my fault, I should tell you.
I asked for Friday morning off, I'm sorry.
- For what?
- I actually need a lot of recovery time.
Tonight is me and Miri's ten-year high school reunion.
I'm just gonna get fucking alcohol poisoning.
- Reunion?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
- Isn't that fucked up that they do that?
They say it's the best chance to get everyone together.
People come back in town for the holidays.
But they could have it in the middle of the summer at a blowjob contest that I was judging' and it would still be retarded.
- So why you going, then?
- Miri's making me go.
Why you always bending over backwards for that girI'
- knowing she ain't giving up no ass?
- We got a good thing going.
She pays half the rent, does dishes, she wakes me up in the morning.
Why complicate that with sex?
Besides, man, I've known her since the first grade.
You don't fuck someone you met in the first grade.
Excuse me, I met my wife in kindergarten.
We got married senior year, and she has been the queen of my world ever since.
- What if you could do it all over again?
- I'd jerk off and live by myself.
That woman is the bane of my existence.
- See?
- Excuse me, can I get a coffee, black?
Can't you see we talking, white?
If you're gonna continue to emasculate me with this Barbie dress-up shit'
I'm using your laptop.
Don't forget to smack it when you turn it on, otherwise the screen doesn't come on.
Why don't you spring and get a new one?
Same reason I don't spring for clothes for tonight, I'm broke.
There's a chick who works at Teen Juice at the mall, you know.
I gave her a good deal on yarn,
- so she's letting me borrow this stuff.
- Yo, bro.
What?
- You're buying a vibrator online.
- What's wrong with the one you have?
It died last week.
Look at the size of those fucking panties.
Shoot that shit.
Shoot it.
My God, who even knew Amazon sold shit like this?
This is incredible.
- Those are fucking granny panties.
Okay,
A, I don't appreciate you violating the sanctity of my Amazon Wish List page' and B, I'm not buying that thing from Amazon, because it turns out I don't have a credit card they take.
- Oh, shit.
- I'm sorry, guys.
Am I in the way?
You're a fucking faggot, all right?
Let's go to Starbucks.
- He's a shitty barista anyways.
- Cock.
- And he throws like a bitch.
You know what else I throw?
My nut sack in your coffees, so how did that taste, fucker?
We saw your girlfriend in her underwear, cunt nugget.
well' too bad she's not my girlfriend, you little fuck
- Oh, they're gone.
MIRl:
Are you still talking to me?
Uh, just said, I'm gonna look up more fuck toys on Amazon.
Oh' holy shit.
- They sell the Fleshlight here too.
- What's that?
It's a fucking pocket pussy that is shaped like a flashlight
"for discretionary jacking off. "
That way if you get caught, no one thinks it's weird.
You're just a guy who likes to fuck his flashlight.
I am totally buying this shit.
Whoa, if you've got money to burn, how about paying the electric bill?
- That's due already?
- November's is probably due now, but I was talking about September's.
Tell me this doesn't rock.
You kind of look like Ronald McDonald.
That makes me want some McNuggets.
Why would you wanna buy a pocket pussy anyway?
That is so sad.
What?
Excuse me, I forgot about the nobility that accompanies coming with a fucking vibrator.
Think a kid in Darfur gets saved every time a vibrator makes you come?
No.
- "Real feel action"?
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
If you start fucking machines, I'm moving out.
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a machine.
How come you get to fuck something with a motor in it?
I've never met a man who can make me come like a vibrator does.
That's bullshit.
You get to be Buck Rogers having sex in the 25th century with fucking Twiki and Dr. Theopolis.
I'm stuck to a bottle of Jergens in the bathroom.
Holy bejesus.
You do not use my Jergens to jack it in our bathroom.
No, you know what I do actually, is I light a bunch of candles and I sprawl out on my sheets and I listen to Sting.
No, I'm a guy.
Give me two Popsicle sticks and a rubber band,
I'll find a way to fuck it, like a filthy MacGyver.
Oh' my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.
How about this?
I don't get why you're putting so much effert into this thing.
I thought we were just gonna go to sit around and make fun of everybody.
I can't wear anything that I already own and expect to bring home Bobby Long.
Bobby fucking Long?
No way.
Didn't that guy call you "Stinky Linky"?
Yeah, that was then, okay?
Maybe now he can save me a fortune in Amazon bills.
Maybe you can fuck our landlord so we can at least keep a roof over our heads.
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.
Hey, I bought skates with last week's paycheck
- and I need those to skate with.
- Oh.
And this week's will barely cover the past two water bills, so...
Is this sexy?
Yeah, in like a To Catch a Predator kind of way' it is pretty fucking sexy.
Then we're done.
What the fuck?
Zack.
- You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?
- They shut it off.
- Oh, shit.
Just, uh-
Help me get this shit out of my hair.
Just use the water out of the toilet.
- There's poo in there.
- Not that part.
- The back part of the toilet thing.
- Oh, that makes sense.
Take the cup there and then scoop it in, there you go.
Here, I'll lean back and you can just' you know, pour it down like
- Like that.
You're harshing my buzz' you know.
This is so lame.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Whoa!
All right, one hour tops, then we're gone.
Or I had an idea.
We could just not go at all, which would rock.
Even though we're broke and we've never amounted to anything, we're still better than these people, right?
No.
Not at all.
We're probably not even as good as most of them, unless one of them is a crackhead or something.
Just tell me I'm prettier than when we graduated.
You look about the same.
Definitely not prettier, but around the same.
I'm thinner, though' right?
A little?
Not really.
well' good pep talk.
Fuck.
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.
- You don't recognize us' do you?
- Um, no, sorry.
Zack Brown, Miri Linky.
Were you the one they called Stinky Linky?
Oh' no' no one ever called me that.
Oh.
- Great.
What does yours say?
- What the fuck?
Come on.
- I'm sure I had a nickname.
Nothing?
- All right, you have a great time' and before you go, don't forget your copy of The Roving Roe-Ver.
What the fuck's this shit?
That is not shit, that would be our bi-monthly newsletter.
- Awesome.
It updates you
- on what everyone's doing.
- Finally.
I love your enthusiasm.
Here you go.
Write your e-mail address on that and I'll be sure to add you to our 800-member-strong mailing list.
We had 800 people in our graduating class?
Yes, and only 250 R.S.V.P.'d.
Doesn't that suck, Mary?
- Miri.
- You married, Bets?
- I am.
Two kids.
- Wow, that's beautiful.
- Awesome.
- You wanna fuck me later?
- Uh, no, I'm married.
- Okay, cool.
If you change your mind,
- I'll be in there getting shitfaced.
- He will.
- Just so you know, I eat the pussy.
- He does.
Ah, tempting.
Again, no.
- Shall we?
- Sir.
Bye, Bets.
Think about it.
Enjoy.
Can I get two beers' please?
You want a beer?
- Yeah.
- Three beers.
- Thank you.
Here you go.
Is that Zack?
Or am I Zack?
Whoa, ho, ho.
MIRl:
Oh' wow.
- Never gets old, huh?
- The other Zack.
Oh' in my world, nobody calls me "the other Zack,"
now that this guy's not around anymore, huh?
- Get the fuck off of me.
- There can be only one.
- What?
- Highlander, man?
The Kurgan.
Remember?
I'd yell it at you whenever we passed each other in the hallway?
Like it was yesterday' man.
Awesome.
Awesome.
Awesome.
God, you guys have so much to catch up on.
Whoo.
- No.
- I'm gonna let you get to it.
Bitch.
Have you seen that big blowup picture they have of me?
Yeah, it's-
My hair is terrible.
I can't believe I even wore my hair like that.
That's before I knew about styling products' you know.
It makes a big difference in life.
But you live and learn, though' right?
I mean, ten years ago, Pittsburgh, who knew anything about fashion?
Back in the day' our hairstyle, oh...
Hey, stranger.
- Whoa.
Stinky Linky.
- Yeah.
Although it's just Miri now.
- Give me a hug.
- Oh, okay.
- Hi, heh, heh, heh.
- Hi.
Wow.
- How have you been?
- Great, great.
- Yeah?
- You look fantastic.
Wow, that is not something that you would have said to me ten years ago.
- Well' I've grown up.
- Yes.
Yes, you have.
You just look...
Ooh, heh, heh.
- Well' listen to you.
Thank you.
- No, don't thank me, just fuck me.
Roxanne.
Hey.
Someone I like, what are the odds' huh?
Zack Brown, we had four years of Spanish together.
Why does no one recognize me?
- Am I thinner?
Is that it?
- Look at him.
- Who?
- My stupid husband.
No fucking shit.
John Butterfield?
You actually married John Butterfield?
- That's amazing.
- Don't ever get married.
It sucks.
You stop appreciating each other and run out of shit to talk about after the first year.
But look at him now, chatty as fuck.
Flirting up a storm with that cheerleader nimrod Monica Von.
You want me to maybe flirt with you so he can see it, even it up a bit?
I don't wanna get even.
If I was gonna do anything, I'd wanna one-up the asshole.
You can give me a handjob in the girls' locker room.
- Fine, but make it fast.
- Fuck, yeah.
Are you staying in town for a while or-?
Just tonight.
I fly back to L.A. tomorrow.
L.A., wow, Los Angeles.
Gosh' Bobby Long' coming up in the world.
- With Mrs. Long, I bet, huh?
- No, no, no.
No Mrs. Long for me.
- Then can I be honest with you?
- Sure.
Um...
Whew.
I think I need a drink.
Do you need a drink?
Because I need a drink to say this.
- I've got a beer already, so-
- Oh, great, thank you.
I think there's a cigarette butt in there.
Yup.
Sorry about the elbow.
There can be only one.
Can I get a beer, please?
Thank you very much.
Oh' Jesus Christ.
My friend's making an ass of herself hitting on her high school crush.
Oh' God' that's so sad.
It's so Miri, is what it is.
I'm Zack, by the way.
Brandon.
Don't worry, we weren't in the same class or anything.
- Okay.
Lucky you.
- Are you a Monroe-ver?
well' I went here' let's just leave it at that, I guess.
Do you have one of the large blown-up pictures of your younger self
- hanging around here?
- I do, kind of.
Right there.
Gorgeous.
- Good times.
What do you do?
What brings you here?
I came with somebody who went to school here.
- Really?
- Bobby Long.
No shit.
That's who my friend's hitting on right now.
See right there?
- Really.
- One dressed like Hannah Montana?
In L.A., we call that look "Nickelodeon chic. "
- Wait, L.A.?
Los Angeles?
- California.
That's awesome, man.
What do you do out there?
- I'm an actor.
- Wow, that's really impressive.
- Thank you, thank you.
- In fucking movies?
"Fucking movies. " Pretty much.
Look at you.
What-?
Anything I've seen?
What movies?
Oh' all sorts of movies with all-male casts.
All-male casts.
Like Glengarry Glen Ross?
Like that?
Like Glen and Gary Suck Ross' Meaty Cock and Drop Their Hairy Nuts in His Eager Mouth.
- Is that like a sequel?
- Sort of.
- It's a re-imagining.
- Oh, like The Wiz.
More erotic and with less women.
No women' to be exact.
I apologize in advance if I am out of line here, but are you in gay porn?
- Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?
- I thought you recognized me, that's-
- Oh, okay, I get it.
You're not in my demographic' so I'm not insulted.
- Not really.
Who's your demographic?
- Do you love pussy?
- I do.
- Then not you.
Oh' okay.
I came here tonight hoping to seduce you and bring you back to my apartment and sleep with you to, uh, get back at you, you know, for calling me Stinky Linky all those years ago.
Wow.
That is a weird revenge plot.
- You must be a terrible lay for that.
- What?
No, I'm great.
I mean, I've had enough practice and everything.
That-
Wow, that sounded not good.
I fuck a lot.
That's what I meant to say.
That doesn't sound good either.
Wow.
You're a lot funnier than I remember.
Thank you.
Gosh, you turned out to be such a nice guy.
It just
- You know' it makes it even easier to just
- To just say this.
Would you like to come back to my place and maybe open a bottle of wine and have ourselves a real high school reunion?
- I-
- Hello, Miriam.
Beat it, we're talking.
- I wanted to introduce you to Brandon.
- Salutations.
- Bobby's boyfriend.
- Bobby who?
- Bobby me.
- Bobby Long.
Brandon is the star of such adult fare as
- What was that one called again?
You Better Shut Your Mouth or I'm Gonna Fuck It.
That's right.
I'm surprised I forgot that.
Are you fucking with me?
No, they're fucking with each other.
Oh' my God.
- No.
- What?
Granny Panties?
- Excuse me?
- How can you tell?
This is so crazy.
I was literally just watching you, like, right before we got here.
This is so crazy.
This is you, right?
TEEN 1 My name's Granny Panties, and nobody wants to fuck me.
Nothing's whiter than my big gay ass-
Where'd you get that?
Oh' I entered "gay" and "ass," and it was the top hit.
It's had 200,000 views in three hours.
Honey' you are, like-
I'm jealous right now because you're, like, super famous.
Baby, please take our picture.
I get a picture with Granny Panties.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is awesome.
- All right, smile.
Okay' got it.
- Did you get it?
- Oh, thank you very much.
- E-mail me that.
Oh' because he's the worst photographer.
Okay' good.
- You're gay?
- Yeah.
And I'm on the Internet wearing a diaper?
Who knew you'd come to Pittsburgh and meet a celebrity?
I'm gonna binge-drink now until I pass out.
Okay.
She'll be fine.
So you guys suck each other's cocks, huh?
Oh' like crazy.
Okay, that's enough, I think.
I'm embarrassing him.
I love when he's embarrassed.
He's not living out loud, so he gets all like, ooh.
- You are totally in love, aren't you?
- Zachary' we are.
Wow, I-
Oh' God' I just wanna eat him up, yum, yum.
Save some for me' yum, yum, yum.
- I can't keep my hands off him.
- You've had one too many.
Although he does most of the eating in the sack.
In the sack and of the sack.
All right, that's enough.
Look, you've drunk too much.
You do this every time.
You get too Mary for everybody in the room
- and you can't contain yourself.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
And by containing myself, do you mean containing myself in a closet?
In a closet of denial?
Is that-?
No, no, no.
Holy shit, this just got real.
This is exactly why you haven't met my mother.
You don't know how to ease people into this situation.
- You just force your way in every time.
- I thought, maybe for one second in this godforsaken town, I could be myself.
I'm so sorry.
No, you're right' I should just butch up and pretend that I don't love it when you shove your dick in my mouth.
- This is the best night of my life.
Am I making a spectacle?
- I could make a much bigger scene.
- You really are.
I'm sorry.
Pittsburgh.
Listen up' Monroe-vers.
My name is Brandon St. Randy' and I love Bobby Long.
- Fucking A. Is that enough?
Is that enough of a scene?
I could start doing worse than that.
The reason you haven't taken me to your mother's-
Your mother with her makeup and all her drinking, she's in the closet too.
- They fight just like real people.
- I thought I'd be a conduit for you-
Thank you.
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm not.
- Thank you.
- I love you.
- I'll e-mail you.
- Zack, it was so nice to meet you.
And I will be patient with you.
I will be there on your journey.
I will be your Sherpa up the mountain of gayness.
well' might as well see how many hits Granny Panties is up to, huh?
Did I do that?
Thanks, George.
What kind of evil fucks turn off your power the day-?
No, the night before Thanksgiving?
Who does that?
Can you get an advance on your card?
Fleshlight maxed-out my $200 limit.
Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.
This is bad.
If we don't come up with rent, we're gonna get locked out.
Who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.
Which means by the time we get home, there's no heat either.
well' I think it's time we put what we always talked about into effect.
- You're gonna have to start hooking.
- You know, you jest, but these are the exact circumstances people find themselves in right before they start having sex for money.
- Yeah.
- Or making porn.
Oh, my God, yeah.
- What?
You got an idea?
We could make a porno.
- Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?
No, that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me?
That's a rad idea.
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend, he said he makes a hundred grand a year because he shoots and distributes his own porno flicks.
If it's so easy, how come everybody doesn't do it?
Because other people have options and dignity, which we do not have, which puts us in an amazingly advantageous position.
Fuck you, I have dignity.
Where?
Is it hidden in your gigantic underpants that are plastered all over the Internet?
Is that where you hide your dignity?
Every woman has a pair of those period panties.
That's, like, a fact.
Okay.
Families.
I bet people don't make porno, because they have families.
But luckily, your parents are dead.
Sorry.
My grandparents are dead.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
So who are we gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone mainstream now.
It's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks in it.
Look at Paris Hilton.
She throat-fucks a guy in night vision, now she's selling fragrances to tweens.
And I'm pretty sure she's legally retarded.
That's for tweens?
Have you seen that Joe Francis guy who made Girls Gone Wild?
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot piece of shit in the world and he has a jet and a fucking island.
Look, there's got to be a less extreme solution to our financial woes here.
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper route.
- I don't have a bike.
- Be a waiter.
No one wants me around their food.
Would you eat food that I gave you?
I would not eat food that you gave me, that's true.
I mean, nobody wants to see us fuck, Zack.
Everybody wants to see anybody fuck.
I hate Rosie O'Donnell, but if someone said' "I got a tape of Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid,"
I'd be like, "Why aren't we watching that right now?"
Because she's famous.
Hello.
So are you.
You're fucking Granny Panties.
My underwear and your ass are famous' we're not.
So who the F would wanna watch us fuck?
- At least 800 people.
- The jerks we went to school with?
- Are you serious?
- Of course.
If you heard that someone we graduated with was in a fucking porno movie, you'd watch it, right?
I'd watch that guy Brandon suck a cock, I just met him.
With this mailing list, we have almost a thousand people that would definitely buy a porno we were in just to be like,
"Hey, I sat next to that guy in Civics.
Look at his fucking dick. "
We sell a thousand copies at 20 bucks a pop, bam' we have paid off our bills.
So' what do you think?
- I don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.
Oh' wow, like you've never done that before.
How many guys have you met in a bar, taken home, banged with your mouth and then never talked to again?
That's what we call a stranger.
Dude, I don't one-night mouth-fuck anybody that I pick up in bars.
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in the porno movie for some weird reason.
I guess...
We could fuck.
- Ew.
- Fuck you.
I mean, you're a nice-enough-looking guy and everything-
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're an all-right-enough-looking girl.
- How does that feel?
- Dude' I'm just saying it'd be weird and wrong, you know, like fucking my brother.
Okay, seriously, we're just talking about sex, okay?
It's for a purpose.
It's for getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.
- Wow.
- Just explain to your private beforehand,
"Look' this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash. "
- Oh, my God.
- What?
You're just doing this because you've always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?
Yes.
I've gone my whole life pretending that I want nothing to do with you, just hoping one day we'd be in such dire financial straits that I could use it to finally make my move on you.
You're just being sarcastic.
- I am.
See' I was pretending to cry right there.
MIRl:
I guess it's not like it'd be creepy, like if we got way too drunk one night and accidentally fucked, you know?
No.
We'd be going in with the understanding that it's-
A business decision.
Strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.
- Right.
- And by end,
I mean, I'll be waxing your ass.
Fuck you.
I'm not even letting you see my ass.
I've seen your ass and the rest of you naked around a billion times already.
- That goes both ways, buddy.
- You've never seen my dick.
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.
Are you kidding?
That party we went to where you got blasted, and Houls dared you to give yourself head, and we all watched you try for, like, an hour.
Oh' yeah.
Thanks by the way, for fucking letting me do that.
Thank you.
Oh' God.
We really do know too much about each other.
See' and this would really just be one more thing.
I mean, look at us.
It's Thanksgiving and we're huddled around a flaming fucking garbage can like a couple of steno bums.
I mean, this could give us a chance to pay off our debt, pay our bills, get a fucking nicer apartment with heat in it maybe.
What are you doing?
Miriam Linky, will you have sex with me on camera for money?
I will.
A producer?
Yeah.
- Guy who gets to finance the movie.
- You think I got that kind of money?
We just need that.
What you're about to spend on the flat screen.
Now I can't get my flat screen?
Fuck that.
No, no, no.
With your cut of the profits, you're gonna get two flat screens.
One in your living room, one in your bathroom.
One in the bathroom?
You know, it's always been my dream to watch shit while I shit.
Everyone with an ass loves to watch shit while they shit.
- I'm gonna make that happen for you.
- I don't know, man.
What else the producer do?
- Um, they help with the casting.
- What's casting?
Finding the people to be in the movie.
- I get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.
Like, I can look at a titty, make sure there ain't no moles on there?
- You can look at both titties, man.
- Man.
I've been looking at the same busted titties for the past almost 20 years.
- I'm due for another new titty.
- Please help us.
Please.
Please.
Yes.
Yes.
I love you.
well' don't mind that smell.
We had some homeless people squatting in here.
You know, they'd void their bowels everywhere but the bathroom.
Anyway, you pick up the poop and you've got yourself a movie studio.
Why don't we shoot in your apartment?
No power.
You wanna pay our electric bill?
- You motherfuckers...
- We'll take it.
Bring it back.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Oh' Jesus.
Oh' Jesus.
Oh' God.
Come on.
Why the fuck do I have to do everything?
Fuckers.
Hey, what is that?
Fucking guys.
This fucking team, man.
They fucking suck.
I'm gonna hatefuck the shit out of you, ref.
- Dude.
- It's cool.
- He's my cousin.
- Hey.
Didn't you used to videotape the varsity basketball games in high school?
Just the away games.
I did it because I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.
Which one?
Whichever one wanted to fuck the guy who taped the varsity games.
- Aw.
- Still know how to work a camera?
- Who cares what the title is?
- The porn I liked when I was a kid, it was always, like, a spoof of a popular movie, you know?
Like, um, Edward Penishands.
Okay, so we need a mildly clever, vaguely dirty title, that sounds like a real movie
- and sums up what you're gonna see.
- Correct.
An American Werewolf in Brenda?
Fuckback Mountain?
- Too soon?
A Cock-in-Lips Now?
Next.
Cradle the balls.
Work the shaft.
Jerk my come-crayon and let me color you white.
I need cock and I need it now.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
It's "puss" as in pussy.
Oh' because I was like' who would wanna fuck puss?
I want to slam my ham in your can, woman.
Scene.
- This guy is amazing.
- This guy's great-looking too.
I wanna fuck him.
Hi, my name's Delaney and I'm a producer.
I really don't know what it means.
I'm gonna be honest' this is my first time.
You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna touch you or nothing like that.
- All right.
- I have a wife, you know.
We're happy.
I mean, not happy' but it's cool, you know.
Just so you know, there will be some fucking.
- We'll talk about that if you get the part.
- Okay.
I mean, not
- We won't be fucking, there'll be fucking in the movie.
Like I said' I got a wife.
She don't play that shit.
- She is a crazy bitch.
- Yep.
It's my job as the producer to see what you got.
So if that makes you uncomfortable in any way, you don't have to show me anything you don't wanna show me, because-
I love the movies.
- Lawrence of a Labia.
- No.
- Oh, come on.
- Dawn of the Dick.
Yeah, but how are zombies doing it at all sexy?
I want to eat your brain and your ass.
- Dude.
- Sci-fi.
Yeah.
Close Encounters With a Turd From Behind.
- I don't know what that means.
- Just asses.
Fucking deep in asses.
What?
We're making a porno and we just need to know what you would be or would not be interested in doing.
If anything.
- No anal.
- Oh, definitely no anal.
Anal and hugging.
I don't do ass stuff.
- Anal.
- Ah, fuck.
- Oh, wait, oral.
I like anal.
- Yay.
Okay, well, so, uh, do you have any special skills?
Special skills?
I can get a boner really quick and it sticks straight up.
- Is that really a special skill?
- I think.
- Can you show us what you mean?
- Sure.
Oh' that is special.
Yeah, you're hired, Mr. -
- Who are you again?
- Lester.
Lester "The Molester" Cockinshtuff.
- No.
- Wow.
That is the best porn name I've ever heard' man.
I can have a porn name?
- Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.
Are you Granny Panties?
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The panties are actually in the house.
- I'll get them.
- Whoa.
- Star Sex 2:
The Wrath of Cunt.
We never made a Star Sex 1.
I guess we can lose Star Sex 3:
The Search for Cock, then.
- Cocunt.
- What's that?
It's Cocoon with a cunt.
So Delaney tells us you have a special talent of some sort.
I don't know if I'd call it a special talent, but it's a little something I picked up doing bachelor parties.
It would probably be easier if I just showed you.
- Great.
- The floor is yours.
So a movie, huh?
That could be fun.
Holy fuck.
Her name's Bubbles.
- Invasion of the Potty-Snatchers?
- That's like MAD Magazine stupid.
well' fuck you' okay?
You try to think of a good sci-fi porno title.
It's hard.
There's gotta be one we haven't thought of that would say it all' not be ridiculously filthy and off-putting, and still have instant recognition with our audience.
- I got it.
- I got it.
- Star Whores.
- Yeah.
It's funny' right?
See' we figured this opens us up to an even bigger sales market beyond the people we went to school with.
People who like comics and sci-fi.
Comics?
Like "Ziggy"?
"Ziggy"?
Is that even in fucking papers anymore?
No, man.
Fuck you. "Ziggy" is a comic' right next to "Family Circus. "
No, like Spider-Man and shit, you know?
There's always a shitload of Star Wars nerds at those comic-book shows.
So we sell them a Princess Leia they can really fucking jerk off to.
- That'd be me, Princess Lay-Her.
- Who am I playing?
You' my friend, are the lead role of Lubed Guy-Baller.
Man' he's gonna be balling dudes?
I thought you said this was boys on girls.
If I have to fuck a guy' okay, but I'd rather fuck a girl.
What's wrong with you, boy?
- We'll change the name to Sky-Baller.
- Sky-Baller.
I will be Hung So-low.
Delaney, my friend, you are On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
Man' I can't be in no porno.
My wife will kill me.
Hump me, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
You're my only hump.
On the other hand, fuck my wife.
Unfortunately, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over does not have any sex in the movie but the droids do, I
- CUP and R2-T-Bag.
I robot.
And Stacey over here is gonna play Darth Vibrator.
- I'm the bad guy?
- She's not a guy, Zack.
I know that because I'm not a fucking idiot.
In our movie, Darth Vibrator is a bad girl who wants to fuck the galaxy, literally' and it's up to Lubed and Hung to stop her with their cocks.
- You and me get to have sex, then?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- I know.
Isn't that awesome?
Hold up, hold up.
So who's all having sex with who in this movie?
As of last night, I was having sex with Zack.
What?
Han Solo ain't never had no sex with Princess Leia in the Star Wars.
Guys' this isn't a literal adaptation here.
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.
Kind of like The Wiz or like a parody.
With lots of anal.
- Cool.
- I know, isn't that awesome?
I have a question, do Princess Lay-Her and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?
Uh, no, because they're brother and sister, and according to Miri' brothers and sisters can't fuck.
But you said, that this wasn't a literal translation, so that means Lester's character could have sex with Miri's character.
Because I would love to fucking eat her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.
Dream on, pal, it's never gonna happen, okay?
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See' she's fine
- Wait, what?
Yep.
I mean, everyone else is having sex with more than one person in this movie all of a sudden, so I think it's' you know' not fair if I'm only fucking you.
Guys, read amongst yourselves, okay?
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Look, Miri, we got plenty of sex going on in this thing, you don't have to do that.
Zack, it's fine.
I mean I have slept with way worse-looking guys than Lester.
I just wanna do my part for the movie like everyone else.
You're having sex in the movie, you don't need to fuck someone else.
- You're good.
- I'm only fucking you' though.
So don't we need to vary it up to keep it fair?
Fair for-?
I don't
- What?
Fair for who?
What are these, blood diamonds we're talking about?
Fair for everyone else who is fucking more than one person, a. k.a. you' in the movie.
- I mean, fine-
- All right.
I mean, if you don't care-
I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
Fuck.
I don't give a shit.
Like you said, you know, you've fucked bigger idiots than Lester.
Holy shit.
Are we really gonna shoot this in outer space?
Maybe not bigger idiots.
Thank you.
- Cut.
All right, guys, that's it.
- Yeah.
Make sure you leave your costume so we know they're here for tomorrow.
Mostly, everybody, thank you so much for helping us get ready' you know.
Cleaning this place out, building the sets, sewing the costumes, it's just-
I mean, it's really amazing.
Thank you.
Seriously, thanks.
But this is just the beginning, guys.
If Star Whores works, and it wilI' we are set up for sequels galore.
The Empire Strikes Ass.
- Return of the Brown-Eye.
- The Phantom Man-Ass.
And Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter.
- Okay.
- Revenge of the Shit.
- You got it?
- Yeah, no, we got it.
Ew.
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.
- We'll talk about that one.
We're gonna have a lot of fun' but more importantly, we're gonna make a lot of fucking money' okay?
- Yeah.
- So get ready for greatness, people.
Tomorrow we start principal photography.
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
- All right, good night, you guys.
- We got a movie.
- What?
- Nothing.
I think someone should acknowledge how insane and amazing this is
- and it's all because of you.
- I don't know.
It's just a porno.
You know what I mean.
You've really come into your own.
Shut the fuck up.
So speaking of coming into things' ready for tomorrow?
Twenty years' we're finally gonna know what it's like to have sex with each other.
You say that like you've been wondering what it'd be like to sleep with me for a while now.
Why the fuck do you think I started hanging out with you?
I knew it.
Here, help.
Let's just promise that it's not gonna change anything between us, okay?
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Some guys can't keep sex in perspective.
If anyone's gotta keep this in perspective, it's you, okay?
I don't want you getting all mushy and gooey on me after I give you the best orgasm you've ever had.
Oh' like you know what you're doing down there at all.
I actually don't.
Where's the clitoris?
Is it in your ass?
Just, you know, make sure you kind of whoop it up and act like I'm a stud who knows what he's doing' okay?
Just be a pal.
Oh' dude, I am gonna Meryl Streep the fuck out of this tomorrow, you watch.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
No.
Really, thank you.
For everything.
You're welcome.
Less than 12 hours and we make Monroeville history.
- I really hope nothing goes wrong.
- It's a movie.
What could go wrong?
What are you doing?
What's up?
- What the fuck?
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait.
- Wait.
- Stop.
Stop.
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck is going on?
Condos is what's going on, as soon as this shit-hole's demo'd.
No, you gotta stop it right now.
We rented this place for a month from Mr. Jenkins.
Sounds like your Mr. Jenkins was full of shit.
Luxury Homesteads bought this place a month ago.
I'm gonna kill that lying old fuck.
You're gonna have to go Florida, that's where he moved.
We've got thousands of dollars of equipment in there.
- Please.
- If you wanna sift through this rubble when we're done, be my guest.
Hey, get that fucking beam down.
MIRl:
This is the last thing you wanna hear.
If you don't get an advance,
I don't think we're gonna keep a roof over our heads.
I got an advance already.
It went into all the costumes.
- So all our money's gone?
- All your money?
Never mind what my wife's gonna do when there ain't no new snow tires, or when she sees I charged a video camera.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this' man.
I just wanted to see some free titties.
That's all.
But there's no such thing as free titties' is there, Zack?
- Is there?
- Fuck this noise.
Why don't we get another camera, and shoot something else?
Where are we gonna do that?
Got another sound stage?
Sound stage?
We had a shit-covered garage we turned into a sound stage.
We find someplace new and we do it again.
How?
Okay, I'm broke, man.
No, make that' I was broke.
Now I am really tapped out.
I have to get another job to pay Delaney back.
So please tell me, how can I afford to start over?
- What can I get you?
- Yeah, can I get a, uh-?
Too fucking late.
Cappuccino, 3.50.
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
I mean, I'm a total loser in every single other aspect of my life.
What made me think I could do something as simple as filming people fucking?
We have no money left, nowhere to shoot, no sets, we have no fucking cameras.
Here.
It's time I go back to my regular life where I am a quiet fuckup who doesn't cost anybody any money and knows his goddamn position behind this fucking counter making cappuccinos for this fucking guy.
Oh' yeah.
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
Oh' yeah.
Yeah.
Fuck, yes.
Zack.
You sneaky Indian motherfucker.
I tell you, yes.
Swallow My Cockuccino.
- What?
- That's it.
That's the movie.
Why didn't I think of it before?
We don't need sets or a stage.
Look at all this production value, waiting to have balls on it.
Hold up.
You wanna shoot a dirty movie here, where we work?
Yes.
Fuck, yes, I do.
You know how many stories I have from working here?
How many times I've been laid right there after hours?
You've never gotten laid here after hours.
I know.
Thank you for reminding me.
But I always wish I had, and that's what porno is.
It's fantasy.
It's taking the normal and making it abnormal by fucking it.
Don't do that.
The little dog don't like that.
How did you get a camera?
By being a terrible, untrustworthy employee, that's how.
Give me today, I'll bang out a script.
Meet me back here after closing.
We're gonna launch arching ropes of jism all over this motherfucker.
Peace.
I like that guy but if he tries to fuck that little dog tonight for real,
I'm calling the Humane Society.
It's called Bean-N-Gone, so get the fuck out of here.
Hey, Barry.
Stand by, Stace' picture's up.
- Okay.
Roll tape.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 12, Take 1.
And action.
I'd like a double espresso so I can stay up all night because I'm in the mood to fuck.
well' I am a whore-ista, so I love to fuck.
Would you like to fuck me?
Holy fuck.
You mean, after you're done with your shift?
I mean during my shift.
- Sorry.
- Keep going, keep going.
With your shaft.
Let us fuck.
Cue music.
Okay, open up to camera, guys.
Let us see it.
More tongue.
Little less tongue.
Oh' that was good.
Cue effects.
Oh' yeah, like that.
Oh' yeah.
See' I told you it would work.
Didn't I tell you?
It looks amazing.
It's incredible.
Oh' the beans hurt.
Easy.
- Move in for coverage.
- Nice.
That's why we got him.
- Nice.
I'm impressed.
- Get in there, Deacon.
- Come on.
- Like that?
Like that.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
- Pull out a bit, actually.
That's hot.
No, not you, Lester.
Put it back in.
Kiss the muscle.
- I kiss the muscle.
- You kiss the muscle.
- Can he slap her ass a little?
- Don't be a fucking pervert, dude.
- Stir, come on.
Stir.
- Yeah, stir it.
Stir it, baby.
Hey.
- Holy.
- Shit.
Are you guys still open?
No.
We close at 9.
I need coffee so I'm drive home.
- Okay.
Yeah.
Thank you.
That's a cute kitty.
Okay.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You guys see the game?
I was at it.
Fucking Roethlisberger, the quarterback, was all fucking'
"Hug it' chug it, football.
All night. " Heh-heh.
Okay, paI' here you go.
On the house.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Have a good one.
- Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- I said, have a good one.
Oh.
- Okay.
Keep moving.
You and your little dog.
Go Steelers.
Action.
Oh' yeah.
Yeah, yeah, like that.
Oh' fuck it' chuck it' football.
Oh' yeah.
Oh' God' this is good.
You take it.
You take it.
Take it, Barry.
Oh, take it.
Take it, Barry.
Take it.
I'm disturbed at how turned on I am by this.
- Shit, dude' it's almost 6.
- Oh, fuck.
Okay, that's a wrap, everybody, yeah.
Let's give a hand to our hotties with the bodies from last night.
Stacey, Lester, Bubbles, Barry' whoo.
Yeah.
Nice.
Okay, when we come back tonight, we finish up the venti-vulva scene' and then we get into me and Miri's stuff.
Again' amazing first night, everybody.
Thank you so much.
Let us fuck.
- Hey' how'd it look?
- How do you think it looked?
It looked like shit going into other shit, in focus.
What an artist.
That was Kurosawa's motto. "Shit going into other shit. "
Oh' man, I can't believe you gotta work now.
It's okay.
You know, honestly, I don't think I could sleep.
- I'm pretty, like, pumped up right now.
- Right?
It was amazing.
It was awesome.
I think the cast and crew had a good time.
- We were getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.
I just wanna keep shooting people boning all day.
I don't think I've ever met the ambitious Zack Brown before.
- Well' I'm trying to pay the bills, so...
- It's not a bad thing.
I think it looks good on you.
Come on, hurry.
Come on, come on' come on.
Wait a minute.
- You guys never did it before?
It's fine.
You know, we talked about it and it's just for the movie.
We're friends' you know' we're just friends.
And we will always just be just friends, so...
Listen' I have some extra lube from last night.
I understand it's kind of hard getting wet when everyone's watching.
At least it was for Barry.
- I don't know if I am gonna need it.
- Really?
Yeah, I think I'm just excited.
Uh-huh.
At the idea of people watching' not because of Zack.
Oh' God.
Zack could never have that effect on me in a million years.
- Hello, Miriam.
- Oh, hey.
Wow.
- Your face.
- Yeah.
Weird, huh?
I don't think I've seen your face since senior year.
I think I made a mistake.
I did it for you so you wouldn't get road rash during our scene, but I should have asked first' I look like a fucking beluga whale.
I think I'll be going now.
Okay.
All I keep thinking is we should've done a trial run at home last week or something.
- Oh, my God.
Right?
- I know.
- You're still cool to do it, though, right?
- Yeah, um.
Totally.
Are you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I'm, uh...
- Honestly, I'm a little nervous, I guess.
- You are?
- It's kind of a big deal.
- It is?
Yeah, you know, it's our first time together since our auspicious debut on viral video.
Oh' yeah.
That's a fuckload of pressure for a director.
As a director, please.
What about the anxiety I'm feeling as an actress?
- Did I pick the right project?
- Yeah.
What about this follow-up?
Julia Roberts followed Pretty Waman with Sleeping With the Enemy.
I'm following Granny Panties with Swallow My Cockuccino.
Only difference is this movie's about cock-sucking and her movie just sucked cock, period.
- The only difference, yeah.
- The end was pretty rad.
I liked that.
- When she kills him.
- With a gun.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- She calls the cops first.
- She calls it in first.
- It was so awesome.
- Awesome, yeah.
So I guess we should do this.
I think we should probably wait just until I lose another 20 or 30 pounds.
Stop it.
You look good.
Thanks.
So, what about me?
How do I look?
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful, so I guess it's not a big deal, but you look amazing.
- Okay.
Let's go make a porno.
- Okay.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 8, Take 1.
Come here.
- I'm over-?
All right, settle.
Action.
Who could it be?
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm a delivery man and I have some cream for you.
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.
I work out.
So do you want me to give you your cream now?
I've been waiting for it all day.
- Fuck.
Come on.
- Oops.
Keep going.
I spilled my cream.
Do you mind?
I don't mind.
Especially if you spill it on my face.
Let us fuck.
- Fix my shirt.
Think I should?
- Okay.
Let me see them titties.
Actually, you know what?
Sorry, I don't think we should show them.
- What?
- We shouldn't show your breasts.
- Aren't you gonna take your shirt off?
- I'm just gonna open it.
You're not gonna take it off?
Why not?
My tits are bigger than yours.
I don't wanna show that.
She's not gonna show her tits?
I showed my cock and my asshole.
- Okay, I'II do your pants.
- Back and forth. okay.
- Holy shit.
- Where's that delivery?
I can't believe this.
I was delivering cream, and look what's happening.
- Jesus, what is that, a rumba?
- What's a rumba?
That awkward movement.
- Should I take your underpants off?
- Yeah, take them off.
What the fuck?
How does this work?
They're just like
- I'll do it.
- I'll do mine, you just
- You do yours.
- I'll do my pants.
Granny panties.
Just get on with it already.
I'm gonna fuck you with my pecker.
Dude, that's really dirty.
- That's too dirty?
- That offends me.
- Penis?
- Fine.
- I'm gonna fuck you with my penis.
- I can't wait.
For my penis.
Be careful, Miri.
Okay, there we go.
Just keep rolling, keep rolling.
- I'll walk forward.
- Fucking cream is coming.
This is the worst porno I've ever seen.
Get over here, delivery man.
Let's fuck on these beans.
- You okay?
- Yup.
Okay' all right.
- Just leave them.
Just leave them.
- They're really distracting.
- You should leave them.
- You gotta get your
- There you go.
Okay' okay.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.
This okay?
Okay.
Okay, uh.
- We'll start kissing on three' okay?
- Okay.
One, two, three.
Go.
MIRl:
I'm ready.
- I'm ready.
- Okay.
Deacon.
- Deacon.
Deacon.
- What?
Did you see Lost this week, man?
I missed it.
What happened?
They're on the island, off the island.
Who can follow that?
I think they're in hell.
Would you all shut the motherfuck up?
I want you to come.
- I want you to come with me.
- Okay.
Oh' God.
Oh' God.
Cut.
That's it?
It's over?
Ain't he supposed to come on her titties?
well' it wasn't what we'd shot-listed' but that was nice.
- It was so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack.
Thanks, Lester, uh.
It wasn't just me, though, guys.
Give it up for my radiant costar here, Miri.
Nice.
- Um, show's over in here.
Let's move out' start lighting the next scene.
- All right.
Let's do it.
You looked so beautiful.
- Thanks.
I thought they were gonna be fucking hard.
- It was pretty.
Pretty don't sell.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
You good, Mir?
You need anything?
I'm just gonna take a minute, okay?
Okay, uh.
I'll just be out there.
Yeah.
- That was fun.
- Yeah, fun.
ZACK "Fun. " You fucking douche.
Wow.
- Hey.
Hey.
- You working on a rewrite?
- Yeah, just for tonight's scene.
- I'm ready to go when you are, though.
- Okay.
You know, before we go, I...
I'm thinking that, uh, it's a good idea if we talk about what happened last night.
- Oh.
- I mean, we don't have to' but I think-
Okay, yeah, uh.
I kind of dropped the ball on that, I guess, huh?
- No, no.
It's...
- To be honest, it was...
You know, I didn't realize how weird it would be for me.
Weird?
Like
- Weird how?
Acting and directing at the same time.
It's a lot to process, you know.
For the first time' I thought my balls didn't have enough hair on them.
That's not what I meant.
I know what you meant.
How you feeling about it?
I guess, um...
I feel like...
Like we...
- Holy fuck.
- The power's on.
Did you do this?
How did this happen?
I burned the bills.
How could we have done that?
- The water.
- The water.
MIRl:
Come on, come on' come on.
Yeah!
- We can shower in our home again.
- We are liquid.
Greetings.
Have you heard the good news about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?
Oh' my God, did you guys do this?
We got tired of you taking showers at our places all the time.
So we took up a collection amongst ourselves.
And chipped away at your mountain of debt.
You guys paid off our massive utilities bills?
- How did you afferd that?
- I stole my old lady's bingo winnings.
And Mistress Bubbles did a bachelor party tonight at which yours truly was a guest star, thank you very much.
- Oh.
- Whoa.
Don't get too excited.
We didn't pay off your whole bill.
Just a month of each.
They agreed to turn everything back on?
At 9 at night?
How does that work?
Stacey knows somebody that works at Power and Light.
- You guys...
- This is amazing.
You didn't have to do this.
You didn't have to put us in your movie.
- Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.
- Or put us in your movie either.
- We said that already.
Guys, honestly, I don't know what to say.
You can start by saying we can take tonight off so we can have our wrap party right now.
Guys, we're not wrapped.
We still have four days of shooting left.
Excuse me.
In my "producoriaI" capacity,
I'm shutting the movie down for a night so we can get a little silly.
Go' go' go.
- Yes.
- Yes.
You all drink.
Was it just amazing with him, after all those years of not knowing?
It was, um, weird.
- But good.
- My scene with Zack's tomorrow.
You don't say.
But I'm a little nervous.
I was thinking about trying to get with him tonight.
- Really?
- I mean, if you don't mind.
You are just friends and all' so I didn't think it would be a biggie.
- It wouldn't be a biggie, would it?
- No.
No, no.
It's not a biggie.
What?
No.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Stacey' I'm not married to the guy, so...
I don't know.
You guys just looked kind of intimate last night.
- We did?
- Yeah.
well' we're just better actors than I thought, I think, so you know what?
If you wanna get with him' you should just go ask him.
- He'd be really excited to hear that.
- Yeah?
For real, you don't mind?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
All the quarters are on the ground.
Hey, Stace.
- Hey' Zack.
Come on, are you guys playing or what?
well' I'm bummed, but I totally get it.
It's no problem to work with Lester again.
He has a nice cock.
well' you're a trouper, Stace.
Oh' but if I start making weird faces or anything during the scene' it's just because I've been constipated all day.
Oh' shit' uh.
We don't have to shoot the scene tonight.
No, I want to.
anal's great for when you're constipated.
It totally loosens you up.
I use ex-lax' but good to know.
Okay, I never thought I would have that conversation.
So are we starting with Lester and Stacey tonight?
We were supposed to start with Lester and Miri.
I know.
She
- We're not gonna do that.
I don't think Miri's gonna do that.
Hey.
So where are we shooting this?
Over here?
- What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.
Our scene's tonight, right?
Can I talk to you for a minute in the back?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
What do you want me to shoot here?
Start with the close-ups of Lester and Stacey.
Give me a second, man.
What an artist.
Okay, uh.
Did I do something wrong to you?
No.
Then why are you here?
I'm here for the same reason you're here.
To make the movie.
Okay, just, like' for your own personal information, you're acting really weird right now.
I'm acting weird?
I think you're acting weird right now.
Oh' I'm acting- How exactly am I acting weird?
You've been trying to keep me from fucking anybody but you since we started this thing.
Maybe I was thinking about your feelings.
Were you thinking of my feelings when you were banging Stacey?
Because that'd be really sad for Stacey.
She told me that you told her that that was okay.
I told her that it was okay to ask you.
Holy shit.
I get it.
I fucking get it.
It was a test.
That whole thing was a fucking test, is that it?
If it was, how do you think you did?
We had a discussion, Miri.
We had
- Actually, we had many discussions about how it was just sex
- and how we wouldn't let it get weird.
- I'm not acting weird.
You're acting like a jealous girlfriend is what the fuck you're acting like.
- I am not your girlfriend.
- I know that.
You're not my boyfriend, so why are we having this conversation right now?
Because you're about to fuck Lester to spite me, it seems like.
Did you fuck Stacey to spite me?
No.
You fucked her like you fucked every other bitch and never gave a shit how I felt about it.
- Well' that was before.
- Before what?
Look, don't fucking pretend that the other night, you and me, right there, that that didn't mean anything to you, that you didn't feel it too.
Oh.
You're not getting all gooey on me here, are you, Zack?
You know what?
If you were any other bitch I didn't give a rat's ass about,
I would tell you to go fuck yourself right now because I fucking hate this game-playing shit.
But you, you mean more to me than that' so I'm just gonna lay this out on front street.
I know you felt something big, something real the other night when we were together because I felt it too.
We tried to fuck and instead, we wound up making love.
So if this is what you need to hear in order to keep you from fucking Lester, if this is what you need, then fine.
Here it is, I'm gonna say it.
I love you, Miri.
Happy?
Oh' Jesus.
You better get ahold of yourself, Zack, because we just fucked.
Okay.
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?
But you did.
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.
Wait-
All right, don't forget I'm down here.
Watch that pullout, huh?
Yeah.
Mmm.
This is some damn good coffee.
- Where you going?
- Getting the fuck out of here.
We gotta finish this movie.
Yo!
You believe this shit?
Do you believe this shit?
What the fuck just happened in there?
I'll tell you what just happened in there.
That chick frosted me like I was a fucking cake.
Zack.
Okay, seriously' get a picture of me right now.
I'm hunting humans.
- Dude' check it out.
Ooh.
- Oh, shit.
Seriously, let's shoot the shit out of this bitch.
- Where you aiming at?
- Cock shots?
Cock shots.
We shot you in the balls, cunt nugget.
well' it's my job to get shot in the balls, so
- Oh, they're gone.
Excuse me.
Didn't you used to work at the Bean-N-Gone in Monroeville?
I sure as shit hope this pays better, I tell you.
So why don't they just shoot you with a puck?
What do you mean?
I mean, what does paintball got to do with hockey?
Nothing, I guess.
- So ain't no prizes or-?
- No, no.
So, what are they paying $5 for?
To shoot a Broad Street Bully in the balls.
White people are fucked up.
Yup' they sure are.
It's a living.
You've been getting the checks I've been sending?
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Probably didn't save you from a brutal tongue-lashing, though, huh?
You know, the wife never found out about the camera, because I paid off the bills.
How did you manage that?
- Because now I'm Oprah rich.
- No way.
- The post office fucking settled?
- Hundred-sixty large' son.
- Nice, man.
Congratulations.
- A beautiful day, thank you very much.
I thought you made that whole thing up.
No, no.
It was very real.
You can believe it.
Even though she's spending all of it.
well' since you ain't gonna ask me, I'll just go ahead and tell you.
- No, I have not seen Miri.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.
Oh' I suppose you weren't gonna ask about your movie, neither?
Look, that's why I came down here.
I need you to come take a look at it.
- I'm not interested.
Sorry.
- You'd better get interested
- because you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?
The story doesn't make sense.
- The story?
- The story doesn't make sense.
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?
It's a movie, dog, and a movie's gotta have an ending, which we don't have at the moment.
Come shot, credits.
There's your fucking ending.
Do me this favor, okay?
When you're done getting your nuts blown off' come back to humble Monroeville to my crib for a couple hours' check out the flick, you tell me what's missing.
No.
I'll tell you what, you do that, you don't owe me shit no more.
- Really?
- Really.
- Is your wife home?
- Yes.
- Maybe I should leave the pads on.
- You got some extra ones?
Hey, honey.
Where the fuck you been?
And who in the fuck is this now?
Would you calm down, woman?
Goddamn.
You already left one white boy down in my basement while you off gallivanting and shit.
What if this motherfucker
- was all grabby on me?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
Oh' what in the fuck is that supposed to mean?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
WIFE:
White boys love me.
White boy.
- I said, white boy.
- Yeah?
You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?
- Should I say yes?
- Just say yes.
Yeah.
- Why don't you, uh, head downstairs?
- Oh, okay.
It's just through this hallway.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
What the fuck you looking at?
Why you gotta be yelling at me in front of my director?
- Oh, he's a director?
- Yeah.
I didn't know that.
Shit, he's a director.
well' why don't he direct my ass to a new husband?
How about that shit?
- That's the bedroom.
Keep talking, maybe he will.
Oh' don't nobody want them saggy-ass balls!
Saggy balls?
Look at these sagging-ass titties you got around here.
- You could tie these together.
- Motherfucker, we match.
Oh' shit.
Where's my paintball gun at?
Look at you, editor and DP.
You got your shit covered, man.
Please, don't ever say "shit-covered" to me again.
Roll the film for the man, please, so we can see what he thinks.
Just jump through it.
I ain't got all night.
The bitch is on me.
"Nigga Rich Productions. " Classy.
- Yeah, DreamWorks was taken.
- Was it?
Plus' it sounds like an underground gay fuck club.
"I met a guy at DreamWorks. " Yeah.
All right, so we got Lester and Stacey fucking.
Then we got Barry and Bubbles fucking.
And then this boring bullshit.
Okay, just, uh, go to the next scene, would you?
Uh...
- What next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?
We never shot it.
- Why not?
- Because after you left that night,
Miri came out of the backroom and said she couldn't do it.
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped?
So...
- Wait, so Miri-
- Never fucked nobody.
Just you.
Now, I wonder why she did that.
- Hm.
- Hm.
You see, there was a time when I was just a bitter old fuck making coffees, and Stacey was just a lap dancer and Barry and Bubbles didn't know each other and this fool here, hell, I don't even know what he was.
- A white supremacist.
- Man' fuck you.
Then two people come along and showed us something we didn't know existed.
A world of possibilities where plain old people just like us could do something special.
Even if it's something as simple as filming people fucking.
Sometimes we just need someone to show us something we can't see for ourselves
and then we're changed forever.
So as you can see' our movie ain't got no ending.
Every movie needs an ending' don't it?
Peace.
Delaney, you're a slick cupid motherfucker.
Ain't love grand?
WIFE:
Why the fuck is this white boy running through my goddamn house?
Sometimes.
Miri.
- Miri.
Zack?
Miri.
I'm sorry.
Get out.
- Close the door.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over-
- Just close the fucking door' Zack.
I never slept with Stacey that night, okay?
I swear to God.
When we got into my room, you know what we did?
We talked about you, and us and how things were different and how I was too much of a fucking pussy to just tell you how I felt about you.
And I know
- I know that that's only because of all the stupid shit we said about how we wouldn't let sex change us, but it did.
It changed me.
That has to be love, right?
It has to be love and just so you know, I can't go back to being just friends anymore,
- because I just can't.
- Good.
And I think-
I think that you feel the same way.
Because that night after I left, you didn't fuck Lester.
What's up, Zack?
You know what?
I don't care that you're fucking Lester, okay?
How's that?
- Oh, shit.
- I don't wanna be with anyone but you.
So I will wait forever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life because I love you, and I have for as long as I can remember.
And I would rather die than be without you, Miriam Linky.
Miri's last name is Linky?
You're gonna fuck a guy who doesn't know your last name?
Or that you beat up Carl Roth in the sixth grade?
I know that.
Or what your senior prom dress would've looked like had we gone but we decided not to, and we got drunk alone instead.
Or that you washed your hair in the toilet.
We're not fucking' Zack.
Or that you're not fucking Zack- What?
I asked her to fuck me.
She wouldn't do it.
I even tried to talk her into giving me the fucking Dutch rudder.
Shot me down on that too.
- And a Dutch rudder is?
- Don't know what a Dutch rudder-?
All right, you grab your dick, then you have someone else work your arm.
Here, let me show you.
All right, grab my arm.
I'm grabbing my dick, you're grabbing my arm.
Now work it.
Work my arm.
See that shit?
Work it up and down.
It's like someone else is jerking you off.
Okay.
There's the double Dutch rudder, which' I grab my dick, you grab your dick, you work my arm, I work your arm' same time.
It's like jerking off together but not gay.
We're not touching dicks, each other's dicks anyway.
I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.
It feels good, sir.
Try me, come on.
Sorry to change the subject on you, Lester, but if you're not fucking Miri, why is your dick out right now?
Because I live here now, and I like to be naked.
- What?
- When you moved out, she couldn't afford to pay her rent by herself, so I moved in to help.
But you just came out of her room.
That's my room now.
She moved in your old room.
Wait, wait, wait.
She changed rooms?
Yeah, she said she did it because she missed the smell of you or some shit.
I don't smell anything.
But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.
- Night, Zack.
- Night.
Do you?
Then why are you crying?
Because I missed you so much.
Me too.
I love you.
- I love you, I love you.
I love you.
I don't mean to alarm you but I think I just jerked off Lester a little bit.
- The Dutch rudder?
- Yeah, it's ingenious, right?
If you ask me nicely, I will Dutch-rudder you the rest of our lives.
Good.
I'm getting tired of fucking the Fleshlight.
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.
- What'd it feel like?
- Like fucking a flashlight.
Wrong room.
- Oh, God.
That's gross.
Let us fuck.
Hello.
Welcome to Nigga Rich Productions' home of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, the production house for the couple looking to put a little spice in their sex life.
- Shall we take a look around?
- Fuck me so hard.
Oh, God.
First, you'll meet for a consultation with one of our romance-ologists, who'II coach you through that initial awkward stage before you're camera-ready.
So we will start off with some erotic massage and some-
Dude.
Some light petting.
That sounds good.
Are you guys sure you don't wanna do some, uh, butt-sack work too?
- Uh, let's move on' shall we?
- Why?
From their break-out hit, Swallow My Cockuccino, to the multi-million selling Swallow My Cockuccino ll and the award-winning Star Whores saga, including Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter,
Zack and Miri have proven time and again that they know how to shoot hot sex.
As an actor, I've sometimes brought my work home with me inappropriately.
When you're telling your real-life lover in the bedroom' to' you know' bend over while you cake your hand in K-Y, it is a sign that the romance is dead, I think.
Then we turned to the professionals at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
Oh' my God, they totally saved our civil union.
They filmed what was inside of us and not what was coming out of us necessarily.
It helped me see his asshole as not just a come dumpster, but a sign of his beauty' his flower.
It became a, uh, gorgeous orchid.
Orchids grow in sort of the filthiest conditions.
That's what his asshole became to me.
This beautiful flower amidst shit.
- Honey, they get the metaphor.
- I don't think they do.
Let's just say, thank you to Zack and Miri.
It's helped us out, it's helped our friends.
Enrique?
Park?
Park?
Enrique?
Can we get a little love for Zack and Miri?
They don't even know what's going on, they're so pilled up.
But don't take his word for it.
Just ask our co-founders.
- Hi.
I'm Miri Linky Brown.
- I'm Zack Linky Brown.
Here at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, we're dedicated
- to committing your love-
- Or lust.
- to high-end, quality production digital video.
A forever keepsake of your passion.
That's right, Miri.
Why set up a camera at the end of your bed and settle for one unflattering angle, when you could let the professionals dazzle and delight your senses with an array of shots so masterfully rendered you'll swear Martin Scorsese snuck into your room
and caught you fucking?
And remember' we're not just the presidents of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
We're also clients.
Call now to set up your appointment
Way to fuck, Zack.
[BELLS TOLLING]
[HORN HONKING]
MAN:
You little motherfucker!
Get up' Zack.
Come on, I don't wanna be late for work.
MIRl:
Ahh!
Get out!
- Jesus, fuck!
Close the door if you're gonna take a shit.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over, it was not closed.
- Close the door' Zack!
- Okay, okay.
MIRl:
God.
- Fine.
- What's that thing?
- It's a hand warmer.
[SIGHS]
We're going now.
- You smell that?
Is that the car?
Fuck.
- Oh, goddamn it.
- What?
What?
- Oh, it's wedged in my taint.
- What is?
- It got wedged in my taint.
- What?
- It's stuck under my balls.
- It's between my balls and my leg.
- What's happening?
- Please, pull over.
Pull the fuck over!
- All right, all right!
Jesus, all right!
ZACK:
It's about to move up to my ass.
MIRl:
What?
ZACK:
The movement makes it hotter.
It's tucked under them.
It's stuck under them.
[GRUNTING]
Oh' fuck.
I think I burned my ball hair off.
[LAUGHING]
It's not funny.
Can you help me pick out an outfit for tonight?
I'm working till 6.
- Well' I can try stuff on at the store.
- The store?
No, how about instead, you get a friend?
But you are my friend.
I mean a girl friend, jeez.
[JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
Mr. Delaney, can you work for me tomorrow?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
Then you must come in the next day, I tell you.
- It's Black Friday.
- Black Friday?
It's the biggest mall-shopping day of the year.
And since the mall is just up the street, I would like you to come out and work.
- On Black Friday.
- Oh, yeah.
All right, you want me to work on Moolie Monday too?
- I'm sorry?
- How about Nigga Tuesday?
- Nigga Tuesday?
Is this a new holiday?
- You come to a brother and tell him he gotta work on Black Friday.
You got any idea how racist that sounds?
Telling me to work.
What, you think you own me?
- I never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?
You thought,
"I'm gonna lay down the law for this nigga, I put food on his table, clothes on his nigga baby backs, and he ain't gonna say shit. "
- This ain't Amistad.
- You shut up.
You goddamn right this ain't Amistad.
I can't wait till the post office settles my disability suit because then I'm gonna be out this motherfucker.
I'm gonna be Oprah rich.
Y'all can kiss my ass.
You know what?
Fuck you.
Fuck you, and suck cock.
- To hell with you.
DELANEY:
To hell with you.
- Zachary will work.
Zack' my boy.
- Yeah.
- The customer with the harelip-
- Oh, yeah.
- speak me, say you were playing baseball here the other night.
Wiffle ball.
And' uh' no' that wasn't me.
Maybe the harelip makes it sound like "baseball. "
ZACK:
Yeah, maybe you hear with an accent.
- Fuck you, okay?
- Okay.
One day' I'm gonna put a camera over there' and then I can tell-
I'll know everything you do when I'm gone.
Everything.
Scratch your balls, take a shit, everything, I tell you, okay?
Okay.
Fucker.
I hate both of you ebony and ivory motherfuckers, I tell you.
- Why is he so fucking high-strung?
- "Fuck off, I tell you.
Very good. "
Can you believe that Gandhi motherfucker, telling me I gotta work on Black Friday?
Ain't that some shit?
- Yeah.
- Like I don't wanna do shopping.
Biggest sales day of the year.
I'm getting a flat-screen TV, believe that.
That's my fault, I should tell you.
I asked for Friday morning off, I'm sorry.
- For what?
- I actually need a lot of recovery time.
Tonight is me and Miri's ten-year high school reunion.
I'm just gonna get fucking alcohol poisoning.
- Reunion?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
- Isn't that fucked up that they do that?
They say it's the best chance to get everyone together.
People come back in town for the holidays.
But you know what?
they could have it in the middle of the summer at a fucking blowjob contest that I was judging' and it would still be retarded.
- So why you going, then?
- Miri's making me go.
Why you always bending over backwards for that girI'
- knowing she ain't giving up no ass?
- We got a good thing going.
She pays half the rent, does dishes, she wakes me up in the morning.
Why complicate that with sex?
Besides, man, I've known her since the first grade.
You don't fuck someone you met in the first grade.
Excuse me, I met my wife in kindergarten.
We got married senior year, and she has been the queen of my world ever since.
- What if you could do it all over again?
- I'd jerk off and live by myself.
That woman is the bane of my existence.
- See?
- Excuse me, can I get a coffee, black?
Can't you see we talking, white?
ZACK:
If you're gonna continue to emasculate me with this Barbie dress-up shit'
I'm using your laptop.
Don't forget to smack it when you turn it on, otherwise the screen doesn't come on.
[COMPUTER PLAYS FANFARE]
Why don't you spring and get a new one?
Same reason I don't spring for clothes for tonight, I'm broke.
There's a chick who works at Teen Juice at the mall, you know.
I gave her a good deal on yarn,
- so she's letting me borrow this stuff.
- Yo, bro.
[ZACK LAUGHING]
MIRl:
What?
- You're buying a vibrator online.
- What's wrong with the one you have?
MIRl:
It died last week.
Look at the size of those fucking panties.
Shoot that shit.
Shoot it.
ZACK:
My God, who even knew Amazon sold shit like this?
This is incredible.
- Those are fucking granny panties.
MIRl:
Okay,
A, I don't appreciate you violating the sanctity of my Amazon Wish List page' and B, I'm not buying that thing from Amazon, because it turns out I don't have a credit card they take.
[ZACK GRUNTS]
- Oh, shit.
- I'm sorry, guys.
Am I in the way?
You're a fucking faggot, all right?
Let's go to Starbucks.
- He's a shitty barista anyways.
- Cock.
- And he throws like a bitch.
ZACK:
You know what else I throw?
My nut sack in your coffees, so how did that taste, fucker?
We saw your girlfriend in her underwear, cunt nugget.
well' too bad she's not my girlfriend, you little fuck
- Oh, they're gone.
MIRl:
Are you still talking to me?
Uh, just said, I'm gonna look up more fuck toys on Amazon.
Oh' holy shit.
- They sell the Fleshlight here too.
- What's that?
It's a fucking pocket pussy that is shaped like a flashlight
"for discretionary jacking off. "
That way if you get caught, no one thinks it's weird.
You're just a guy who likes to fuck his flashlight.
I am totally buying this shit.
Whoa, if you've got money to burn, how about paying the electric bill?
- That's due already?
- November's is probably due now, but I was talking about September's.
Tell me this doesn't rock.
You kind of look like Ronald McDonald.
That makes me want some McNuggets.
Why would you wanna buy a pocket pussy anyway?
That is so sad.
What?
Excuse me, I forgot about the nobility that accompanies coming with a fucking vibrator.
Think a kid in Darfur gets saved every time a vibrator makes you come?
No.
- "Real feel action"?
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
If you start fucking machines, I'm moving out.
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a machine.
How come you get to fuck something with a motor in it?
I've never met a man who can make me come like a vibrator does.
That's bullshit.
You get to be Buck Rogers having sex in the 25th century with fucking Twiki and Dr. Theopolis.
I'm stuck to a bottle of Jergens in the bathroom.
Holy bejesus.
You do not use my Jergens to jack it in our bathroom.
ZACK:
No, you know what I do actually, is I light a bunch of candles and I sprawl out on my sheets and I listen to Sting.
No, I'm a guy.
Give me two Popsicle sticks and a rubber band,
I'll find a way to fuck it, like a filthy MacGyver.
Oh' my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.
How about this?
I don't get why you're putting so much effert into this thing.
I thought we were just gonna go to sit around and make fun of everybody.
I can't wear anything that I already own and expect to bring home Bobby Long.
Bobby fucking Long?
No way.
Didn't that guy call you "Stinky Linky"?
Yeah, that was then, okay?
Maybe now he can save me a fortune in Amazon bills.
Maybe you can fuck our landlord so we can at least keep a roof over our heads.
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.
Hey, I bought skates with last week's paycheck
- and I need those to skate with.
- Oh.
And this week's will barely cover the past two water bills, so...
Is this sexy?
Yeah, in like a To Catch a Predator kind of way' it is pretty fucking sexy.
Then we're done.
[SHOWER SPLASHING AND PIPES CREAKING]
What the fuck?
Zack.
- You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?
- They shut it off.
- Oh, shit.
Just, uh-
Help me get this shit out of my hair.
Just use the water out of the toilet.
- There's poo in there.
- Not that part.
- The back part of the toilet thing.
- Oh, that makes sense.
MIRl:
Take the cup there and then scoop it in, there you go.
Here, I'll lean back and you can just' you know, pour it down like
- Like that.
ZACK:
You're harshing my buzz' you know.
This is so lame.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Whoa!
All right, one hour tops, then we're gone.
Or I had an idea.
We could just not go at all, which would rock.
Even though we're broke and we've never amounted to anything, we're still better than these people, right?
No.
Not at all.
We're probably not even as good as most of them, unless one of them is a crackhead or something.
Just tell me I'm prettier than when we graduated.
You look about the same.
Definitely not prettier, but around the same.
I'm thinner, though' right?
A little?
Not really.
well' good pep talk.
Fuck.
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.
- You don't recognize us' do you?
- Um, no, sorry.
Zack Brown, Miri Linky.
Were you the one they called Stinky Linky?
Oh' no' no one ever called me that.
Oh.
- Great.
What does yours say?
- What the fuck?
Come on.
- I'm sure I had a nickname.
Nothing?
- All right, you have a great time' and before you go, don't forget your copy of The Roving Roe-Ver.
What the fuck's this shit?
That is not shit, that would be our bi-monthly newsletter.
- Awesome.

It updates you
- on what everyone's doing.
- Finally.
I love your enthusiasm.
Here you go.

Yes, and only 250 R.S.V.P.'d.

- Miri.

- I am.

- Wow, that's beautiful.
- Awesome.
- You wanna fuck me later?
- Uh, no, I'm married.
- Okay, cool.
If you change your mind,
- I'll be in there getting shitfaced.
- He will.
- Just so you know, I eat the pussy.
- He does.
Ah, tempting.

- Sir.

That's before I knew about styling products' you know.
It makes a big difference in life.
But you live and learn, though' right?

- Great, great.

- Well' I've grown up.

You want me to maybe flirt with you so he can see it, even it up a bit?

Like that?
Like Glen and Gary Suck Ross' Meaty Cock and Drop Their Hairy Nuts in His Eager Mouth.
- Is that like a sequel?
- Sort of.
- It's a re-imagining.
- Oh, like The Wiz.
More erotic and with less women.
No women' to be exact.

- Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?
- I thought you recognized me, that's-

You're not in my demographic' so I'm not insulted.
- Not really.
Who's your demographic?
- Do you love pussy?
- I do.

No, I'm great.

- Zachary' we are.
Wow, I-
Oh' God' I just wanna eat him up, yum, yum.
Save some for me' yum, yum, yum.
- I can't keep my hands off him.
- You've had one too many.
Although he does most of the eating in the sack.
In the sack and of the sack.
All right, that's enough.
Look, you've drunk too much.
You do this every time.
You get too Mary for everybody in the room
- and you can't contain yourself.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
And by containing myself, do you mean containing myself in a closet?
In a closet of denial?
Is that-?
No, no, no.
Holy shit, this just got real.
This is exactly why you haven't met my mother.
You don't know how to ease people into this situation.
- You just force your way in every time.
- I thought, maybe for one second in this godforsaken town, I could be myself.
I'm so sorry.
No, you're right' I should just butch up and pretend that I don't love it when you shove your dick in my mouth.
- This is the best night of my life.

Am I making a spectacle?
- I could make a much bigger scene.
- You really are.

Is that enough?
Is that enough of a scene?

Your mother with her makeup and all her drinking, she's in the closet too.
- They fight just like real people.

- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm not.

Thanks, George.
What kind of evil fucks turn off your power the day-?
No, the night before Thanksgiving?
Who does that?
Can you get an advance on your card?
Fleshlight maxed-out my $200 limit.
Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.
This is bad.
If we don't come up with rent, we're gonna get locked out.
Who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.
Which means by the time we get home, there's no heat either.
well' I think it's time we put what we always talked about into effect.
- You're gonna have to start hooking.
- You know, you jest, but these are the exact circumstances people find themselves in right before they start having sex for money.
- Yeah.
- Or making porn.
ZACK:
Oh, my God, yeah.
- What?
You got an idea?
We could make a porno.
- Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?
No, that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me?
That's a rad idea.
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend, he said he makes a hundred grand a year because he shoots and distributes his own porno flicks.
If it's so easy, how come everybody doesn't do it?
Because other people have options and dignity, which we do not have, which puts us in an amazingly advantageous position.
Fuck you, I have dignity.
Where?
Is it hidden in your gigantic underpants that are plastered all over the Internet?
Is that where you hide your dignity?
Every woman has a pair of those period panties.
That's, like, a fact.
Okay.
Families.
I bet people don't make porno, because they have families.
But luckily, your parents are dead.
Sorry.
My grandparents are dead.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
So who are we gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone mainstream now.
It's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks in it.
Look at Paris Hilton.
She throat-fucks a guy in night vision, now she's selling fragrances to tweens.
And I'm pretty sure she's legally retarded.
That's for tweens?
Have you seen that Joe Francis guy who made Girls Gone Wild?
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot piece of shit in the world and he has a jet and a fucking island.
Look, there's got to be a less extreme solution to our financial woes here.
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper route.
- I don't have a bike.
- Be a waiter.
No one wants me around their food.
Would you eat food that I gave you?
I would not eat food that you gave me, that's true.
MIRl:
I mean, nobody wants to see us fuck, Zack.
ZACK:
Everybody wants to see anybody fuck.
I hate Rosie O'Donnell, but if someone said' "I got a tape of Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid,"
I'd be like, "Why aren't we watching that right now?"
Because she's famous.
Hello.
So are you.
You're fucking Granny Panties.
My underwear and your ass are famous' we're not.
So who the F would wanna watch us fuck?
- At least 800 people.
- The jerks we went to school with?
- Are you serious?
- Of course.
If you heard that someone we graduated with was in a fucking porno movie, you'd watch it, right?
I'd watch that guy Brandon suck a cock, I just met him.
With this mailing list, we have almost a thousand people that would definitely buy a porno we were in just to be like,
"Hey, I sat next to that guy in Civics.
Look at his fucking dick. "
We sell a thousand copies at 20 bucks a pop, bam' we have paid off our bills.
ZACK:
So' what do you think?
- I don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.
Oh' wow, like you've never done that before.
How many guys have you met in a bar, taken home, banged with your mouth and then never talked to again?
That's what we call a stranger.
Dude, I don't one-night mouth-fuck anybody that I pick up in bars.
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in the porno movie for some weird reason.
I guess...
We could fuck.
- Ew.
- Fuck you.
I mean, you're a nice-enough-looking guy and everything-
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're an all-right-enough-looking girl.
- How does that feel?
- Dude' I'm just saying it'd be weird and wrong, you know, like fucking my brother.
Okay, seriously, we're just talking about sex, okay?
It's for a purpose.
It's for getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.
- Wow.
- Just explain to your private beforehand,
"Look' this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash. "
- Oh, my God.
- What?
You're just doing this because you've always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?
Yes.
I've gone my whole life pretending that I want nothing to do with you, just hoping one day we'd be in such dire financial straits that I could use it to finally make my move on you.
MIRl:
You're just being sarcastic.
- I am.
See' I was pretending to cry right there.
MIRl:
I guess it's not like it'd be creepy, like if we got way too drunk one night and accidentally fucked, you know?
No.
We'd be going in with the understanding that it's-
A business decision.
Strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.
- Right.
- And by end,
I mean, I'll be waxing your ass.
Fuck you.
I'm not even letting you see my ass.
I've seen your ass and the rest of you naked around a billion times already.
- That goes both ways, buddy.
- You've never seen my dick.
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.
Are you kidding?
That party we went to where you got blasted, and Houls dared you to give yourself head, and we all watched you try for, like, an hour.
Oh' yeah.
Thanks by the way, for fucking letting me do that.
Thank you.
Oh' God.
We really do know too much about each other.
See' and this would really just be one more thing.
I mean, look at us.
It's Thanksgiving and we're huddled around a flaming fucking garbage can like a couple of steno bums.
I mean, this could give us a chance to pay off our debt, pay our bills, get a fucking nicer apartment with heat in it maybe.
What are you doing?
Miriam Linky, will you have sex with me on camera for money?
I will.
DELANEY:
A producer?
ZACK:
Yeah.
- Guy who gets to finance the movie.
- You think I got that kind of money?
We just need that.
What you're about to spend on the flat screen.
Now I can't get my flat screen?
Fuck that.
No, no, no.
With your cut of the profits, you're gonna get two flat screens.
One in your living room, one in your bathroom.
One in the bathroom?
You know, it's always been my dream to watch shit while I shit.
Everyone with an ass loves to watch shit while they shit.
- I'm gonna make that happen for you.
- I don't know, man.
What else the producer do?
- Um, they help with the casting.
- What's casting?
Finding the people to be in the movie.
- I get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.
Like, I can look at a titty, make sure there ain't no moles on there?
- You can look at both titties, man.
- Man.
I've been looking at the same busted titties for the past almost 20 years.
- I'm due for another new titty.
- Please help us.
Please.
Please.
Yes.
Yes.
I love you.
well' don't mind that smell.
We had some homeless people squatting in here.
You know, they'd void their bowels everywhere but the bathroom.
Anyway, you pick up the poop and you've got yourself a movie studio.
Why don't we shoot in your apartment?
No power.
You wanna pay our electric bill?
- You motherfuckers...
- We'll take it.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
MAN 1:
Bring it back.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
DEACON:
Oh' Jesus.
Oh' Jesus.
Oh' God.
Come on.
Why the fuck do I have to do everything?
Fuckers.
[CROWD CHEERS]
MAN 2:
Hey, what is that?
DEACON:
Fucking guys.
This fucking team, man.
They fucking suck.
[MAN 2 SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
I'm gonna hatefuck the shit out of you, ref.
- Dude.
- It's cool.
- He's my cousin.
- Hey.
Didn't you used to videotape the varsity basketball games in high school?
Just the away games.
I did it because I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.
Which one?
Whichever one wanted to fuck the guy who taped the varsity games.
- Aw.
- Still know how to work a camera?
- Who cares what the title is?
- The porn I liked when I was a kid, it was always, like, a spoof of a popular movie, you know?
Like, um, Edward Penishands.
Okay, so we need a mildly clever, vaguely dirty title, that sounds like a real movie
- and sums up what you're gonna see.
- Correct.
An American Werewolf in Brenda?
Fuckback Mountain?
- Too soon?
A Cock-in-Lips Now?
MIRl:
Next.
Cradle the balls.
Work the shaft.
Jerk my come-crayon and let me color you white.
I need cock and I need it now.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
It's "puss" as in pussy.
Oh' because I was like' who would wanna fuck puss?
I want to slam my ham in your can, woman.
Scene.
- This guy is amazing.
- This guy's great-looking too.
I wanna fuck him.
DELANEY:
Hi, my name's Delaney and I'm a producer.
I really don't know what it means.
I'm gonna be honest' this is my first time.
You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna touch you or nothing like that.
- All right.
- I have a wife, you know.
We're happy.
I mean, not happy' but it's cool, you know.
Just so you know, there will be some fucking.
- We'll talk about that if you get the part.
- Okay.
I mean, not
- We won't be fucking, there'll be fucking in the movie.
Like I said' I got a wife.
She don't play that shit.
- She is a crazy bitch.
- Yep.
It's my job as the producer to see what you got.
So if that makes you uncomfortable in any way, you don't have to show me anything you don't wanna show me, because-
I love the movies.
- Lawrence of a Labia.
- No.
- Oh, come on.
- Dawn of the Dick.
Yeah, but how are zombies doing it at all sexy?
I want to eat your brain and your ass.
[GROANING]
- Dude.
- Sci-fi.
Yeah.
Close Encounters With a Turd From Behind.
- I don't know what that means.
- Just asses.
Fucking deep in asses.
[TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
What?
We're making a porno and we just need to know what you would be or would not be interested in doing.
If anything.
- No anal.
- Oh, definitely no anal.
Anal and hugging.
I don't do ass stuff.
- Anal.
- Ah, fuck.
- Oh, wait, oral.
I like anal.
- Yay.
Okay, well, so, uh, do you have any special skills?
Special skills?
I can get a boner really quick and it sticks straight up.
- Is that really a special skill?
- I think.
- Can you show us what you mean?
- Sure.
Oh' that is special.
[ZACK CHUCKLES]
Yeah, you're hired, Mr. -
- Who are you again?
- Lester.
Lester "The Molester" Cockinshtuff.
- No.
- Wow.
That is the best porn name I've ever heard' man.
I can have a porn name?
- Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.
Are you Granny Panties?
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The panties are actually in the house.
- I'll get them.
- Whoa.
- Star Sex 2:
The Wrath of Cunt.
MIRl:
We never made a Star Sex 1.
I guess we can lose Star Sex 3:
The Search for Cock, then.
- Cocunt.
- What's that?
It's Cocoon with a cunt.
[LAUGHING]
So Delaney tells us you have a special talent of some sort.
I don't know if I'd call it a special talent, but it's a little something I picked up doing bachelor parties.
It would probably be easier if I just showed you.
- Great.
- The floor is yours.
So a movie, huh?
That could be fun.
Holy fuck.
Her name's Bubbles.
- Invasion of the Potty-Snatchers?
- That's like MAD Magazine stupid.
well' fuck you' okay?
You try to think of a good sci-fi porno title.
It's hard.
MIRl:
There's gotta be one we haven't thought of that would say it all' not be ridiculously filthy and off-putting, and still have instant recognition with our audience.
- I got it.
- I got it.
- Star Whores.
- Yeah.
It's funny' right?
See' we figured this opens us up to an even bigger sales market beyond the people we went to school with.
People who like comics and sci-fi.
Comics?
Like "Ziggy"?
"Ziggy"?
Is that even in fucking papers anymore?
No, man.
Fuck you. "Ziggy" is a comic' right next to "Family Circus. "
No, like Spider-Man and shit, you know?
There's always a shitload of Star Wars nerds at those comic-book shows.
So we sell them a Princess Leia they can really fucking jerk off to.
- That'd be me, Princess Lay-Her.
- Who am I playing?
You' my friend, are the lead role of Lubed Guy-Baller.
Man' he's gonna be balling dudes?
I thought you said this was boys on girls.
If I have to fuck a guy' okay, but I'd rather fuck a girl.
What's wrong with you, boy?
- We'll change the name to Sky-Baller.
- Sky-Baller.
I will be Hung So-low.
Delaney, my friend, you are On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
Man' I can't be in no porno.
My wife will kill me.
Hump me, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
You're my only hump.
On the other hand, fuck my wife.
Unfortunately, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over does not have any sex in the movie but the droids do, I
- CUP and R2-T-Bag.
I robot.
And Stacey over here is gonna play Darth Vibrator.
- I'm the bad guy?
- She's not a guy, Zack.
I know that because I'm not a fucking idiot.
In our movie, Darth Vibrator is a bad girl who wants to fuck the galaxy, literally' and it's up to Lubed and Hung to stop her with their cocks.
- You and me get to have sex, then?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- I know.
Isn't that awesome?
Hold up, hold up.
So who's all having sex with who in this movie?
As of last night, I was having sex with Zack.
What?
Han Solo ain't never had no sex with Princess Leia in the Star Wars.
ZACK:
Guys' this isn't a literal adaptation here.
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.
Kind of like The Wiz or like a parody.
With lots of anal.
- Cool.
- I know, isn't that awesome?
I have a question, do Princess Lay-Her and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?
Uh, no, because they're brother and sister, and according to Miri' brothers and sisters can't fuck.
But you said, that this wasn't a literal translation, so that means Lester's character could have sex with Miri's character.
Because I would love to fucking eat her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.
Dream on, pal, it's never gonna happen, okay?
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See' she's fine
- Wait, what?
Yep.
I mean, everyone else is having sex with more than one person in this movie all of a sudden, so I think it's' you know' not fair if I'm only fucking you.
Guys, read amongst yourselves, okay?
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Look, Miri, we got plenty of sex going on in this thing, you don't have to do that.
Zack, it's fine.
I mean I have slept with way worse-looking guys than Lester.
I just wanna do my part for the movie like everyone else.
You're having sex in the movie, you don't need to fuck someone else.
- You're good.
- I'm only fucking you' though.
So don't we need to vary it up to keep it fair?
Fair for-?
I don't
- What?
Fair for who?
What are these, blood diamonds we're talking about?
Fair for everyone else who is fucking more than one person, a. k. a. you' in the movie.
- I mean, fine-
- All right.
I mean, if you don't care-
I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
Fuck.
I don't give a shit.
Like you said, you know, you've fucked bigger idiots than Lester.
Holy shit.
Are we really gonna shoot this in outer space?
Maybe not bigger idiots.
[MOUTHS] Thank you.
- Cut.
All right, guys, that's it.
- Yeah.
Make sure you leave your costume so we know they're here for tomorrow.
Mostly, everybody, thank you so much for helping us get ready' you know.
Cleaning this place out, building the sets, sewing the costumes, it's just-
I mean, it's really amazing.
Thank you.
ZACK:
Seriously, thanks.
But this is just the beginning, guys.
If Star Whores works, and it wilI' we are set up for sequels galore.
The Empire Strikes Ass.
- Return of the Brown-Eye.
- The Phantom Man-Ass.
And Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter.
- Okay.
- Revenge of the Shit.
- You got it?
- Yeah, no, we got it.
Ew.
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.
- We'll talk about that one.
We're gonna have a lot of fun' but more importantly, we're gonna make a lot of fucking money' okay?
- Yeah.
- So get ready for greatness, people.
Tomorrow we start principal photography.
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
- All right, good night, you guys.
- We got a movie.
- What?
- Nothing.
I think someone should acknowledge how insane and amazing this is
- and it's all because of you.
- I don't know.
It's just a porno.
You know what I mean.
You've really come into your own.
Shut the fuck up.
So speaking of coming into things' ready for tomorrow?
Twenty years' we're finally gonna know what it's like to have sex with each other.
You say that like you've been wondering what it'd be like to sleep with me for a while now.
Why the fuck do you think I started hanging out with you?
I knew it.
Here, help.
Let's just promise that it's not gonna change anything between us, okay?
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Some guys can't keep sex in perspective.
If anyone's gotta keep this in perspective, it's you, okay?
I don't want you getting all mushy and gooey on me after I give you the best orgasm you've ever had.
Oh' like you know what you're doing down there at all.
I actually don't.
Where's the clitoris?
Is it in your ass?
Just, you know, make sure you kind of whoop it up and act like I'm a stud who knows what he's doing' okay?
Just be a pal.
Oh' dude, I am gonna Meryl Streep the fuck out of this tomorrow, you watch.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
No.
Really, thank you.
For everything.
You're welcome.
Less than 12 hours and we make Monroeville history.
- I really hope nothing goes wrong.
- It's a movie.
What could go wrong?
ZACK:
What are you doing?
DELANEY:
What's up?
- What the fuck?
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait.
- Wait.
- Stop.
Stop.
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck is going on?
Condos is what's going on, as soon as this shit-hole's demo'd.
No, you gotta stop it right now.
We rented this place for a month from Mr. Jenkins.
Sounds like your Mr. Jenkins was full of shit.
Luxury Homesteads bought this place a month ago.
I'm gonna kill that lying old fuck.
You're gonna have to go Florida, that's where he moved.
We've got thousands of dollars of equipment in there.
- Please.
- If you wanna sift through this rubble when we're done, be my guest.
Hey, get that fucking beam down.
MIRl:
This is the last thing you wanna hear.
If you don't get an advance,
I don't think we're gonna keep a roof over our heads.
I got an advance already.
It went into all the costumes.
- So all our money's gone?
- All your money?
Never mind what my wife's gonna do when there ain't no new snow tires, or when she sees I charged a video camera.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this' man.
DELANEY:
I just wanted to see some free titties.
That's all.
But there's no such thing as free titties' is there, Zack?
- Is there?
- Fuck this noise.
Why don't we get another camera, and shoot something else?
Where are we gonna do that?
Got another sound stage?
Sound stage?
We had a shit-covered garage we turned into a sound stage.
We find someplace new and we do it again.
[DOOR SQUEAKS]
How?
Okay, I'm broke, man.
No, make that' I was broke.
Now I am really tapped out.
I have to get another job to pay Delaney back.
So please tell me, how can I afford to start over?
- What can I get you?
- Yeah, can I get a, uh-?
Too fucking late.
Cappuccino, 3.50.
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
I mean, I'm a total loser in every single other aspect of my life.
What made me think I could do something as simple as filming people fucking?
We have no money left, nowhere to shoot, no sets, we have no fucking cameras.
Here.
It's time I go back to my regular life where I am a quiet fuckup who doesn't cost anybody any money and knows his goddamn position behind this fucking counter making cappuccinos for this fucking guy.
Oh' yeah.
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
ZACK:
Oh' yeah.
Yeah.
Fuck, yes.
Zack.
[CHUCKLES]
You sneaky Indian motherfucker.
I tell you, yes.
Swallow My Cockuccino.
- What?
- That's it.
That's the movie.
Why didn't I think of it before?
We don't need sets or a stage.
Look at all this production value, waiting to have balls on it.
Hold up.
You wanna shoot a dirty movie here, where we work?
Yes.
Fuck, yes, I do.
You know how many stories I have from working here?
How many times I've been laid right there after hours?
You've never gotten laid here after hours.
I know.
Thank you for reminding me.
But I always wish I had, and that's what porno is.
It's fantasy.
It's taking the normal and making it abnormal by fucking it.
Don't do that.
The little dog don't like that.
How did you get a camera?
By being a terrible, untrustworthy employee, that's how.
Give me today, I'll bang out a script.
Meet me back here after closing.
We're gonna launch arching ropes of jism all over this motherfucker.
Peace.
I like that guy but if he tries to fuck that little dog tonight for real,
I'm calling the Humane Society.
It's called Bean-N-Gone, so get the fuck out of here.
Hey, Barry.
ZACK:
Stand by, Stace' picture's up.
- Okay.
ZACK:
Roll tape.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 12, Take 1.
ZACK:
And action.
I'd like a double espresso so I can stay up all night because I'm in the mood to fuck.
well' I am a whore-ista, so I love to fuck.
Would you like to fuck me?
Holy fuck.
You mean, after you're done with your shift?
I mean during my shift.
- Sorry.
- Keep going, keep going.
With your shaft.
Let us fuck.
Cue music.
[FUNK MUSIC PLAYING]
Okay, open up to camera, guys.
Let us see it.
More tongue.
Little less tongue.
Oh' that was good.
[CASH REGISTER BEEPING]
Cue effects.
[MOANING]
Oh' yeah, like that.
Oh' yeah.
See' I told you it would work.
Didn't I tell you?
It looks amazing.
It's incredible.
STACEY:
Oh' the beans hurt.
Easy.
- Move in for coverage.
- Nice.
That's why we got him.
- Nice.
I'm impressed.
- Get in there, Deacon.
- Come on.
- Like that?
Like that.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
- Pull out a bit, actually.
STACEY:
That's hot.
No, not you, Lester.
Put it back in.
Kiss the muscle.
- I kiss the muscle.
- You kiss the muscle.
- Can he slap her ass a little?
- Don't be a fucking pervert, dude.
- Stir, come on.
Stir.
- Yeah, stir it.
Stir it, baby.
Hey.
- Holy.
- Shit.
Are you guys still open?
No.
We close at 9.
I need coffee so I'm drive home.
- Okay.
Yeah.
MAN:
Thank you.
That's a cute kitty.
Okay.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You guys see the game?
I was at it.
Fucking Roethlisberger, the quarterback, was all fucking'
"Hug it' chug it, football.
All night. " Heh-heh.
Okay, paI' here you go.
On the house.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Have a good one.
- Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- I said, have a good one.
Oh.
- Okay.
Keep moving.
MAN:
You and your little dog.
Go Steelers.
Action.
Oh' yeah.
Yeah, yeah, like that.
Oh' fuck it' chuck it' football.
Oh' yeah.
BARRY:
Oh' God' this is good.
[BARRY MOANING]
You take it.
You take it.
Take it, Barry.
Oh, take it.
Take it, Barry.
Take it.
I'm disturbed at how turned on I am by this.
- Shit, dude' it's almost 6.
- Oh, fuck.
Okay, that's a wrap, everybody, yeah.
Let's give a hand to our hotties with the bodies from last night.
Stacey, Lester, Bubbles, Barry' whoo.
LESTER:
Yeah.
ZACK:
Nice.
Okay, when we come back tonight, we finish up the venti-vulva scene' and then we get into me and Miri's stuff.
Again' amazing first night, everybody.
Thank you so much.
Let us fuck.
- Hey' how'd it look?
- How do you think it looked?
It looked like shit going into other shit, in focus.
What an artist.
That was Kurosawa's motto. "Shit going into other shit. "
Oh' man, I can't believe you gotta work now.
It's okay.
You know, honestly, I don't think I could sleep.
- I'm pretty, like, pumped up right now.
- Right?
It was amazing.
It was awesome.
I think the cast and crew had a good time.
- We were getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.
I just wanna keep shooting people boning all day.
I don't think I've ever met the ambitious Zack Brown before.
- Well' I'm trying to pay the bills, so...
- It's not a bad thing.
I think it looks good on you.
ZACK:
Come on, hurry.
Come on, come on' come on.
BUBBLES:
Wait a minute.
- You guys never did it before?
MIRl:
It's fine.
You know, we talked about it and it's just for the movie.
We're friends' you know' we're just friends.
And we will always just be just friends, so...
Listen' I have some extra lube from last night.
I understand it's kind of hard getting wet when everyone's watching.
At least it was for Barry.
- I don't know if I am gonna need it.
- Really?
Yeah, I think I'm just excited.
Uh-huh.
At the idea of people watching' not because of Zack.
Oh' God.
Zack could never have that effect on me in a million years.
- Hello, Miriam.
- Oh, hey.
Wow.
- Your face.
- Yeah.
Weird, huh?
I don't think I've seen your face since senior year.
ZACK:
I think I made a mistake.
I did it for you so you wouldn't get road rash during our scene, but I should have asked first' I look like a fucking beluga whale.
I think I'll be going now.
ZACK:
Okay.
[CLEARING THROAT]
All I keep thinking is we should've done a trial run at home last week or something.
- Oh, my God.
Right?
- I know.
[LAUGHING]
- You're still cool to do it, though, right?
- Yeah, um.
Totally.
Are you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I'm, uh...
- Honestly, I'm a little nervous, I guess.
- You are?
- It's kind of a big deal.
- It is?
Yeah, you know, it's our first time together since our auspicious debut on viral video.
Oh' yeah.
That's a fuckload of pressure for a director.
As a director, please.
What about the anxiety I'm feeling as an actress?
- Did I pick the right project?
- Yeah.
What about this follow-up?
Julia Roberts followed Pretty Waman with Sleeping With the Enemy.
I'm following Granny Panties with Swallow My Cockuccino.
Only difference is this movie's about cock-sucking and her movie just sucked cock, period.
- The only difference, yeah.
- The end was pretty rad.
I liked that.
- When she kills him.
- With a gun.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- She calls the cops first.
- She calls it in first.
- It was so awesome.
- Awesome, yeah.
So I guess we should do this.
I think we should probably wait just until I lose another 20 or 30 pounds.
Stop it.
You look good.
Thanks.
So, what about me?
How do I look?
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful, so I guess it's not a big deal, but you look amazing.
- Okay.
Let's go make a porno.
- Okay.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 8, Take 1.
DEACON:
Come here.
- I'm over-?
All right, settle.
Action.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Who could it be?
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm a delivery man and I have some cream for you.
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.
I work out.
So do you want me to give you your cream now?
I've been waiting for it all day.
- Fuck.
Come on.
- Oops.
[WHISPERS] Keep going.
I spilled my cream.
Do you mind?
I don't mind.
Especially if you spill it on my face.
Let us fuck.
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
- Fix my shirt.
Think I should?
- Okay.
Let me see them titties.
Actually, you know what?
Sorry, I don't think we should show them.
- What?
- We shouldn't show your breasts.
- Aren't you gonna take your shirt off?
- I'm just gonna open it.
You're not gonna take it off?
Why not?
My tits are bigger than yours.
I don't wanna show that.
She's not gonna show her tits?
I showed my cock and my asshole.
- Okay, I'll do your pants.
- Back and forth. okay.
- Holy shit.
- Where's that delivery?
I can't believe this.
I was delivering cream, and look what's happening.
- Jesus, what is that, a rumba?
- What's a rumba?
That awkward movement.
- Should I take your underpants off?
- Yeah, take them off.
ZACK:
What the fuck?
How does this work?
They're just like
- I'll do it.
- I'll do mine, you just
- You do yours.
- I'll do my pants.
Granny panties.
Just get on with it already.
I'm gonna fuck you with my pecker.
Dude, that's really dirty.
- That's too dirty?
- That offends me.
- Penis?
- Fine.
- I'm gonna fuck you with my penis.
- I can't wait.
For my penis.
Be careful, Miri.
Okay, there we go.
Just keep rolling, keep rolling.
- I'll walk forward.
- Fucking cream is coming.
This is the worst porno I've ever seen.
MIRl:
Get over here, delivery man.
ZACK:
Let's fuck on these beans.
[GRUNTING]
- You okay?
- Yup.
ZACK:
Okay' all right.
- Just leave them.
Just leave them.
- They're really distracting.
- You should leave them.
- You gotta get your
- There you go.
ZACK:
Okay' okay.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.
This okay?
Okay.
Okay, uh.
- We'll start kissing on three' okay?
- Okay.
One, two, three.
Go.
MIRl:
I'm ready.
- I'm ready.
- Okay.
Deacon.
- Deacon.
Deacon.
- What?
Did you see Lost this week, man?
I missed it.
What happened?
They're on the island, off the island.
Who can follow that?
I think they're in hell.
Would you all shut the motherfuck up?
[MOANING]
I want you to come.
- I want you to come with me.
- Okay.
Oh' God.
ZACK:
Oh' God.
Cut.
That's it?
It's over?
Ain't he supposed to come on her titties?
well' it wasn't what we'd shot-listed' but that was nice.
- It was so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack.
Thanks, Lester, uh.
It wasn't just me, though, guys.
Give it up for my radiant costar here, Miri.
[CHEERING]
LESTER:
Nice.
- Um, show's over in here.
Let's move out' start lighting the next scene.
- All right.
LESTER:
Let's do it.
BUBBLES:
You looked so beautiful.
- Thanks.
DELANEY:
I thought they were gonna be fucking hard.
- It was pretty.
DELANEY:
Pretty don't sell.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
You good, Mir?
You need anything?
I'm just gonna take a minute, okay?
Okay, uh.
I'll just be out there.
Yeah.
- That was fun.
- Yeah, fun.
ZACK [WHISPERS]:
"Fun. " You fucking douche.
[SIGHS]
Wow.
- Hey.
ZACK:
Hey.
- You working on a rewrite?
- Yeah, just for tonight's scene.
- I'm ready to go when you are, though.
- Okay.
You know, before we go, I...
I'm thinking that, uh, it's a good idea if we talk about what happened last night.
- Oh.
- I mean, we don't have to' but I think-
Okay, yeah, uh.
I kind of dropped the ball on that, I guess, huh?
- No, no.
It's...
- To be honest, it was...
You know, I didn't realize how weird it would be for me.
Weird?
Like
- Weird how?
Acting and directing at the same time.
It's a lot to process, you know.
For the first time' I thought my balls didn't have enough hair on them.
That's not what I meant.
I know what you meant.
How you feeling about it?
I guess, um...
I feel like...
Like we...
- Holy fuck.
- The power's on.
Did you do this?
ZACK:
How did this happen?
I burned the bills.
How could we have done that?
- The water.
- The water.
MIRl:
Come on, come on' come on.
Yeah!
- We can shower in our home again.
- We are liquid.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Greetings.
Have you heard the good news about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?
Oh' my God, did you guys do this?
We got tired of you taking showers at our places all the time.
So we took up a collection amongst ourselves.
And chipped away at your mountain of debt.
You guys paid off our massive utilities bills?
- How did you afferd that?
- I stole my old lady's bingo winnings.
And Mistress Bubbles did a bachelor party tonight at which yours truly was a guest star, thank you very much.
- Oh.
- Whoa.
Don't get too excited.
We didn't pay off your whole bill.
Just a month of each.
They agreed to turn everything back on?
At 9 at night?
How does that work?
Stacey knows somebody that works at Power and Light.
- You guys...
- This is amazing.
You didn't have to do this.
You didn't have to put us in your movie.
- Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.
- Or put us in your movie either.
- We said that already.
Guys, honestly, I don't know what to say.
You can start by saying we can take tonight off so we can have our wrap party right now.
Guys, we're not wrapped.
We still have four days of shooting left.
Excuse me.
In my "producoriaI" capacity,
I'm shutting the movie down for a night so we can get a little silly.
[DMX'S "PARTY UP (UP IN HERE)" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
[THE PIXIES' "HEY" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
[COIN CLINKING AND PEOPLE CHATTERING]
Go' go' go.
- Yes.
- Yes.
[LAUGHING]
You all drink.
Was it just amazing with him, after all those years of not knowing?
It was, um, weird.
- But good.
- My scene with Zack's tomorrow.
You don't say.
But I'm a little nervous.
I was thinking about trying to get with him tonight.
- Really?
- I mean, if you don't mind.
You are just friends and all' so I didn't think it would be a biggie.
- It wouldn't be a biggie, would it?
- No.
No, no.
It's not a biggie.
What?
No.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Stacey' I'm not married to the guy, so...
I don't know.
You guys just looked kind of intimate last night.
- We did?
- Yeah.
well' we're just better actors than I thought, I think, so you know what?
If you wanna get with him' you should just go ask him.
- He'd be really excited to hear that.
- Yeah?
For real, you don't mind?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
DEACON:
All the quarters are on the ground.
ZACK:
Hey, Stace.
- Hey' Zack.
[WHISPERING]
DEACON:
Come on, are you guys playing or what?
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
well' I'm bummed, but I totally get it.
It's no problem to work with Lester again.
He has a nice cock.
well' you're a trouper, Stace.
Oh' but if I start making weird faces or anything during the scene' it's just because I've been constipated all day.
Oh' shit' uh.
We don't have to shoot the scene tonight.
No, I want to.
anal's great for when you're constipated.
It totally loosens you up.
I use ex-lax' but good to know.
Okay, I never thought I would have that conversation.
So are we starting with Lester and Stacey tonight?
We were supposed to start with Lester and Miri.
I know.
She
- We're not gonna do that.
I don't think Miri's gonna...
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
...do that.
Hey.
So where are we shooting this?
Over here?
- What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.
Our scene's tonight, right?
Can I talk to you for a minute in the back?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
What do you want me to shoot here?
Start with the close-ups of Lester and Stacey.
Give me a second, man.
What an artist.
Okay, uh.
Did I do something wrong to you?
No.
Then why are you here?
I'm here for the same reason you're here.
To make the movie.
Okay, just, like' for your own personal information, you're acting really weird right now.
I'm acting weird?
I think you're acting weird right now.
Oh' I'm acting- How exactly am I acting weird?
You've been trying to keep me from fucking anybody but you since we started this thing.
Maybe I was thinking about your feelings.
Were you thinking of my feelings when you were banging Stacey?
Because that'd be really sad for Stacey.
She told me that you told her that that was okay.
I told her that it was okay to ask you.
Holy shit.
I get it.
I fucking get it.
It was a test.
That whole thing was a fucking test, is that it?
If it was, how do you think you did?
We had a discussion, Miri.
We had
- Actually, we had many discussions about how it was just sex
- and how we wouldn't let it get weird.
- I'm not acting weird.
You're acting like a jealous girlfriend is what the fuck you're acting like.
- I am not your girlfriend.
- I know that.
You're not my boyfriend, so why are we having this conversation right now?
Because you're about to fuck Lester to spite me, it seems like.
Did you fuck Stacey to spite me?
No.
You fucked her like you fucked every other bitch and never gave a shit how I felt about it.
- Well' that was before.
- Before what?
Look, don't fucking pretend that the other night, you and me, right there, that that didn't mean anything to you, that you didn't feel it too.
Oh.
You're not getting all gooey on me here, are you, Zack?
You know what?
If you were any other bitch I didn't give a rat's ass about,
I would tell you to go fuck yourself right now because I fucking hate this game-playing shit.
But you, you mean more to me than that' so I'm just gonna lay this out on front street.
I know you felt something big, something real the other night when we were together because I felt it too.
We tried to fuck and instead, we wound up making love.
So if this is what you need to hear in order to keep you from fucking Lester, if this is what you need, then fine.
Here it is, I'm gonna say it.
I love you, Miri.
Happy?
Oh' Jesus.
You better get ahold of yourself, Zack, because we just fucked.
Okay.
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?
But you did.
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.
[WHISPERS] Wait-
All right, don't forget I'm down here.
Watch that pullout, huh?
STACEY:
Yeah.
Mmm.
This is some damn good coffee.
- Where you going?
- Getting the fuck out of here.
We gotta finish this movie.
[GASPS]
Yo!
[COUGHING AND GROANING]
You believe this shit?
Do you believe this shit?
What the fuck just happened in there?
I'll tell you what just happened in there.
That chick frosted me like I was a fucking cake.
Zack.
TEEN 1:
Okay, seriously' get a picture of me right now.
I'm hunting humans.
- Dude' check it out.
Ooh.
- Oh, shit.
Seriously, let's shoot the shit out of this bitch.
- Where you aiming at?
- Cock shots?
Cock shots.
[BUZZER RINGS]
[BUZZER RINGS]
We shot you in the balls, cunt nugget.
well' it's my job to get shot in the balls, so
- Oh, they're gone.
MAN:
Excuse me.
Didn't you used to work at the Bean-N-Gone in Monroeville?
I sure as shit hope this pays better, I tell you.
[CHATTERING]
So why don't they just shoot you with a puck?
What do you mean?
I mean, what does paintball got to do with hockey?
Nothing, I guess.
- So ain't no prizes or-?
- No, no.
So, what are they paying $5 for?
To shoot a Broad Street Bully in the balls.
White people are fucked up.
Yup' they sure are.
It's a living.
You've been getting the checks I've been sending?
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Probably didn't save you from a brutal tongue-lashing, though, huh?
You know, the wife never found out about the camera, because I paid off the bills.
How did you manage that?
- Because now I'm Oprah rich.
- No way.
- The post office fucking settled?
- Hundred-sixty large' son.
- Nice, man.
Congratulations.
- A beautiful day, thank you very much.
I thought you made that whole thing up.
No, no.
It was very real.
You can believe it.
Even though she's spending all of it.
well' since you ain't gonna ask me, I'll just go ahead and tell you.
- No, I have not seen Miri.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.
Oh' I suppose you weren't gonna ask about your movie, neither?
Look, that's why I came down here.
I need you to come take a look at it.
- I'm not interested.
Sorry.
- You'd better get interested
- because you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?
The story doesn't make sense.
- The story?
- The story doesn't make sense.
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?
It's a movie, dog, and a movie's gotta have an ending, which we don't have at the moment.
Come shot, credits.
There's your fucking ending.
Do me this favor, okay?
When you're done getting your nuts blown off' come back to humble Monroeville to my crib for a couple hours' check out the flick, you tell me what's missing.
No.
I'll tell you what, you do that, you don't owe me shit no more.
- Really?
- Really.
- Is your wife home?
- Yes.
- Maybe I should leave the pads on.
- You got some extra ones?
Hey, honey.
Where the fuck you been?
And who in the fuck is this now?
Would you calm down, woman?
Goddamn.
You already left one white boy down in my basement while you off gallivanting and shit.
What if this motherfucker
- was all grabby on me?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
Oh' what in the fuck is that supposed to mean?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
WIFE:
White boys love me.
White boy.
- I said, white boy.
- Yeah?
You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?
- Should I say yes?
- Just say yes.
Yeah.
- Why don't you, uh, head downstairs?
- Oh, okay.
It's just through this hallway.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
What the fuck you looking at?
Why you gotta be yelling at me in front of my director?
- Oh, he's a director?
- Yeah.
I didn't know that.
Shit, he's a director.
well' why don't he direct my ass to a new husband?
How about that shit?
- That's the bedroom.
DELANEY:
Keep talking, maybe he will.
Oh' don't nobody want them saggy-ass balls!
Saggy balls?
Look at these sagging-ass titties you got around here.
- You could tie these together.
- Motherfucker, we match.
Oh' shit.
Where's my paintball gun at?
Look at you, editor and DP.
You got your shit covered, man.
Please, don't ever say "shit-covered" to me again.
Roll the film for the man, please, so we can see what he thinks.
Just jump through it.
I ain't got all night.
The bitch is on me.
"Nigga Rich Productions. " Classy.
- Yeah, DreamWorks was taken.
- Was it?
Plus' it sounds like an underground gay fuck club.
"I met a guy at DreamWorks. " Yeah.
All right, so we got Lester and Stacey fucking.
Then we got Barry and Bubbles fucking.
And then this boring bullshit.
Okay, just, uh, go to the next scene, would you?
Uh...
- What next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?
We never shot it.
- Why not?
- Because after you left that night,
Miri came out of the backroom and said she couldn't do it.
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped?
So...
- Wait, so Miri-
- Never fucked nobody.
Just you.
Now, I wonder why she did that.
- Hm.
- Hm.
You see, there was a time when I was just a bitter old fuck making coffees, and Stacey was just a lap dancer and Barry and Bubbles didn't know each other and this fool here, hell, I don't even know what he was.
- A white supremacist.
- Man' fuck you.
Then two people come along and showed us something we didn't know existed.
A world of possibilities where plain old people just like us could do something special.
Even if it's something as simple as filming people fucking.
Sometimes we just need someone to show us something we can't see for ourselves
and then we're changed forever.
So as you can see' our movie ain't got no ending.
Every movie needs an ending' don't it?
Peace.
Delaney, you're a slick cupid motherfucker.
Ain't love grand?
WIFE:
Why the fuck is this white boy running through my goddamn house?
[DOOR SLAMS]
Sometimes.
Miri.
- Miri.
MIRl:
Zack?
ZACK:
Miri.
I'm sorry.
MIRl:
Get out.
- Close the door.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over-
- Just close the fucking door' Zack.
I never slept with Stacey that night, okay?
I swear to God.
When we got into my room, you know what we did?
We talked about you, and us and how things were different and how I was too much of a fucking pussy to just tell you how I felt about you.
And I know
- I know that that's only because of all the stupid shit we said about how we wouldn't let sex change us, but it did.
It changed me.
That has to be love, right?
It has to be love and just so you know, I can't go back to being just friends anymore,
- because I just can't.
- Good.
And I think-
I think that you feel the same way.
Because that night after I left, you didn't fuck Lester.
What's up, Zack?
You know what?
I don't care that you're fucking Lester, okay?
How's that?
- Oh, shit.
- I don't wanna be with anyone but you.
So I will wait forever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life because I love you, and I have for as long as I can remember.
And I would rather die than be without you, Miriam Linky.
Miri's last name is Linky?
You're gonna fuck a guy who doesn't know your last name?
Or that you beat up Carl Roth in the sixth grade?
I know that.
Or what your senior prom dress would've looked like had we gone but we decided not to, and we got drunk alone instead.
Or that you washed your hair in the toilet.
We're not fucking' Zack.
Or that you're not fucking Zack- What?
I asked her to fuck me.
She wouldn't do it.
I even tried to talk her into giving me the fucking Dutch rudder.
Shot me down on that too.
- And a Dutch rudder is?
- Don't know what a Dutch rudder-?
All right, you grab your dick, then you have someone else work your arm.
Here, let me show you.
All right, grab my arm.
I'm grabbing my dick, you're grabbing my arm.
Now work it.
Work my arm.
See that shit?
Work it up and down.
It's like someone else is jerking you off.
Okay.
There's the double Dutch rudder, which' I grab my dick, you grab your dick, you work my arm, I work your arm' same time.
It's like jerking off together but not gay.
We're not touching dicks, each other's dicks anyway.
I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.
It feels good, sir.
Try me, come on.
Sorry to change the subject on you, Lester, but if you're not fucking Miri, why is your dick out right now?
Because I live here now, and I like to be naked.
- What?
- When you moved out, she couldn't afford to pay her rent by herself, so I moved in to help.
But you just came out of her room.
That's my room now.
She moved in your old room.
Wait, wait, wait.
She changed rooms?
Yeah, she said she did it because she missed the smell of you or some shit.
[SNIFFS]
I don't smell anything.
But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.
- Night, Zack.
- Night.
Do you?
Then why are you crying?
Because I missed you so much.
ZACK:
Me too.
I love you.
- I love you, I love you.
ZACK:
I love you.
I don't mean to alarm you but I think I just jerked off Lester a little bit.
- The Dutch rudder?
- Yeah, it's ingenious, right?
If you ask me nicely, I will Dutch-rudder you the rest of our lives.
Good.
I'm getting tired of fucking the Fleshlight.
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.
- What'd it feel like?
- Like fucking a flashlight.
LESTER:
Wrong room.
- Oh, God.
That's gross.
Let us fuck.
You little motherfucker!
Get up' Zack.
Come on, I don't wanna be late for work.
Ahh!
Get out!
- Jesus, fuck!
Close the door if you're gonna take a shit.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over, it was not closed.
- Close the door' Zack!
- Okay, okay.
God.
- Fine.
- What's that thing?
- It's a hand warmer.
We're going now.
- You smell that?
Is that the car?
Fuck.
- Oh, goddamn it.
- What?
What?
- Oh, it's wedged in my taint.
- What is?
- It got wedged in my taint.
- What?
- It's stuck under my balls.
- It's between my balls and my leg.
- What's happening?
- Please, pull over.
Pull the fuck over!
- All right, all right!
Jesus, all right!
It's about to move up to my ass.
- What?
The movement makes it hotter.
It's tucked under them.
It's stuck under them.
Oh' fuck.
I think I burned my ball hair off.
It's not funny.
Can you help me pick out an outfit for tonight?
I'm working till 6.
- Well' I can try stuff on at the store.
- The store?
No, how about instead, you get a friend?
But you are my friend.
I mean a girl friend, jeez.
Mr. Delaney, can you work for me tomorrow?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
Then you must come in the next day, I tell you.
- It's Black Friday.
- Black Friday?
It's the biggest mall-shopping day of the year.
And since the mall is just up the street, I would like you to come out and work.
- On Black Friday.
- Oh, yeah.
All right, you want me to work on Moolie Monday too?
- I'm sorry?
- How about Nigga Tuesday?
- Nigga Tuesday?
Is this a new holiday?
- You come to a brother and tell him he gotta work on Black Friday.
You got any idea how racist that sounds?
Telling me to work.
What, you think you own me?
- I never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?
You thought,
"I'm gonna lay down the law for this nigga, I put food on his table, clothes on his nigga baby backs, and he ain't gonna say shit."
- This ain't Amistad.
- You shut up.
You goddamn right this ain't Amistad.
I can't wait till the post office settles my disability suit because then I'm gonna be out this motherfucker.
I'm gonna be Oprah rich.
Y'all can kiss my ass.
You know what?
Fuck you.
Fuck you, and suck cock.
- To hell with you.
- To hell with you.
- Zachary will work.
Zack' my boy.
- Yeah.
- The customer with the harelip...
- Oh, yeah.
- speak me, say you were playing baseball here the other night.
Wiffle ball.
And' uh' no' that wasn't me.
Maybe the harelip makes it sound like "baseball."
Yeah, maybe you hear with an accent.
- Fuck you, okay?
- Okay.
One day' I'm gonna put a camera over there' and then I can tell...
I'll know everything you do when I'm gone.
Everything.
Scratch your balls, take a shit, everything, I tell you, okay?
Okay.
Fucker.
I hate both of you ebony and ivory motherfuckers, I tell you.
- Why is he so fucking high-strung?
- "Fuck off, I tell you.
Very good."
Can you believe that Gandhi motherfucker, telling me I gotta work on Black Friday?
Ain't that some shit?
- Yeah.
- Like I don't wanna do shopping.
Biggest sales day of the year.
I'm getting a flat-screen TV, believe that.
That's my fault, I should tell you.
I asked for Friday morning off, I'm sorry.
- For what?
- I actually need a lot of recovery time.
Tonight is me and Miri's ten-year high school reunion.
I'm just gonna get fucking alcohol poisoning.
- Reunion?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
- Isn't that fucked up that they do that?
They say it's the best chance to get everyone together.
People come back in town for the holidays.
But they could have it in the middle of the summer at a blowjob contest that I was judging' and it would still be retarded.
- So why you going, then?
- Miri's making me go.
Why you always bending over backwards for that girl'
- knowing she ain't giving up no ass?
- We got a good thing going.
She pays half the rent, does dishes, she wakes me up in the morning.
Why complicate that with sex?
Besides, man, I've known her since the first grade.
You don't fuck someone you met in the first grade.
Excuse me, I met my wife in kindergarten.
We got married senior year, and she has been the queen of my world ever since.
- What if you could do it all over again?
- I'd jerk off and live by myself.
That woman is the bane of my existence.
- See?
- Excuse me, can I get a coffee, black?
Can't you see we talking, white?
If you're gonna continue to emasculate me with this Barbie dress-up shit'
I'm using your laptop.
Don't forget to smack it when you turn it on, otherwise the screen doesn't come on.
Why don't you spring and get a new one?
Same reason I don't spring for clothes for tonight, I'm broke.
There's a chick who works at Teen Juice at the mall, you know.
I gave her a good deal on yarn,
- so she's letting me borrow this stuff.
- Yo, bro.
What?
- You're buying a vibrator online.
- What's wrong with the one you have?
- It died last week.
Look at the size of those fucking panties.
Shoot that shit.
Shoot it.
My God, who even knew Amazon sold shit like this?
This is incredible.
- Those are fucking granny panties.
- Okay,
A, I don't appreciate you violating the sanctity of my Amazon Wish List page' and B, I'm not buying that thing from Amazon, because it turns out I don't have a credit card they take.
- Oh, shit.
- I'm sorry, guys.
Am I in the way?
You're a fucking faggot, all right?
Let's go to Starbucks.
- He's a shitty barista anyways.
- Cock.
- And he throws like a bitch.
- You know what else I throw?
My nut sack in your coffees, so how did that taste, fucker?
We saw your girlfriend in her underwear, cunt nugget.
Well' too bad she's not my girlfriend, you little fuck...
Oh, they're gone.
Are you still talking to me?
Uh, just said, I'm gonna look up more fuck toys on Amazon.
Oh' holy shit.
- They sell the Fleshlight here too.
- What's that?
It's a fucking pocket pussy that is shaped like a flashlight
"for discretionary jacking off."
That way if you get caught, no one thinks it's weird.
You're just a guy who likes to fuck his flashlight.
I am totally buying this shit.
Whoa, if you've got money to burn, how about paying the electric bill?
- That's due already?
- November's is probably due now, but I was talking about September's.
Tell me this doesn't rock.
You kind of look like Ronald McDonald.
That makes me want some McNuggets.
Why would you wanna buy a pocket pussy anyway?
That is so sad.
What?
Excuse me, I forgot about the nobility that accompanies coming with a fucking vibrator.
Think a kid in Darfur gets saved every time a vibrator makes you come?
No.
- "Real feel action"?
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
If you start fucking machines, I'm moving out.
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a machine.
How come you get to fuck something with a motor in it?
I've never met a man who can make me come like a vibrator does.
That's bullshit.
You get to be Buck Rogers having sex in the 25th century with fucking Twiki and Dr. Theopolis.
I'm stuck to a bottle of Jergens in the bathroom.
Holy bejesus.
You do not use my Jergens to jack it in our bathroom.
No, you know what I do actually, is I light a bunch of candles and I sprawl out on my sheets and I listen to Sting.
No, I'm a guy.
Give me two Popsicle sticks and a rubber band,
I'll find a way to fuck it, like a filthy MacGyver.
Oh' my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.
How about this?
I don't get why you're putting so much effort into this thing.
I thought we were just gonna go to sit around and make fun of everybody.
I can't wear anything that I already own and expect to bring home Bobby Long.
Bobby fucking Long?
No way.
Didn't that guy call you "Stinky Linky"?
Yeah, that was then, okay?
Maybe now he can save me a fortune in Amazon bills.
Maybe you can fuck our landlord so we can at least keep a roof over our heads.
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.
Hey, I bought skates with last week's paycheck
- and I need those to skate with.
- Oh.
And this week's will barely cover the past two water bills, so...
Is this sexy?
Yeah, in like a To Catch a Predator kind of way' it is pretty fucking sexy.
Then we're done.
What the fuck?
Zack.
- You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?
- They shut it off.
- Oh, shit.
Just, uh...
Help me get this shit out of my hair.
Just use the water out of the toilet.
- There's poo in there.
- Not that part.
- The back part of the toilet thing.
- Oh, that makes sense.
Take the cup there and then scoop it in, there you go.
Here, I'll lean back and you can just' you know, pour it down like...
Like that.
You're harshing my buzz' you know.
This is so lame.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Whoa!
All right, one hour tops, then we're gone.
Or I had an idea.
We could just not go at all, which would rock.
Even though we're broke and we've never amounted to anything, we're still better than these people, right?
No.
Not at all.
We're probably not even as good as most of them, unless one of them is a crackhead or something.
Just tell me I'm prettier than when we graduated.
You look about the same.
Definitely not prettier, but around the same.
I'm thinner, though' right?
A little?
Not really.
Well' good pep talk.
Fuck.
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.
- You don't recognize us' do you?
- Um, no, sorry.
Zack Brown, Miri Linky.
Were you the one they called Stinky Linky?
Oh' no' no one ever called me that.
Oh.
- Great.
What does yours say?
- What the fuck?
Come on.
- I'm sure I had a nickname.
Nothing?
- All right, you have a great time' and before you go, don't forget your copy of The Roving Roe-Ver.
What the fuck's this shit?
That is not shit, that would be our bi-monthly newsletter.
- Awesome.
- It updates you
- on what everyone's doing.
- Finally.
I love your enthusiasm.
Here you go.
Write your e-mail address on that and I'll be sure to add you to our 800-member-strong mailing list.
We had 800 people in our graduating class?
Yes, and only 250 R.S.V.P.'d.
Doesn't that suck, Mary?
- Miri.
- You married, Bets?
- I am.
Two kids.
- Wow, that's beautiful.
- Awesome.
- You wanna fuck me later?
- Uh, no, I'm married.
- Okay, cool.
If you change your mind,
- I'll be in there getting shitfaced.
- He will.
- Just so you know, I eat the pussy.
- He does.
Ah, tempting.
Again, no.
- Shall we?
- Sir.
Bye, Bets.
Think about it.
Enjoy.
Can I get two beers' please?
You want a beer?
- Yeah.
- Three beers.
- Thank you.
- Here you go.
Is that Zack?
Or am I Zack?
Whoa, ho, ho.
Oh' wow.
- Never gets old, huh?
- The other Zack.
Oh' in my world, nobody calls me "the other Zack,"
now that this guy's not around anymore, huh?
- Get the fuck off of me.
- There can be only one.
- What?
- Highlander, man?
The Kurgan.
Remember?
I'd yell it at you whenever we passed each other in the hallway?
Like it was yesterday' man.
Awesome.
Awesome.
Awesome.
God, you guys have so much to catch up on.
Whoo.
- No.
- I'm gonna let you get to it.
Bitch.
Have you seen that big blowup picture they have of me?
Yeah, it's...
My hair is terrible.
I can't believe I even wore my hair like that.
That's before I knew about styling products' you know.
It makes a big difference in life.
But you live and learn, though' right?
I mean, ten years ago, Pittsburgh, who knew anything about fashion?
Back in the day' our hairstyle, oh...
Hey, stranger.
- Whoa.
Stinky Linky.
- Yeah.
Although it's just Miri now.
- Give me a hug.
- Oh, okay.
- Hi, heh, heh, heh.
- Hi.
Wow.
- How have you been?
- Great, great.
- Yeah?
- You look fantastic.
Wow, that is not something that you would have said to me ten years ago.
- Well' I've grown up.
- Yes.
Yes, you have.
You just look...
Ooh, heh, heh.
- Well' listen to you.
Thank you.
- No, don't thank me, just fuck me.
Roxanne.
Hey.
Someone I like, what are the odds' huh?
Zack Brown, we had four years of Spanish together.
Why does no one recognize me?
- Am I thinner?
Is that it?
- Look at him.
- Who?
- My stupid husband.
No fucking shit.
John Butterfield?
You actually married John Butterfield?
- That's amazing.
- Don't ever get married.
It sucks.
You stop appreciating each other and run out of shit to talk about after the first year.
But look at him now, chatty as fuck.
Flirting up a storm with that cheerleader nimrod Monica Von.
You want me to maybe flirt with you so he can see it, even it up a bit?
I don't wanna get even.
If I was gonna do anything, I'd wanna one-up the asshole.
You can give me a handjob in the girls' locker room.
- Fine, but make it fast.
- Fuck, yeah.
Are you staying in town for a while or...?
Just tonight.
I fly back to L.A. tomorrow.
L.A., wow, Los Angeles.
Gosh' Bobby Long' coming up in the world.
- With Mrs. Long, I bet, huh?
- No, no, no.
No Mrs. Long for me.
- Then can I be honest with you?
- Sure.
Um...
Whew.
I think I need a drink.
Do you need a drink?
Because I need a drink to say this.
- I've got a beer already, so...
- Oh, great, thank you.
I think there's a cigarette butt in there.
Yup.
Sorry about the elbow.
There can be only one.
Can I get a beer, please?
Thank you very much.
Oh' Jesus Christ.
My friend's making an ass of herself hitting on her high school crush.
Oh' God' that's so sad.
It's so Miri, is what it is.
I'm Zack, by the way.
Brandon.
Don't worry, we weren't in the same class or anything.
- Okay.
Lucky you.
- Are you a Monroe-ver?
Well' I went here' let's just leave it at that, I guess.
Do you have one of the large blown-up pictures of your younger self
- hanging around here?
- I do, kind of.
Right there.
Gorgeous.
- Good times.
What do you do?
What brings you here?
I came with somebody who went to school here.
- Really?
- Bobby Long.
No shit.
That's who my friend's hitting on right now.
See right there?
- Really.
- One dressed like Hannah Montana?
In L.A., we call that look "Nickelodeon chic."
- Wait, L. A?
Los Angeles?
- California.
That's awesome, man.
What do you do out there?
- I'm an actor.
- Wow, that's really impressive.
- Thank you, thank you.
- In fucking movies?
"Fucking movies." Pretty much.
Look at you.
What...?
Anything I've seen?
What movies?
Oh' all sorts of movies with all-male casts.
All-male casts.
Like Glengarry Glen Ross?
Like that?
Like Glen and Gary Suck Ross' Meaty Cock and Drop Their Hairy Nuts in His Eager Mouth.
- Is that like a sequel?
- Sort of.
- It's a re-imagining.
- Oh, like The Wiz.
More erotic and with less women.
No women' to be exact.
I apologize in advance if I am out of line here, but are you in gay porn?
- Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?
- I thought you recognized me, that's...
- Oh, okay, I get it.
You're not in my demographic' so I'm not insulted.
- Not really.
Who's your demographic?
- Do you love pussy?
- I do.
- Then not you.
Oh' okay.
I came here tonight hoping to seduce you and bring you back to my apartment and sleep with you to, uh, get back at you, you know, for calling me Stinky Linky all those years ago.
Wow.
That is a weird revenge plot.
- You must be a terrible lay for that.
- What?
No, I'm great.
I mean, I've had enough practice and everything.
That...
Wow, that sounded not good.
I fuck a lot.
That's what I meant to say.
That doesn't sound good either.
Wow.
You're a lot funnier than I remember.
Thank you.
Gosh, you turned out to be such a nice guy.
It just...
You know' it makes it even easier to just...
To just say this.
Would you like to come back to my place and maybe open a bottle of wine and have ourselves a real high school reunion?
- I...
- Hello, Miriam.
Beat it, we're talking.
- I wanted to introduce you to Brandon.
- Salutations.
- Bobby's boyfriend.
- Bobby who?
- Bobby me.
- Bobby Long.
Brandon is the star of such adult fare as...
What was that one called again?
You Better Shut Your Mouth or I'm Gonna Fuck It.
That's right.
I'm surprised I forgot that.
Are you fucking with me?
No, they're fucking with each other.
Oh' my God.
- No.
- What?
Granny Panties?
- Excuse me?
- How can you tell?
This is so crazy.
I was literally just watching you, like, right before we got here.
This is so crazy.
This is you, right?
My name's Granny Panties, and nobody wants to fuck me.
Nothing's whiter than my big gay ass...
Where'd you get that?
Oh' I entered "gay" and "ass," and it was the top hit.
It's had 200,000 views in three hours.
Honey' you are, like...
I'm jealous right now because you're, like, super famous.
Baby, please take our picture.
I get a picture with Granny Panties.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is awesome.
- All right, smile.
Okay' got it.
- Did you get it?
- Oh, thank you very much.
- E-mail me that.
Oh' because he's the worst photographer.
Okay' good.
- You're gay?
- Yeah.
And I'm on the Internet wearing a diaper?
Who knew you'd come to Pittsburgh and meet a celebrity?
I'm gonna binge-drink now until I pass out.
Okay.
She'll be fine.
So you guys suck each other's cocks, huh?
Oh' like crazy.
Okay, that's enough, I think.
I'm embarrassing him.
I love when he's embarrassed.
He's not living out loud, so he gets all like, ooh.
- You are totally in love, aren't you?
- Zachary' we are.
Wow, I...
Oh' God' I just wanna eat him up, yum, yum.
Save some for me' yum, yum, yum.
- I can't keep my hands off him.
- You've had one too many.
Although he does most of the eating in the sack.
In the sack and of the sack.
All right, that's enough.
Look, you've drunk too much.
You do this every time.
You get too Mary for everybody in the room
- and you can't contain yourself.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
And by containing myself, do you mean containing myself in a closet?
In a closet of denial?
Is that...?
No, no, no.
Holy shit, this just got real.
This is exactly why you haven't met my mother.
You don't know how to ease people into this situation.
- You just force your way in every time.
- I thought, maybe for one second in this godforsaken town, I could be myself.
I'm so sorry.
No, you're right' I should just butch up and pretend that I don't love it when you shove your dick in my mouth.
- This is the best night of my life.
- Am I making a spectacle?
- I could make a much bigger scene.
- You really are.
I'm sorry.
Pittsburgh.
Listen up' Monroe-vers.
My name is Brandon St. Randy' and I love Bobby Long.
- Fucking A.
- Is that enough?
Is that enough of a scene?
I could start doing worse than that.
The reason you haven't taken me to your mother's...
Your mother with her makeup and all her drinking, she's in the closet too.
- They fight just like real people.
- I thought I'd be a conduit for you...
Thank you.
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm not.
- Thank you.
- I love you.
- I'll e-mail you.
- Zack, it was so nice to meet you.
And I will be patient with you.
I will be there on your journey.
I will be your Sherpa up the mountain of gayness.
Well' might as well see how many hits Granny Panties is up to, huh?
Did I do that?
Thanks, George.
What kind of evil fucks turn off your power the day...?
No, the night before Thanksgiving?
Who does that?
Can you get an advance on your card?
Fleshlight maxed-out my $200 limit.
Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.
This is bad.
If we don't come up with rent, we're gonna get locked out.
Who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.
Which means by the time we get home, there's no heat either.
Well' I think it's time we put what we always talked about into effect.
- You're gonna have to start hooking.
- You know, you jest, but these are the exact circumstances people find themselves in right before they start having sex for money.
- Yeah.
- Or making porn.
Oh, my God, yeah.
- What?
You got an idea?
We could make a porno.
- Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?
No, that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me?
That's a rad idea.
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend, he said he makes a hundred grand a year because he shoots and distributes his own porno flicks.
If it's so easy, how come everybody doesn't do it?
Because other people have options and dignity, which we do not have, which puts us in an amazingly advantageous position.
Fuck you, I have dignity.
Where?
Is it hidden in your gigantic underpants that are plastered all over the Internet?
Is that where you hide your dignity?
Every woman has a pair of those period panties.
That's, like, a fact.
Okay.
Families.
I bet people don't make porno, because they have families.
But luckily, your parents are dead.
Sorry.
My grandparents are dead.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
So who are we gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone mainstream now.
It's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks in it.
Look at Paris Hilton.
She throat-fucks a guy in night vision, now she's selling fragrances to tweens.
And I'm pretty sure she's legally retarded.
That's for tweens?
Have you seen that Joe Francis guy who made Girls Gone Wild?
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot piece of shit in the world and he has a jet and a fucking island.
Look, there's got to be a less extreme solution to our financial woes here.
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper route.
- I don't have a bike.
- Be a waiter.
No one wants me around their food.
Would you eat food that I gave you?
I would not eat food that you gave me, that's true.
I mean, nobody wants to see us fuck, Zack.
Everybody wants to see anybody fuck.
I hate Rosie O'Donnell, but if someone said' "I got a tape of Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid,"
I'd be like, "Why aren't we watching that right now?"
Because she's famous.
Hello.
So are you.
You're fucking Granny Panties.
My underwear and your ass are famous' we're not.
So who the F would wanna watch us fuck?
- At least 800 people.
- The jerks we went to school with?
- Are you serious?
- Of course.
If you heard that someone we graduated with was in a fucking porno movie, you'd watch it, right?
I'd watch that guy Brandon suck a cock, I just met him.
With this mailing list, we have almost a thousand people that would definitely buy a porno we were in just to be like,
"Hey, I sat next to that guy in Civics.
Look at his fucking dick."
We sell a thousand copies at 20 bucks a pop, bam' we have paid off our bills.
So' what do you think?
- I don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.
Oh' wow, like you've never done that before.
How many guys have you met in a bar, taken home, banged with your mouth and then never talked to again?
That's what we call a stranger.
Dude, I don't one-night mouth-fuck anybody that I pick up in bars.
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in the porno movie for some weird reason.
I guess...
We could fuck.
- Ew.
- Fuck you.
I mean, you're a nice-enough-looking guy and everything...
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're an all-right-enough-looking girl.
- How does that feel?
- Dude' I'm just saying it'd be weird and wrong, you know, like fucking my brother.
Okay, seriously, we're just talking about sex, okay?
It's for a purpose.
It's for getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.
- Wow.
- Just explain to your private beforehand,
"Look' this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash."
- Oh, my God.
- What?
You're just doing this because you've always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?
Yes.
I've gone my whole life pretending that I want nothing to do with you, just hoping one day we'd be in such dire financial straits that I could use it to finally make my move on you.
You're just being sarcastic.
- I am.
See' I was pretending to cry right there.
I guess it's not like it'd be creepy, like if we got way too drunk one night and accidentally fucked, you know?
No.
We'd be going in with the understanding that it's...
A business decision.
Strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.
- Right.
- And by end,
I mean, I'll be waxing your ass.
Fuck you.
I'm not even letting you see my ass.
I've seen your ass and the rest of you naked around a billion times already.
- That goes both ways, buddy.
- You've never seen my dick.
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.
Are you kidding?
That party we went to where you got blasted, and Houls dared you to give yourself head, and we all watched you try for, like, an hour.
Oh' yeah.
Thanks by the way, for fucking letting me do that.
Thank you.
Oh' God.
We really do know too much about each other.
See' and this would really just be one more thing.
I mean, look at us.
It's Thanksgiving and we're huddled around a flaming fucking garbage can like a couple of steno bums.
I mean, this could give us a chance to pay off our debt, pay our bills, get a fucking nicer apartment with heat in it maybe.
What are you doing?
Miriam Linky, will you have sex with me on camera for money?
I will.
A producer?
- Yeah.
- Guy who gets to finance the movie.
- You think I got that kind of money?
We just need that.
What you're about to spend on the flat screen.
Now I can't get my flat screen?
Fuck that.
No, no, no.
With your cut of the profits, you're gonna get two flat screens.
One in your living room, one in your bathroom.
One in the bathroom?
You know, it's always been my dream to watch shit while I shit.
Everyone with an ass loves to watch shit while they shit.
- I'm gonna make that happen for you.
- I don't know, man.
What else the producer do?
- Um, they help with the casting.
- What's casting?
Finding the people to be in the movie.
- I get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.
Like, I can look at a titty, make sure there ain't no moles on there?
- You can look at both titties, man.
- Man.
I've been looking at the same busted titties for the past almost 20 years.
- I'm due for another new titty.
- Please help us.
Please.
Please.
Yes.
Yes.
I love you.
Well' don't mind that smell.
We had some homeless people squatting in here.
You know, they'd void their bowels everywhere but the bathroom.
Anyway, you pick up the poop and you've got yourself a movie studio.
Why don't we shoot in your apartment?
No power.
You wanna pay our electric bill?
- You motherfuckers...
- We'll take it.
Bring it back.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Oh' Jesus.
Oh' Jesus.
Oh' God.
Come on.
Why the fuck do I have to do everything?
Fuckers.
Hey, what is that?
Fucking guys.
This fucking team, man.
They fucking suck.
I'm gonna hatefuck the shit out of you, ref.
- Dude.
- It's cool.
- He's my cousin.
- Hey.
Didn't you used to videotape the varsity basketball games in high school?
Just the away games.
I did it because I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.
Which one?
Whichever one wanted to fuck the guy who taped the varsity games.
- Aw.
- Still know how to work a camera?
- Who cares what the title is?
- The porn I liked when I was a kid, it was always, like, a spoof of a popular movie, you know?
Like, um, Edward Penishands.
Okay, so we need a mildly clever, vaguely dirty title, that sounds like a real movie
- and sums up what you're gonna see.
- Correct.
An American Werewolf in Brenda?
Fuckback Mountain?
- Too soon?
A Cock-in-Lips Now?
- Next.
Cradle the balls.
Work the shaft.
Jerk my come-crayon and let me color you white.
I need cock and I need it now.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
It's "puss" as in pussy.
Oh' because I was like' who would wanna fuck puss?
I want to slam my ham in your can, woman.
Scene.
- This guy is amazing.
- This guy's great-looking too.
I wanna fuck him.
Hi, my name's Delaney and I'm a producer.
I really don't know what it means.
I'm gonna be honest' this is my first time.
You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna touch you or nothing like that.
- All right.
- I have a wife, you know.
We're happy.
I mean, not happy' but it's cool, you know.
Just so you know, there will be some fucking.
- We'll talk about that if you get the part.
- Okay.
I mean, not...
We won't be fucking, there'll be fucking in the movie.
Like I said' I got a wife.
She don't play that shit.
- She is a crazy bitch.
- Yep.
It's my job as the producer to see what you got.
So if that makes you uncomfortable in any way, you don't have to show me anything you don't wanna show me, because...
I love the movies.
- Lawrence of a Labia.
- No.
- Oh, come on.
- Dawn of the Dick.
Yeah, but how are zombies doing it at all sexy?
I want to eat your brain and your ass.
- Dude.
- Sci-fi.
Yeah.
Close Encounters With a Turd From Behind.
- I don't know what that means.
- Just asses.
Fucking deep in asses.
What?
We're making a porno and we just need to know what you would be or would not be interested in doing.
If anything.
- No anal.
- Oh, definitely no anal.
Anal and hugging.
I don't do ass stuff.
- Anal.
- Ah, fuck.
- Oh, wait, oral.
I like anal.
- Yay.
Okay, well, so, uh, do you have any special skills?
Special skills?
I can get a boner really quick and it sticks straight up.
- Is that really a special skill?
- I think.
- Can you show us what you mean?
- Sure.
Oh' that is special.
Yeah, you're hired, Mr...
- Who are you again?
- Lester.
Lester "The Molester" Cockinshtuff.
- No.
- Wow.
That is the best porn name I've ever heard' man.
I can have a porn name?
- Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.
Are you Granny Panties?
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The panties are actually in the house.
- I'll get them.
- Whoa.
The Wrath of Cunt.
- We never made a Star Sex 1.
I guess we can lose Star Sex 3:
The Search for Cock, then.
- Cocunt.
- What's that?
It's Cocoon with a cunt.
So Delaney tells us you have a special talent of some sort.
I don't know if I'd call it a special talent, but it's a little something I picked up doing bachelor parties.
It would probably be easier if I just showed you.
- Great.
- The floor is yours.
So a movie, huh?
That could be fun.
Holy fuck.
Her name's Bubbles.
- Invasion of the Potty-Snatchers?
- That's like MAD Magazine stupid.
Well' fuck you' okay?
You try to think of a good sci-fi porno title.
It's hard.
There's gotta be one we haven't thought of that would say it all' not be ridiculously filthy and off-putting, and still have instant recognition with our audience.
- I got it.
- I got it.
- Star Whores.
- Yeah.
It's funny' right?
See' we figured this opens us up to an even bigger sales market beyond the people we went to school with.
People who like comics and sci-fi.
Comics?
Like "Ziggy"?
"Ziggy"?
Is that even in fucking papers anymore?
No, man.
Fuck you. "Ziggy" is a comic' right next to "Family Circus."
No, like Spider-Man and shit, you know?
There's always a shitload of Star Wars nerds at those comic-book shows.
So we sell them a Princess Leia they can really fucking jerk off to.
- That'd be me, Princess Lay-Her.
- Who am I playing?
You' my friend, are the lead role of Lubed Guy-Baller.
Man' he's gonna be balling dudes?
I thought you said this was boys on girls.
If I have to fuck a guy' okay, but I'd rather fuck a girl.
What's wrong with you, boy?
- We'll change the name to Sky-Baller.
- Sky-Baller.
I will be Hung So-low.
Delaney, my friend, you are On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
Man' I can't be in no porno.
My wife will kill me.
Hump me, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
You're my only hump.
On the other hand, fuck my wife.
Unfortunately, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over does not have any sex in the movie but the droids do, l-CUP and R2-T-Bag.
I robot.
And Stacey over here is gonna play Darth Vibrator.
- I'm the bad guy?
- She's not a guy, Zack.
I know that because I'm not a fucking idiot.
In our movie, Darth Vibrator is a bad girl who wants to fuck the galaxy, literally' and it's up to Lubed and Hung to stop her with their cocks.
- You and me get to have sex, then?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- I know.
Isn't that awesome?
Hold up, hold up.
So who's all having sex with who in this movie?
As of last night, I was having sex with Zack.
What?
Han Solo ain't never had no sex with Princess Leia in the Star Wars.
Guys' this isn't a literal adaptation here.
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.
Kind of like The Wiz or like a parody.
With lots of anal.
- Cool.
- I know, isn't that awesome?
I have a question, do Princess Lay-Her and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?
Uh, no, because they're brother and sister, and according to Miri' brothers and sisters can't fuck.
But you said, that this wasn't a literal translation, so that means Lester's character could have sex with Miri's character.
Because I would love to fucking eat her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.
Dream on, pal, it's never gonna happen, okay?
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See' she's fine...
Wait, what?
Yep.
I mean, everyone else is having sex with more than one person in this movie all of a sudden, so I think it's' you know' not fair if I'm only fucking you.
Guys, read amongst yourselves, okay?
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Look, Miri, we got plenty of sex going on in this thing, you don't have to do that.
Zack, it's fine.
I mean I have slept with way worse-looking guys than Lester.
I just wanna do my part for the movie like everyone else.
You're having sex in the movie, you don't need to fuck someone else.
- You're good.
- I'm only fucking you' though.
So don't we need to vary it up to keep it fair?
Fair for...?
I don't...
What?
Fair for who?
What are these, blood diamonds we're talking about?
Fair for everyone else who is fucking more than one person, a.k.a. you' in the movie.
- I mean, fine...
- All right.
I mean, if you don't care...
I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
Fuck.
I don't give a shit.
Like you said, you know, you've fucked bigger idiots than Lester.
Holy shit.
Are we really gonna shoot this in outer space?
Maybe not bigger idiots.
Thank you.
- Cut.
All right, guys, that's it.
- Yeah.
Make sure you leave your costume so we know they're here for tomorrow.
Mostly, everybody, thank you so much for helping us get ready' you know.
Cleaning this place out, building the sets, sewing the costumes, it's just...
I mean, it's really amazing.
Thank you.
Seriously, thanks.
But this is just the beginning, guys.
If Star Whores works, and it will' we are set up for sequels galore.
The Empire Strikes Ass.
- Return of the Brown-Eye.
- The Phantom Man-Ass.
And Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter.
- Okay.
- Revenge of the Shit.
- You got it?
- Yeah, no, we got it.
Ew.
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.
- We'll talk about that one.
We're gonna have a lot of fun' but more importantly, we're gonna make a lot of fucking money' okay?
- Yeah.
- So get ready for greatness, people.
Tomorrow we start principal photography.
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
- All right, good night, you guys.
- We got a movie.
- What?
- Nothing.
I think someone should acknowledge how insane and amazing this is
- and it's all because of you.
- I don't know.
It's just a porno.
You know what I mean.
You've really come into your own.
Shut the fuck up.
So speaking of coming into things' ready for tomorrow?
Twenty years' we're finally gonna know what it's like to have sex with each other.
You say that like you've been wondering what it'd be like to sleep with me for a while now.
Why the fuck do you think I started hanging out with you?
I knew it.
Here, help.
Let's just promise that it's not gonna change anything between us, okay?
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Some guys can't keep sex in perspective.
If anyone's gotta keep this in perspective, it's you, okay?
I don't want you getting all mushy and gooey on me after I give you the best orgasm you've ever had.
Oh' like you know what you're doing down there at all.
I actually don't.
Where's the clitoris?
Is it in your ass?
Just, you know, make sure you kind of whoop it up and act like I'm a stud who knows what he's doing' okay?
Just be a pal.
Oh' dude, I am gonna Meryl Streep the fuck out of this tomorrow, you watch.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
No.
Really, thank you.
For everything.
You're welcome.
Less than 12 hours and we make Monroeville history.
- I really hope nothing goes wrong.
- It's a movie.
What could go wrong?
What are you doing?
What's up?
- What the fuck?
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait.
- Wait.
- Stop.
Stop.
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck is going on?
Condos is what's going on, as soon as this shit-hole's demo'd.
No, you gotta stop it right now.
We rented this place for a month from Mr. Jenkins.
Sounds like your Mr. Jenkins was full of shit.
Luxury Homesteads bought this place a month ago.
I'm gonna kill that lying old fuck.
You're gonna have to go Florida, that's where he moved.
We've got thousands of dollars of equipment in there.
- Please.
- If you wanna sift through this rubble when we're done, be my guest.
Hey, get that fucking beam down.
This is the last thing you wanna hear.
If you don't get an advance,
I don't think we're gonna keep a roof over our heads.
I got an advance already.
It went into all the costumes.
- So all our money's gone?
- All your money?
Never mind what my wife's gonna do when there ain't no new snow tires, or when she sees I charged a video camera.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this' man.
I just wanted to see some free titties.
That's all.
But there's no such thing as free titties' is there, Zack?
- Is there?
- Fuck this noise.
Why don't we get another camera, and shoot something else?
Where are we gonna do that?
Got another sound stage?
Sound stage?
We had a shit-covered garage we turned into a sound stage.
We find someplace new and we do it again.
How?
Okay, I'm broke, man.
No, make that' I was broke.
Now I am really tapped out.
I have to get another job to pay Delaney back.
So please tell me, how can I afford to start over?
- What can I get you?
- Yeah, can I get a, uh...?
Too fucking late.
Cappuccino, 3.50.
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
I mean, I'm a total loser in every single other aspect of my life.
What made me think I could do something as simple as filming people fucking?
We have no money left, nowhere to shoot, no sets, we have no fucking cameras.
Here.
It's time I go back to my regular life where I am a quiet fuckup who doesn't cost anybody any money and knows his goddamn position behind this fucking counter making cappuccinos for this fucking guy.
Oh' yeah.
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
Oh' yeah.
Yeah.
Fuck, yes.
Zack.
You sneaky Indian motherfucker.
I tell you, yes.
Swallow My Cockuccino.
- What?
- That's it.
That's the movie.
Why didn't I think of it before?
We don't need sets or a stage.
Look at all this production value, waiting to have balls on it.
Hold up.
You wanna shoot a dirty movie here, where we work?
Yes.
Fuck, yes, I do.
You know how many stories I have from working here?
How many times I've been laid right there after hours?
You've never gotten laid here after hours.
I know.
Thank you for reminding me.
But I always wish I had, and that's what porno is.
It's fantasy.
It's taking the normal and making it abnormal by fucking it.
Don't do that.
The little dog don't like that.
How did you get a camera?
By being a terrible, untrustworthy employee, that's how.
Give me today, I'll bang out a script.
Meet me back here after closing.
We're gonna launch arching ropes of jism all over this motherfucker.
Peace.
I like that guy but if he tries to fuck that little dog tonight for real,
I'm calling the Humane Society.
It's called Bean-N-Gone, so get the fuck out of here.
Hey, Barry.
Stand by, Stace' picture's up.
- Okay.
Roll tape.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 12, Take 1.
And action.
I'd like a double espresso so I can stay up all night because I'm in the mood to fuck.
Well' I am a whore-ista, so I love to fuck.
Would you like to fuck me?
Holy fuck.
You mean, after you're done with your shift?
I mean during my shift.
- Sorry.
- Keep going, keep going.
With your shaft.
Let us fuck.
Cue music.
Okay, open up to camera, guys.
Let us see it.
More tongue.
Little less tongue.
Oh' that was good.
Cue effects.
Oh' yeah, like that.
Oh' yeah.
See' I told you it would work.
Didn't I tell you?
It looks amazing.
It's incredible.
Oh' the beans hurt.
Easy.
- Move in for coverage.
- Nice.
That's why we got him.
- Nice.
I'm impressed.
- Get in there, Deacon.
- Come on.
- Like that?
Like that.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
- Pull out a bit, actually.
- That's hot.
No, not you, Lester.
Put it back in.
Kiss the muscle.
- I kiss the muscle.
- You kiss the muscle.
- Can he slap her ass a little?
- Don't be a fucking pervert, dude.
- Stir, come on.
Stir.
- Yeah, stir it.
Stir it, baby.
Hey.
- Holy.
- Shit.
Are you guys still open?
No.
We close at 9.
I need coffee so I'm drive home.
- Okay.
Yeah.
- Thank you.
That's a cute kitty.
Okay.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You guys see the game?
I was at it.
Fucking Roethlisberger, the quarterback, was all fucking'
"Hug it' chug it, football.
All night." Heh-heh.
Okay, pal' here you go.
On the house.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Have a good one.
- Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- I said, have a good one.
Oh.
- Okay.
Keep moving.
- You and your little dog.
Go Steelers.
Action.
Oh' yeah.
Yeah, yeah, like that.
Oh' fuck it' chuck it' football.
Oh' yeah.
Oh' God' this is good.
You take it.
You take it.
Take it, Barry.
Oh, take it.
Take it, Barry.
Take it.
I'm disturbed at how turned on I am by this.
- Shit, dude' it's almost 6.
- Oh, fuck.
Okay, that's a wrap, everybody, yeah.
Let's give a hand to our hotties with the bodies from last night.
Stacey, Lester, Bubbles, Barry' whoo.
Yeah.
- Nice.
Okay, when we come back tonight, we finish up the venti-vulva scene' and then we get into me and Miri's stuff.
Again' amazing first night, everybody.
Thank you so much.
Let us fuck.
- Hey' how'd it look?
- How do you think it looked?
It looked like shit going into other shit, in focus.
What an artist.
That was Kurosawa's motto. "Shit going into other shit."
Oh' man, I can't believe you gotta work now.
It's okay.
You know, honestly, I don't think I could sleep.
- I'm pretty, like, pumped up right now.
- Right?
It was amazing.
It was awesome.
I think the cast and crew had a good time.
- We were getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.
I just wanna keep shooting people boning all day.
I don't think I've ever met the ambitious Zack Brown before.
- Well' I'm trying to pay the bills, so...
- It's not a bad thing.
I think it looks good on you.
Come on, hurry.
Come on, come on' come on.
Wait a minute.
- You guys never did it before?
- It's fine.
You know, we talked about it and it's just for the movie.
We're friends' you know' we're just friends.
And we will always just be just friends, so...
Listen' I have some extra lube from last night.
I understand it's kind of hard getting wet when everyone's watching.
At least it was for Barry.
- I don't know if I am gonna need it.
- Really?
Yeah, I think I'm just excited.
Uh-huh.
At the idea of people watching' not because of Zack.
Oh' God.
Zack could never have that effect on me in a million years.
- Hello, Miriam.
- Oh, hey.
Wow.
- Your face.
- Yeah.
Weird, huh?
I don't think I've seen your face since senior year.
I think I made a mistake.
I did it for you so you wouldn't get road rash during our scene, but I should have asked first' I look like a fucking beluga whale.
I think I'll be going now.
Okay.
All I keep thinking is we should've done a trial run at home last week or something.
- Oh, my God.
Right?
- I know.
- You're still cool to do it, though, right?
- Yeah, um.
Totally.
Are you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I'm, uh...
- Honestly, I'm a little nervous, I guess.
- You are?
- It's kind of a big deal.
- It is?
Yeah, you know, it's our first time together since our auspicious debut on viral video.
Oh' yeah.
That's a fuckload of pressure for a director.
As a director, please.
What about the anxiety I'm feeling as an actress?
- Did I pick the right project?
- Yeah.
What about this follow-up?
Julia Roberts followed Pretty Waman with Sleeping With the Enemy.
I'm following Granny Panties with Swallow My Cockuccino.
Only difference is this movie's about cock-sucking and her movie just sucked cock, period.
- The only difference, yeah.
- The end was pretty rad.
I liked that.
- When she kills him.
- With a gun.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- She calls the cops first.
- She calls it in first.
- It was so awesome.
- Awesome, yeah.
So I guess we should do this.
I think we should probably wait just until I lose another 20 or 30 pounds.
Stop it.
You look good.
Thanks.
So, what about me?
How do I look?
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful, so I guess it's not a big deal, but you look amazing.
- Okay.
Let's go make a porno.
- Okay.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 8, Take 1.
Come here.
- I'm over...?
All right, settle.
Action.
Who could it be?
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm a delivery man and I have some cream for you.
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.
I work out.
So do you want me to give you your cream now?
I've been waiting for it all day.
- Fuck.
Come on.
- Oops.
Keep going.
I spilled my cream.
Do you mind?
I don't mind.
Especially if you spill it on my face.
Let us fuck.
- Fix my shirt.
Think I should?
- Okay.
Let me see them titties.
Actually, you know what?
Sorry, I don't think we should show them.
- What?
- We shouldn't show your breasts.
- Aren't you gonna take your shirt off?
- I'm just gonna open it.
You're not gonna take it off?
Why not?
My tits are bigger than yours.
I don't wanna show that.
She's not gonna show her tits?
I showed my cock and my asshole.
- Okay, I'll do your pants.
- Back and forth. okay.
- Holy shit.
- Where's that delivery?
I can't believe this.
I was delivering cream, and look what's happening.
- Jesus, what is that, a rumba?
- What's a rumba?
That awkward movement.
- Should I take your underpants off?
- Yeah, take them off.
What the fuck?
How does this work?
They're just like...
I'll do it.
- I'll do mine, you just...
You do yours.
- I'll do my pants.
Granny panties.
Just get on with it already.
I'm gonna fuck you with my pecker.
Dude, that's really dirty.
- That's too dirty?
- That offends me.
- Penis?
- Fine.
- I'm gonna fuck you with my penis.
- I can't wait.
For my penis.
Be careful, Miri.
Okay, there we go.
Just keep rolling, keep rolling.
- I'll walk forward.
- Fucking cream is coming.
This is the worst porno I've ever seen.
Get over here, delivery man.
- Let's fuck on these beans.
- You okay?
- Yup.
Okay' all right.
- Just leave them.
Just leave them.
- They're really distracting.
- You should leave them.
- You gotta get your...
There you go.
- Okay' okay.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.
This okay?
Okay.
Okay, uh.
- We'll start kissing on three' okay?
- Okay.
One, two, three.
Go.
I'm ready.
- I'm ready.
- Okay.
Deacon.
- Deacon.
Deacon.
- What?
Did you see Lost this week, man?
I missed it.
What happened?
They're on the island, off the island.
Who can follow that?
I think they're in hell.
Would you all shut the motherfuck up?
I want you to come.
- I want you to come with me.
- Okay.
Oh' God.
Oh' God.
Cut.
That's it?
It's over?
Ain't he supposed to come on her titties?
Well' it wasn't what we'd shot-listed' but that was nice.
- It was so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack.
Thanks, Lester, uh.
It wasn't just me, though, guys.
Give it up for my radiant costar here, Miri.
Nice.
- Um, show's over in here.
Let's move out' start lighting the next scene.
- All right.
- Let's do it.
You looked so beautiful.
- Thanks.
I thought they were gonna be fucking hard.
- It was pretty.
- Pretty don't sell.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
You good, Mir?
You need anything?
I'm just gonna take a minute, okay?
Okay, uh.
I'll just be out there.
Yeah.
- That was fun.
- Yeah, fun.
"Fun." You fucking douche.
Wow.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You working on a rewrite?
- Yeah, just for tonight's scene.
- I'm ready to go when you are, though.
- Okay.
You know, before we go, I...
I'm thinking that, uh, it's a good idea if we talk about what happened last night.
- Oh.
- I mean, we don't have to' but I think...
Okay, yeah, uh.
I kind of dropped the ball on that, I guess, huh?
- No, no.
It's...
- To be honest, it was...
You know, I didn't realize how weird it would be for me.
Weird?
Like...
Weird how?
Acting and directing at the same time.
It's a lot to process, you know.
For the first time' I thought my balls didn't have enough hair on them.
That's not what I meant.
I know what you meant.
How you feeling about it?
I guess, um...
I feel like...
Like we...
- Holy fuck.
- The power's on.
Did you do this?
How did this happen?
I burned the bills.
How could we have done that?
- The water.
- The water.
Come on, come on' come on.
Yeah!
- We can shower in our home again.
- We are liquid.
Greetings.
Have you heard the good news about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?
Oh' my God, did you guys do this?
We got tired of you taking showers at our places all the time.
So we took up a collection amongst ourselves.
And chipped away at your mountain of debt.
You guys paid off our massive utilities bills?
- How did you afford that?
- I stole my old lady's bingo winnings.
And Mistress Bubbles did a bachelor party tonight at which yours truly was a guest star, thank you very much.
- Oh.
- Whoa.
Don't get too excited.
We didn't pay off your whole bill.
Just a month of each.
They agreed to turn everything back on?
At 9 at night?
How does that work?
Stacey knows somebody that works at Power and Light.
- You guys...
- This is amazing.
You didn't have to do this.
You didn't have to put us in your movie.
- Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.
- Or put us in your movie either.
- We said that already.
Guys, honestly, I don't know what to say.
You can start by saying we can take tonight off so we can have our wrap party right now.
Guys, we're not wrapped.
We still have four days of shooting left.
Excuse me.
In my "producorial" capacity,
I'm shutting the movie down for a night so we can get a little silly.
Go' go' go.
- Yes.
- Yes.
You all drink.
Was it just amazing with him, after all those years of not knowing?
It was, um, weird.
- But good.
- My scene with Zack's tomorrow.
You don't say.
But I'm a little nervous.
I was thinking about trying to get with him tonight.
- Really?
- I mean, if you don't mind.
You are just friends and all' so I didn't think it would be a biggie.
- It wouldn't be a biggie, would it?
- No.
No, no.
It's not a biggie.
What?
No.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Stacey' I'm not married to the guy, so...
I don't know.
You guys just looked kind of intimate last night.
- We did?
- Yeah.
Well' we're just better actors than I thought, I think, so you know what?
If you wanna get with him' you should just go ask him.
- He'd be really excited to hear that.
- Yeah?
For real, you don't mind?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
All the quarters are on the ground.
Hey, Stace.
- Hey' Zack.
Come on, are you guys playing or what?
Well' I'm bummed, but I totally get it.
It's no problem to work with Lester again.
He has a nice cock.
Well' you're a trouper, Stace.
Oh' but if I start making weird faces or anything during the scene' it's just because I've been constipated all day.
Oh' shit' uh.
We don't have to shoot the scene tonight.
No, I want to.
Anal's great for when you're constipated.
It totally loosens you up.
I use ex-lax' but good to know.
Okay, I never thought I would have that conversation.
So are we starting with Lester and Stacey tonight?
We were supposed to start with Lester and Miri.
I know.
She...
We're not gonna do that.
I don't think Miri's gonna do that.
Hey.
So where are we shooting this?
Over here?
- What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.
Our scene's tonight, right?
Can I talk to you for a minute in the back?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
What do you want me to shoot here?
Start with the close-ups of Lester and Stacey.
Give me a second, man.
What an artist.
Okay, uh.
Did I do something wrong to you?
No.
Then why are you here?
I'm here for the same reason you're here.
To make the movie.
Okay, just, like' for your own personal information, you're acting really weird right now.
I'm acting weird?
I think you're acting weird right now.
Oh' I'm acting...
How exactly am I acting weird?
You've been trying to keep me from fucking anybody but you since we started this thing.
Maybe I was thinking about your feelings.
Were you thinking of my feelings when you were banging Stacey?
Because that'd be really sad for Stacey.
She told me that you told her that that was okay.
I told her that it was okay to ask you.
Holy shit.
I get it.
I fucking get it.
It was a test.
That whole thing was a fucking test, is that it?
If it was, how do you think you did?
We had a discussion, Miri.
We had...
Actually, we had many discussions about how it was just sex
- and how we wouldn't let it get weird.
- I'm not acting weird.
You're acting like a jealous girlfriend is what the fuck you're acting like.
- I am not your girlfriend.
- I know that.
You're not my boyfriend, so why are we having this conversation right now?
Because you're about to fuck Lester to spite me, it seems like.
Did you fuck Stacey to spite me?
No.
You fucked her like you fucked every other bitch and never gave a shit how I felt about it.
- Well' that was before.
- Before what?
Look, don't fucking pretend that the other night, you and me, right there, that that didn't mean anything to you, that you didn't feel it too.
Oh.
You're not getting all gooey on me here, are you, Zack?
You know what?
If you were any other bitch I didn't give a rat's ass about,
I would tell you to go fuck yourself right now because I fucking hate this game-playing shit.
But you, you mean more to me than that' so I'm just gonna lay this out on front street.
I know you felt something big, something real the other night when we were together because I felt it too.
We tried to fuck and instead, we wound up making love.
So if this is what you need to hear in order to keep you from fucking Lester, if this is what you need, then fine.
Here it is, I'm gonna say it.
I love you, Miri.
Happy?
Oh' Jesus.
You better get ahold of yourself, Zack, because we just fucked.
Okay.
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?
But you did.
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.
Wait...
All right, don't forget I'm down here.
Watch that pullout, huh?
Yeah.
Mmm.
This is some damn good coffee.
- Where you going?
- Getting the fuck out of here.
We gotta finish this movie.
Yo!
You believe this shit?
Do you believe this shit?
What the fuck just happened in there?
I'll tell you what just happened in there.
That chick frosted me like I was a fucking cake.
Zack.
Okay, seriously' get a picture of me right now.
I'm hunting humans.
- Dude' check it out.
Ooh.
- Oh, shit.
Seriously, let's shoot the shit out of this bitch.
- Where you aiming at?
- Cock shots?
Cock shots.
We shot you in the balls, cunt nugget.
Well' it's my job to get shot in the balls, so... oh, they're gone.
Excuse me.
Didn't you used to work at the Bean-N-Gone in Monroeville?
I sure as shit hope this pays better, I tell you.
So why don't they just shoot you with a puck?
What do you mean?
I mean, what does paintball got to do with hockey?
Nothing, I guess.
- So ain't no prizes or...?
- No, no.
So, what are they paying $5 for?
To shoot a Broad Street Bully in the balls.
White people are fucked up.
Yup' they sure are.
It's a living.
You've been getting the checks I've been sending?
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Probably didn't save you from a brutal tongue-lashing, though, huh?
You know, the wife never found out about the camera, because I paid off the bills.
How did you manage that?
- Because now I'm Oprah rich.
- No way.
- The post office fucking settled?
- Hundred-sixty large' son.
- Nice, man.
Congratulations.
- A beautiful day, thank you very much.
I thought you made that whole thing up.
No, no.
It was very real.
You can believe it.
Even though she's spending all of it.
Well' since you ain't gonna ask me, I'll just go ahead and tell you.
- No, I have not seen Miri.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.
Oh' I suppose you weren't gonna ask about your movie, neither?
Look, that's why I came down here.
I need you to come take a look at it.
- I'm not interested.
Sorry.
- You'd better get interested
- because you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?
The story doesn't make sense.
- The story?
- The story doesn't make sense.
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?
It's a movie, dog, and a movie's gotta have an ending, which we don't have at the moment.
Come shot, credits.
There's your fucking ending.
Do me this favor, okay?
When you're done getting your nuts blown off' come back to humble Monroeville to my crib for a couple hours' check out the flick, you tell me what's missing.
No.
I'll tell you what, you do that, you don't owe me shit no more.
- Really?
- Really.
- Is your wife home?
- Yes.
- Maybe I should leave the pads on.
- You got some extra ones?
Hey, honey.
Where the fuck you been?
And who in the fuck is this now?
Would you calm down, woman?
Goddamn.
You already left one white boy down in my basement while you off gallivanting and shit.
What if this motherfucker
- was all grabby on me?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
Oh' what in the fuck is that supposed to mean?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
- White boys love me.
White boy.
- I said, white boy.
- Yeah?
You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?
- Should I say yes?
- Just say yes.
Yeah.
- Why don't you, uh, head downstairs?
- Oh, okay.
It's just through this hallway.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
What the fuck you looking at?
Why you gotta be yelling at me in front of my director?
- Oh, he's a director?
- Yeah.
I didn't know that.
Shit, he's a director.
Well' why don't he direct my ass to a new husband?
How about that shit?
- That's the bedroom.
- Keep talking, maybe he will.
Oh' don't nobody want them saggy-ass balls!
Saggy balls?
Look at these sagging-ass titties you got around here.
- You could tie these together.
- Motherfucker, we match.
Oh' shit.
Where's my paintball gun at?
Look at you, editor and DP.
You got your shit covered, man.
Please, don't ever say "shit-covered" to me again.
Roll the film for the man, please, so we can see what he thinks.
Just jump through it.
I ain't got all night.
The bitch is on me.
"Nigga Rich Productions." Classy.
- Yeah, DreamWorks was taken.
- Was it?
Plus' it sounds like an underground gay fuck club.
"I met a guy at DreamWorks." Yeah.
All right, so we got Lester and Stacey fucking.
Then we got Barry and Bubbles fucking.
And then this boring bullshit.
Okay, just, uh, go to the next scene, would you?
Uh...
- What next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?
We never shot it.
- Why not?
- Because after you left that night,
Miri came out of the backroom and said she couldn't do it.
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped?
So...
- Wait, so Miri...
- Never fucked nobody.
Just you.
Now, I wonder why she did that.
- Hm.
- Hm.
You see, there was a time when I was just a bitter old fuck making coffees, and Stacey was just a lap dancer and Barry and Bubbles didn't know each other and this fool here, hell, I don't even know what he was.
- A white supremacist.
- Man' fuck you.
Then two people come along and showed us something we didn't know existed.
A world of possibilities where plain old people just like us could do something special.
Even if it's something as simple as filming people fucking.
Sometimes we just need someone to show us something we can't see for ourselves
and then we're changed forever.
So as you can see' our movie ain't got no ending.
Every movie needs an ending' don't it?
Peace.
Delaney, you're a slick cupid motherfucker.
Ain't love grand?
Why the fuck is this white boy running through my goddamn house?
Sometimes.
Miri.
- Miri.
- Zack?
Miri.
I'm sorry.
- Get out.
- Close the door.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over...
- Just close the fucking door' Zack.
I never slept with Stacey that night, okay?
I swear to God.
When we got into my room, you know what we did?
We talked about you, and us and how things were different and how I was too much of a fucking pussy to just tell you how I felt about you.
And I know...
I know that that's only because of all the stupid shit we said about how we wouldn't let sex change us, but it did.
It changed me.
That has to be love, right?
It has to be love and just so you know, I can't go back to being just friends anymore,
- because I just can't.
- Good.
And I think...
I think that you feel the same way.
Because that night after I left, you didn't fuck Lester.
What's up, Zack?
You know what?
I don't care that you're fucking Lester, okay?
How's that?
- Oh, shit.
- I don't wanna be with anyone but you.
So I will wait forever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life because I love you, and I have for as long as I can remember.
And I would rather die than be without you, Miriam Linky.
Miri's last name is Linky?
You're gonna fuck a guy who doesn't know your last name?
Or that you beat up Carl Roth in the sixth grade?
I know that.
Or what your senior prom dress would've looked like had we gone but we decided not to, and we got drunk alone instead.
Or that you washed your hair in the toilet.
We're not fucking' Zack.
Or that you're not fucking Zack...
What?
I asked her to fuck me.
She wouldn't do it.
I even tried to talk her into giving me the fucking Dutch rudder.
Shot me down on that too.
- And a Dutch rudder is?
- Don't know what a Dutch rudder...?
All right, you grab your dick, then you have someone else work your arm.
Here, let me show you.
All right, grab my arm.
I'm grabbing my dick, you're grabbing my arm.
Now work it.
Work my arm.
See that shit?
Work it up and down.
It's like someone else is jerking you off.
Okay.
There's the double Dutch rudder, which' I grab my dick, you grab your dick, you work my arm, I work your arm' same time.
It's like jerking off together but not gay.
We're not touching dicks, each other's dicks anyway.
I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.
It feels good, sir.
Try me, come on.
Sorry to change the subject on you, Lester, but if you're not fucking Miri, why is your dick out right now?
Because I live here now, and I like to be naked.
- What?
- When you moved out, she couldn't afford to pay her rent by herself, so I moved in to help.
But you just came out of her room.
That's my room now.
She moved in your old room.
Wait, wait, wait.
She changed rooms?
Yeah, she said she did it because she missed the smell of you or some shit.
I don't smell anything.
But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.
- Night, Zack.
- Night.
Do you?
Then why are you crying?
Because I missed you so much.
Me too.
I love you.
- I love you, I love you.
- I love you.
I don't mean to alarm you but I think I just jerked off Lester a little bit.
- The Dutch rudder?
- Yeah, it's ingenious, right?
If you ask me nicely, I will Dutch-rudder you the rest of our lives.
Good.
I'm getting tired of fucking the Fleshlight.
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.
- What'd it feel like?
- Like fucking a flashlight.
Wrong room.
- Oh, God.
That's gross.
Let us fuck.
Hello.
Welcome to Nigga Rich Productions' home of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, the production house for the couple looking to put a little spice in their sex life.
- Shall we take a look around?
- Fuck me so hard.
Oh, God.
First, you'll meet for a consultation with one of our romance-ologists, who'll coach you through that initial awkward stage before you're camera-ready.
So we will start off with some erotic massage and some...
Dude.
Some light petting.
That sounds good.
Are you guys sure you don't wanna do some, uh, butt-sack work too?
- Uh, let's move on' shall we?
- Why?
From their break-out hit, Swallow My Cockuccino, to the multi-million selling Swallow My Cockuccino II and the award-winning Star Whores saga, including Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter,
Zack and Miri have proven time and again that they know how to shoot hot sex.
As an actor, I've sometimes brought my work home with me inappropriately.
When you're telling your real-life lover in the bedroom' to' you know' bend over while you cake your hand in K-Y, it is a sign that the romance is dead, I think.
Then we turned to the professionals at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
Oh' my God, they totally saved our civil union.
They filmed what was inside of us and not what was coming out of us necessarily.
It helped me see his asshole as not just a come dumpster, but a sign of his beauty' his flower.
It became a, uh, gorgeous orchid.
Orchids grow in sort of the filthiest conditions.
That's what his asshole became to me.
This beautiful flower amidst shit.
- Honey, they get the metaphor.
- I don't think they do.
Let's just say, thank you to Zack and Miri.
It's helped us out, it's helped our friends.
Enrique?
Park?
Park?
Enrique?
Can we get a little love for Zack and Miri?
They don't even know what's going on, they're so pilled up.
But don't take his word for it.
Just ask our co-founders.
- Hi.
I'm Miri Linky Brown.
- I'm Zack Linky Brown.
Here at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, we're dedicated
- to committing your love...
- Or lust.
- to high-end, quality production digital video.
A forever keepsake of your passion.
That's right, Miri.
Why set up a camera at the end of your bed and settle for one unflattering angle, when you could let the professionals dazzle and delight your senses with an array of shots so masterfully rendered you'll swear Martin Scorsese snuck into your room
and caught you fucking?
And remember' we're not just the presidents of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
We're also clients.
Call now to set up your appointment
Way to fuck, Zack.

[HORN HONKING]
MAN:
You little motherfucker!
Get up' Zack.
Come on, I don't wanna be late for work.
MIRI:
Ahh!
Get out!
- Jesus, fuck!
Close the door if you're gonna take a shit.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over, it was not closed.
- Close the door' Zack!
- Okay, okay.
MIRI:
God.
- Fine.
- What's that thing?
- It's a hand warmer.
[SIGHS]
We're going now.
- You smell that?
Is that the car?
Fuck.
- Oh, goddamn it.
- What?
What?
- Oh, it's wedged in my taint.
- What is?
- It got wedged in my taint.
- What?
- It's stuck under my balls.
- It's between my balls and my leg.
- What's happening?
- Please, pull over.
Pull the fuck over!
- All right, all right!
Jesus, all right!
ZACK:
It's about to move up to my ass.
MIRI:
What?
ZACK:
The movement makes it hotter.
It's tucked under them.
It's stuck under them.
[GRUNTING]
Oh' fuck.
I think I burned my ball hair off.
[LAUGHING]
It's not funny.
Can you help me pick out an outfit for tonight?
I'm working till 6.
- Well' I can try stuff on at the store.
- The store?
No, how about instead, you get a friend?
But you are my friend.
I mean a girl friend, jeez.
[JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
Mr. Delaney, can you work for me tomorrow?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
Then you must come in the next day, I tell you.
- It's Black Friday.
- Black Friday?
It's the biggest mall-shopping day of the year.
And since the mall is just up the street, I would like you to come out and work.
- On Black Friday.
- Oh, yeah.
All right, you want me to work on Moolie Monday too?
- I'm sorry?
- How about Nigga Tuesday?
- Nigga Tuesday?
Is this a new holiday?
- You come to a brother and tell him he gotta work on Black Friday.
You got any idea how racist that sounds?
Telling me to work.
What, you think you own me?
- I never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?
You thought,
"I'm gonna lay down the law for this nigga, I put food on his table, clothes on his nigga baby backs, and he ain't gonna say shit."
- This ain't Amistad.
- You shut up.
You goddamn right this ain't Amistad.
I can't wait till the post office settles my disability suit because then I'm gonna be out this motherfucker.
I'm gonna be Oprah rich.
Y'all can kiss my ass.
You know what?
Fuck you.
Fuck you, and suck cock.
- To hell with you.
DELANEY:
To hell with you.
- Zachary will work.
Zack' my boy.
- Yeah.
- The customer with the harelip...
- Oh, yeah.
- speak me, say you were playing baseball here the other night.
Wiffle ball.
And' uh' no' that wasn't me.
Maybe the harelip makes it sound like "baseball."
ZACK:
Yeah, maybe you hear with an accent.
- Fuck you, okay?
- Okay.
One day' I'm gonna put a camera over there' and then I can tell...
I'll know everything you do when I'm gone.
Everything.
Scratch your balls, take a shit, everything, I tell you, okay?
Okay.
Fucker.
I hate both of you ebony and ivory motherfuckers, I tell you.
- Why is he so fucking high-strung?
- "Fuck off, I tell you.
Very good."
Can you believe that Gandhi motherfucker, telling me I gotta work on Black Friday?
Ain't that some shit?
- Yeah.
- Like I don't wanna do shopping.
Biggest sales day of the year.
I'm getting a flat-screen TV, believe that.
That's my fault, I should tell you.
I asked for Friday morning off, I'm sorry.
- For what?
- I actually need a lot of recovery time.
Tonight is me and Miri's ten-year high school reunion.
I'm just gonna get fucking alcohol poisoning.
- Reunion?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
- Isn't that fucked up that they do that?
They say it's the best chance to get everyone together.
People come back in town for the holidays.
But they could have it in the middle of the summer at a blowjob contest that I was judging' and it would still be retarded.
- So why you going, then?
- Miri's making me go.
Why you always bending over backwards for that girl'
- knowing she ain't giving up no ass?
- We got a good thing going.
She pays half the rent, does dishes, she wakes me up in the morning.
Why complicate that with sex?
Besides, man, I've known her since the first grade.
You don't fuck someone you met in the first grade.
Excuse me, I met my wife in kindergarten.
We got married senior year, and she has been the queen of my world ever since.
- What if you could do it all over again?
- I'd jerk off and live by myself.
That woman is the bane of my existence.
- See?
- Excuse me, can I get a coffee, black?
Can't you see we talking, white?
ZACK:
If you're gonna continue to emasculate me with this Barbie dress-up shit'
I'm using your laptop.
Don't forget to smack it when you turn it on, otherwise the screen doesn't come on.
[COMPUTER PLAYS FANFARE]
Why don't you spring and get a new one?
Same reason I don't spring for clothes for tonight, I'm broke.
There's a chick who works at Teen Juice at the mall, you know.
I gave her a good deal on yarn,
- so she's letting me borrow this stuff.
- Yo, bro.
[ZACK LAUGHING]
MIRI:
What?
- You're buying a vibrator online.
- What's wrong with the one you have?
MIRI:
It died last week.
Look at the size of those fucking panties.
Shoot that shit.
Shoot it.
ZACK:
My God, who even knew Amazon sold shit like this?
This is incredible.
- Those are fucking granny panties.
MIRI:
Okay,
A, I don't appreciate you violating the sanctity of my Amazon Wish List page' and B, I'm not buying that thing from Amazon, because it turns out I don't have a credit card they take.
[ZACK GRUNTS]
- Oh, shit.
- I'm sorry, guys.
Am I in the way?
You're a fucking faggot, all right?
Let's go to Starbucks.
- He's a shitty barista anyways.
- Cock.
- And he throws like a bitch.
ZACK:
You know what else I throw?
My nut sack in your coffees, so how did that taste, fucker?
We saw your girlfriend in her underwear, cunt nugget.
Well' too bad she's not my girlfriend, you little fuck...
Oh, they're gone.
MIRI:
Are you still talking to me?
Uh, just said, I'm gonna look up more fuck toys on Amazon.
Oh' holy shit.
- They sell the Fleshlight here too.
- What's that?
It's a fucking pocket pussy that is shaped like a flashlight
"for discretionary jacking off."
That way if you get caught, no one thinks it's weird.
You're just a guy who likes to fuck his flashlight.
I am totally buying this shit.
Whoa, if you've got money to burn, how about paying the electric bill?
- That's due already?
- November's is probably due now, but I was talking about September's.
Tell me this doesn't rock.
You kind of look like Ronald McDonald.
That makes me want some McNuggets.
Why would you wanna buy a pocket pussy anyway?
That is so sad.
What?
Excuse me, I forgot about the nobility that accompanies coming with a fucking vibrator.
Think a kid in Darfur gets saved every time a vibrator makes you come?
No.
- "Real feel action"?
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
If you start fucking machines, I'm moving out.
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a machine.
How come you get to fuck something with a motor in it?
I've never met a man who can make me come like a vibrator does.
That's bullshit.
You get to be Buck Rogers having sex in the 25th century with fucking Twiki and Dr. Theopolis.
I'm stuck to a bottle of Jergens in the bathroom.
Holy bejesus.
You do not use my Jergens to jack it in our bathroom.
ZACK:
No, you know what I do actually, is I light a bunch of candles and I sprawl out on my sheets and I listen to Sting.
No, I'm a guy.
Give me two Popsicle sticks and a rubber band,
I'll find a way to fuck it, like a filthy MacGyver.
Oh' my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.
How about this?
I don't get why you're putting so much effort into this thing.
I thought we were just gonna go to sit around and make fun of everybody.
I can't wear anything that I already own and expect to bring home Bobby Long.
Bobby fucking Long?
No way.
Didn't that guy call you "Stinky Linky"?
Yeah, that was then, okay?
Maybe now he can save me a fortune in Amazon bills.
Maybe you can fuck our landlord so we can at least keep a roof over our heads.
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.
Hey, I bought skates with last week's paycheck
- and I need those to skate with.
- Oh.
And this week's will barely cover the past two water bills, so...
Is this sexy?
Yeah, in like a To Catch a Predator kind of way' it is pretty fucking sexy.
Then we're done.
[SHOWER SPLASHING AND PIPES CREAKING]
What the fuck?
Zack.
- You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?
- They shut it off.
- Oh, shit.
Just, uh...
Help me get this shit out of my hair.
Just use the water out of the toilet.
- There's poo in there.
- Not that part.
- The back part of the toilet thing.
- Oh, that makes sense.
MIRI:
Take the cup there and then scoop it in, there you go.
Here, I'll lean back and you can just' you know, pour it down like...
Like that.
ZACK:
You're harshing my buzz' you know.
This is so lame.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Whoa!
All right, one hour tops, then we're gone.
Or I had an idea.
We could just not go at all, which would rock.
Even though we're broke and we've never amounted to anything, we're still better than these people, right?
No.
Not at all.
We're probably not even as good as most of them, unless one of them is a crackhead or something.
Just tell me I'm prettier than when we graduated.
You look about the same.
Definitely not prettier, but around the same.
I'm thinner, though' right?
A little?
Not really.
Well' good pep talk.
Fuck.
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.
- You don't recognize us' do you?
- Um, no, sorry.
Zack Brown, Miri Linky.
Were you the one they called Stinky Linky?
Oh' no' no one ever called me that.
Oh.
- Great.
What does yours say?
- What the fuck?
Come on.
- I'm sure I had a nickname.
Nothing?
- All right, you have a great time' and before you go, don't forget your copy of The Roving Roe-Ver.
What the fuck's this shit?
That is not shit, that would be our bi-monthly newsletter.
- Awesome.
BETSY:
It updates you
- on what everyone's doing.
- Finally.
I love your enthusiasm.
Here you go.
Write your e-mail address on that and I'll be sure to add you to our 800-member-strong mailing list.
We had 800 people in our graduating class?
Yes, and only 250 R.S.V.P.'d.
Doesn't that suck, Mary?
- Miri.
- You married, Bets?
- I am.
Two kids.
- Wow, that's beautiful.
- Awesome.
- You wanna fuck me later?
- Uh, no, I'm married.
- Okay, cool.
If you change your mind,
- I'll be in there getting shitfaced.
- He will.
- Just so you know, I eat the pussy.
- He does.
Ah, tempting.
Again, no.
- Shall we?
- Sir.
Bye, Bets.
Think about it.
[DJ KOOL'S "LET ME CLEAR MY THROAT" PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]

Enjoy.
Can I get two beers' please?
You want a beer?
- Yeah.
- Three beers.
- Thank you.
BARTENDER:
Here you go.
Is that Zack?
Or am I Zack?
Whoa, ho, ho.
MIRI:
Oh' wow.
- Never gets old, huh?
- The other Zack.
Oh' in my world, nobody calls me "the other Zack,"
now that this guy's not around anymore, huh?
- Get the fuck off of me.
- There can be only one.
- What?
- Highlander, man?
The Kurgan.
Remember?
I'd yell it at you whenever we passed each other in the hallway?
Like it was yesterday' man.
Awesome.
Awesome.
Awesome.
God, you guys have so much to catch up on.
Whoo.
- No.
- I'm gonna let you get to it.
Bitch.
[MARCY PLAYGROUND'S "SEX AND CANDY" PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]
Have you seen that big blowup picture they have of me?
Yeah, it's...
My hair is terrible.
I can't believe I even wore my hair like that.
That's before I knew about styling products' you know.
It makes a big difference in life.
But you live and learn, though' right?
I mean, ten years ago, Pittsburgh, who knew anything about fashion?
Back in the day' our hairstyle, oh...
Hey, stranger.
- Whoa.
Stinky Linky.
- Yeah.
Although it's just Miri now.
- Give me a hug.
- Oh, okay.
- Hi, heh, heh, heh.
- Hi.
Wow.
- How have you been?
- Great, great.
- Yeah?
- You look fantastic.
Wow, that is not something that you would have said to me ten years ago.
- Well' I've grown up.
- Yes.
Yes, you have.
You just look...
Ooh, heh, heh.
- Well' listen to you.
Thank you.
- No, don't thank me, just fuck me.
[LAUGHING]
[LEN'S "STEAL MY SUNSHINE" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
Roxanne.
Hey.
Someone I like, what are the odds' huh?
Zack Brown, we had four years of Spanish together.
Why does no one recognize me?
- Am I thinner?
Is that it?
- Look at him.
- Who?
- My stupid husband.
No fucking shit.
John Butterfield?
You actually married John Butterfield?
- That's amazing.
- Don't ever get married.
It sucks.
You stop appreciating each other and run out of shit to talk about after the first year.
But look at him now, chatty as fuck.
Flirting up a storm with that cheerleader nimrod Monica Von.
You want me to maybe flirt with you so he can see it, even it up a bit?
I don't wanna get even.
If I was gonna do anything, I'd wanna one-up the asshole.
You can give me a handjob in the girls' locker room.
- Fine, but make it fast.
- Fuck, yeah.
Are you staying in town for a while or...?
Just tonight.
I fly back to L.A. tomorrow.
L.A., wow, Los Angeles.
Gosh' Bobby Long' coming up in the world.
- With Mrs. Long, I bet, huh?
- No, no, no.
No Mrs. Long for me.
- Then can I be honest with you?
- Sure.
Um...
Whew.
I think I need a drink.
Do you need a drink?
Because I need a drink to say this.
- I've got a beer already, so...
- Oh, great, thank you.
I think there's a cigarette butt in there.
Yup.
Sorry about the elbow.
[BRONSKI BEAT'S "SMALLTOWN BOY" PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]
There can be only one.
Can I get a beer, please?
Thank you very much.
Oh' Jesus Christ.
My friend's making an ass of herself hitting on her high school crush.
Oh' God' that's so sad.
It's so Miri, is what it is.
I'm Zack, by the way.
Brandon.
Don't worry, we weren't in the same class or anything.
- Okay.
Lucky you.
- Are you a Monroe-ver?
Well' I went here' let's just leave it at that, I guess.
Do you have one of the large blown-up pictures of your younger self
- hanging around here?
- I do, kind of.
Right there.
BRANDON:
Gorgeous.
- Good times.
What do you do?
What brings you here?
I came with somebody who went to school here.
- Really?
- Bobby Long.
No shit.
That's who my friend's hitting on right now.
See right there?
- Really.
- One dressed like Hannah Montana?
In L.A., we call that look "Nickelodeon chic."
- Wait, L. A?
Los Angeles?
- California.
That's awesome, man.
What do you do out there?
- I'm an actor.
- Wow, that's really impressive.
- Thank you, thank you.
- In fucking movies?
"Fucking movies." Pretty much.
Look at you.
What...?
Anything I've seen?
What movies?
Oh' all sorts of movies with all-male casts.
All-male casts.
Like Glengarry Glen Ross?
Like that?
Like Glen and Gary Suck Ross' Meaty Cock and Drop Their Hairy Nuts in His Eager Mouth.
- Is that like a sequel?
- Sort of.
- It's a re-imagining.
- Oh, like The Wiz.
More erotic and with less women.
No women' to be exact.
I apologize in advance if I am out of line here, but are you in gay porn?
- Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?
- I thought you recognized me, that's...
- Oh, okay, I get it.
You're not in my demographic' so I'm not insulted.
- Not really.
Who's your demographic?
- Do you love pussy?
- I do.
- Then not you.
Oh' okay.
I came here tonight hoping to seduce you and bring you back to my apartment and sleep with you to, uh, get back at you, you know, for calling me Stinky Linky all those years ago.
Wow.
That is a weird revenge plot.
- You must be a terrible lay for that.
- What?
No, I'm great.
I mean, I've had enough practice and everything.
That...
Wow, that sounded not good.
I fuck a lot.
That's what I meant to say.
That doesn't sound good either.
Wow.
You're a lot funnier than I remember.
Thank you.
Gosh, you turned out to be such a nice guy.
It just...
You know' it makes it even easier to just...
To just say this.
Would you like to come back to my place and maybe open a bottle of wine and have ourselves a real high school reunion?
- I...
- Hello, Miriam.
Beat it, we're talking.
- I wanted to introduce you to Brandon.
- Salutations.
- Bobby's boyfriend.
- Bobby who?
- Bobby me.
- Bobby Long.
Brandon is the star of such adult fare as...
What was that one called again?
You Better Shut Your Mouth or I'm Gonna Fuck It.
That's right.
I'm surprised I forgot that.
Are you fucking with me?
No, they're fucking with each other.
Oh' my God.
- No.
- What?
Granny Panties?
- Excuse me?
- How can you tell?
This is so crazy.
I was literally just watching you, like, right before we got here.
This is so crazy.
This is you, right?
TEEN 1 [ON VIDEO]:
My name's Granny Panties, and nobody wants to fuck me.
TEEN 2:
Nothing's whiter than my big gay ass...
Where'd you get that?
Oh' I entered "gay" and "ass," and it was the top hit.
It's had 200,000 views in three hours.
Honey' you are, like...
I'm jealous right now because you're, like, super famous.
Baby, please take our picture.
I get a picture with Granny Panties.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is awesome.
- All right, smile.
Okay' got it.
- Did you get it?
- Oh, thank you very much.
- E-mail me that.
Oh' because he's the worst photographer.
Okay' good.
- You're gay?
- Yeah.
And I'm on the Internet wearing a diaper?
Who knew you'd come to Pittsburgh and meet a celebrity?
I'm gonna binge-drink now until I pass out.
Okay.
She'll be fine.
So you guys suck each other's cocks, huh?
Oh' like crazy.
[LAUGHING]
Okay, that's enough, I think.
I'm embarrassing him.
I love when he's embarrassed.
He's not living out loud, so he gets all like, ooh.
- You are totally in love, aren't you?
- Zachary' we are.
Wow, I...
Oh' God' I just wanna eat him up, yum, yum.
Save some for me' yum, yum, yum.
- I can't keep my hands off him.
- You've had one too many.
Although he does most of the eating in the sack.
In the sack and of the sack.
All right, that's enough.
Look, you've drunk too much.
You do this every time.
You get too Mary for everybody in the room
- and you can't contain yourself.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
And by containing myself, do you mean containing myself in a closet?
In a closet of denial?
Is that...?
No, no, no.
Holy shit, this just got real.
This is exactly why you haven't met my mother.
You don't know how to ease people into this situation.
- You just force your way in every time.
- I thought, maybe for one second in this godforsaken town, I could be myself.
I'm so sorry.
No, you're right' I should just butch up and pretend that I don't love it when you shove your dick in my mouth.
- This is the best night of my life.
BRANDON:
Am I making a spectacle?
- I could make a much bigger scene.
- You really are.
I'm sorry.
Pittsburgh.
Listen up' Monroe-vers.
My name is Brandon St. Randy' and I love Bobby Long.
- Fucking A. BRANDON:
Is that enough?
Is that enough of a scene?
I could start doing worse than that.
The reason you haven't taken me to your mother's...
Your mother with her makeup and all her drinking, she's in the closet too.
- They fight just like real people.
- I thought I'd be a conduit for you...
Thank you.
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm not.
- Thank you.
- I love you.
- I'll e-mail you.
- Zack, it was so nice to meet you.
And I will be patient with you.
I will be there on your journey.
I will be your Sherpa up the mountain of gayness.
Well' might as well see how many hits Granny Panties is up to, huh?
[COMPUTER PLAYS FANFARE]
Did I do that?
[MUSIC PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]
Thanks, George.
What kind of evil fucks turn off your power the day...?
No, the night before Thanksgiving?
Who does that?
Can you get an advance on your card?
Fleshlight maxed-out my $200 limit.
Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.
This is bad.
If we don't come up with rent, we're gonna get locked out.
Who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.
Which means by the time we get home, there's no heat either.
Well' I think it's time we put what we always talked about into effect.
- You're gonna have to start hooking.
- You know, you jest, but these are the exact circumstances people find themselves in right before they start having sex for money.
- Yeah.
- Or making porn.
ZACK:
Oh, my God, yeah.
- What?
You got an idea?
We could make a porno.
- Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?
No, that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me?
That's a rad idea.
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend, he said he makes a hundred grand a year because he shoots and distributes his own porno flicks.
If it's so easy, how come everybody doesn't do it?
Because other people have options and dignity, which we do not have, which puts us in an amazingly advantageous position.
Fuck you, I have dignity.
Where?
Is it hidden in your gigantic underpants that are plastered all over the Internet?
Is that where you hide your dignity?
Every woman has a pair of those period panties.
That's, like, a fact.
Okay.
Families.
I bet people don't make porno, because they have families.
But luckily, your parents are dead.
Sorry.
My grandparents are dead.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
So who are we gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone mainstream now.
It's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks in it.
Look at Paris Hilton.
She throat-fucks a guy in night vision, now she's selling fragrances to tweens.
And I'm pretty sure she's legally retarded.
That's for tweens?
Have you seen that Joe Francis guy who made Girls Gone Wild?
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot piece of shit in the world and he has a jet and a fucking island.
Look, there's got to be a less extreme solution to our financial woes here.
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper route.
- I don't have a bike.
- Be a waiter.
No one wants me around their food.
Would you eat food that I gave you?
I would not eat food that you gave me, that's true.
MIRI:
I mean, nobody wants to see us fuck, Zack.
ZACK:
Everybody wants to see anybody fuck.
I hate Rosie O'Donnell, but if someone said' "I got a tape of Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid,"
I'd be like, "Why aren't we watching that right now?"
Because she's famous.
Hello.
So are you.
You're fucking Granny Panties.
My underwear and your ass are famous' we're not.
So who the F would wanna watch us fuck?
- At least 800 people.
- The jerks we went to school with?
- Are you serious?
- Of course.
If you heard that someone we graduated with was in a fucking porno movie, you'd watch it, right?
I'd watch that guy Brandon suck a cock, I just met him.
With this mailing list, we have almost a thousand people that would definitely buy a porno we were in just to be like,
"Hey, I sat next to that guy in Civics.
Look at his fucking dick."
We sell a thousand copies at 20 bucks a pop, bam' we have paid off our bills.
ZACK:
So' what do you think?
- I don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.
Oh' wow, like you've never done that before.
How many guys have you met in a bar, taken home, banged with your mouth and then never talked to again?
That's what we call a stranger.
Dude, I don't one-night mouth-fuck anybody that I pick up in bars.
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in the porno movie for some weird reason.
I guess...
We could fuck.
- Ew.
- Fuck you.
I mean, you're a nice-enough-looking guy and everything...
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're an all-right-enough-looking girl.
- How does that feel?
- Dude' I'm just saying it'd be weird and wrong, you know, like fucking my brother.
Okay, seriously, we're just talking about sex, okay?
It's for a purpose.
It's for getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.
- Wow.
- Just explain to your private beforehand,
"Look' this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash."
- Oh, my God.
- What?
You're just doing this because you've always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?
Yes.
I've gone my whole life pretending that I want nothing to do with you, just hoping one day we'd be in such dire financial straits that I could use it to finally make my move on you.
MIRI:
You're just being sarcastic.
- I am.
See' I was pretending to cry right there.
MIRI:
I guess it's not like it'd be creepy, like if we got way too drunk one night and accidentally fucked, you know?
No.
We'd be going in with the understanding that it's...
A business decision.
Strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.
- Right.
- And by end,
I mean, I'll be waxing your ass.
Fuck you.
I'm not even letting you see my ass.
I've seen your ass and the rest of you naked around a billion times already.
- That goes both ways, buddy.
- You've never seen my dick.
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.
Are you kidding?
That party we went to where you got blasted, and Houls dared you to give yourself head, and we all watched you try for, like, an hour.
Oh' yeah.
Thanks by the way, for fucking letting me do that.
Thank you.
Oh' God.
We really do know too much about each other.
See' and this would really just be one more thing.
I mean, look at us.
It's Thanksgiving and we're huddled around a flaming fucking garbage can like a couple of steno bums.
I mean, this could give us a chance to pay off our debt, pay our bills, get a fucking nicer apartment with heat in it maybe.
What are you doing?
Miriam Linky, will you have sex with me on camera for money?
I will.
DELANEY:
A producer?
ZACK:
Yeah.
- Guy who gets to finance the movie.
- You think I got that kind of money?
We just need that.
What you're about to spend on the flat screen.
Now I can't get my flat screen?
Fuck that.
No, no, no.
With your cut of the profits, you're gonna get two flat screens.
One in your living room, one in your bathroom.
One in the bathroom?
You know, it's always been my dream to watch shit while I shit.
Everyone with an ass loves to watch shit while they shit.
- I'm gonna make that happen for you.
- I don't know, man.
What else the producer do?
- Um, they help with the casting.
- What's casting?
Finding the people to be in the movie.
- I get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.
Like, I can look at a titty, make sure there ain't no moles on there?
- You can look at both titties, man.
- Man.
I've been looking at the same busted titties for the past almost 20 years.
- I'm due for another new titty.
- Please help us.
Please.
Please.
Yes.
Yes.
I love you.
Well' don't mind that smell.
We had some homeless people squatting in here.
You know, they'd void their bowels everywhere but the bathroom.
Anyway, you pick up the poop and you've got yourself a movie studio.
Why don't we shoot in your apartment?
No power.
You wanna pay our electric bill?
- You motherfuckers...
- We'll take it.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
MAN 1:
Bring it back.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
DEACON:
Oh' Jesus.
Oh' Jesus.
Oh' God.
Come on.
Why the fuck do I have to do everything?
Fuckers.
[CROWD CHEERS]
MAN 2:
Hey, what is that?
DEACON:
Fucking guys.
This fucking team, man.
They fucking suck.
[MAN 2 SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
I'm gonna hatefuck the shit out of you, ref.
- Dude.
- It's cool.
- He's my cousin.
- Hey.
Didn't you used to videotape the varsity basketball games in high school?
Just the away games.
I did it because I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.
Which one?
Whichever one wanted to fuck the guy who taped the varsity games.
- Aw.
- Still know how to work a camera?
- Who cares what the title is?
- The porn I liked when I was a kid, it was always, like, a spoof of a popular movie, you know?
Like, um, Edward Penishands.
Okay, so we need a mildly clever, vaguely dirty title, that sounds like a real movie
- and sums up what you're gonna see.
- Correct.
An American Werewolf in Brenda?
Fuckback Mountain?
- Too soon?
A Cock-in-Lips Now?
MIRI:
Next.
Cradle the balls.
Work the shaft.
Jerk my come-crayon and let me color you white.
I need cock and I need it now.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
It's "puss" as in pussy.
Oh' because I was like' who would wanna fuck puss?
I want to slam my ham in your can, woman.
Scene.
- This guy is amazing.
- This guy's great-looking too.
I wanna fuck him.
DELANEY:
Hi, my name's Delaney and I'm a producer.
I really don't know what it means.
I'm gonna be honest' this is my first time.
You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna touch you or nothing like that.
- All right.
- I have a wife, you know.
We're happy.
I mean, not happy' but it's cool, you know.
Just so you know, there will be some fucking.
- We'll talk about that if you get the part.
- Okay.
I mean, not...
We won't be fucking, there'll be fucking in the movie.
Like I said' I got a wife.
She don't play that shit.
- She is a crazy bitch.
- Yep.
It's my job as the producer to see what you got.
So if that makes you uncomfortable in any way, you don't have to show me anything you don't wanna show me, because...
I love the movies.
- Lawrence of a Labia.
- No.
- Oh, come on.
- Dawn of the Dick.
Yeah, but how are zombies doing it at all sexy?
I want to eat your brain and your ass.
[GROANING]
- Dude.
- Sci-fi.
Yeah.
Close Encounters With a Turd From Behind.
- I don't know what that means.
- Just asses.
Fucking deep in asses.
[TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
What?
We're making a porno and we just need to know what you would be or would not be interested in doing.
If anything.
- No anal.
- Oh, definitely no anal.
Anal and hugging.
I don't do ass stuff.
- Anal.
- Ah, fuck.
- Oh, wait, oral.
I like anal.
- Yay.
Okay, well, so, uh, do you have any special skills?
Special skills?
I can get a boner really quick and it sticks straight up.
- Is that really a special skill?
- I think.
- Can you show us what you mean?
- Sure.
Oh' that is special.
[ZACK CHUCKLES]
Yeah, you're hired, Mr...
- Who are you again?
- Lester.
Lester "The Molester" Cockinshtuff.
- No.
- Wow.
That is the best porn name I've ever heard' man.
I can have a porn name?
- Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.
Are you Granny Panties?
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The panties are actually in the house.
- I'll get them.
- Whoa.
- Star Sex 2:
The Wrath of Cunt.
MIRI:
We never made a Star Sex 1.
I guess we can lose Star Sex 3:
The Search for Cock, then.
- Cocunt.
- What's that?
It's Cocoon with a cunt.
[LAUGHING]
So Delaney tells us you have a special talent of some sort.
I don't know if I'd call it a special talent, but it's a little something I picked up doing bachelor parties.
It would probably be easier if I just showed you.
- Great.
- The floor is yours.
So a movie, huh?
That could be fun.
Holy fuck.
Her name's Bubbles.
- Invasion of the Potty-Snatchers?
- That's like MAD Magazine stupid.
Well' fuck you' okay?
You try to think of a good sci-fi porno title.
It's hard.
MIRI:
There's gotta be one we haven't thought of that would say it all' not be ridiculously filthy and off-putting, and still have instant recognition with our audience.
- I got it.
- I got it.
- Star Whores.
- Yeah.
It's funny' right?
See' we figured this opens us up to an even bigger sales market beyond the people we went to school with.
People who like comics and sci-fi.
Comics?
Like "Ziggy"?
"Ziggy"?
Is that even in fucking papers anymore?
No, man.
Fuck you. "Ziggy" is a comic' right next to "Family Circus."
No, like Spider-Man and shit, you know?
There's always a shitload of Star Wars nerds at those comic-book shows.
So we sell them a Princess Leia they can really fucking jerk off to.
- That'd be me, Princess Lay-Her.
- Who am I playing?
You' my friend, are the lead role of Lubed Guy-Baller.
Man' he's gonna be balling dudes?
I thought you said this was boys on girls.
If I have to fuck a guy' okay, but I'd rather fuck a girl.
What's wrong with you, boy?
- We'll change the name to Sky-Baller.
- Sky-Baller.
I will be Hung So-low.
Delaney, my friend, you are On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
Man' I can't be in no porno.
My wife will kill me.
Hump me, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
You're my only hump.
On the other hand, fuck my wife.
Unfortunately, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over does not have any sex in the movie but the droids do, l-CUP and R2-T-Bag.
I robot.
And Stacey over here is gonna play Darth Vibrator.
- I'm the bad guy?
- She's not a guy, Zack.
I know that because I'm not a fucking idiot.
In our movie, Darth Vibrator is a bad girl who wants to fuck the galaxy, literally' and it's up to Lubed and Hung to stop her with their cocks.
- You and me get to have sex, then?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- I know.
Isn't that awesome?
Hold up, hold up.
So who's all having sex with who in this movie?
As of last night, I was having sex with Zack.
What?
Han Solo ain't never had no sex with Princess Leia in the Star Wars.
ZACK:
Guys' this isn't a literal adaptation here.
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.
Kind of like The Wiz or like a parody.
With lots of anal.
- Cool.
- I know, isn't that awesome?
I have a question, do Princess Lay-Her and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?
Uh, no, because they're brother and sister, and according to Miri' brothers and sisters can't fuck.
But you said, that this wasn't a literal translation, so that means Lester's character could have sex with Miri's character.
Because I would love to fucking eat her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.
Dream on, pal, it's never gonna happen, okay?
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See' she's fine...
Wait, what?
Yep.
I mean, everyone else is having sex with more than one person in this movie all of a sudden, so I think it's' you know' not fair if I'm only fucking you.
Guys, read amongst yourselves, okay?
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Look, Miri, we got plenty of sex going on in this thing, you don't have to do that.
Zack, it's fine.
I mean I have slept with way worse-looking guys than Lester.
I just wanna do my part for the movie like everyone else.
You're having sex in the movie, you don't need to fuck someone else.
- You're good.
- I'm only fucking you' though.
So don't we need to vary it up to keep it fair?
Fair for...?
I don't...
What?
Fair for who?
What are these, blood diamonds we're talking about?
Fair for everyone else who is fucking more than one person, a.k.a. you' in the movie.
- I mean, fine...
- All right.
I mean, if you don't care...
I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
Fuck.
I don't give a shit.
Like you said, you know, you've fucked bigger idiots than Lester.
Holy shit.
Are we really gonna shoot this in outer space?
Maybe not bigger idiots.
[MOUTHS] Thank you.
- Cut.
All right, guys, that's it.
- Yeah.
Make sure you leave your costume so we know they're here for tomorrow.
Mostly, everybody, thank you so much for helping us get ready' you know.
Cleaning this place out, building the sets, sewing the costumes, it's just...
I mean, it's really amazing.
Thank you.
ZACK:
Seriously, thanks.
But this is just the beginning, guys.
If Star Whores works, and it will' we are set up for sequels galore.
The Empire Strikes Ass.
- Return of the Brown-Eye.
- The Phantom Man-Ass.
And Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter.
- Okay.
- Revenge of the Shit.
- You got it?
- Yeah, no, we got it.
Ew.
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.
- We'll talk about that one.
We're gonna have a lot of fun' but more importantly, we're gonna make a lot of fucking money' okay?
- Yeah.
- So get ready for greatness, people.
Tomorrow we start principal photography.
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
- All right, good night, you guys.
- We got a movie.
- What?
- Nothing.
I think someone should acknowledge how insane and amazing this is
- and it's all because of you.
- I don't know.
It's just a porno.
You know what I mean.
You've really come into your own.
Shut the fuck up.
So speaking of coming into things' ready for tomorrow?
Twenty years' we're finally gonna know what it's like to have sex with each other.
You say that like you've been wondering what it'd be like to sleep with me for a while now.
Why the fuck do you think I started hanging out with you?
I knew it.
Here, help.
Let's just promise that it's not gonna change anything between us, okay?
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Some guys can't keep sex in perspective.
If anyone's gotta keep this in perspective, it's you, okay?
I don't want you getting all mushy and gooey on me after I give you the best orgasm you've ever had.
Oh' like you know what you're doing down there at all.
I actually don't.
Where's the clitoris?
Is it in your ass?
Just, you know, make sure you kind of whoop it up and act like I'm a stud who knows what he's doing' okay?
Just be a pal.
Oh' dude, I am gonna Meryl Streep the fuck out of this tomorrow, you watch.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
No.
Really, thank you.
For everything.
You're welcome.
Less than 12 hours and we make Monroeville history.
- I really hope nothing goes wrong.
- It's a movie.
What could go wrong?
ZACK:
What are you doing?
DELANEY:
What's up?
- What the fuck?
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait.
- Wait.
- Stop.
Stop.
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck is going on?
Condos is what's going on, as soon as this shit-hole's demo'd.
No, you gotta stop it right now.
We rented this place for a month from Mr. Jenkins.
Sounds like your Mr. Jenkins was full of shit.
Luxury Homesteads bought this place a month ago.
I'm gonna kill that lying old fuck.
You're gonna have to go Florida, that's where he moved.
We've got thousands of dollars of equipment in there.
- Please.
- If you wanna sift through this rubble when we're done, be my guest.
Hey, get that fucking beam down.
MIRI:
This is the last thing you wanna hear.
If you don't get an advance,
I don't think we're gonna keep a roof over our heads.
I got an advance already.
It went into all the costumes.
- So all our money's gone?
- All your money?
Never mind what my wife's gonna do when there ain't no new snow tires, or when she sees I charged a video camera.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this' man.
DELANEY:
I just wanted to see some free titties.
That's all.
But there's no such thing as free titties' is there, Zack?
- Is there?
- Fuck this noise.
Why don't we get another camera, and shoot something else?
Where are we gonna do that?
Got another sound stage?
Sound stage?
We had a shit-covered garage we turned into a sound stage.
We find someplace new and we do it again.
[DOOR SQUEAKS]
How?
Okay, I'm broke, man.
No, make that' I was broke.
Now I am really tapped out.
I have to get another job to pay Delaney back.
So please tell me, how can I afford to start over?
- What can I get you?
- Yeah, can I get a, uh...?
Too fucking late.
Cappuccino, 3.50.
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
I mean, I'm a total loser in every single other aspect of my life.
What made me think I could do something as simple as filming people fucking?
We have no money left, nowhere to shoot, no sets, we have no fucking cameras.
Here.
It's time I go back to my regular life where I am a quiet fuckup who doesn't cost anybody any money and knows his goddamn position behind this fucking counter making cappuccinos for this fucking guy.
Oh' yeah.
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
ZACK:
Oh' yeah.
Yeah.
Fuck, yes.
Zack.
[CHUCKLES]
You sneaky Indian motherfucker.
I tell you, yes.
Swallow My Cockuccino.
- What?
- That's it.
That's the movie.
Why didn't I think of it before?
We don't need sets or a stage.
Look at all this production value, waiting to have balls on it.
Hold up.
You wanna shoot a dirty movie here, where we work?
Yes.
Fuck, yes, I do.
You know how many stories I have from working here?
How many times I've been laid right there after hours?
You've never gotten laid here after hours.
I know.
Thank you for reminding me.
But I always wish I had, and that's what porno is.
It's fantasy.
It's taking the normal and making it abnormal by fucking it.
Don't do that.
The little dog don't like that.
How did you get a camera?
By being a terrible, untrustworthy employee, that's how.
Give me today, I'll bang out a script.
Meet me back here after closing.
We're gonna launch arching ropes of jism all over this motherfucker.
Peace.
I like that guy but if he tries to fuck that little dog tonight for real,
I'm calling the Humane Society.
It's called Bean-N-Gone, so get the fuck out of here.
Hey, Barry.
ZACK:
Stand by, Stace' picture's up.
- Okay.
ZACK:
Roll tape.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 12, Take 1.
ZACK:
And action.
I'd like a double espresso so I can stay up all night because I'm in the mood to fuck.
Well' I am a whore-ista, so I love to fuck.
Would you like to fuck me?
Holy fuck.
You mean, after you're done with your shift?
I mean during my shift.
- Sorry.
- Keep going, keep going.
With your shaft.
Let us fuck.
Cue music.
[FUNK MUSIC PLAYING]
Okay, open up to camera, guys.
Let us see it.
More tongue.
Little less tongue.
Oh' that was good.
[CASH REGISTER BEEPING]
Cue effects.
[MOANING]
Oh' yeah, like that.
Oh' yeah.
See' I told you it would work.
Didn't I tell you?
It looks amazing.
It's incredible.
STACEY:
Oh' the beans hurt.
Easy.
- Move in for coverage.
- Nice.
That's why we got him.
- Nice.
I'm impressed.
- Get in there, Deacon.
- Come on.
- Like that?
Like that.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
- Pull out a bit, actually.
STACEY:
That's hot.
No, not you, Lester.
Put it back in.
Kiss the muscle.
- I kiss the muscle.
- You kiss the muscle.
- Can he slap her ass a little?
- Don't be a fucking pervert, dude.
- Stir, come on.
Stir.
- Yeah, stir it.
Stir it, baby.
Hey.
- Holy.
- Shit.
Are you guys still open?
No.
We close at 9.
I need coffee so I'm drive home.
- Okay.
Yeah.
MAN:
Thank you.
That's a cute kitty.
Okay.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You guys see the game?
I was at it.
Fucking Roethlisberger, the quarterback, was all fucking'
"Hug it' chug it, football.
All night." Heh-heh.
Okay, pal' here you go.
On the house.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Have a good one.
- Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- I said, have a good one.
Oh.
- Okay.
Keep moving.
MAN:
You and your little dog.
Go Steelers.
Action.
Oh' yeah.
Yeah, yeah, like that.
Oh' fuck it' chuck it' football.
Oh' yeah.
BARRY:
Oh' God' this is good.
[BARRY MOANING]
You take it.
You take it.
Take it, Barry.
Oh, take it.
Take it, Barry.
Take it.
I'm disturbed at how turned on I am by this.
- Shit, dude' it's almost 6.
- Oh, fuck.
Okay, that's a wrap, everybody, yeah.
Let's give a hand to our hotties with the bodies from last night.
Stacey, Lester, Bubbles, Barry' whoo.
LESTER:
Yeah.
ZACK:
Nice.
Okay, when we come back tonight, we finish up the venti-vulva scene' and then we get into me and Miri's stuff.
Again' amazing first night, everybody.
Thank you so much.
Let us fuck.
- Hey' how'd it look?
- How do you think it looked?
It looked like shit going into other shit, in focus.
What an artist.
That was Kurosawa's motto. "Shit going into other shit."
Oh' man, I can't believe you gotta work now.
It's okay.
You know, honestly, I don't think I could sleep.
- I'm pretty, like, pumped up right now.
- Right?
It was amazing.
It was awesome.
I think the cast and crew had a good time.
- We were getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.
I just wanna keep shooting people boning all day.
I don't think I've ever met the ambitious Zack Brown before.
- Well' I'm trying to pay the bills, so...
- It's not a bad thing.
I think it looks good on you.
ZACK:
Come on, hurry.
Come on, come on' come on.
BUBBLES:
Wait a minute.
- You guys never did it before?
MIRI:
It's fine.
You know, we talked about it and it's just for the movie.
We're friends' you know' we're just friends.
And we will always just be just friends, so...
Listen' I have some extra lube from last night.
I understand it's kind of hard getting wet when everyone's watching.
At least it was for Barry.
- I don't know if I am gonna need it.
- Really?
Yeah, I think I'm just excited.
Uh-huh.
At the idea of people watching' not because of Zack.
Oh' God.
Zack could never have that effect on me in a million years.
- Hello, Miriam.
- Oh, hey.
Wow.
- Your face.
- Yeah.
Weird, huh?
I don't think I've seen your face since senior year.
ZACK:
I think I made a mistake.
I did it for you so you wouldn't get road rash during our scene, but I should have asked first' I look like a fucking beluga whale.
I think I'll be going now.
ZACK:
Okay.
[CLEARING THROAT]
All I keep thinking is we should've done a trial run at home last week or something.
- Oh, my God.
Right?
- I know.
[LAUGHING]
- You're still cool to do it, though, right?
- Yeah, um.
Totally.
Are you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I'm, uh...
- Honestly, I'm a little nervous, I guess.
- You are?
- It's kind of a big deal.
- It is?
Yeah, you know, it's our first time together since our auspicious debut on viral video.
Oh' yeah.
That's a fuckload of pressure for a director.
As a director, please.
What about the anxiety I'm feeling as an actress?
- Did I pick the right project?
- Yeah.
What about this follow-up?
Julia Roberts followed Pretty Waman with Sleeping With the Enemy.
I'm following Granny Panties with Swallow My Cockuccino.
Only difference is this movie's about cock-sucking and her movie just sucked cock, period.
- The only difference, yeah.
- The end was pretty rad.
I liked that.
- When she kills him.
- With a gun.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- She calls the cops first.
- She calls it in first.
- It was so awesome.
- Awesome, yeah.
So I guess we should do this.
I think we should probably wait just until I lose another 20 or 30 pounds.
Stop it.
You look good.
Thanks.
So, what about me?
How do I look?
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful, so I guess it's not a big deal, but you look amazing.
- Okay.
Let's go make a porno.
- Okay.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 8, Take 1.
DEACON:
Come here.
- I'm over...?
All right, settle.
Action.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Who could it be?
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm a delivery man and I have some cream for you.
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.
I work out.
So do you want me to give you your cream now?
I've been waiting for it all day.
- Fuck.
Come on.
- Oops.
[WHISPERS] Keep going.
I spilled my cream.
Do you mind?
I don't mind.
Especially if you spill it on my face.
Let us fuck.
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
- Fix my shirt.
Think I should?
- Okay.
Let me see them titties.
Actually, you know what?
Sorry, I don't think we should show them.
- What?
- We shouldn't show your breasts.
- Aren't you gonna take your shirt off?
- I'm just gonna open it.
You're not gonna take it off?
Why not?
My tits are bigger than yours.
I don't wanna show that.
She's not gonna show her tits?
I showed my cock and my asshole.
- Okay, I'll do your pants.
- Back and forth. okay.
- Holy shit.
- Where's that delivery?
I can't believe this.
I was delivering cream, and look what's happening.
- Jesus, what is that, a rumba?
- What's a rumba?
That awkward movement.
- Should I take your underpants off?
- Yeah, take them off.
ZACK:
What the fuck?
How does this work?
They're just like...
I'll do it.
- I'll do mine, you just...
You do yours.
- I'll do my pants.
Granny panties.
Just get on with it already.
I'm gonna fuck you with my pecker.
Dude, that's really dirty.
- That's too dirty?
- That offends me.
- Penis?
- Fine.
- I'm gonna fuck you with my penis.
- I can't wait.
For my penis.
Be careful, Miri.
Okay, there we go.
Just keep rolling, keep rolling.
- I'll walk forward.
- Fucking cream is coming.
This is the worst porno I've ever seen.
MIRI:
Get over here, delivery man.
ZACK:
Let's fuck on these beans.
[GRUNTING]
- You okay?
- Yup.
ZACK:
Okay' all right.
- Just leave them.
Just leave them.
- They're really distracting.
- You should leave them.
- You gotta get your...
There you go.
ZACK:
Okay' okay.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.
This okay?
Okay.
Okay, uh.
- We'll start kissing on three' okay?
- Okay.
One, two, three.
Go.
MIRI:
I'm ready.
- I'm ready.
- Okay.
Deacon.
- Deacon.
Deacon.
- What?
Did you see Lost this week, man?
I missed it.
What happened?
They're on the island, off the island.
Who can follow that?
I think they're in hell.
Would you all shut the motherfuck up?
[MOANING]
I want you to come.
- I want you to come with me.
- Okay.
Oh' God.
ZACK:
Oh' God.
Cut.
That's it?
It's over?
Ain't he supposed to come on her titties?
Well' it wasn't what we'd shot-listed' but that was nice.
- It was so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack.
Thanks, Lester, uh.
It wasn't just me, though, guys.
Give it up for my radiant costar here, Miri.
[CHEERING]
LESTER:
Nice.
- Um, show's over in here.
Let's move out' start lighting the next scene.
- All right.
LESTER:
Let's do it.
BUBBLES:
You looked so beautiful.
- Thanks.
DELANEY:
I thought they were gonna be fucking hard.
- It was pretty.
DELANEY:
Pretty don't sell.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
You good, Mir?
You need anything?
I'm just gonna take a minute, okay?
Okay, uh.
I'll just be out there.
Yeah.
- That was fun.
- Yeah, fun.
ZACK [WHISPERS]:
"Fun." You fucking douche.
[SIGHS]
Wow.
- Hey.
ZACK:
Hey.
- You working on a rewrite?
- Yeah, just for tonight's scene.
- I'm ready to go when you are, though.
- Okay.
You know, before we go, I...
I'm thinking that, uh, it's a good idea if we talk about what happened last night.
- Oh.
- I mean, we don't have to' but I think...
Okay, yeah, uh.
I kind of dropped the ball on that, I guess, huh?
- No, no.
It's...
- To be honest, it was...
You know, I didn't realize how weird it would be for me.
Weird?
Like...
Weird how?
Acting and directing at the same time.
It's a lot to process, you know.
For the first time' I thought my balls didn't have enough hair on them.
That's not what I meant.
I know what you meant.
How you feeling about it?
I guess, um...
I feel like...
Like we...
- Holy fuck.
- The power's on.
Did you do this?
ZACK:
How did this happen?
I burned the bills.
How could we have done that?
- The water.
- The water.
MIRI:
Come on, come on' come on.
Yeah!
- We can shower in our home again.
- We are liquid.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Greetings.
Have you heard the good news about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?
Oh' my God, did you guys do this?
We got tired of you taking showers at our places all the time.
So we took up a collection amongst ourselves.
And chipped away at your mountain of debt.
You guys paid off our massive utilities bills?
- How did you afford that?
- I stole my old lady's bingo winnings.
And Mistress Bubbles did a bachelor party tonight at which yours truly was a guest star, thank you very much.
- Oh.
- Whoa.
Don't get too excited.
We didn't pay off your whole bill.
Just a month of each.
They agreed to turn everything back on?
At 9 at night?
How does that work?
Stacey knows somebody that works at Power and Light.
- You guys...
- This is amazing.
You didn't have to do this.
You didn't have to put us in your movie.
- Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.
- Or put us in your movie either.
- We said that already.
Guys, honestly, I don't know what to say.
You can start by saying we can take tonight off so we can have our wrap party right now.
Guys, we're not wrapped.
We still have four days of shooting left.
Excuse me.
In my "producorial" capacity,
I'm shutting the movie down for a night so we can get a little silly.
[DMX'S "PARTY UP (UP IN HERE)" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
[THE PIXIES' "HEY" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
[COIN CLINKING AND PEOPLE CHATTERING]
Go' go' go.
- Yes.
- Yes.
[LAUGHING]
You all drink.
Was it just amazing with him, after all those years of not knowing?
It was, um, weird.
- But good.
- My scene with Zack's tomorrow.
You don't say.
But I'm a little nervous.
I was thinking about trying to get with him tonight.
- Really?
- I mean, if you don't mind.
You are just friends and all' so I didn't think it would be a biggie.
- It wouldn't be a biggie, would it?
- No.
No, no.
It's not a biggie.
What?
No.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Stacey' I'm not married to the guy, so...
I don't know.
You guys just looked kind of intimate last night.
- We did?
- Yeah.
Well' we're just better actors than I thought, I think, so you know what?
If you wanna get with him' you should just go ask him.
- He'd be really excited to hear that.
- Yeah?
For real, you don't mind?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
DEACON:
All the quarters are on the ground.
ZACK:
Hey, Stace.
- Hey' Zack.
[WHISPERING]
DEACON:
Come on, are you guys playing or what?
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
Well' I'm bummed, but I totally get it.
It's no problem to work with Lester again.
He has a nice cock.
Well' you're a trouper, Stace.
Oh' but if I start making weird faces or anything during the scene' it's just because I've been constipated all day.
Oh' shit' uh.
We don't have to shoot the scene tonight.
No, I want to.
Anal's great for when you're constipated.
It totally loosens you up.
I use ex-lax' but good to know.
Okay, I never thought I would have that conversation.
So are we starting with Lester and Stacey tonight?
We were supposed to start with Lester and Miri.
I know.
She...
We're not gonna do that.
I don't think Miri's gonna...
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
...do that.
Hey.
So where are we shooting this?
Over here?
- What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.
Our scene's tonight, right?
Can I talk to you for a minute in the back?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
What do you want me to shoot here?
Start with the close-ups of Lester and Stacey.
Give me a second, man.
What an artist.
Okay, uh.
Did I do something wrong to you?
No.
Then why are you here?
I'm here for the same reason you're here.
To make the movie.
Okay, just, like' for your own personal information, you're acting really weird right now.
I'm acting weird?
I think you're acting weird right now.
Oh' I'm acting...
How exactly am I acting weird?
You've been trying to keep me from fucking anybody but you since we started this thing.
Maybe I was thinking about your feelings.
Were you thinking of my feelings when you were banging Stacey?
Because that'd be really sad for Stacey.
She told me that you told her that that was okay.
I told her that it was okay to ask you.
Holy shit.
I get it.
I fucking get it.
It was a test.
That whole thing was a fucking test, is that it?
If it was, how do you think you did?
We had a discussion, Miri.
We had...
Actually, we had many discussions about how it was just sex
- and how we wouldn't let it get weird.
- I'm not acting weird.
You're acting like a jealous girlfriend is what the fuck you're acting like.
- I am not your girlfriend.
- I know that.
You're not my boyfriend, so why are we having this conversation right now?
Because you're about to fuck Lester to spite me, it seems like.
Did you fuck Stacey to spite me?
No.
You fucked her like you fucked every other bitch and never gave a shit how I felt about it.
- Well' that was before.
- Before what?
Look, don't fucking pretend that the other night, you and me, right there, that that didn't mean anything to you, that you didn't feel it too.
Oh.
You're not getting all gooey on me here, are you, Zack?
You know what?
If you were any other bitch I didn't give a rat's ass about,
I would tell you to go fuck yourself right now because I fucking hate this game-playing shit.
But you, you mean more to me than that' so I'm just gonna lay this out on front street.
I know you felt something big, something real the other night when we were together because I felt it too.
We tried to fuck and instead, we wound up making love.
So if this is what you need to hear in order to keep you from fucking Lester, if this is what you need, then fine.
Here it is, I'm gonna say it.
I love you, Miri.
Happy?
Oh' Jesus.
You better get ahold of yourself, Zack, because we just fucked.
Okay.
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?
But you did.
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.
[WHISPERS] Wait...
All right, don't forget I'm down here.
Watch that pullout, huh?
STACEY:
Yeah.
Mmm.
This is some damn good coffee.
- Where you going?
- Getting the fuck out of here.
We gotta finish this movie.
[GASPS]
Yo!
[COUGHING AND GROANING]
You believe this shit?
Do you believe this shit?
What the fuck just happened in there?
I'll tell you what just happened in there.
That chick frosted me like I was a fucking cake.
Zack.
TEEN 1:
Okay, seriously' get a picture of me right now.
I'm hunting humans.
- Dude' check it out.
Ooh.
- Oh, shit.
Seriously, let's shoot the shit out of this bitch.
- Where you aiming at?
- Cock shots?
Cock shots.
[BUZZER RINGS]
[BUZZER RINGS]
We shot you in the balls, cunt nugget.
Well' it's my job to get shot in the balls, so... oh, they're gone.
MAN:
Excuse me.
Didn't you used to work at the Bean-N-Gone in Monroeville?
I sure as shit hope this pays better, I tell you.
[CHATTERING]
So why don't they just shoot you with a puck?
What do you mean?
I mean, what does paintball got to do with hockey?
Nothing, I guess.
- So ain't no prizes or...?
- No, no.
So, what are they paying $5 for?
To shoot a Broad Street Bully in the balls.
White people are fucked up.
Yup' they sure are.
It's a living.
You've been getting the checks I've been sending?
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Probably didn't save you from a brutal tongue-lashing, though, huh?
You know, the wife never found out about the camera, because I paid off the bills.
How did you manage that?
- Because now I'm Oprah rich.
- No way.
- The post office fucking settled?
- Hundred-sixty large' son.
- Nice, man.
Congratulations.
- A beautiful day, thank you very much.
I thought you made that whole thing up.
No, no.
It was very real.
You can believe it.
Even though she's spending all of it.
Well' since you ain't gonna ask me, I'll just go ahead and tell you.
- No, I have not seen Miri.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.
Oh' I suppose you weren't gonna ask about your movie, neither?
Look, that's why I came down here.
I need you to come take a look at it.
- I'm not interested.
Sorry.
- You'd better get interested
- because you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?
The story doesn't make sense.
- The story?
- The story doesn't make sense.
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?
It's a movie, dog, and a movie's gotta have an ending, which we don't have at the moment.
Come shot, credits.
There's your fucking ending.
Do me this favor, okay?
When you're done getting your nuts blown off' come back to humble Monroeville to my crib for a couple hours' check out the flick, you tell me what's missing.
No.
I'll tell you what, you do that, you don't owe me shit no more.
- Really?
- Really.
- Is your wife home?
- Yes.
- Maybe I should leave the pads on.
- You got some extra ones?
Hey, honey.
Where the fuck you been?
And who in the fuck is this now?
Would you calm down, woman?
Goddamn.
You already left one white boy down in my basement while you off gallivanting and shit.
What if this motherfucker
- was all grabby on me?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
Oh' what in the fuck is that supposed to mean?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
WIFE:
White boys love me.
White boy.
- I said, white boy.
- Yeah?
You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?
- Should I say yes?
- Just say yes.
Yeah.
- Why don't you, uh, head downstairs?
- Oh, okay.
It's just through this hallway.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
What the fuck you looking at?
Why you gotta be yelling at me in front of my director?
- Oh, he's a director?
- Yeah.
I didn't know that.
Shit, he's a director.
Well' why don't he direct my ass to a new husband?
How about that shit?
- That's the bedroom.
DELANEY:
Keep talking, maybe he will.
Oh' don't nobody want them saggy-ass balls!
Saggy balls?
Look at these sagging-ass titties you got around here.
- You could tie these together.
- Motherfucker, we match.
Oh' shit.
Where's my paintball gun at?
Look at you, editor and DP.
You got your shit covered, man.
Please, don't ever say "shit-covered" to me again.
Roll the film for the man, please, so we can see what he thinks.
Just jump through it.
I ain't got all night.
The bitch is on me.
"Nigga Rich Productions." Classy.
- Yeah, DreamWorks was taken.
- Was it?
Plus' it sounds like an underground gay fuck club.
"I met a guy at DreamWorks." Yeah.
All right, so we got Lester and Stacey fucking.
Then we got Barry and Bubbles fucking.
And then this boring bullshit.
Okay, just, uh, go to the next scene, would you?
Uh...
- What next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?
We never shot it.
- Why not?
- Because after you left that night,
Miri came out of the backroom and said she couldn't do it.
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped?
So...
- Wait, so Miri...
- Never fucked nobody.
Just you.
Now, I wonder why she did that.
- Hm.
- Hm.
You see, there was a time when I was just a bitter old fuck making coffees, and Stacey was just a lap dancer and Barry and Bubbles didn't know each other and this fool here, hell, I don't even know what he was.
- A white supremacist.
- Man' fuck you.
Then two people come along and showed us something we didn't know existed.
A world of possibilities where plain old people just like us could do something special.
Even if it's something as simple as filming people fucking.
Sometimes we just need someone to show us something we can't see for ourselves
and then we're changed forever.
So as you can see' our movie ain't got no ending.
Every movie needs an ending' don't it?
Peace.
Delaney, you're a slick cupid motherfucker.
Ain't love grand?
WIFE:
Why the fuck is this white boy running through my goddamn house?
[DOOR SLAMS]
Sometimes.
Miri.
- Miri.
MIRI:
Zack?
ZACK:
Miri.
I'm sorry.
MIRI:
Get out.
- Close the door.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over...
- Just close the fucking door' Zack.
I never slept with Stacey that night, okay?
I swear to God.
When we got into my room, you know what we did?
We talked about you, and us and how things were different and how I was too much of a fucking pussy to just tell you how I felt about you.
And I know...
I know that that's only because of all the stupid shit we said about how we wouldn't let sex change us, but it did.
It changed me.
That has to be love, right?
It has to be love and just so you know, I can't go back to being just friends anymore,
- because I just can't.
- Good.
And I think...
I think that you feel the same way.
Because that night after I left, you didn't fuck Lester.
What's up, Zack?
You know what?
I don't care that you're fucking Lester, okay?
How's that?
- Oh, shit.
- I don't wanna be with anyone but you.
So I will wait forever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life because I love you, and I have for as long as I can remember.
And I would rather die than be without you, Miriam Linky.
Miri's last name is Linky?
You're gonna fuck a guy who doesn't know your last name?
Or that you beat up Carl Roth in the sixth grade?
I know that.
Or what your senior prom dress would've looked like had we gone but we decided not to, and we got drunk alone instead.
Or that you washed your hair in the toilet.
We're not fucking' Zack.
Or that you're not fucking Zack...
What?
I asked her to fuck me.
She wouldn't do it.
I even tried to talk her into giving me the fucking Dutch rudder.
Shot me down on that too.
- And a Dutch rudder is?
- Don't know what a Dutch rudder...?
All right, you grab your dick, then you have someone else work your arm.
Here, let me show you.
All right, grab my arm.
I'm grabbing my dick, you're grabbing my arm.
Now work it.
Work my arm.
See that shit?
Work it up and down.
It's like someone else is jerking you off.
Okay.
There's the double Dutch rudder, which' I grab my dick, you grab your dick, you work my arm, I work your arm' same time.
It's like jerking off together but not gay.
We're not touching dicks, each other's dicks anyway.
I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.
It feels good, sir.
Try me, come on.
Sorry to change the subject on you, Lester, but if you're not fucking Miri, why is your dick out right now?
Because I live here now, and I like to be naked.
- What?
- When you moved out, she couldn't afford to pay her rent by herself, so I moved in to help.
But you just came out of her room.
That's my room now.
She moved in your old room.
Wait, wait, wait.
She changed rooms?
Yeah, she said she did it because she missed the smell of you or some shit.
[SNIFFS]
I don't smell anything.
But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.
- Night, Zack.
- Night.
Do you?
Then why are you crying?
Because I missed you so much.
ZACK:
Me too.
I love you.
- I love you, I love you.
ZACK:
I love you.
I don't mean to alarm you but I think I just jerked off Lester a little bit.
- The Dutch rudder?
- Yeah, it's ingenious, right?
If you ask me nicely, I will Dutch-rudder you the rest of our lives.
Good.
I'm getting tired of fucking the Fleshlight.
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.
- What'd it feel like?
- Like fucking a flashlight.
LESTER:
Wrong room.
- Oh, God.
That's gross.
Let us fuck.
Hello.
Welcome to Nigga Rich Productions' home of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, the production house for the couple looking to put a little spice in their sex life.
- Shall we take a look around?
- Fuck me so hard.
Oh, God.
First, you'll meet for a consultation with one of our romance-ologists, who'll coach you through that initial awkward stage before you're camera-ready.
So we will start off with some erotic massage and some...
Dude.
Some light petting.
That sounds good.
Are you guys sure you don't wanna do some, uh, butt-sack work too?
- Uh, let's move on' shall we?
- Why?
ANNOUNCER:
From their break-out hit, Swallow My Cockuccino, to the multi-million selling Swallow My Cockuccino II and the award-winning Star Whores saga, including Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter,
Zack and Miri have proven time and again that they know how to shoot hot sex.
As an actor, I've sometimes brought my work home with me inappropriately.
When you're telling your real-life lover in the bedroom' to' you know' bend over while you cake your hand in K-Y, it is a sign that the romance is dead, I think.
Then we turned to the professionals at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
Oh' my God, they totally saved our civil union.
They filmed what was inside of us and not what was coming out of us necessarily.
It helped me see his asshole as not just a come dumpster, but a sign of his beauty' his flower.
It became a, uh, gorgeous orchid.
Orchids grow in sort of the filthiest conditions.
That's what his asshole became to me.
This beautiful flower amidst shit.
- Honey, they get the metaphor.
- I don't think they do.
Let's just say, thank you to Zack and Miri.
It's helped us out, it's helped our friends.
Enrique?
Park?
Park?
Enrique?
Can we get a little love for Zack and Miri?
They don't even know what's going on, they're so pilled up.
But don't take his word for it.
Just ask our co-founders.
- Hi.
I'm Miri Linky Brown.
- I'm Zack Linky Brown.
Here at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, we're dedicated
- to committing your love...
- Or lust.
- to high-end, quality production digital video.
A forever keepsake of your passion.
That's right, Miri.
Why set up a camera at the end of your bed and settle for one unflattering angle, when you could let the professionals dazzle and delight your senses with an array of shots so masterfully rendered you'll swear Martin Scorsese snuck into your room
and caught you fucking?
And remember' we're not just the presidents of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
We're also clients.
ANNOUNCER:
Call now to set up your appointment
LESTER:
Way to fuck, Zack.
Subtitles by LeapinLar
You little motherfucker!
Get up, Zack.
Come on, I don't wanna be late for work.
- Ahh!
Get out!
- Jesus, fuck!
Close the door if you're gonna take a shit.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over, it was not closed.
- Close the door, Zack!
- Okay, okay.
- God.
- Fine.
- What's that thing?
- It's a hand warmer.
We're going now.
- You smell that?
Is that the car?
Fuck.
- Oh, goddamn it.
- What?
What?
- Oh, it's wedged in my taint.
- What is?
- It got wedged in my taint.
- What?
- It's stuck under my balls.
- It's between my balls and my leg.
- What's happening?
- Please, pull over.
Pull the fuck over!
- All right, all right!
Jesus, all right!
It's about to move up to my ass.
What?
The movement makes it hotter.
It's tucked under them.
It's stuck under them.
Oh, fuck.
I think I burned my ball hair off.
It's not funny.
Can you help me pick out an outfit for tonight?
I'm working till 6.
- Well, I can try stuff on at the store.
- The store?
No, how about instead, you get a friend?
But you are my friend.
I mean a girl friend, jeez.
Mr. Delaney, can you work for me tomorrow?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
Then you must come in the next day, I tell you.
- It's Black Friday.
- Black Friday?
It's the biggest mall-shopping day of the year.
And since the mall is just up the street, I would like you to come out and work.
- On Black Friday.
- Oh, yeah.
All right, you want me to work on Moolie Monday too?
- I'm sorry?
- How about Nigga Tuesday?
- Nigga Tuesday?
Is this a new holiday?
- You come to a brother and tell him he gotta work on Black Friday.
You got any idea how racist that sounds?
Telling me to work.
What, you think you own me?
- I never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?
You thought,
"I'm gonna lay down the law for this nigga, I put food on his table, clothes on his nigga baby backs, and he ain't gonna say shit. "
- This ain't Amistad.
- You shut up.
You goddamn right this ain't Amistad.
I can't wait till the post office settles my disability suit because then I'm gonna be out this motherfucker.
I'm gonna be Oprah rich.
Y'all can kiss my ass.
You know what?
Fuck you.
Fuck you, and suck cock.
- To hell with you.
- To hell with you.
- Zachary will work.
Zack, my boy.
- Yeah.
- The customer with the harelip...
- Oh, yeah.
- speak me, say you were playing baseball here the other night.
Wiffle ball.
And, uh, no, that wasn't me.
Maybe the harelip makes it sound like "baseball. "
Yeah, maybe you hear with an accent.
- Fuck you, okay?
- Okay.
One day, I'm gonna put a camera over there, and then I can tell...
I'll know everything you do when I'm gone.
Everything.
Scratch your balls, take a shit, everything, I tell you, okay?
Okay.
Fucker.
I hate both of you ebony and ivory motherfuckers, I tell you.
- Why is he so fucking high-strung?
- "Fuck off, I tell you.
Very good. "
Can you believe that Gandhi motherfucker, telling me I gotta work on Black Friday?
Ain't that some shit?
- Yeah.
- Like I don't wanna do shopping.
Biggest sales day of the year.
I'm getting a flat-screen TV, believe that.
That's my fault, I should tell you.
I asked for Friday morning off, I'm sorry.
- For what?
- I actually need a lot of recovery time.
Tonight is me and Miri's ten-year high school reunion.
I'm just gonna get fucking alcohol poisoning.
- Reunion?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
- Isn't that fucked up that they do that?
They say it's the best chance to get everyone together.
People come back in town for the holidays.
But they could have it in the middle of the summer at a blowjob contest that I was judging' and it would still be retarded.
- So why you going, then?
- Miri's making me go.
Why you always bending over backwards for that girl'
- knowing she ain't giving up no ass?
- We got a good thing going.
She pays half the rent, does dishes, she wakes me up in the morning.
Why complicate that with sex?
Besides, man, I've known her since the first grade.
You don't fuck someone you met in the first grade.
Excuse me, I met my wife in kindergarten.
We got married senior year, and she has been the queen of my world ever since.
- What if you could do it all over again?
- I'd jerk off and live by myself.
That woman is the bane of my existence.
- See?
- Excuse me, can I get a coffee, black?
Can't you see we talking, white?
If you're gonna continue to emasculate me with this Barbie dress-up shit'
I'm using your laptop.
Don't forget to smack it when you turn it on, otherwise the screen doesn't come on.
Why don't you spring and get a new one?
Same reason I don't spring for clothes for tonight, I'm broke.
There's a chick who works at Teen Juice at the mall, you know.
I gave her a good deal on yarn,
- so she's letting me borrow this stuff.
- Yo, bro.
What?
- You're buying a vibrator online.
- What's wrong with the one you have?
It died last week.
Look at the size of those fucking panties.
Shoot that shit.
Shoot it.
My God, who even knew Amazon sold shit like this?
This is incredible.
- Those are fucking granny panties.
Okay,
A, I don't appreciate you violating the sanctity of my Amazon Wish List page' and B, I'm not buying that thing from Amazon, because it turns out I don't have a credit card they take.
- Oh, shit.
- I'm sorry, guys.
Am I in the way?
You're a fucking faggot, all right?
Let's go to Starbucks.
- He's a shitty barista anyways.
- Cock.
- And he throws like a bitch.
You know what else I throw?
My nut sack in your coffees, so how did that taste, fucker?
We saw your girlfriend in her underwear, cunt nugget.
Well, too bad she's not my girlfriend, you little fuck...
Oh, they're gone.
Are you still talking to me?
Uh, just said, I'm gonna look up more fuck toys on Amazon.
Oh, holy shit.
- They sell the Fleshlight here too.
- What's that?
It's a fucking pocket pussy that is shaped like a flashlight
"for discretionary jacking off. "
That way if you get caught, no one thinks it's weird.
You're just a guy who likes to fuck his flashlight.
I am totally buying this shit.
Whoa, if you've got money to burn, how about paying the electric bill?
- That's due already?
- November's is probably due now, but I was talking about September's.
Tell me this doesn't rock.
You kind of look like Ronald McDonald.
That makes me want some McNuggets.
Why would you wanna buy a pocket pussy anyway?
That is so sad.
What?
Excuse me, I forgot about the nobility that accompanies coming with a fucking vibrator.
Think a kid in Darfur gets saved every time a vibrator makes you come?
No.
- "Real feel action"?
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
If you start fucking machines, I'm moving out.
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a machine.
How come you get to fuck something with a motor in it?
I've never met a man who can make me come like a vibrator does.
That's bullshit.
You get to be Buck Rogers having sex in the 25th century with fucking Twiki and Dr. Theopolis.
I'm stuck to a bottle of Jergens in the bathroom.
Holy bejesus.
You do not use my Jergens to jack it in our bathroom.
No, you know what I do actually, is I light a bunch of candles and I sprawl out on my sheets and I listen to Sting.
No, I'm a guy.
Give me two Popsicle sticks and a rubber band,
I'll find a way to fuck it, like a filthy MacGyver.
Oh, my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.
How about this?
I don't get why you're putting so much effert into this thing.
I thought we were just gonna go to sit around and make fun of everybody.
I can't wear anything that I already own and expect to bring home Bobby Long.
Bobby fucking Long?
No way.
Didn't that guy call you "Stinky Linky"?
Yeah, that was then, okay?
Maybe now he can save me a fortune in Amazon bills.
Maybe you can fuck our landlord so we can at least keep a roof over our heads.
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.
Hey, I bought skates with last week's paycheck
- and I need those to skate with.
- Oh.
And this week's will barely cover the past two water bills, so...
Is this sexy?
Yeah, in like a To Catch a Predator kind of way, it is pretty fucking sexy.
Then we're done.
What the fuck?
Zack.
- You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?
- They shut it off.
- Oh, shit.
Just, uh...
Help me get this shit out of my hair.
Just use the water out of the toilet.
- There's poo in there.
- Not that part.
- The back part of the toilet thing.
- Oh, that makes sense.
Take the cup there and then scoop it in, there you go.
Here, I'll lean back and you can just' you know, pour it down like...
Like that.
You're harshing my buzz, you know.
This is so lame.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Whoa!
All right, one hour tops, then we're gone.
Or I had an idea.
We could just not go at all, which would rock.
Even though we're broke and we've never amounted to anything, we're still better than these people, right?
No.
Not at all.
We're probably not even as good as most of them, unless one of them is a crackhead or something.
Just tell me I'm prettier than when we graduated.
You look about the same.
Definitely not prettier, but around the same.
I'm thinner, though, right?
A little?
Not really.
Well, good pep talk.
Fuck.
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.
- You don't recognize us, do you?
- Um, no, sorry.
Zack Brown, Miri Linky.
Were you the one they called Stinky Linky?
Oh, no, no one ever called me that.
Oh.
- Great.
What does yours say?
- What the fuck?
Come on.
- I'm sure I had a nickname.
Nothing?
- All right, you have a great time' and before you go, don't forget your copy of The Roving Roe-Ver.
What the fuck's this shit?
That is not shit, that would be our bi-monthly newsletter.
- Awesome.
- It updates you
- on what everyone's doing.
- Finally.
I love your enthusiasm.
Here you go.
Write your e-mail address on that and I'll be sure to add you to our 800-member-strong mailing list.
We had 800 people in our graduating class?
Yes, and only 250 R. S. V. P.'d.
Doesn't that suck, Mary?
- Miri.
- You married, Bets?
- I am.
Two kids.
- Wow, that's beautiful.
- Awesome.
- You wanna fuck me later?
- Uh, no, I'm married.
- Okay, cool.
If you change your mind,
- I'll be in there getting shitfaced.
- He will.
- Just so you know, I eat the pussy.
- He does.
Ah, tempting.
Again, no.
- Shall we?
- Sir.
Bye, Bets.
Think about it.
Enjoy.
Can I get two beers, please?
You want a beer?
- Yeah.
- Three beers.
- Thank you.
- Here you go.
Is that Zack?
Or am I Zack?
Whoa, ho, ho.
Oh, wow.
- Never gets old, huh?
- The other Zack.
Oh, in my world, nobody calls me "the other Zack,"
now that this guy's not around anymore, huh?
- Get the fuck off of me.
- There can be only one.
- What?
- Highlander, man?
The Kurgan.
Remember?
I'd yell it at you whenever we passed each other in the hallway?
Like it was yesterday, man.
Awesome.
Awesome.
Awesome.
God, you guys have so much to catch up on.
Whoo.
- No.
- I'm gonna let you get to it.
Bitch.
Have you seen that big blowup picture they have of me?
Yeah, it's...
My hair is terrible.
I can't believe I even wore my hair like that.
That's before I knew about styling products, you know.
It makes a big difference in life.
But you live and learn, though, right?
I mean, ten years ago, Pittsburgh, who knew anything about fashion?
Back in the day, our hairstyle, oh...
Hey, stranger.
- Whoa.
Stinky Linky.
- Yeah.
Although it's just Miri now.
- Give me a hug.
- Oh, okay.
- Hi, heh, heh, heh.
- Hi.
Wow.
- How have you been?
- Great, great.
- Yeah?
- You look fantastic.
Wow, that is not something that you would have said to me ten years ago.
- Well, I've grown up.
- Yes.
Yes, you have.
You just look...
Ooh, heh, heh.
- Well, listen to you.
Thank you.
- No, don't thank me, just fuck me.
Roxanne.
Hey.
Someone I like, what are the odds' huh?
Zack Brown, we had four years of Spanish together.
Why does no one recognize me?
- Am I thinner?
Is that it?
- Look at him.
- Who?
- My stupid husband.
No fucking shit.
John Butterfield?
You actually married John Butterfield?
- That's amazing.
- Don't ever get married.
It sucks.
You stop appreciating each other and run out of shit to talk about after the first year.
But look at him now, chatty as fuck.
Flirting up a storm with that cheerleader nimrod Monica Von.
You want me to maybe flirt with you so he can see it, even it up a bit?
I don't wanna get even.
If I was gonna do anything, I'd wanna one-up the asshole.
You can give me a handjob in the girls' locker room.
- Fine, but make it fast.
- Fuck, yeah.
Are you staying in town for a while or...?
Just tonight.
I fly back to L. A. tomorrow.
L. A., wow, Los Angeles.
Gosh, Bobby Long, coming up in the world.
- With Mrs. Long, I bet, huh?
- No, no, no.
No Mrs. Long for me.
- Then can I be honest with you?
- Sure.
Um...
Whew.
I think I need a drink.
Do you need a drink?
Because I need a drink to say this.
- I've got a beer already, so...
- Oh, great, thank you.
I think there's a cigarette butt in there.
Yup.
Sorry about the elbow.
There can be only one.
Can I get a beer, please?
Thank you very much.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
My friend's making an ass of herself hitting on her high school crush.
Oh, God, that's so sad.
It's so Miri, is what it is.
I'm Zack, by the way.
Brandon.
Don't worry, we weren't in the same class or anything.
- Okay.
Lucky you.
- Are you a Monroe-ver?
Well, I went here' let's just leave it at that, I guess.
Do you have one of the large blown-up pictures of your younger self
- hanging around here?
- I do, kind of.
Right there.
Gorgeous.
- Good times.
What do you do?
What brings you here?
I came with somebody who went to school here.
- Really?
- Bobby Long.
No shit.
That's who my friend's hitting on right now.
See right there?
- Really.
- One dressed like Hannah Montana?
In L. A., we call that look "Nickelodeon chic. "
- Wait, L. A.?
Los Angeles?
- California.
That's awesome, man.
What do you do out there?
- I'm an actor.
- Wow, that's really impressive.
- Thank you, thank you.
- In fucking movies?
"Fucking movies. " Pretty much.
Look at you.
What...?
Anything I've seen?
What movies?
Oh, all sorts of movies with all-male casts.
All-male casts.
Like Glengarry Glen Ross?
Like that?
Like Glen and Gary Suck Ross' Meaty Cock and Drop Their Hairy Nuts in His Eager Mouth.
- Is that like a sequel?
- Sort of.
- It's a re-imagining.
- Oh, like The Wiz.
More erotic and with less women.
No women, to be exact.
I apologize in advance if I am out of line here, but are you in gay porn?
- Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?
- I thought you recognized me, that's...
- Oh, okay, I get it.
You're not in my demographic' so I'm not insulted.
- Not really.
Who's your demographic?
- Do you love pussy?
- I do.
- Then not you.
Oh, okay.
I came here tonight hoping to seduce you and bring you back to my apartment and sleep with you to, uh, get back at you, you know, for calling me Stinky Linky all those years ago.
Wow.
That is a weird revenge plot.
- You must be a terrible lay for that.
- What?
No, I'm great.
I mean, I've had enough practice and everything.
That...
Wow, that sounded not good.
I fuck a lot.
That's what I meant to say.
That doesn't sound good either.
Wow.
You're a lot funnier than I remember.
Thank you.
Gosh, you turned out to be such a nice guy.
It just...
You know, it makes it even easier to just...
To just say this.
Would you like to come back to my place and maybe open a bottle of wine and have ourselves a real high school reunion?
- I...
- Hello, Miriam.
Beat it, we're talking.
- I wanted to introduce you to Brandon.
- Salutations.
- Bobby's boyfriend.
- Bobby who?
- Bobby me.
- Bobby Long.
Brandon is the star of such adult fare as
- What was that one called again?
You Better Shut Your Mouth or I'm Gonna Fuck It.
That's right.
I'm surprised I forgot that.
Are you fucking with me?
No, they're fucking with each other.
Oh, my God.
- No.
- What?
Granny Panties?
- Excuse me?
- How can you tell?
This is so crazy.
I was literally just watching you, like, right before we got here.
This is so crazy.
This is you, right?
TEEN 1 My name's Granny Panties, and nobody wants to fuck me.
Nothing's whiter than my big gay ass...
Where'd you get that?
Oh, I entered "gay" and "ass," and it was the top hit.
It's had 200,000 views in three hours.
Honey, you are, like...
I'm jealous right now because you're, like, super famous.
Baby, please take our picture.
I get a picture with Granny Panties.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is awesome.
- All right, smile.
Okay, got it.
- Did you get it?
- Oh, thank you very much.
- E-mail me that.
Oh, because he's the worst photographer.
Okay, good.
- You're gay?
- Yeah.
And I'm on the Internet wearing a diaper?
Who knew you'd come to Pittsburgh and meet a celebrity?
I'm gonna binge-drink now until I pass out.
Okay.
She'll be fine.
So you guys suck each other's cocks, huh?
Oh, like crazy.
Okay, that's enough, I think.
I'm embarrassing him.
I love when he's embarrassed.
He's not living out loud, so he gets all like, ooh.
- You are totally in love, aren't you?
- Zachary, we are.
Wow, I...
Oh, God, I just wanna eat him up, yum, yum.
Save some for me, yum, yum, yum.
- I can't keep my hands off him.
- You've had one too many.
Although he does most of the eating in the sack.
In the sack and of the sack.
All right, that's enough.
Look, you've drunk too much.
You do this every time.
You get too Mary for everybody in the room
- and you can't contain yourself.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
And by containing myself, do you mean containing myself in a closet?
In a closet of denial?
Is that...?
No, no, no.
Holy shit, this just got real.
This is exactly why you haven't met my mother.
You don't know how to ease people into this situation.
- You just force your way in every time.
- I thought, maybe for one second in this godforsaken town, I could be myself.
I'm so sorry.
No, you're right, I should just butch up and pretend that I don't love it when you shove your dick in my mouth.
- This is the best night of my life.
Am I making a spectacle?
- I could make a much bigger scene.
- You really are.
I'm sorry.
Pittsburgh.
Listen up, Monroe-vers.
My name is Brandon St. Randy' and I love Bobby Long.
- Fucking A.
- Is that enough?
Is that enough of a scene?
I could start doing worse than that.
The reason you haven't taken me to your mother's...
Your mother with her makeup and all her drinking, she's in the closet too.
- They fight just like real people.
- I thought I'd be a conduit for you-
Thank you.
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm not.
- Thank you.
- I love you.
- I'll e-mail you.
- Zack, it was so nice to meet you.
And I will be patient with you.
I will be there on your journey.
I will be your Sherpa up the mountain of gayness.
Well, might as well see how many hits Granny Panties is up to, huh?
Did I do that?
Thanks, George.
What kind of evil fucks turn off your power the day...?
No, the night before Thanksgiving?
Who does that?
Can you get an advance on your card?
Fleshlight maxed-out my $200 limit.
Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.
This is bad.
If we don't come up with rent, we're gonna get locked out.
Who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.
Which means by the time we get home, there's no heat either.
Well, I think it's time we put what we always talked about into effect.
- You're gonna have to start hooking.
- You know, you jest, but these are the exact circumstances people find themselves in right before they start having sex for money.
- Yeah.
- Or making porn.
Oh, my God, yeah.
- What?
You got an idea?
We could make a porno.
- Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?
No, that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me?
That's a rad idea.
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend, he said he makes a hundred grand a year because he shoots and distributes his own porno flicks.
If it's so easy, how come everybody doesn't do it?
Because other people have options and dignity, which we do not have, which puts us in an amazingly advantageous position.
Fuck you, I have dignity.
Where?
Is it hidden in your gigantic underpants that are plastered all over the Internet?
Is that where you hide your dignity?
Every woman has a pair of those period panties.
That's, like, a fact.
Okay.
Families.
I bet people don't make porno, because they have families.
But luckily, your parents are dead.
Sorry.
My grandparents are dead.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
So who are we gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone mainstream now.
It's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks in it.
Look at Paris Hilton.
She throat-fucks a guy in night vision, now she's selling fragrances to tweens.
And I'm pretty sure she's legally retarded.
That's for tweens?
Have you seen that Joe Francis guy who made Girls Gone Wild?
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot piece of shit in the world and he has a jet and a fucking island.
Look, there's got to be a less extreme solution to our financial woes here.
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper route.
- I don't have a bike.
- Be a waiter.
No one wants me around their food.
Would you eat food that I gave you?
I would not eat food that you gave me, that's true.
I mean, nobody wants to see us fuck, Zack.
Everybody wants to see anybody fuck.
I hate Rosie O'Donnell, but if someone said, "I got a tape of Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid,"
I'd be like, "Why aren't we watching that right now?"
Because she's famous.
Hello.
So are you.
You're fucking Granny Panties.
My underwear and your ass are famous, we're not.
So who the F would wanna watch us fuck?
- At least 800 people.
- The jerks we went to school with?
- Are you serious?
- Of course.
If you heard that someone we graduated with was in a fucking porno movie, you'd watch it, right?
I'd watch that guy Brandon suck a cock, I just met him.
With this mailing list, we have almost a thousand people that would definitely buy a porno we were in just to be like,
"Hey, I sat next to that guy in Civics.
Look at his fucking dick. "
We sell a thousand copies at 20 bucks a pop, bam, we have paid off our bills.
So, what do you think?
- I don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.
Oh, wow, like you've never done that before.
How many guys have you met in a bar, taken home, banged with your mouth and then never talked to again?
That's what we call a stranger.
Dude, I don't one-night mouth-fuck anybody that I pick up in bars.
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in the porno movie for some weird reason.
I guess...
We could fuck.
- Ew.
- Fuck you.
I mean, you're a nice-enough-looking guy and everything...
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're an all-right-enough-looking girl.
- How does that feel?
- Dude, I'm just saying it'd be weird and wrong, you know, like fucking my brother.
Okay, seriously, we're just talking about sex, okay?
It's for a purpose.
It's for getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.
- Wow.
- Just explain to your private beforehand,
"Look, this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash. "
- Oh, my God.
- What?
You're just doing this because you've always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?
Yes.
I've gone my whole life pretending that I want nothing to do with you, just hoping one day we'd be in such dire financial straits that I could use it to finally make my move on you.
You're just being sarcastic.
- I am.
See, I was pretending to cry right there.
I guess it's not like it'd be creepy, like if we got way too drunk one night and accidentally fucked, you know?
No.
We'd be going in with the understanding that it's...
A business decision.
Strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.
- Right.
- And by end,
I mean, I'll be waxing your ass.
Fuck you.
I'm not even letting you see my ass.
I've seen your ass and the rest of you naked around a billion times already.
- That goes both ways, buddy.
- You've never seen my dick.
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.
Are you kidding?
That party we went to where you got blasted, and Houls dared you to give yourself head, and we all watched you try for, like, an hour.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks by the way, for fucking letting me do that.
Thank you.
Oh, God.
We really do know too much about each other.
See, and this would really just be one more thing.
I mean, look at us.
It's Thanksgiving and we're huddled around a flaming fucking garbage can like a couple of steno bums.
I mean, this could give us a chance to pay off our debt, pay our bills, get a fucking nicer apartment with heat in it maybe.
What are you doing?
Miriam Linky, will you have sex with me on camera for money?
I will.
A producer?
Yeah.
- Guy who gets to finance the movie.
- You think I got that kind of money?
We just need that.
What you're about to spend on the flat screen.
Now I can't get my flat screen?
Fuck that.
No, no, no.
With your cut of the profits, you're gonna get two flat screens.
One in your living room, one in your bathroom.
One in the bathroom?
You know, it's always been my dream to watch shit while I shit.
Everyone with an ass loves to watch shit while they shit.
- I'm gonna make that happen for you.
- I don't know, man.
What else the producer do?
- Um, they help with the casting.
- What's casting?
Finding the people to be in the movie.
- I get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.
Like, I can look at a titty, make sure there ain't no moles on there?
- You can look at both titties, man.
- Man.
I've been looking at the same busted titties for the past almost 20 years.
- I'm due for another new titty.
- Please help us.
Please.
Please.
Yes.
Yes.
I love you.
Well, don't mind that smell.
We had some homeless people squatting in here.
You know, they'd void their bowels everywhere but the bathroom.
Anyway, you pick up the poop and you've got yourself a movie studio.
Why don't we shoot in your apartment?
No power.
You wanna pay our electric bill?
- You motherfuckers...
- We'll take it.
Bring it back.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, God.
Come on.
Why the fuck do I have to do everything?
Fuckers.
Hey, what is that?
Fucking guys.
This fucking team, man.
They fucking suck.
I'm gonna hatefuck the shit out of you, ref.
- Dude.
- It's cool.
- He's my cousin.
- Hey.
Didn't you used to videotape the varsity basketball games in high school?
Just the away games.
I did it because I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.
Which one?
Whichever one wanted to fuck the guy who taped the varsity games.
- Aw.
- Still know how to work a camera?
- Who cares what the title is?
- The porn I liked when I was a kid, it was always, like, a spoof of a popular movie, you know?
Like, um, Edward Penishands.
Okay, so we need a mildly clever, vaguely dirty title, that sounds like a real movie
- and sums up what you're gonna see.
- Correct.
An American Werewolf in Brenda?
Fuckback Mountain?
- Too soon?
A Cock-in-Lips Now?
Next.
Cradle the balls.
Work the shaft.
Jerk my come-crayon and let me color you white.
I need cock and I need it now.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
It's "puss" as in pussy.
Oh, because I was like' who would wanna fuck puss?
I want to slam my ham in your can, woman.
Scene.
- This guy is amazing.
- This guy's great-looking too.
I wanna fuck him.
Hi, my name's Delaney and I'm a producer.
I really don't know what it means.
I'm gonna be honest, this is my first time.
You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna touch you or nothing like that.
- All right.
- I have a wife, you know.
We're happy.
I mean, not happy' but it's cool, you know.
Just so you know, there will be some fucking.
- We'll talk about that if you get the part.
- Okay.
I mean, not
- We won't be fucking, there'll be fucking in the movie.
Like I said, I got a wife.
She don't play that shit.
- She is a crazy bitch.
- Yep.
It's my job as the producer to see what you got.
So if that makes you uncomfortable in any way, you don't have to show me anything you don't wanna show me, because...
I love the movies.
- Lawrence of a Labia.
- No.
- Oh, come on.
- Dawn of the Dick.
Yeah, but how are zombies doing it at all sexy?
I want to eat your brain and your ass.
- Dude.
- Sci-fi.
Yeah.
Close Encounters With a Turd From Behind.
- I don't know what that means.
- Just asses.
Fucking deep in asses.
What?
We're making a porno and we just need to know what you would be or would not be interested in doing.
If anything.
- No anal.
- Oh, definitely no anal.
Anal and hugging.
I don't do ass stuff.
- Anal.
- Ah, fuck.
- Oh, wait, oral.
I like anal.
- Yay.
Okay, well, so, uh, do you have any special skills?
Special skills?
I can get a boner really quick and it sticks straight up.
- Is that really a special skill?
- I think.
- Can you show us what you mean?
- Sure.
Oh, that is special.
Yeah, you're hired, Mr...
- Who are you again?
- Lester.
Lester "The Molester" Cockinshtuff.
- No.
- Wow.
That is the best porn name I've ever heard, man.
I can have a porn name?
- Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.
Are you Granny Panties?
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The panties are actually in the house.
- I'll get them.
- Whoa.
- Star Sex 2:
The Wrath of Cunt.
- We never made a Star Sex 1.
I guess we can lose Star Sex 3:
The Search for Cock, then.
- Cocunt.
- What's that?
It's Cocoon with a cunt.
So Delaney tells us you have a special talent of some sort.
I don't know if I'd call it a special talent, but it's a little something I picked up doing bachelor parties.
It would probably be easier if I just showed you.
- Great.
- The floor is yours.
So a movie, huh?
That could be fun.
Holy fuck.
Her name's Bubbles.
- Invasion of the Potty-Snatchers?
- That's like MAD Magazine stupid.
Well, fuck you, okay?
You try to think of a good sci-fi porno title.
It's hard.
There's gotta be one we haven't thought of that would say it all' not be ridiculously filthy and off-putting, and still have instant recognition with our audience.
- I got it.
- I got it.
- Star Whores.
- Yeah.
It's funny, right?
See, we figured this opens us up to an even bigger sales market beyond the people we went to school with.
People who like comics and sci-fi.
Comics?
Like "Ziggy"?
"Ziggy"?
Is that even in fucking papers anymore?
No, man.
Fuck you. "Ziggy" is a comic' right next to "Family Circus. "
No, like Spider-Man and shit, you know?
There's always a shitload of Star Wars nerds at those comic-book shows.
So we sell them a Princess Leia they can really fucking jerk off to.
- That'd be me, Princess Lay-Her.
- Who am I playing?
You, my friend, are the lead role of Lubed Guy-Baller.
Man, he's gonna be balling dudes?
I thought you said this was boys on girls.
If I have to fuck a guy, okay, but I'd rather fuck a girl.
What's wrong with you, boy?
- We'll change the name to Sky-Baller.
- Sky-Baller.
I will be Hung So-low.
Delaney, my friend, you are On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
Man, I can't be in no porno.
My wife will kill me.
Hump me, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
You're my only hump.
On the other hand, fuck my wife.
Unfortunately, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over does not have any sex in the movie but the droids do, I
- CUP and R2-T-Bag.
I robot.
And Stacey over here is gonna play Darth Vibrator.
- I'm the bad guy?
- She's not a guy, Zack.
I know that because I'm not a fucking idiot.
In our movie, Darth Vibrator is a bad girl who wants to fuck the galaxy, literally, and it's up to Lubed and Hung to stop her with their cocks.
- You and me get to have sex, then?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- I know.
Isn't that awesome?
Hold up, hold up.
So who's all having sex with who in this movie?
As of last night, I was having sex with Zack.
What?
Han Solo ain't never had no sex with Princess Leia in the Star Wars.
Guys, this isn't a literal adaptation here.
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.
Kind of like The Wiz or like a parody.
With lots of anal.
- Cool.
- I know, isn't that awesome?
I have a question, do Princess Lay-Her and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?
Uh, no, because they're brother and sister, and according to Miri' brothers and sisters can't fuck.
But you said, that this wasn't a literal translation, so that means Lester's character could have sex with Miri's character.
Because I would love to fucking eat her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.
Dream on, pal, it's never gonna happen, okay?
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See, she's fine...
Wait, what?
Yep.
I mean, everyone else is having sex with more than one person in this movie all of a sudden, so I think it's, you know, not fair if I'm only fucking you.
Guys, read amongst yourselves, okay?
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Look, Miri, we got plenty of sex going on in this thing, you don't have to do that.
Zack, it's fine.
I mean I have slept with way worse-looking guys than Lester.
I just wanna do my part for the movie like everyone else.
You're having sex in the movie, you don't need to fuck someone else.
- You're good.
- I'm only fucking you, though.
So don't we need to vary it up to keep it fair?
Fair for...?
I don't...
What?
Fair for who?
What are these, blood diamonds we're talking about?
Fair for everyone else who is fucking more than one person, a. k. a. you, in the movie.
- I mean, fine...
- All right.
I mean, if you don't care...
I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
Fuck.
I don't give a shit.
Like you said, you know, you've fucked bigger idiots than Lester.
Holy shit.
Are we really gonna shoot this in outer space?
Maybe not bigger idiots.
Thank you.
- Cut.
All right, guys, that's it.
- Yeah.
Make sure you leave your costume so we know they're here for tomorrow.
Mostly, everybody, thank you so much for helping us get ready, you know.
Cleaning this place out, building the sets, sewing the costumes, it's just...
I mean, it's really amazing.
Thank you.
Seriously, thanks.
But this is just the beginning, guys.
If Star Whores works, and it will' we are set up for sequels galore.
The Empire Strikes Ass.
- Return of the Brown-Eye.
- The Phantom Man-Ass.
And Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter.
- Okay.
- Revenge of the Shit.
- You got it?
- Yeah, no, we got it.
Ew.
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.
- We'll talk about that one.
We're gonna have a lot of fun' but more importantly, we're gonna make a lot of fucking money, okay?
- Yeah.
- So get ready for greatness, people.
Tomorrow we start principal photography.
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
- All right, good night, you guys.
- We got a movie.
- What?
- Nothing.
I think someone should acknowledge how insane and amazing this is
- and it's all because of you.
- I don't know.
It's just a porno.
You know what I mean.
You've really come into your own.
Shut the fuck up.
So speaking of coming into things' ready for tomorrow?
Twenty years' we're finally gonna know what it's like to have sex with each other.
You say that like you've been wondering what it'd be like to sleep with me for a while now.
Why the fuck do you think I started hanging out with you?
I knew it.
Here, help.
Let's just promise that it's not gonna change anything between us, okay?
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Some guys can't keep sex in perspective.
If anyone's gotta keep this in perspective, it's you, okay?
I don't want you getting all mushy and gooey on me after I give you the best orgasm you've ever had.
Oh, like you know what you're doing down there at all.
I actually don't.
Where's the clitoris?
Is it in your ass?
Just, you know, make sure you kind of whoop it up and act like I'm a stud who knows what he's doing, okay?
Just be a pal.
Oh, dude, I am gonna Meryl Streep the fuck out of this tomorrow, you watch.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
No.
Really, thank you.
For everything.
You're welcome.
Less than 12 hours and we make Monroeville history.
- I really hope nothing goes wrong.
- It's a movie.
What could go wrong?
What are you doing?
What's up?
- What the fuck?
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait.
- Wait.
- Stop.
Stop.
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck is going on?
Condos is what's going on, as soon as this shit-hole's demo'd.
No, you gotta stop it right now.
We rented this place for a month from Mr. Jenkins.
Sounds like your Mr. Jenkins was full of shit.
Luxury Homesteads bought this place a month ago.
I'm gonna kill that lying old fuck.
You're gonna have to go Florida, that's where he moved.
We've got thousands of dollars of equipment in there.
- Please.
- If you wanna sift through this rubble when we're done, be my guest.
Hey, get that fucking beam down.
This is the last thing you wanna hear.
If you don't get an advance,
I don't think we're gonna keep a roof over our heads.
I got an advance already.
It went into all the costumes.
- So all our money's gone?
- All your money?
Never mind what my wife's gonna do when there ain't no new snow tires, or when she sees I charged a video camera.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this, man.
I just wanted to see some free titties.
That's all.
But there's no such thing as free titties, is there, Zack?
- Is there?
- Fuck this noise.
Why don't we get another camera, and shoot something else?
Where are we gonna do that?
Got another sound stage?
Sound stage?
We had a shit-covered garage we turned into a sound stage.
We find someplace new and we do it again.
How?
Okay, I'm broke, man.
No, make that, I was broke.
Now I am really tapped out.
I have to get another job to pay Delaney back.
So please tell me, how can I afford to start over?
- What can I get you?
- Yeah, can I get a, uh...?
Too fucking late.
Cappuccino, 3.50.
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
I mean, I'm a total loser in every single other aspect of my life.
What made me think I could do something as simple as filming people fucking?
We have no money left, nowhere to shoot, no sets, we have no fucking cameras.
Here.
It's time I go back to my regular life where I am a quiet fuckup who doesn't cost anybody any money and knows his goddamn position behind this fucking counter making cappuccinos for this fucking guy.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Fuck, yes.
Zack.
You sneaky Indian motherfucker.
I tell you, yes.
Swallow My Cockuccino.
- What?
- That's it.
That's the movie.
Why didn't I think of it before?
We don't need sets or a stage.
Look at all this production value, waiting to have balls on it.
Hold up.
You wanna shoot a dirty movie here, where we work?
Yes.
Fuck, yes, I do.
You know how many stories I have from working here?
How many times I've been laid right there after hours?
You've never gotten laid here after hours.
I know.
Thank you for reminding me.
But I always wish I had, and that's what porno is.
It's fantasy.
It's taking the normal and making it abnormal by fucking it.
Don't do that.
The little dog don't like that.
How did you get a camera?
By being a terrible, untrustworthy employee, that's how.
Give me today, I'll bang out a script.
Meet me back here after closing.
We're gonna launch arching ropes of jism all over this motherfucker.
Peace.
I like that guy but if he tries to fuck that little dog tonight for real,
I'm calling the Humane Society.
It's called Bean-N-Gone, so get the fuck out of here.
Hey, Barry.
Stand by, Stace, picture's up.
- Okay.
Roll tape.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 12, Take 1.
And action.
I'd like a double espresso so I can stay up all night because I'm in the mood to fuck.
Well, I am a whore-ista, so I love to fuck.
Would you like to fuck me?
Holy fuck.
You mean, after you're done with your shift?
I mean during my shift.
- Sorry.
- Keep going, keep going.
With your shaft.
Let us fuck.
Cue music.
Okay, open up to camera, guys.
Let us see it.
More tongue.
Little less tongue.
Oh, that was good.
Cue effects.
Oh, yeah, like that.
Oh, yeah.
See, I told you it would work.
Didn't I tell you?
It looks amazing.
It's incredible.
Oh, the beans hurt.
Easy.
- Move in for coverage.
- Nice.
That's why we got him.
- Nice.
I'm impressed.
- Get in there, Deacon.
- Come on.
- Like that?
Like that.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
- Pull out a bit, actually.
- That's hot.
No, not you, Lester.
Put it back in.
Kiss the muscle.
- I kiss the muscle.
- You kiss the muscle.
- Can he slap her ass a little?
- Don't be a fucking pervert, dude.
- Stir, come on.
Stir.
- Yeah, stir it.
Stir it, baby.
Hey.
- Holy.
- Shit.
Are you guys still open?
No.
We close at 9.
I need coffee so I'm drive home.
- Okay.
Yeah.
Thank you.
That's a cute kitty.
Okay.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You guys see the game?
I was at it.
Fucking Roethlisberger, the quarterback, was all fucking'
"Hug it, chug it, football.
All night. " Heh-heh.
Okay, pal, here you go.
On the house.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Have a good one.
- Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- I said, have a good one.
Oh.
- Okay.
Keep moving.
You and your little dog.
Go Steelers.
Action.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, like that.
Oh, fuck it, chuck it, football.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, God, this is good.
You take it.
You take it.
Take it, Barry.
Oh, take it.
Take it, Barry.
Take it.
I'm disturbed at how turned on I am by this.
- Shit, dude, it's almost 6.
- Oh, fuck.
Okay, that's a wrap, everybody, yeah.
Let's give a hand to our hotties with the bodies from last night.
Stacey, Lester, Bubbles, Barry, whoo.
Yeah.
Nice.
Okay, when we come back tonight, we finish up the venti-vulva scene, and then we get into me and Miri's stuff.
Again, amazing first night, everybody.
Thank you so much.
Let us fuck.
- Hey, how'd it look?
- How do you think it looked?
It looked like shit going into other shit, in focus.
What an artist.
That was Kurosawa's motto. "Shit going into other shit. "
Oh, man, I can't believe you gotta work now.
It's okay.
You know, honestly, I don't think I could sleep.
- I'm pretty, like, pumped up right now.
- Right?
It was amazing.
It was awesome.
I think the cast and crew had a good time.
- We were getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.
I just wanna keep shooting people boning all day.
I don't think I've ever met the ambitious Zack Brown before.
- Well, I'm trying to pay the bills, so...
- It's not a bad thing.
I think it looks good on you.
Come on, hurry.
Come on, come on, come on.
Wait a minute.
- You guys never did it before?
It's fine.
You know, we talked about it and it's just for the movie.
We're friends, you know' we're just friends.
And we will always just be just friends, so...
Listen, I have some extra lube from last night.
I understand it's kind of hard getting wet when everyone's watching.
At least it was for Barry.
- I don't know if I am gonna need it.
- Really?
Yeah, I think I'm just excited.
Uh-huh.
At the idea of people watching' not because of Zack.
Oh, God.
Zack could never have that effect on me in a million years.
- Hello, Miriam.
- Oh, hey.
Wow.
- Your face.
- Yeah.
Weird, huh?
I don't think I've seen your face since senior year.
I think I made a mistake.
I did it for you so you wouldn't get road rash during our scene, but I should have asked first' I look like a fucking beluga whale.
I think I'll be going now.
Okay.
All I keep thinking is we should've done a trial run at home last week or something.
- Oh, my God.
Right?
- I know.
- You're still cool to do it, though, right?
- Yeah, um.
Totally.
Are you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I'm, uh...
- Honestly, I'm a little nervous, I guess.
- You are?
- It's kind of a big deal.
- It is?
Yeah, you know, it's our first time together since our auspicious debut on viral video.
Oh, yeah.
That's a fuckload of pressure for a director.
As a director, please.
What about the anxiety I'm feeling as an actress?
- Did I pick the right project?
- Yeah.
What about this follow-up?
Julia Roberts followed Pretty Waman with Sleeping With the Enemy.
I'm following Granny Panties with Swallow My Cockuccino.
Only difference is this movie's about cock-sucking and her movie just sucked cock, period.
- The only difference, yeah.
- The end was pretty rad.
I liked that.
- When she kills him.
- With a gun.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- She calls the cops first.
- She calls it in first.
- It was so awesome.
- Awesome, yeah.
So I guess we should do this.
I think we should probably wait just until I lose another 20 or 30 pounds.
Stop it.
You look good.
Thanks.
So, what about me?
How do I look?
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful, so I guess it's not a big deal, but you look amazing.
- Okay.
Let's go make a porno.
- Okay.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 8, Take 1.
- Come here.
- I'm over...?
All right, settle.
Action.
Who could it be?
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm a delivery man and I have some cream for you.
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.
I work out.
So do you want me to give you your cream now?
I've been waiting for it all day.
- Fuck.
Come on.
- Oops.
Keep going.
I spilled my cream.
Do you mind?
I don't mind.
Especially if you spill it on my face.
Let us fuck.
- Fix my shirt.
Think I should?
- Okay.
Let me see them titties.
Actually, you know what?
Sorry, I don't think we should show them.
- What?
- We shouldn't show your breasts.
- Aren't you gonna take your shirt off?
- I'm just gonna open it.
You're not gonna take it off?
Why not?
My tits are bigger than yours.
I don't wanna show that.
She's not gonna show her tits?
I showed my cock and my asshole.
- Okay, I'll do your pants.
- Back and forth. okay.
- Holy shit.
- Where's that delivery?
I can't believe this.
I was delivering cream, and look what's happening.
- Jesus, what is that, a rumba?
- What's a rumba?
That awkward movement.
- Should I take your underpants off?
- Yeah, take them off.
What the fuck?
How does this work?
They're just like...
I'll do it.
- I'll do mine, you just...
You do yours.
- I'll do my pants.
Granny panties.
Just get on with it already.
I'm gonna fuck you with my pecker.
Dude, that's really dirty.
- That's too dirty?
- That offends me.
- Penis?
- Fine.
- I'm gonna fuck you with my penis.
- I can't wait.
For my penis.
Be careful, Miri.
Okay, there we go.
Just keep rolling, keep rolling.
- I'll walk forward.
- Fucking cream is coming.
This is the worst porno I've ever seen.
Get over here, delivery man.
Let's fuck on these beans.
- You okay?
- Yup.
Okay, all right.
- Just leave them.
Just leave them.
- They're really distracting.
- You should leave them.
- You gotta get your...
There you go.
Okay, okay.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.
This okay?
Okay.
Okay, uh.
- We'll start kissing on three, okay?
- Okay.
One, two, three.
Go.
I'm ready.
- I'm ready.
- Okay.
Deacon.
- Deacon.
Deacon.
- What?
Did you see Lost this week, man?
I missed it.
What happened?
They're on the island, off the island.
Who can follow that?
I think they're in hell.
Would you all shut the motherfuck up?
I want you to come.
- I want you to come with me.
- Okay.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Cut.
That's it?
It's over?
Ain't he supposed to come on her titties?
Well, it wasn't what we'd shot-listed' but that was nice.
- It was so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack.
Thanks, Lester, uh.
It wasn't just me, though, guys.
Give it up for my radiant costar here, Miri.
Nice.
- Um, show's over in here.
Let's move out' start lighting the next scene.
- All right.
- Let's do it.
- You looked so beautiful.
- Thanks.
I thought they were gonna be fucking hard.
- It was pretty.
- Pretty don't sell.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
You good, Mir?
You need anything?
I'm just gonna take a minute, okay?
Okay, uh.
I'll just be out there.
Yeah.
- That was fun.
- Yeah, fun.
ZACK "Fun. " You fucking douche.
Wow.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You working on a rewrite?
- Yeah, just for tonight's scene.
- I'm ready to go when you are, though.
- Okay.
You know, before we go, I...
I'm thinking that, uh, it's a good idea if we talk about what happened last night.
- Oh.
- I mean, we don't have to, but I think...
Okay, yeah, uh.
I kind of dropped the ball on that, I guess, huh?
- No, no.
It's...
- To be honest, it was...
You know, I didn't realize how weird it would be for me.
Weird?
Like...
Weird how?
Acting and directing at the same time.
It's a lot to process, you know.
For the first time, I thought my balls didn't have enough hair on them.
That's not what I meant.
I know what you meant.
How you feeling about it?
I guess, um...
I feel like...
Like we...
- Holy fuck.
- The power's on.
Did you do this?
How did this happen?
I burned the bills.
How could we have done that?
- The water.
- The water.
Come on, come on, come on.
Yeah!
- We can shower in our home again.
- We are liquid.
Greetings.
Have you heard the good news about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?
Oh, my God, did you guys do this?
We got tired of you taking showers at our places all the time.
So we took up a collection amongst ourselves.
And chipped away at your mountain of debt.
You guys paid off our massive utilities bills?
- How did you afford that?
- I stole my old lady's bingo winnings.
And Mistress Bubbles did a bachelor party tonight at which yours truly was a guest star, thank you very much.
- Oh.
- Whoa.
Don't get too excited.
We didn't pay off your whole bill.
Just a month of each.
They agreed to turn everything back on?
At 9 at night?
How does that work?
Stacey knows somebody that works at Power and Light.
- You guys...
- This is amazing.
You didn't have to do this.
You didn't have to put us in your movie.
- Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.
- Or put us in your movie either.
- We said that already.
Guys, honestly, I don't know what to say.
You can start by saying we can take tonight off so we can have our wrap party right now.
Guys, we're not wrapped.
We still have four days of shooting left.
Excuse me.
In my "producorial" capacity,
I'm shutting the movie down for a night so we can get a little silly.
Go, go, go.
- Yes.
- Yes.
You all drink.
Was it just amazing with him, after all those years of not knowing?
It was, um, weird.
- But good.
- My scene with Zack's tomorrow.
You don't say.
But I'm a little nervous.
I was thinking about trying to get with him tonight.
- Really?
- I mean, if you don't mind.
You are just friends and all' so I didn't think it would be a biggie.
- It wouldn't be a biggie, would it?
- No.
No, no.
It's not a biggie.
What?
No.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Stacey' I'm not married to the guy, so...
I don't know.
You guys just looked kind of intimate last night.
- We did?
- Yeah.
Well, we're just better actors than I thought, I think, so you know what?
If you wanna get with him' you should just go ask him.
- He'd be really excited to hear that.
- Yeah?
For real, you don't mind?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
All the quarters are on the ground.
- Hey, Stace.
- Hey, Zack.
Come on, are you guys playing or what?
Well, I'm bummed, but I totally get it.
It's no problem to work with Lester again.
He has a nice cock.
Well, you're a trouper, Stace.
Oh, but if I start making weird faces or anything during the scene' it's just because I've been constipated all day.
Oh, shit, uh.
We don't have to shoot the scene tonight.
No, I want to.
Anal's great for when you're constipated.
It totally loosens you up.
I use ex-lax, but good to know.
Okay, I never thought I would have that conversation.
So are we starting with Lester and Stacey tonight?
We were supposed to start with Lester and Miri.
I know.
She...
We're not gonna do that.
I don't think Miri's gonna do that.
Hey.
So where are we shooting this?
Over here?
- What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.
Our scene's tonight, right?
Can I talk to you for a minute in the back?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
What do you want me to shoot here?
Start with the close-ups of Lester and Stacey.
Give me a second, man.
What an artist.
Okay, uh.
Did I do something wrong to you?
No.
Then why are you here?
I'm here for the same reason you're here.
To make the movie.
Okay, just, like' for your own personal information, you're acting really weird right now.
I'm acting weird?
I think you're acting weird right now.
Oh, I'm acting...
How exactly am I acting weird?
You've been trying to keep me from fucking anybody but you since we started this thing.
Maybe I was thinking about your feelings.
Were you thinking of my feelings when you were banging Stacey?
Because that'd be really sad for Stacey.
She told me that you told her that that was okay.
I told her that it was okay to ask you.
Holy shit.
I get it.
I fucking get it.
It was a test.
That whole thing was a fucking test, is that it?
If it was, how do you think you did?
We had a discussion, Miri.
We had...
Actually, we had many discussions about how it was just sex
- and how we wouldn't let it get weird.
- I'm not acting weird.
You're acting like a jealous girlfriend is what the fuck you're acting like.
- I am not your girlfriend.
- I know that.
You're not my boyfriend, so why are we having this conversation right now?
Because you're about to fuck Lester to spite me, it seems like.
Did you fuck Stacey to spite me?
No.
You fucked her like you fucked every other bitch and never gave a shit how I felt about it.
- Well, that was before.
- Before what?
Look, don't fucking pretend that the other night, you and me, right there, that that didn't mean anything to you, that you didn't feel it too.
Oh.
You're not getting all gooey on me here, are you, Zack?
You know what?
If you were any other bitch I didn't give a rat's ass about,
I would tell you to go fuck yourself right now because I fucking hate this game-playing shit.
But you, you mean more to me than that' so I'm just gonna lay this out on front street.
I know you felt something big, something real the other night when we were together because I felt it too.
We tried to fuck and instead, we wound up making love.
So if this is what you need to hear in order to keep you from fucking Lester, if this is what you need, then fine.
Here it is, I'm gonna say it.
I love you, Miri.
Happy?
Oh, Jesus.
You better get a hold of yourself, Zack, because we just fucked.
Okay.
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?
But you did.
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.
Wait...
All right, don't forget I'm down here.
Watch that pullout, huh?
Yeah.
Mmm.
This is some damn good coffee.
- Where you going?
- Getting the fuck out of here.
We gotta finish this movie.
Yo!
You believe this shit?
Do you believe this shit?
What the fuck just happened in there?
I'll tell you what just happened in there.
That chick frosted me like I was a fucking cake.
Zack.
Okay, seriously' get a picture of me right now.
I'm hunting humans.
- Dude, check it out.
Ooh.
- Oh, shit.
Seriously, let's shoot the shit out of this bitch.
- Where you aiming at?
- Cock shots?
Cock shots.
We shot you in the balls, cunt nugget.
Well, it's my job to get shot in the balls, so...
Oh, they're gone.
Excuse me.
Didn't you used to work at the Bean-N-Gone in Monroeville?
I sure as shit hope this pays better, I tell you.
So why don't they just shoot you with a puck?
What do you mean?
I mean, what does paintball got to do with hockey?
Nothing, I guess.
- So ain't no prizes or...?
- No, no.
So, what are they paying $5 for?
To shoot a Broad Street Bully in the balls.
White people are fucked up.
Yup, they sure are.
It's a living.
You've been getting the checks I've been sending?
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Probably didn't save you from a brutal tongue-lashing, though, huh?
You know, the wife never found out about the camera, because I paid off the bills.
How did you manage that?
- Because now I'm Oprah rich.
- No way.
- The post office fucking settled?
- Hundred-sixty large, son.
- Nice, man.
Congratulations.
- A beautiful day, thank you very much.
I thought you made that whole thing up.
No, no.
It was very real.
You can believe it.
Even though she's spending all of it.
Well, since you ain't gonna ask me, I'll just go ahead and tell you.
- No, I have not seen Miri.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.
Oh, I suppose you weren't gonna ask about your movie, neither?
Look, that's why I came down here.
I need you to come take a look at it.
- I'm not interested.
Sorry.
- You'd better get interested
- because you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?
The story doesn't make sense.
- The story?
- The story doesn't make sense.
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?
It's a movie, dog, and a movie's gotta have an ending, which we don't have at the moment.
Come shot, credits.
There's your fucking ending.
Do me this favor, okay?
When you're done getting your nuts blown off' come back to humble Monroeville to my crib for a couple hours' check out the flick, you tell me what's missing.
No.
I'll tell you what, you do that, you don't owe me shit no more.
- Really?
- Really.
- Is your wife home?
- Yes.
- Maybe I should leave the pads on.
- You got some extra ones?
Hey, honey.
Where the fuck you been?
And who in the fuck is this now?
Would you calm down, woman?
Goddamn.
You already left one white boy down in my basement while you off gallivanting and shit.
What if this motherfucker
- was all grabby on me?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
Oh, what in the fuck is that supposed to mean?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
- White boys love me.
White boy.
- I said, white boy.
- Yeah?
You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?
- Should I say yes?
- Just say yes.
Yeah.
- Why don't you, uh, head downstairs?
- Oh, okay.
It's just through this hallway.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
What the fuck you looking at?
Why you gotta be yelling at me in front of my director?
- Oh, he's a director?
- Yeah.
I didn't know that.
Shit, he's a director.
Well, why don't he direct my ass to a new husband?
How about that shit?
- That's the bedroom.
Keep talking, maybe he will.
Oh, don't nobody want them saggy-ass balls!
Saggy balls?
Look at these sagging-ass titties you got around here.
- You could tie these together.
- Motherfucker, we match.
Oh, shit.
Where's my paintball gun at?
Look at you, editor and DP.
You got your shit covered, man.
Please, don't ever say "shit-covered" to me again.
Roll the film for the man, please, so we can see what he thinks.
Just jump through it.
I ain't got all night.
The bitch is on me.
"Nigga Rich Productions. " Classy.
- Yeah, DreamWorks was taken.
- Was it?
Plus, it sounds like an underground gay fuck club.
"I met a guy at DreamWorks. " Yeah.
All right, so we got Lester and Stacey fucking.
Then we got Barry and Bubbles fucking.
And then this boring bullshit.
Okay, just, uh, go to the next scene, would you?
Uh...
- What next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?
We never shot it.
- Why not?
- Because after you left that night,
Miri came out of the backroom and said she couldn't do it.
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped?
So...
- Wait, so Miri...
- Never fucked nobody.
Just you.
Now, I wonder why she did that.
- Hm.
- Hm.
You see, there was a time when I was just a bitter old fuck making coffees, and Stacey was just a lap dancer and Barry and Bubbles didn't know each other and this fool here, hell, I don't even know what he was.
- A white supremacist.
- Man, fuck you.
Then two people come along and showed us something we didn't know existed.
A world of possibilities where plain old people just like us could do something special.
Even if it's something as simple as filming people fucking.
Sometimes we just need someone to show us something we can't see for ourselves
and then we're changed forever.
So as you can see' our movie ain't got no ending.
Every movie needs an ending' don't it?
Peace.
Delaney, you're a slick cupid motherfucker.
Ain't love grand?
Why the fuck is this white boy running through my goddamn house?
Sometimes.
Miri.
- Miri.
- Zack?
Miri.
I'm sorry.
Get out.
- Close the door.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over...
- Just close the fucking door, Zack.
I never slept with Stacey that night, okay?
I swear to God.
When we got into my room, you know what we did?
We talked about you, and us and how things were different and how I was too much of a fucking pussy to just tell you how I felt about you.
And I know...
I know that that's only because of all the stupid shit we said about how we wouldn't let sex change us, but it did.
It changed me.
That has to be love, right?
It has to be love and just so you know, I can't go back to being just friends anymore,
- because I just can't.
- Good.
And I think...
I think that you feel the same way.
Because that night after I left, you didn't fuck Lester.
What's up, Zack?
You know what?
I don't care that you're fucking Lester, okay?
How's that?
- Oh, shit.
- I don't wanna be with anyone but you.
So I will wait forever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life because I love you, and I have for as long as I can remember.
And I would rather die than be without you, Miriam Linky.
Miri's last name is Linky?
You're gonna fuck a guy who doesn't know your last name?
Or that you beat up Carl Roth in the sixth grade?
I know that.
Or what your senior prom dress would've looked like had we gone but we decided not to, and we got drunk alone instead.
Or that you washed your hair in the toilet.
We're not fucking, Zack.
Or that you're not fucking Zack...
What?
I asked her to fuck me.
She wouldn't do it.
I even tried to talk her into giving me the fucking Dutch rudder.
Shot me down on that too.
- And a Dutch rudder is?
- Don't know what a Dutch rudder...?
All right, you grab your dick, then you have someone else work your arm.
Here, let me show you.
All right, grab my arm.
I'm grabbing my dick, you're grabbing my arm.
Now work it.
Work my arm.
See that shit?
Work it up and down.
It's like someone else is jerking you off.
Okay.
There's the double Dutch rudder, which, I grab my dick, you grab your dick, you work my arm, I work your arm' same time.
It's like jerking off together but not gay.
We're not touching dicks, each other's dicks anyway.
I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.
It feels good, sir.
Try me, come on.
Sorry to change the subject on you, Lester, but if you're not fucking Miri, why is your dick out right now?
Because I live here now, and I like to be naked.
- What?
- When you moved out, she couldn't afford to pay her rent by herself, so I moved in to help.
But you just came out of her room.
That's my room now.
She moved in your old room.
Wait, wait, wait.
She changed rooms?
Yeah, she said she did it because she missed the smell of you or some shit.
I don't smell anything.
But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.
- Night, Zack.
- Night.
Do you?
Then why are you crying?
Because I missed you so much.
Me too.
I love you.
- I love you, I love you.
I love you.
I don't mean to alarm you but I think I just jerked off Lester a little bit.
- The Dutch rudder?
- Yeah, it's ingenious, right?
If you ask me nicely, I will Dutch-rudder you the rest of our lives.
Good.
I'm getting tired of fucking the Fleshlight.
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.
- What'd it feel like?
- Like fucking a flashlight.
- Wrong room.
- Oh, God.
That's gross.
Let us fuck.
Hello.
Welcome to Nigga Rich Productions' home of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, the production house for the couple looking to put a little spice in their sex life.
- Shall we take a look around?
- Fuck me so hard.
Oh, God.
First, you'll meet for a consultation with one of our romance-ologists, who'll coach you through that initial awkward stage before you're camera-ready.
So we will start off with some erotic massage and some...
Dude.
Some light petting.
That sounds good.
Are you guys sure you don't wanna do some, uh, butt-sack work too?
- Uh, let's move on, shall we?
- Why?
From their break-out hit, Swallow My Cockuccino, to the multi-million selling Swallow My Cockuccino II and the award-winning Star Whores saga, including Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter,
Zack and Miri have proven time and again that they know how to shoot hot sex.
As an actor, I've sometimes brought my work home with me inappropriately.
When you're telling your real-life lover in the bedroom' to, you know, bend over while you cake your hand in K-Y, it is a sign that the romance is dead, I think.
Then we turned to the professionals at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
Oh, my God, they totally saved our civil union.
They filmed what was inside of us and not what was coming out of us necessarily.
It helped me see his asshole as not just a come dumpster, but a sign of his beauty, his flower.
It became a, uh, gorgeous orchid.
Orchids grow in sort of the filthiest conditions.
That's what his asshole became to me.
This beautiful flower amidst shit.
- Honey, they get the metaphor.
- I don't think they do.
Let's just say, thank you to Zack and Miri.
It's helped us out, it's helped our friends.
Enrique?
Park?
Park?
Enrique?
Can we get a little love for Zack and Miri?
They don't even know what's going on, they're so pilled up.
But don't take his word for it.
Just ask our co-founders.
- Hi.
I'm Miri Linky Brown.
- I'm Zack Linky Brown.
Here at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, we're dedicated
- to committing your love...
- Or lust.
- to high-end, quality production digital video.
A forever keepsake of your passion.
That's right, Miri.
Why set up a camera at the end of your bed and settle for one unflattering angle, when you could let the professionals dazzle and delight your senses with an array of shots so masterfully rendered you'll swear Martin Scorsese snuck into your room
and caught you fucking?
And remember' we're not just the presidents of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
We're also clients.
Call now to set up your appointment
Way to fuck, Zack.

It's not funny.
Can you help me pick out an outfit for tonight?
I'm working till 6.
- Well' l can try stuff on at the store.
- The store?
No, how about instead, you get a friend?
But you are my friend.
I mean a girl friend, jeez.
[JAZZ music playing OVER SPEAKERS]
Mr. Delaney, can you work for me tomorrow?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
Then you must come in the next day, I tell you.
- lt's black Friday.
- Black Friday?
It's the biggest mall-shopping day of the year.
And since the mall is just up the street, I would like you to come out and work.
- On Black Friday.
- Oh, yeah.
All right, you want me to work on Moolie Monday too?
- l'm sorry?
- How about Nigga Tuesday?
- Nigga Tuesday?
Is this a new holiday?
- You come to a brother and tell him he gotta work on Black Friday.
You got any idea how racist that sounds?
Telling me to work.
What, you think you own me?
- l never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?
You thought,
"l'm gonna lay down the law for this nigga, I put food on his table, clothes on his nigga baby backs, and he ain't gonna say shit."
- This ain't Amistad.
- You shut up.
You goddamn right this ain't Amistad.
I can't wait till the post office settles my disability suit because then I'm gonna be out this motherfucker.
I'm gonna be Oprah rich.
Y'all can kiss my ass.
You know what?
Fuck you.
Fuck you, and suck cock.
- To hell with you.
DELANEY:
To hell with you.
- Zachary will work.
Zack' my boy.
- Yeah.
- The customer with the hareIip--
- Oh, yeah.
--speak me, say you were playing baseball here the other night.
Wiffle ball.
And' uh' no' that wasn't me.
Maybe the harelip makes it sound like "baseball."
ZACK:
Yeah, maybe you hear with an accent.
- Fuck you, okay?
- Okay.
One day' l'm gonna put a camera over there' and then I can tell--
I'll know everything you do when I'm gone.
Everything.
Scratch your balls, take a shit, everything, I tell you, okay?
Okay.
Fucker.
I hate both of you ebony and ivory motherfuckers, I tell you.
- Why is he so fucking high-strung?
- "Fuck off, I tell you.
Very good."
Can you believe that Gandhi motherfucker, telling me I gotta work on Black Friday?
Ain't that some shit?
- Yeah.
- Like I don't wanna do shopping.
Biggest sales day of the year. I'm getting a flat-screen TV, believe that.
That's my fault, I should tell you. I asked for Friday morning off, I'm sorry.
- For what?
- l actually need a lot of recovery time.
Tonight is me and Miri's ten-year high school reunion.
I'm just gonna get fucking alcohol poisoning.
- Reunion?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
- lsn't that fucked up that they do that?
They say it's the best chance to get everyone together.
People come back in town for the holidays.
But they could have it in the middle of the summer at a blowjob contest that I was judging' and it would still be retarded.
- So why you going, then?
- Miri's making me go.
Why you always bending over backwards for that girI'
- knowing she ain't giving up no ass?
- We got a good thing going.
She pays half the rent, does dishes, she wakes me up in the morning.
Why complicate that with sex?
Besides, man, I've known her since the first grade.
You don't fuck someone you met in the first grade.
Excuse me, I met my wife in kindergarten.
We got married senior year, and she has been the queen of my world ever since.
- What if you could do it all over again?
- l'd jerk off and live by myself.
That woman is the bane of my existence.
- See?
- Excuse me, can I get a coffee, black?
Can't you see we talking, white?
ZACK:
If you're gonna continue to emasculate me with this Barbie dress-up shit'
I'm using your laptop.
Don't forget to smack it when you turn it on, otherwise the screen doesn't come on.
[COMPUTER PLAYS FANFARE]
Why don't you spring and get a new one?
Same reason I don't spring for clothes for tonight, I'm broke.
There's a chick who works at Teen Juice at the mall, you know.
I gave her a good deal on yarn,
- so she's letting me borrow this stuff.
- Yo, bro.
[ZACK laughing]
MlRl:
What?
- You're buying a vibrator online.
- What's wrong with the one you have?
MlRl:
It died last week.
Look at the size of those fucking panties.
Shoot that shit.
Shoot it.
ZACK:
My God, who even knew Amazon sold shit like this?
This is incredible.
- Those are fucking granny panties.
MlRl:
Okay,
A, I don't appreciate you violating the sanctity of my Amazon Wish List page' and B, I'm not buying that thing from Amazon, because it turns out I don't have a credit card they take.
[ZACK GRUNTS]
- Oh, shit.
- l'm sorry, guys.
Am I in the way?
You're a fucking faggot, all right?
Let's go to Starbucks.
- He's a shitty barista anyways.
- Cock.
- And he throws like a bitch.
ZACK:
You know what else I throw?
My nut sack in your coffees, so how did that taste, fucker?
We saw your girlfriend in her underwear, cunt nugget.
well' too bad she's not my girlfriend, you little fuck-
- Oh, they're gone.
MlRl:
Are you still talking to me?
Uh, just said, I'm gonna look up more fuck toys on Amazon.
Oh' holy shit.
- They sell the fleshlight here too.
- What's that?
It's a fucking pocket pussy that is shaped like a flashlight
"for discretionary jacking off."
That way if you get caught, no one thinks it's weird.
You're just a guy who likes to fuck his flashlight.
I am totally buying this shit.
Whoa, if you've got money to burn, how about paying the electric bill?
- That's due already?
- November's is probably due now, but I was talking about September's.
Tell me this doesn't rock.
You kind of look like Ronald McDonald.
That makes me want some McNuggets.
Why would you wanna buy a pocket pussy anyway?
That is so sad.
What?
Excuse me, I forgot about the nobility that accompanies coming with a fucking vibrator.
Think a kid in Darfur gets saved every time a vibrator makes you come?
No.
- "Real feel action"?
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
If you start fucking machines, I'm moving out.
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a machine.
How come you get to fuck something with a motor in it?
I've never met a man who can make me come like a vibrator does.
That's bullshit.
You get to be Buck Rogers having sex in the 25th century with fucking Twiki and Dr. Theopolis.
I'm stuck to a bottle of Jergens in the bathroom.
Holy bejesus.
You do not use my Jergens to jack it in our bathroom.
ZACK:
No, you know what I do actually, is I light a bunch of candles and I sprawl out on my sheets and I listen to Sting.
No, I'm a guy.
Give me two Popsicle sticks and a rubber band,
I'll find a way to fuck it, like a filthy MacGyver.
Oh' my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.
How about this?
I don't get why you're putting so much effert into this thing.
I thought we were just gonna go to sit around and make fun of everybody.
I can't wear anything that I already own and expect to bring home Bobby Long.
Bobby fucking Long?
No way.
Didn't that guy call you "Stinky Linky"?
Yeah, that was then, okay?
Maybe now he can save me a fortune in Amazon bills.
Maybe you can fuck our landlord so we can at least keep a roof over our heads.
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.
Hey, I bought skates with last week's paycheck
- and I need those to skate with.
- Oh.
And this week's will barely cover the past two water bills, so. ..
Is this sexy?
Yeah, in like a To Catch a Predator kind of way' it is pretty fucking sexy.
Then we're done.
[SHOWER splashing AND pipes CREAKlNG]
What the fuck?
Zack.
- You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?
- They shut it off.
- Oh, shit.
Just, uh--
Help me get this shit out of my hair.
Just use the water out of the toilet.
- There's poo in there.
- Not that part.
- The back part of the toilet thing.
- Oh, that makes sense.
MlRl:
Take the cup there and then scoop it in, there you go.
Here, I'll lean back and you can just' you know, pour it down like-
- Like that.
ZACK:
You're harshing my buzz' you know.
This is so lame.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Whoa!
All right, one hour tops, then we're gone.
Or I had an idea.
We could just not go at all, which would rock.
Even though we're broke and we've never amounted to anything, we're still better than these people, right?
No.
Not at all.
We're probably not even as good as most of them, unless one of them is a crackhead or something.
Just tell me I'm prettier than when we graduated.
You look about the same.
Definitely not prettier, but around the same.
I'm thinner, though' right?
A little?
Not really.
well' good pep talk.
Fuck.

- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.
- You don't recognize us' do you?
- Um, no, sorry.
Zack Brown, Miri Linky.
Were you the one they called Stinky Linky?
Oh' no' no one ever called me that.
Oh.
- Great.
What does yours say?
- What the fuck?
Come on.
- l'm sure I had a nickname.
Nothing?
- All right, you have a great time' and before you go, don't forget your copy of The Roving Roe-Ver.
What the fuck's this shit?
That is not shit, that would be our bi-monthly newsletter.
- Awesome.
BETSY:
It updates you
- on what everyone's doing.
- Finally.
I love your enthusiasm.
Here you go.
Write your e-mail address on that and I'll be sure to add you to our 800-member-strong mailing list.

Yes, and only 250 R.S.V.P .'d.

Two kids.
- Wow, that's beautiful.
- Awesome.
- You wanna fuck me later?
- Uh, no, I'm married.
- Okay, cool. lf you change your mind,
- l'll be in there getting shitfaced.
- He will.
- Just so you know, I eat the pussy.
- He does.
Ah, tempting.

It makes a big difference in life.
But you live and learn, though' right?
I mean, ten years ago, Pittsburgh, who knew anything about fashion?
Back in the day' our hairstyle, oh. ..
Hey, stranger.

- My stupid husband.
No fucking shit.
John Butterfield?
You actually married John Butterfield?
- That's amazing.
- Don't ever get married.
It sucks.
You stop appreciating each other and run out of shit to talk about after the first year.
But look at him now, chatty as fuck.
flirting up a storm with that cheerleader nimrod Monica Von.
You want me to maybe flirt with you so he can see it, even it up a bit?
I don't wanna get even.
If I was gonna do anything, I'd wanna one-up the asshole.
You can give me a handjob in the girls' locker room.
- Fine, but make it fast.
- Fuck, yeah.
Are you staying in town for a while or--?
Just tonight. I fly back to L.A. tomorrow.
L.A., wow, Los Angeles.

Like that?
Like Glen and Gary Suck Ross' Meaty Cock and Drop Their Hairy Nuts in His Eager Mouth.
- ls that like a sequel?
- Sort of.
- lt's a re-imagining.
- Oh, like The Wiz.
More erotic and with less women.
No women' to be exact.
I apologize in advance if I am out of line here, but are you in gay porn?
- Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?
- l thought you recognized me, that's--

You're not in my demographic' so I'm not insulted.

Who's your demographic?

No, I'm great.

You do this every time.
You get too Mary for everybody in the room
- and you can't contain yourself.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
And by containing myself, do you mean containing myself in a closet?
In a closet of denial?
is that--?
No, no, no.
Holy shit, this just got real.
This is exactly why you haven't met my mother.
You don't know how to ease people into this situation.
- You just force your way in every time.
- l thought, maybe for one second in this godforsaken town, I could be myself. I'm so sorry.
No, you're right' l should just butch up and pretend that I don't love it when you shove your dick in my mouth.
- This is the best night of my life.

No, the night before Thanksgiving?

Can you get an advance on your card?
fleshlight maxed-out my $200 limit.
Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.
This is bad. lf we don't come up with rent, we're gonna get locked out.
Who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.
Which means by the time we get home, there's no heat either.
well' l think it's time we put what we always talked about into effect.
- You're gonna have to start hooking.
- You know, you jest, but these are the exact circumstances people find themselves in right before they start having sex for money.
- Yeah.
- Or making porn.
ZACK:
Oh, my God, yeah.
- What?
You got an idea?
We could make a porno.
- Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?
No, that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me?
That's a rad idea.
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend, he said he makes a hundred grand a year because he shoots and distributes his own porno flicks.
If it's so easy, how come everybody doesn't do it?
Because other people have options and dignity, which we do not have, which puts us in an amazingly advantageous position.
Fuck you, I have dignity.
Where?
is it hidden in your gigantic underpants that are plastered all over the Internet?
Is that where you hide your dignity?
Every woman has a pair of those period panties.
That's, like, a fact.
Okay.
families.
I bet people don't make porno, because they have families.
But luckily, your parents are dead.
Sorry.
My grandparents are dead.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
So who are we gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone mainstream now.
It's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks in it.
Look at Paris Hilton.
She throat-fucks a guy in night vision, now she's selling fragrances to tweens.
And I'm pretty sure she's legally retarded.
That's for tweens?
Have you seen that Joe Francis guy who made Girls Gone Wild?
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot piece of shit in the world and he has a jet and a fucking island.
Look, there's got to be a less extreme solution to our financial woes here.
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper route.
- l don't have a bike.
- Be a waiter.
No one wants me around their food.
Would you eat food that I gave you?
I would not eat food that you gave me, that's true.
MlRl:
I mean, nobody wants to see us fuck, Zack.
ZACK:
Everybody wants to see anybody fuck.
I hate Rosie O'Donnell, but if someone said' "l got a tape of Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid,"
I'd be like, "Why aren't we watching that right now?"
Because she's famous.
Hello.
So are you.
You're fucking Granny Panties.
My underwear and your ass are famous' we're not.
So who the F would wanna watch us fuck?
- At least 800 people.
- The jerks we went to school with?
- Are you serious?
- Of course.
If you heard that someone we graduated with was in a fucking porno movie, you'd watch it, right?
I'd watch that guy Brandon suck a cock, I just met him.
With this mailing list, we have almost a thousand people that would definitely buy a porno we were in just to be like,
"Hey, I sat next to that guy in Civics.
Look at his fucking dick."
We sell a thousand copies at 20 bucks a pop, bam' we have paid off our bills.
ZACK:
So' what do you think?
- l don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.
Oh' wow, like you've never done that before.
How many guys have you met in a bar, taken home, banged with your mouth and then never talked to again?
That's what we call a stranger.
Dude, I don't one-night mouth-fuck anybody that I pick up in bars.
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in the porno movie for some weird reason.
I guess...
We could fuck.
- Ew.
- Fuck you.
I mean, you're a nice-enough-looking guy and everything--
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're an all-right-enough-looking girl.
- How does that feel?
- Dude' l'm just saying it'd be weird and wrong, you know, like fucking my brother.
Okay, seriously, we're just talking about sex, okay?
It's for a purpose. lt's for getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.
- Wow.
- Just explain to your private beforehand,
"Look' this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash."
- Oh, my God.
- What?
You're just doing this because you've always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?
Yes. I've gone my whole life pretending that I want nothing to do with you, just hoping one day we'd be in such dire financial straits that I could use it to finally make my move on you.
MlRl:
You're just being sarcastic.
- l am.
See' l was pretending to cry right there.
MlRl:
I guess it's not like it'd be creepy, like if we got way too drunk one night and accidentally fucked, you know?
No.
We'd be going in with the understanding that it's--
A business decision.
strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.
- Right.
- And by end,
I mean, I'll be waxing your ass.
Fuck you.
I'm not even letting you see my ass.
I've seen your ass and the rest of you naked around a billion times already.
- That goes both ways, buddy.
- You've never seen my dick.
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.
Are you kidding?
That party we went to where you got blasted, and Houls dared you to give yourself head, and we all watched you try for, like, an hour.
Oh' yeah.
Thanks by the way, for fucking letting me do that.
Thank you.
Oh' God.
We really do know too much about each other.
See' and this would really just be one more thing.
I mean, look at us. lt's Thanksgiving and we're huddled around a flaming fucking garbage can like a couple of steno bums.
I mean, this could give us a chance to pay off our debt, pay our bills, get a fucking nicer apartment with heat in it maybe.
What are you doing?
Miriam Linky, will you have sex with me on camera for money?
I will.
DELANEY:
A producer?
ZACK:
Yeah.
- Guy who gets to finance the movie.
- You think I got that kind of money?
We just need that.
What you're about to spend on the flat screen.
Now I can't get my flat screen?
Fuck that.
No, no, no.
With your cut of the profits, you're gonna get two flat screens.
One in your living room, one in your bathroom.
One in the bathroom?
You know, it's always been my dream to watch shit while I shit.
Everyone with an ass loves to watch shit while they shit.
- l'm gonna make that happen for you.
- l don't know, man.
What else the producer do?
- Um, they help with the casting.
- What's casting?
Finding the people to be in the movie.
- l get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.

- You can look at both titties, man.

- l'm due for another new titty.
- Please help us.
Please.
Please.
Yes.
Yes. I love you.

Why the fuck do I have to do everything?
Fuckers.
[CROWD CHEERS]
MAN 2:
Hey, what is that?
DEACON:
Fucking guys.
This fucking team, man.
They fucking suck.
[MAN 2 shouting INDlSTlNCTLY]
I'm gonna hatefuck the shit out of you, ref.
- Dude.
- lt's cool.
- He's my cousin.
- Hey.
Didn't you used to videotape the varsity basketball games in high school?
Just the away games. I did it because I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.
Which one?
Whichever one wanted to fuck the guy who taped the varsity games.
- Aw .
- Still know how to work a camera?
- Who cares what the title is?
- The porn I liked when I was a kid, it was always, Iike, a spoof of a popular movie, you know?
Like, um, Edward Penishands.
Okay, so we need a mildly clever, vaguely dirty title, that sounds like a real movie
- and sums up what you're gonna see.
- Correct.
An American Werewolf in Brenda?
Fuckback Mountain?
- Too soon?
A Cock-in-Lips Now?
MlRl:
Next.
cradle the balls.
Work the shaft.
Jerk my come-crayon and let me color you white.
I need cock and I need it now.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
It's "puss" as in pussy.
Oh' because I was like' who would wanna fuck puss?
I want to slam my ham in your can, woman.
Scene.
- This guy is amazing.
- This guy's great-looking too.
I wanna fuck him.
DELANEY:
Hi, my name's Delaney and I'm a producer.
I really don't know what it means. I'm gonna be honest' this is my first time.
You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna touch you or nothing like that.
- All right.
- l have a wife, you know.
We're happy. I mean, not happy' but it's cool, you know.
Just so you know, there will be some fucking.
- We'll talk about that if you get the part.
- Okay.
I mean, not-
- We won't be fucking, there'll be fucking in the movie.
Like I said' l got a wife.
She don't play that shit.
- She is a crazy bitch.
- Yep.
It's my job as the producer to see what you got.
So if that makes you uncomfortable in any way, you don't have to show me anything you don't wanna show me, because--
I love the movies.
- Lawrence of a Labia.
- No.
- Oh, come on.
- Dawn of the Dick.
Yeah, but how are zombies doing it at all sexy?
I want to eat your brain and your ass.
[groaning]
- Dude.
- Sci-fi.
Yeah.
Close Encounters With a Turd From Behind.
- l don't know what that means.
- Just asses.
Fucking deep in asses.
[TECHNO music playing OVER SPEAKERS]
What?
We're making a porno and we just need to know what you would be or would not be interested in doing.
If anything.
- No anal.
- Oh, definitely no anal.
Anal and hugging.
I don't do ass stuff.
- Anal.
- Ah, fuck.
- Oh, wait, oral. I like anal.
- Yay.
Okay, well, so, uh, do you have any special skills?
Special skills?
I can get a boner really quick and it sticks straight up.
- ls that really a special skill?
- l think.
- Can you show us what you mean?
- Sure.
Oh' that is special.
[ZACK CHUCKLES]
Yeah, you're hired, Mr.--
- Who are you again?
- Lester.
Lester "The Molester" Cockinshtuff.
- No.
- Wow.
That is the best porn name I've ever heard' man.
I can have a porn name?
- Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.
Are you Granny Panties?
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The panties are actually in the house.
- l'll get them.
- Whoa.
- Star Sex 2:
The Wrath of Cunt.
MlRl:
We never made a Star Sex 1 .
I guess we can lose Star Sex 3:
The Search for Cock, then.
- Cocunt.
- What's that?
It's Cocoon with a cunt.
[laughing]
So Delaney tells us you have a special talent of some sort.
I don't know if I'd call it a special talent, but it's a little something I picked up doing bachelor parties.
It would probably be easier if I just showed you.
- Great.
- The floor is yours.
So a movie, huh?
That could be fun.
Holy fuck.
Her name's Bubbles.
- lnvasion of the Potty-Snatchers?
- That's like MAD Magazine stupid.
well' fuck you' okay?
You try to think of a good sci-fi porno title. lt's hard.
MlRl:
There's gotta be one we haven't thought of that would say it all' not be ridiculously filthy and off-putting, and still have instant recognition with our audience.
- l got it.
- l got it.
- Star Whores.
- Yeah. lt's funny' right?
See' we figured this opens us up to an even bigger sales market beyond the people we went to school with.
People who like comics and sci-fi.
Comics?
Like "Ziggy"?
"Ziggy"?
is that even in fucking papers anymore?
No, man.
Fuck you. "Ziggy" is a comic' right next to "Family Circus."
No, Iike Spider-Man and shit, you know?
There's always a shitload of Star Wars nerds at those comic-book shows.
So we sell them a Princess Leia they can really fucking jerk off to.
- That'd be me, Princess Lay-Her.
- Who am I playing?
You' my friend, are the lead role of Lubed Guy-Baller.
Man' he's gonna be bailing dudes?
I thought you said this was boys on girls.
If I have to fuck a guy' okay, but I'd rather fuck a girl.
What's wrong with you, boy?
- We'll change the name to Sky-Baller.
- Sky-Baller.
I will be Hung So-low.
Delaney, my friend, you are On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
Man' l can't be in no porno.
My wife will kill me.
Hump me, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
You're my only hump.
On the other hand, fuck my wife.
Unfortunately, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over does not have any sex in the movie but the droids do, I-CUP and R2-T-Bag.
I robot.
And Stacey over here is gonna play Darth Vibrator.
- l'm the bad guy?
- She's not a guy, Zack.
I know that because I'm not a fucking idiot.
In our movie, Darth Vibrator is a bad girl who wants to fuck the galaxy, literally' and it's up to Lubed and Hung to stop her with their cocks.
- You and me get to have sex, then?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- l know. lsn't that awesome?
Hold up, hold up.
So who's all having sex with who in this movie?
As of last night, I was having sex with Zack.
What?
Han Solo ain't never had no sex with Princess Leia in the Star Wars.
ZACK:
Guys' this isn't a literal adaptation here.
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.
Kind of like The Wiz or like a parody.
With lots of anal.
- Cool.
- l know, isn't that awesome?
I have a question, do Princess Lay-Her and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?
Uh, no, because they're brother and sister, and according to Miri' brothers and sisters can't fuck.
But you said, that this wasn't a literal translation, so that means Lester's character could have sex with Miri's character.
Because I would love to fucking eat her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.
Dream on, pal, it's never gonna happen, okay?
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See' she's fine-
- Wait, what?
Yep. I mean, everyone else is having sex with more than one person in this movie all of a sudden, so I think it's' you know' not fair if I'm only fucking you.
Guys, read amongst yourselves, okay?
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Look, Miri, we got plenty of sex going on in this thing, you don't have to do that.
Zack, it's fine. I mean I have slept with way worse-looking guys than Lester.
I just wanna do my part for the movie like everyone else.
You're having sex in the movie, you don't need to fuck someone else.
- You're good.
- l'm only fucking you' though.
So don't we need to vary it up to keep it fair?
Fair for--?
I don't-
- What?
Fair for who?
What are these, blood diamonds we're talking about?
Fair for everyone else who is fucking more than one person, a.k.a. you' in the movie.
- l mean, fine--
- All right. I mean, if you don't care--
I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
Fuck. I don't give a shit.
Like you said, you know, you've fucked bigger idiots than Lester.
Holy shit.
Are we really gonna shoot this in outer space?
Maybe not bigger idiots.
[MOUTHS] Thank you.
- Cut.
All right, guys, that's it.
- Yeah.
Make sure you leave your costume so we know they're here for tomorrow.
mostly, everybody, thank you so much for helping us get ready' you know.
Cleaning this place out, building the sets, sewing the costumes, it's just--
I mean, it's really amazing.
Thank you.
ZACK:
seriously, thanks.
But this is just the beginning, guys.
If Star Whores works, and it wilI' we are set up for sequels galore.
The Empire Strikes Ass.
- Return of the Brown-Eye.
- The Phantom Man-Ass.
And Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter.
- Okay.
- Revenge of the Shit.
- You got it?
- Yeah, no, we got it.
Ew.
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.
- We'll talk about that one.
We're gonna have a lot of fun' but more importantly, we're gonna make a lot of fucking money' okay?
- Yeah.
- So get ready for greatness, people.
Tomorrow we start principal photography.
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
- All right, good night, you guys.
- We got a movie.
- What?
- Nothing.
I think someone should acknowledge how insane and amazing this is
- and it's all because of you.
- l don't know. lt's just a porno.
You know what I mean.
You've really come into your own.
Shut the fuck up.
So speaking of coming into things' ready for tomorrow?
Twenty years' we're finally gonna know what it's like to have sex with each other.
You say that like you've been wondering what it'd be like to sleep with me for a while now.
Why the fuck do you think I started hanging out with you?
I knew it.
Here, help.
Let's just promise that it's not gonna change anything between us, okay?
- Like what?
- l don't know.
Some guys can't keep sex in perspective.
If anyone's gotta keep this in perspective, it's you, okay?
I don't want you getting all mushy and gooey on me after I give you the best orgasm you've ever had.
Oh' like you know what you're doing down there at all.
I actually don't.
Where's the clitoris?
Is it in your ass?
Just, you know, make sure you kind of whoop it up and act like I'm a stud who knows what he's doing' okay?
Just be a pal.
Oh' dude, I am gonna Meryl Streep the fuck out of this tomorrow, you watch.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
No.
Really, thank you.
For everything.
You're welcome.
Less than 1 2 hours and we make Monroeville history.
- l really hope nothing goes wrong.
- lt's a movie.
What could go wrong?
ZACK:
What are you doing?
DELANEY:
What's up?
- What the fuck?
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait.
- Wait.
- Stop.
Stop.
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck is going on?
Condos is what's going on, as soon as this shit-hole's demo'd.
No, you gotta stop it right now.
We rented this place for a month from Mr. Jenkins.
Sounds like your Mr. Jenkins was full of shit.
Luxury Homesteads bought this place a month ago.
I'm gonna kill that lying old fuck.
You're gonna have to go Florida, that's where he moved.
We've got thousands of dollars of equipment in there.
- Please.
- lf you wanna sift through this rubble when we're done, be my guest.
Hey, get that fucking beam down.
MlRl:
This is the last thing you wanna hear.
If you don't get an advance,
I don't think we're gonna keep a roof over our heads.
I got an advance already.
It went into all the costumes.
- So all our money's gone?
- All your money?
Never mind what my wife's gonna do when there ain't no new snow tires, or when she sees I charged a video camera.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this' man.
DELANEY:
I just wanted to see some free titties.
That's all.
But there's no such thing as free titties' is there, Zack?
- ls there?
- Fuck this noise.
Why don't we get another camera, and shoot something else?
Where are we gonna do that?
Got another sound stage?
Sound stage?
We had a shit-covered garage we turned into a sound stage.
We find someplace new and we do it again.
[DOOR SQUEAKS]
How?
Okay, I'm broke, man.
No, make that' l was broke.
Now I am really tapped out.
I have to get another job to pay Delaney back.
So please tell me, how can I afford to start over?
- What can I get you?
- Yeah, can I get a, uh--?
Too fucking late.
Cappuccino, 3.50.
I don't know what the fuck i was thinking.
I mean, I'm a total loser in every single other aspect of my life.
What made me think I could do something as simple as filming people fucking?
We have no money left, nowhere to shoot, no sets, we have no fucking cameras.
Here.
It's time I go back to my regular life where l am a quiet fuckup who doesn't cost anybody any money and knows his goddamn position behind this fucking counter making cappuccinos for this fucking guy.
Oh' yeah.
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
ZACK:
Oh' yeah.
Yeah.
Fuck, yes.
Zack.
[CHUCKLES]
You sneaky Indian motherfucker.
I tell you, yes.
Swallow My Cockuccino.
- What?
- That's it.
That's the movie.
Why didn't I think of it before?
We don't need sets or a stage.
Look at all this production value, waiting to have balls on it.
Hold up.
You wanna shoot a dirty movie here, where we work?
Yes.
Fuck, yes, I do.
You know how many stories I have from working here?
How many times I've been laid right there after hours?
You've never gotten laid here after hours.
I know.
Thank you for reminding me.
But I always wish I had, and that's what porno is.
It's fantasy.
It's taking the normal and making it abnormal by fucking it.
Don't do that.
The little dog don't like that.
How did you get a camera?
By being a terrible, untrustworthy employee, that's how.
Give me today, I'll bang out a script.
Meet me back here after closing.
We're gonna launch arching ropes of jism all over this motherfucker.
Peace.
I like that guy but if he tries to fuck that little dog tonight for real,
I'm calling the Humane Society.
It's called Bean-N-Gone, so get the fuck out of here.
Hey, Barry.
ZACK:
Stand by, Stace' picture's up.
- Okay.
ZACK:
Roll tape.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 1 2, Take 1 .
ZACK:
And action.
I'd like a double espresso so I can stay up all night because I'm in the mood to fuck.
well' l am a whore-ista, so I love to fuck.
Would you like to fuck me?
Holy fuck.
You mean, after you're done with your shift?
I mean during my shift.
- Sorry.
- Keep going, keep going.
With your shaft.
Let us fuck.
Cue music.
[FUNK music playing]
Okay, open up to camera, guys.
Let us see it.
More tongue.
little less tongue.
Oh' that was good.
[CASH register BEEPlNG]
Cue effects.
[moaning]
Oh' yeah, like that.
Oh' yeah.
See' l told you it would work.
Didn't I tell you?
It looks amazing.
It's incredible.
STACEY:
Oh' the beans hurt.
Easy.
- Move in for coverage.
- Nice.
That's why we got him.
- Nice. I'm impressed.
- Get in there, Deacon.
- Come on.
- Like that?
Like that.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
- pull out a bit, actually.
STACEY:
That's hot.
No, not you, Lester.
Put it back in.
Kiss the muscle.
- l kiss the muscle.
- You kiss the muscle.
- Can he slap her ass a little?
- Don't be a fucking pervert, dude.
- Stir, come on.
Stir.
- Yeah, stir it.
Stir it, baby.
Hey.
- Holy.
- Shit.
Are you guys still open?
No.
We close at 9.
I need coffee so I'm drive home.
- Okay.
Yeah.
MAN:
Thank you.
That's a cute kitty.
Okay.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You guys see the game?
I was at it.
Fucking Roethlisberger, the quarterback, was all fucking'
"Hug it' chug it, football.
All night." Heh-heh.
Okay, pal' here you go.
On the house.
- l Iove you.
- l Iove you too.
Have a good one.
- Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- l said, have a good one.
Oh.
- Okay.
Keep moving.
MAN:
You and your little dog.
Go Steelers.
Action.
Oh' yeah.
Yeah, yeah, like that.
Oh' fuck it' chuck it' football.
Oh' yeah.
BARRY:
Oh' God' this is good.
[BARRY moaning]
You take it.
You take it.
Take it, Barry.
Oh, take it.
Take it, Barry.
Take it.
I'm disturbed at how turned on I am by this.
- Shit, dude' it's almost 6.
- Oh, fuck.
Okay, that's a wrap, everybody, yeah.
Let's give a hand to our hotties with the bodies from last night.
Stacey, Lester, Bubbles, Barry' whoo.
LESTER:
Yeah.
ZACK:
Nice.
Okay, when we come back tonight, we finish up the venti-vulva scene' and then we get into me and Miri's stuff.
Again' amazing first night, everybody.
Thank you so much.
Let us fuck.
- Hey' how'd it look?
- How do you think it looked?
It looked like shit going into other shit, in focus.
What an artist.
That was Kurosawa's motto. "Shit going into other shit."
Oh' man, I can't believe you gotta work now.
It's okay.
You know, honestly, I don't think I could sleep.
- l'm pretty, like, pumped up right now.
- Right?
It was amazing.
It was awesome.
I think the cast and crew had a good time.
- We were getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.
I just wanna keep shooting people boning all day.
I don't think I've ever met the ambitious Zack Brown before.
- Well' l'm trying to pay the bills, so...
- lt's not a bad thing.
I think it looks good on you.
ZACK:
Come on, hurry.
Come on, come on' come on.
BUBBLES:
Wait a minute.
- You guys never did it before?
MlRl:
It's fine.
You know, we talked about it and it's just for the movie.
We're friends' you know' we're just friends.
And we will always just be just friends, so...
Listen' l have some extra lube from last night.
I understand it's kind of hard getting wet when everyone's watching.
At least it was for Barry.
- l don't know if I am gonna need it.
- Really?
Yeah, I think I'm just excited.
Uh-huh.
At the idea of people watching' not because of Zack.
Oh' God.
Zack could never have that effect on me in a million years.
- Hello, Miriam.
- Oh, hey.
Wow .
- Your face.
- Yeah.
Weird, huh?
I don't think I've seen your face since senior year.
ZACK:
I think I made a mistake.
I did it for you so you wouldn't get road rash during our scene, but I should have asked first' I look like a fucking beluga whale.
I think I'll be going now.
ZACK:
Okay.
[clearing THROAT]
All I keep thinking is we should've done a trial run at home last week or something.
- Oh, my God.
Right?
- l know.
[laughing]
- You're still cool to do it, though, right?
- Yeah, um.
Totally.
Are you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I'm, uh.. .
- Honestly, I'm a little nervous, I guess.
- You are?
- lt's kind of a big deal.
- lt is?
Yeah, you know, it's our first time together since our auspicious debut on viral video.
Oh' yeah.
That's a fuckload of pressure for a director.
As a director, please.
What about the anxiety I'm feeling as an actress?
- Did I pick the right project?
- Yeah.
What about this follow-up?
Julia Roberts followed Pretty Waman with Sleeping With the Enemy.
I'm following Granny Panties with Swallow My Cockuccino.
Only difference is this movie's about cock-sucking and her movie just sucked cock, period.
- The only difference, yeah.
- The end was pretty rad.
I liked that.
- When she kills him.
- With a gun.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- She calls the cops first.
- She calls it in first.
- lt was so awesome.
- Awesome, yeah.
So I guess we should do this.
I think we should probably wait just until I lose another 20 or 30 pounds.
Stop it.
You look good.
Thanks.
So, what about me?
How do I look?
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful, so I guess it's not a big deal, but you look amazing.
- Okay.
Let's go make a porno.
- Okay.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 8, Take 1 .
DEACON:
Come here.
- l'm over--?
All right, settle.
Action.
[knocking ON DOOR]
Who could it be?
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm a delivery man and I have some cream for you.
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.
I work out.
So do you want me to give you your cream now?
I've been waiting for it all day.
- Fuck.
Come on.
- Oops.
[whispers] Keep going.
I spilled my cream.
Do you mind?
I don't mind.
especially if you spill it on my face.
Let us fuck.
[ROCK music playing]
- Fix my shirt.
Think I should?
- Okay.
Let me see them titties.
Actually, you know what?
Sorry, I don't think we should show them.
- What?
- We shouldn't show your breasts.
- Aren't you gonna take your shirt off?
- l'm just gonna open it.
You're not gonna take it off?
Why not?
My tits are bigger than yours.
I don't wanna show that.
She's not gonna show her tits?
I showed my cock and my asshole.
- Okay, I'lI do your pants.
- Back and forth. okay.
- Holy shit.
- Where's that delivery?
I can't believe this. I was delivering cream, and look what's happening.
- Jesus, what is that, a rumba?
- What's a rumba?
That awkward movement.
- Should I take your underpants off?
- Yeah, take them off.
ZACK:
What the fuck?
How does this work?
They're just like-- l'll do it.
- l'll do mine, you just-
- You do yours.
- l'll do my pants.
Granny panties.
Just get on with it already.
I'm gonna fuck you with my pecker.
Dude, that's really dirty.
- That's too dirty?
- That offends me.
- Penis?
- Fine.
- l'm gonna fuck you with my penis.
- l can't wait.
For my penis.
Be careful, Miri.
Okay, there we go.
Just keep rolling, keep rolling.
- l'll walk forward.
- Fucking cream is coming.
This is the worst porno I've ever seen.
MlRl:
Get over here, delivery man.
ZACK:
Let's fuck on these beans.
[GRUNTlNG]
- You okay?
- Yup.
ZACK:
Okay' all right.
- Just leave them.
Just leave them.
- They're really distracting.
- You should leave them.
- You gotta get your-
- There you go.
ZACK:
Okay' okay.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.
This okay?
Okay.
Okay, uh.
- We'll start kissing on three' okay?
- Okay.
One, two, three.
Go.
MlRl:
I'm ready.
- l'm ready.
- Okay.
Deacon.
- Deacon.
Deacon.
- What?
Did you see Lost this week, man?
I missed it.
What happened?
They're on the island, off the island.
Who can follow that?
I think they're in hell.
Would you all shut the motherfuck up?
[moaning]
I want you to come.
- l want you to come with me.
- Okay.
Oh' God.
ZACK:
Oh' God.
Cut.
That's it?
It's over?
Ain't he supposed to come on her titties?
well' it wasn't what we'd shot-listed' but that was nice.
- lt was so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack.
Thanks, Lester, uh.
It wasn't just me, though, guys.
Give it up for my radiant costar here, Miri.
[cheering]
LESTER:
Nice.
- Um, show's over in here.
Let's move out' start lighting the next scene.
- All right.
LESTER:
Let's do it.
BUBBLES:
You looked so beautiful.
- Thanks.
DELANEY:
I thought they were gonna be fucking hard.
- lt was pretty.
DELANEY:
Pretty don't sell.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
You good, Mir?
You need anything?
I'm just gonna take a minute, okay?
Okay, uh. I'll just be out there.
Yeah.
- That was fun.
- Yeah, fun.
ZACK [whispers]:
"Fun." You fucking douche.
[sighs]
Wow .
- Hey.
ZACK:
Hey.
- You working on a rewrite?
- Yeah, just for tonight's scene.
- l'm ready to go when you are, though.
- Okay.
You know, before we go, I...
I'm thinking that, uh, it's a good idea if we talk about what happened last night.
- Oh.
- l mean, we don't have to' but I think--
Okay, yeah, uh.
I kind of dropped the ball on that, I guess, huh?
- No, no.
It's. ..
- To be honest, it was...
You know, I didn't realize how weird it wouId be for me.
Weird?
Like-
- Weird how?
Acting and directing at the same time.
It's a lot to process, you know.
For the first time' l thought my balls didn't have enough hair on them.
That's not what I meant.
I know what you meant.
How you feeling about it?
I guess, um.. .
I feel like...
Like we. ..
- Holy fuck.
- The power's on.
Did you do this?
ZACK:
How did this happen?
I burned the bills.
How could we have done that?
- The water.
- The water.
MlRl:
Come on, come on' come on.
Yeah!
- We can shower in our home again.
- We are liquid.
[knocking ON DOOR]
Greetings.
Have you heard the good news about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?
Oh' my God, did you guys do this?
We got tired of you taking showers at our places all the time.
So we took up a collection amongst ourselves.
And chipped away at your mountain of debt.
You guys paid off our massive utilities bills?
- How did you afferd that?
- l stole my old lady's bingo winnings.
And Mistress Bubbles did a bachelor party tonight at which yours truly was a guest star, thank you very much.
- Oh.
- Whoa.
Don't get too excited.
We didn't pay off your whole bill.
Just a month of each.
They agreed to turn everything back on?
At 9 at night?
How does that work?
Stacey knows somebody that works at Power and Light.
- You guys...
- This is amazing.
You didn't have to do this.
You didn't have to put us in your movie.
- Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.
- Or put us in your movie either.
- We said that already.
Guys, honestly, I don't know what to say.
You can start by saying we can take tonight off so we can have our wrap party right now.
Guys, we're not wrapped.
We still have four days of shooting left.
Excuse me.
In my "producoriaI" capacity,
I'm shutting the movie down for a night so we can get a little silly.
[DMX'S "PARTY UP (UP in HERE)" playing OVER SPEAKERS]
[THE pixies' "HEY" playing OVER SPEAKERS]
[coin CLlNKlNG AND PEOPLE chattering]
Go' go' go.
- Yes.
- Yes.
[laughing]
You all drink.
Was it just amazing with him, after all those years of not knowing?
It was, um, weird.
- But good.
- My scene with Zack's tomorrow.
You don't say.
But I'm a little nervous. I was thinking about trying to get with him tonight.
- Really?
- l mean, if you don't mind.
You are just friends and all' so I didn't think it would be a biggie.
- lt wouldn't be a biggie, would it?
- No.
No, no. lt's not a biggie.
What?
No.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Stacey' I'm not married to the guy, so. ..
I don't know.
You guys just looked kind of intimate last night.
- We did?
- Yeah.
well' we're just better actors than I thought, I think, so you know what?
If you wanna get with him' you should just go ask him.
- He'd be really excited to hear that.
- Yeah?
For real, you don't mind?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
DEACON:
All the quarters are on the ground.
ZACK:
Hey, Stace.
- Hey' Zack.
[whispering]
DEACON:
Come on, are you guys playing or what?
[inaudible dialogue]
well' l'm bummed, but I totally get it.
It's no problem to work with Lester again.
He has a nice cock.
well' you're a trouper, Stace.
Oh' but if I start making weird faces or anything during the scene' it's just because I've been constipated all day.
Oh' shit' uh.
We don't have to shoot the scene tonight.
No, I want to.
anal's great for when you're constipated.
It totally loosens you up.
I use ex-lax' but good to know.
Okay, I never thought I would have that conversation.
So are we starting with Lester and Stacey tonight?
We were supposed to start with Lester and Miri.
I know.
She-
- We're not gonna do that.
I don't think Miri's gonna...
[knocking ON DOOR]
... dothat.
Hey.
So where are we shooting this?
Over here?
- What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.
Our scene's tonight, right?
Can I talk to you for a minute in the back?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
What do you want me to shoot here?
Start with the close-ups of Lester and Stacey.
Give me a second, man.
What an artist.
Okay, uh.
Did I do something wrong to you?
No.
Then why are you here?
I'm here for the same reason you're here.
To make the movie.
Okay, just, like' for your own personal information, you're acting really weird right now.
I'm acting weird?
I think you're acting weird right now.
Oh' l'm acting-- How exactly am I acting weird?
You've been trying to keep me from fucking anybody but you since we started this thing.
Maybe I was thinking about your feelings.
Were you thinking of my feelings when you were banging Stacey?
Because that'd be really sad for Stacey.
She told me that you told her that that was okay.
I told her that it was okay to ask you.
Holy shit. I get it. I fucking get it.
It was a test.
That whole thing was a fucking test, is that it?
If it was, how do you think you did?
We had a discussion, Miri.
We had-
- actually, we had many discussions about how it was just sex
- and how we wouldn't let it get weird.
- l'm not acting weird.
You're acting like a jealous girlfriend is what the fuck you're acting like.
- l am not your girlfriend.
- l know that.
You're not my boyfriend, so why are we having this conversation right now?
Because you're about to fuck Lester to spite me, it seems like.
Did you fuck Stacey to spite me?
No.
You fucked her like you fucked every other bitch and never gave a shit how I felt about it.
- Well' that was before.
- Before what?
Look, don't fucking pretend that the other night, you and me, right there, that that didn't mean anything to you, that you didn't feel it too.
Oh.
You're not getting all gooey on me here, are you, Zack?
You know what?
If you were any other bitch I didn't give a rat's ass about,
I would tell you to go fuck yourself right now because I fucking hate this game-pIaying shit.
But you, you mean more to me than that' so I'm just gonna lay this out on front street.
I know you felt something big, something real the other night when we were together because I felt it too.
We tried to fuck and instead, we wound up making love.
So if this is what you need to hear in order to keep you from fucking Lester, if this is what you need, then fine.
Here it is, I'm gonna say it.
I love you, Miri.
Happy?
Oh' Jesus.
You better get ahold of yourself, Zack, because we just fucked.
Okay.
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?
But you did.
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.
[whispers] Wait--
All right, don't forget I'm down here.
Watch that pullout, huh?
STACEY:
Yeah.
Mmm.
This is some damn good coffee.
- Where you going?
- Getting the fuck out of here.
We gotta finish this movie.
[GASPS]
Yo!
[coughing AND groaning]
You believe this shit?
Do you believe this shit?
What the fuck just happened in there?
I'll tell you what just happened in there.
That chick frosted me like I was a fucking cake.
Zack.
TEEN 1 :
Okay, seriously' get a picture of me right now.
I'm hunting humans.
- Dude' check it out.
Ooh.
- Oh, shit.
seriously, let's shoot the shit out of this bitch.
- Where you aiming at?
- Cock shots?
Cock shots.
[BUZZER rings]
[BUZZER rings]
We shot you in the balls, cunt nugget.
well' it's my job to get shot in the balls, so-
- Oh, they're gone.
MAN:
Excuse me.
Didn't you used to work at the Bean-N-Gone in Monroeville?
I sure as shit hope this pays better, I tell you.
[chattering]
So why don't they just shoot you with a puck?
What do you mean?
I mean, what does paintball got to do with hockey?
Nothing, I guess.
- So ain't no prizes or--?
- No, no.
So, what are they paying $5 for?
To shoot a Broad Street bully in the balls.
White people are fucked up.
Yup' they sure are.
It's a living.
You've been getting the checks I've been sending?
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Probably didn't save you from a brutal tongue-lashing, though, huh?
You know, the wife never found out about the camera, because I paid off the bills.
How did you manage that?
- Because now I'm Oprah rich.
- No way.
- The post office fucking settled?
- Hundred-sixty large' son.
- Nice, man.
Congratulations.
- A beautiful day, thank you very much.
I thought you made that whole thing up.
No, no. lt was very real.
You can believe it.
Even though she's spending all of it.
well' since you ain't gonna ask me, I'll just go ahead and tell you.
- No, I have not seen Miri.
- l wasn't gonna ask that.
Oh' l suppose you weren't gonna ask about your movie, neither?
Look, that's why I came down here.
I need you to come take a look at it.
- l'm not interested.
Sorry.
- You'd better get interested
- because you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?
The story doesn't make sense.
- The story?
- The story doesn't make sense.
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?
It's a movie, dog, and a movie's gotta have an ending, which we don't have at the moment.
Come shot, credits.
There's your fucking ending.
Do me this favor, okay?
When you're done getting your nuts blown off' come back to humble MonroeviIle to my crib for a couple hours' check out the flick, you tell me what's missing.
No.
I'll tell you what, you do that, you don't owe me shit no more.
- Really?
- Really.
- ls your wife home?
- Yes.
- Maybe I should leave the pads on.
- You got some extra ones?
Hey, honey.
Where the fuck you been?
And who in the fuck is this now?
Would you calm down, woman?
Goddamn.
You already left one white boy down in my basement while you off gallivanting and shit.
What if this motherfucker
- was all grabby on me?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
Oh' what in the fuck is that supposed to mean?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
wife:
White boys love me.
White boy.
- l said, white boy.
- Yeah?
You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?
- Should I say yes?
- Just say yes.
Yeah.
- Why don't you, uh, head downstairs?
- Oh, okay.
It's just through this hallway.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
What the fuck you looking at?
Why you gotta be yelling at me in front of my director?
- Oh, he's a director?
- Yeah.
I didn't know that.
Shit, he's a director.
well' why don't he direct my ass to a new husband?
How about that shit?
- That's the bedroom.
DELANEY:
Keep talking, maybe he will.
Oh' don't nobody want them saggy-ass balls!
Saggy balls?
Look at these sagging-ass titties you got around here.
- You could tie these together.
- Motherfucker, we match.
Oh' shit.
Where's my paintball gun at?
Look at you, editor and DP .
You got your shit covered, man.
Please, don't ever say "shit-covered" to me again.
Roll the film for the man, please, so we can see what he thinks.
Just jump through it. I ain't got all night.
The bitch is on me.
"Nigga Rich Productions." classy.
- Yeah, DreamWorks was taken.
- Was it?
Plus' it sounds like an underground gay fuck club.
"l met a guy at DreamWorks." Yeah.
All right, so we got Lester and Stacey fucking.
Then we got Barry and Bubbles fucking.
And then this boring bullshit.
Okay, just, uh, go to the next scene, would you?
Uh...
- What next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?
We never shot it.
- Why not?
- Because after you left that night,
Miri came out of the backroom and said she couldn't do it.
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped?
So...
- Wait, so Miri--
- Never fucked nobody.
Just you.
Now, I wonder why she did that.
- Hm.
- Hm.
You see, there was a time when I was just a bitter old fuck making coffees, and Stacey was just a lap dancer and Barry and Bubbles didn't know each other and this fool here, hell, I don't even know what he was.
- A white supremacist.
- Man' fuck you.
Then two people come along and showed us something we didn't know existed.
A world of possibilities where plain old people just like us could do something special.
Even if it's something as simple as filming people fucking.
Sometimes we just need someone to show us something we can't see for ourselves
and then we're changed forever.
So as you can see' our movie ain't got no ending.
Every movie needs an ending' don't it?
Peace.
Delaney, you're a slick cupid motherfucker.
Ain't love grand?
wife:
Why the fuck is this white boy running through my goddamn house?
[DOOR SLAMS]
Sometimes.
Miri.
- Miri.
MlRl:
Zack?
ZACK:
Miri. I'm sorry.
MlRl:
Get out.
- Close the door.
- lt was closed.
- lt was closed over--
- Just close the fucking door' Zack.
I never slept with Stacey that night, okay?
I swear to God.
When we got into my room, you know what we did?
We talked about you, and us and how things were different and how I was too much of a fucking pussy to just tell you how I felt about you.
And I know-- l know that that's only because of all the stupid shit we said about how we wouldn't let sex change us, but it did. lt changed me.
That has to be love, right?
It has to be love and just so you know, I can't go back to being just friends anymore,
- because I just can't.
- Good.
And I think--
I think that you feel the same way.
Because that night after I left, you didn't fuck Lester.
What's up, Zack?
You know what?
I don't care that you're fucking Lester, okay?
How's that?
- Oh, shit.
- l don't wanna be with anyone but you.
So I will wait forever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life because I love you, and I have for as long as I can remember.
And I would rather die than be without you, Miriam Linky.
Miri's last name is Linky?
You're gonna fuck a guy who doesn't know your last name?
Or that you beat up Carl Roth in the sixth grade?
I know that.
Or what your senior prom dress would've looked like had we gone but we decided not to, and we got drunk alone instead.
Or that you washed your hair in the toilet.
We're not fucking' Zack.
Or that you're not fucking Zack-- What?
I asked her to fuck me.
She wouldn't do it.
I even tried to talk her into giving me the fucking Dutch rudder.
Shot me down on that too.
- And a Dutch rudder is?
- Don't know what a Dutch rudder--?
All right, you grab your dick, then you have someone else work your arm.
Here, let me show you.
All right, grab my arm. I'm grabbing my dick, you're grabbing my arm.
Now work it.
Work my arm.
See that shit?
Work it up and down.
It's like someone else is jerking you off.
Okay.
There's the double Dutch rudder, which' l grab my dick, you grab your dick, you work my arm, I work your arm' same time.
It's like jerking off together but not gay.
We're not touching dicks, each other's dicks anyway.
I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.
It feels good, sir.
Try me, come on.
Sorry to change the subject on you, Lester, but if you're not fucking Miri, why is your dick out right now?
Because I live here now, and I like to be naked.
- What?
- When you moved out, she couldn't afford to pay her rent by herself, so I moved in to help.
But you just came out of her room.
That's my room now.
She moved in your old room.
Wait, wait, wait.
She changed rooms?
Yeah, she said she did it because she missed the smell of you or some shit.
[sniffs]
I don't smell anything.
But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.
- Night, Zack.
- Night.
Do you?
Then why are you crying?
Because I missed you so much.
ZACK:
Me too.
I love you.
- l Iove you, I love you.
ZACK:
I love you.
I don't mean to alarm you but I think I just jerked off Lester a little bit.
- The Dutch rudder?
- Yeah, it's ingenious, right?
If you ask me nicely, I will Dutch-rudder you the rest of our lives.
Good. I'm getting tired of fucking the Fleshlight.
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.
- What'd it feel like?
- Like fucking a flashlight.
LESTER:
Wrong room.
- Oh, God.
That's gross.
Let us fuck.
Hello.
Welcome to Nigga Rich Productions' home of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, the production house for the couple looking to put a little spice in their sex life.
- Shall we take a look around?
- Fuck me so hard.
Oh, God.
First, you'll meet for a consultation with one of our romance-ologists, who'lI coach you through that initial awkward stage before you're camera-ready.
So we will start off with some erotic massage and some--
Dude.
Some light petting.
That sounds good.
Are you guys sure you don't wanna do some, uh, butt-sack work too?
- Uh, let's move on' shall we?
- Why?
ANNOUNCER:
From their break-out hit, Swallow My Cockuccino, to the multi-million selling Swallow My Cockuccino ll and the award-winning Star Whores saga, including Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter,
Zack and Miri have proven time and again that they know how to shoot hot sex.
As an actor, I've sometimes brought my work home with me inappropriately.
When you're telling your real-life lover in the bedroom' to' you know' bend over while you cake your hand in K-Y, it is a sign that the romance is dead, I think.
Then we turned to the professionals at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
Oh' my God, they totally saved our civil union.
They filmed what was inside of us and not what was coming out of us necessarily.
It helped me see his asshole as not just a come dumpster, but a sign of his beauty' his flower.
It became a, uh, gorgeous orchid.
Orchids grow in sort of the filthiest conditions.
That's what his asshole became to me.
This beautiful flower amidst shit.
- Honey, they get the metaphor.
- l don't think they do.
Let's just say, thank you to Zack and Miri.
It's helped us out, it's helped our friends.
Enrique?
Park?
Park?
Enrique?
Can we get a little love for Zack and Miri?
They don't even know what's going on, they're so pilled up.
But don't take his word for it.
Just ask our co-founders.
- Hi. I'm Miri Linky Brown.
- l'm Zack Linky Brown.
Here at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, we're dedicated
- to committing your love--
- Or lust.
--to high-end, quality production digital video.
A forever keepsake of your passion.
That's right, Miri.
Why set up a camera at the end of your bed and settle for one unflattering angle, when you could let the professionals dazzle and delight your senses with an array of shots so masterfully rendered you'll swear Martin Scorsese snuck into your room
and caught you fucking?
And remember' we're not just the presidents of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
We're also clients.
ANNOUNCER:
Call now to set up your appointment
LESTER:
Way to fuck, Zack.
You little motherfucker!
Get up' Zack.
Come on, I don't wanna be late for work.
Ahh!
Get out!
- Jesus, fuck!
Close the door if you're gonna take a shit.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over, it was not closed.
- Close the door' Zack!
- Okay, okay.
God.
- Fine.
- What's that thing?
- It's a hand warmer.
We're going now.
- You smell that?
Is that the car?
Fuck.
- Oh, goddamn it.
- What?
What?
- Oh, it's wedged in my taint.
- What is?
- It got wedged in my taint.
- What?
- It's stuck under my balls.
- It's between my balls and my leg.
- What's happening?
- Please, pull over.
Pull the fuck over!
- All right, all right!
Jesus, all right!
It's about to move up to my ass.
- What?
The movement makes it hotter.
It's tucked under them.
It's stuck under them.
Oh' fuck.
I think I burned my ball hair off.
It's not funny.
Can you help me pick out an outfit for tonight?
I'm working till 6.
- Well' I can try stuff on at the store.
- The store?
No, how about instead, you get a friend?
But you are my friend.
I mean a girl friend, jeez.
Mr. Delaney, can you work for me tomorrow?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
Then you must come in the next day, I tell you.
- It's Black Friday.
- Black Friday?
It's the biggest mall-shopping day of the year.
And since the mall is just up the street, I would like you to come out and work.
- On Black Friday.
- Oh, yeah.
All right, you want me to work on Moolie Monday too?
- I'm sorry?
- How about Nigga Tuesday?
- Nigga Tuesday?
Is this a new holiday?
- You come to a brother and tell him he gotta work on Black Friday.
You got any idea how racist that sounds?
Telling me to work.
What, you think you own me?
- I never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?
You thought,
"I'm gonna lay down the law for this nigga, I put food on his table, clothes on his nigga baby backs, and he ain't gonna say shit."
- This ain't Amistad.
- You shut up.
You goddamn right this ain't Amistad.
I can't wait till the post office settles my disability suit because then I'm gonna be out this motherfucker.
I'm gonna be Oprah rich.
Y'all can kiss my ass.
You know what?
Fuck you.
Fuck you, and suck cock.
- To hell with you.
- To hell with you.
- Zachary will work.
Zack' my boy.
- Yeah.
- The customer with the harelip...
- Oh, yeah.
- speak me, say you were playing baseball here the other night.
Wiffle ball.
And' uh' no' that wasn't me.
Maybe the harelip makes it sound like "baseball."
Yeah, maybe you hear with an accent.
- Fuck you, okay?
- Okay.
One day' I'm gonna put a camera over there' and then I can tell...
I'll know everything you do when I'm gone.
Everything.
Scratch your balls, take a shit, everything, I tell you, okay?
Okay.
Fucker.
I hate both of you ebony and ivory motherfuckers, I tell you.
- Why is he so fucking high-strung?
- "Fuck off, I tell you.
Very good."
Can you believe that Gandhi motherfucker, telling me I gotta work on Black Friday?
Ain't that some shit?
- Yeah.
- Like I don't wanna do shopping.
Biggest sales day of the year.
I'm getting a flat-screen TV, believe that.
That's my fault, I should tell you.
I asked for Friday morning off, I'm sorry.
- For what?
- I actually need a lot of recovery time.
Tonight is me and Miri's ten-year high school reunion.
I'm just gonna get fucking alcohol poisoning.
- Reunion?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
- Isn't that fucked up that they do that?
They say it's the best chance to get everyone together.
People come back in town for the holidays.
But they could have it in the middle of the summer at a blowjob contest that I was judging' and it would still be retarded.
- So why you going, then?
- Miri's making me go.
Why you always bending over backwards for that girl'
- knowing she ain't giving up no ass?
- We got a good thing going.
She pays half the rent, does dishes, she wakes me up in the morning.
Why complicate that with sex?
Besides, man, I've known her since the first grade.
You don't fuck someone you met in the first grade.
Excuse me, I met my wife in kindergarten.
We got married senior year, and she has been the queen of my world ever since.
- What if you could do it all over again?
- I'd jerk off and live by myself.
That woman is the bane of my existence.
- See?
- Excuse me, can I get a coffee, black?
Can't you see we talking, white?
If you're gonna continue to emasculate me with this Barbie dress-up shit'
I'm using your laptop.
Don't forget to smack it when you turn it on, otherwise the screen doesn't come on.
Why don't you spring and get a new one?
Same reason I don't spring for clothes for tonight, I'm broke.
There's a chick who works at Teen Juice at the mall, you know.
I gave her a good deal on yarn,
- so she's letting me borrow this stuff.
- Yo, bro.
What?
- You're buying a vibrator online.
- What's wrong with the one you have?
- It died last week.
Look at the size of those fucking panties.
Shoot that shit.
Shoot it.
My God, who even knew Amazon sold shit like this?
This is incredible.
- Those are fucking granny panties.
- Okay,
A, I don't appreciate you violating the sanctity of my Amazon Wish List page' and B, I'm not buying that thing from Amazon, because it turns out I don't have a credit card they take.
- Oh, shit.
- I'm sorry, guys.
Am I in the way?
You're a fucking faggot, all right?
Let's go to Starbucks.
- He's a shitty barista anyways.
- Cock.
- And he throws like a bitch.
- You know what else I throw?
My nut sack in your coffees, so how did that taste, fucker?
We saw your girlfriend in her underwear, cunt nugget.
Well' too bad she's not my girlfriend, you little fuck...
Oh, they're gone.
Are you still talking to me?
Uh, just said, I'm gonna look up more fuck toys on Amazon.
Oh' holy shit.
- They sell the Fleshlight here too.
- What's that?
It's a fucking pocket pussy that is shaped like a flashlight
"for discretionary jacking off."
That way if you get caught, no one thinks it's weird.
You're just a guy who likes to fuck his flashlight.
I am totally buying this shit.
Whoa, if you've got money to burn, how about paying the electric bill?
- That's due already?
- November's is probably due now, but I was talking about September's.
Tell me this doesn't rock.
You kind of look like Ronald McDonald.
That makes me want some McNuggets.
Why would you wanna buy a pocket pussy anyway?
That is so sad.
What?
Excuse me, I forgot about the nobility that accompanies coming with a fucking vibrator.
Think a kid in Darfur gets saved every time a vibrator makes you come?
No.
- "Real feel action"?
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
If you start fucking machines, I'm moving out.
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a machine.
How come you get to fuck something with a motor in it?
I've never met a man who can make me come like a vibrator does.
That's bullshit.
You get to be Buck Rogers having sex in the 25th century with fucking Twiki and Dr. Theopolis.
I'm stuck to a bottle of Jergens in the bathroom.
Holy bejesus.
You do not use my Jergens to jack it in our bathroom.
No, you know what I do actually, is I light a bunch of candles and I sprawl out on my sheets and I listen to Sting.
No, I'm a guy.
Give me two Popsicle sticks and a rubber band,
I'll find a way to fuck it, like a filthy MacGyver.
Oh' my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.
How about this?
I don't get why you're putting so much effort into this thing.
I thought we were just gonna go to sit around and make fun of everybody.
I can't wear anything that I already own and expect to bring home Bobby Long.
Bobby fucking Long?
No way.
Didn't that guy call you "Stinky Linky"?
Yeah, that was then, okay?
Maybe now he can save me a fortune in Amazon bills.
Maybe you can fuck our landlord so we can at least keep a roof over our heads.
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.
Hey, I bought skates with last week's paycheck
- and I need those to skate with.
- Oh.
And this week's will barely cover the past two water bills, so...
Is this sexy?
Yeah, in like a To Catch a Predator kind of way' it is pretty fucking sexy.
Then we're done.
What the fuck?
Zack.
- You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?
- They shut it off.
- Oh, shit.
Just, uh...
Help me get this shit out of my hair.
Just use the water out of the toilet.
- There's poo in there.
- Not that part.
- The back part of the toilet thing.
- Oh, that makes sense.
Take the cup there and then scoop it in, there you go.
Here, I'll lean back and you can just' you know, pour it down like...
Like that.
You're harshing my buzz' you know.
This is so lame.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Whoa!
All right, one hour tops, then we're gone.
Or I had an idea.
We could just not go at all, which would rock.
Even though we're broke and we've never amounted to anything, we're still better than these people, right?
No.
Not at all.
We're probably not even as good as most of them, unless one of them is a crackhead or something.
Just tell me I'm prettier than when we graduated.
You look about the same.
Definitely not prettier, but around the same.
I'm thinner, though' right?
A little?
Not really.
Well' good pep talk.
Fuck.
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.
- You don't recognize us' do you?
- Um, no, sorry.
Zack Brown, Miri Linky.
Were you the one they called Stinky Linky?
Oh' no' no one ever called me that.
Oh.
- Great.
What does yours say?
- What the fuck?
Come on.
- I'm sure I had a nickname.
Nothing?
- All right, you have a great time' and before you go, don't forget your copy of The Roving Roe-Ver.
What the fuck's this shit?
That is not shit, that would be our bi-monthly newsletter.
- Awesome.
- It updates you
- on what everyone's doing.
- Finally.
I love your enthusiasm.
Here you go.
Write your e-mail address on that and I'll be sure to add you to our 800-member-strong mailing list.
We had 800 people in our graduating class?
Yes, and only 250 R.S.V.P.'d.
Doesn't that suck, Mary?
- Miri.
- You married, Bets?
- I am.
Two kids.
- Wow, that's beautiful.
- Awesome.
- You wanna fuck me later?
- Uh, no, I'm married.
- Okay, cool.
If you change your mind,
- I'll be in there getting shitfaced.
- He will.
- Just so you know, I eat the pussy.
- He does.
Ah, tempting.
Again, no.
- Shall we?
- Sir.
Bye, Bets.
Think about it.
Enjoy.
Can I get two beers' please?
You want a beer?
- Yeah.
- Three beers.
- Thank you.
- Here you go.
Is that Zack?
Or am I Zack?
Whoa, ho, ho.
Oh' wow.
- Never gets old, huh?
- The other Zack.
Oh' in my world, nobody calls me "the other Zack,"
now that this guy's not around anymore, huh?
- Get the fuck off of me.
- There can be only one.
- What?
- Highlander, man?
The Kurgan.
Remember?
I'd yell it at you whenever we passed each other in the hallway?
Like it was yesterday' man.
Awesome.
Awesome.
Awesome.
God, you guys have so much to catch up on.
Whoo.
- No.
- I'm gonna let you get to it.
Bitch.
Have you seen that big blowup picture they have of me?
Yeah, it's...
My hair is terrible.
I can't believe I even wore my hair like that.
That's before I knew about styling products' you know.
It makes a big difference in life.
But you live and learn, though' right?
I mean, ten years ago, Pittsburgh, who knew anything about fashion?
Back in the day' our hairstyle, oh...
Hey, stranger.
- Whoa.
Stinky Linky.
- Yeah.
Although it's just Miri now.
- Give me a hug.
- Oh, okay.
- Hi, heh, heh, heh.
- Hi.
Wow.
- How have you been?
- Great, great.
- Yeah?
- You look fantastic.
Wow, that is not something that you would have said to me ten years ago.
- Well' I've grown up.
- Yes.
Yes, you have.
You just look...
Ooh, heh, heh.
- Well' listen to you.
Thank you.
- No, don't thank me, just fuck me.
Roxanne.
Hey.
Someone I like, what are the odds' huh?
Zack Brown, we had four years of Spanish together.
Why does no one recognize me?
- Am I thinner?
Is that it?
- Look at him.
- Who?
- My stupid husband.
No fucking shit.
John Butterfield?
You actually married John Butterfield?
- That's amazing.
- Don't ever get married.
It sucks.
You stop appreciating each other and run out of shit to talk about after the first year.
But look at him now, chatty as fuck.
Flirting up a storm with that cheerleader nimrod Monica Von.
You want me to maybe flirt with you so he can see it, even it up a bit?
I don't wanna get even.
If I was gonna do anything, I'd wanna one-up the asshole.
You can give me a handjob in the girls' locker room.
- Fine, but make it fast.
- Fuck, yeah.
Are you staying in town for a while or...?
Just tonight.
I fly back to L.A. tomorrow.
L.A., wow, Los Angeles.
Gosh' Bobby Long' coming up in the world.
- With Mrs. Long, I bet, huh?
- No, no, no.
No Mrs. Long for me.
- Then can I be honest with you?
- Sure.
Um...
Whew.
I think I need a drink.
Do you need a drink?
Because I need a drink to say this.
- I've got a beer already, so...
- Oh, great, thank you.
I think there's a cigarette butt in there.
Yup.
Sorry about the elbow.
There can be only one.
Can I get a beer, please?
Thank you very much.
Oh' Jesus Christ.
My friend's making an ass of herself hitting on her high school crush.
Oh' God' that's so sad.
It's so Miri, is what it is.
I'm Zack, by the way.
Brandon.
Don't worry, we weren't in the same class or anything.
- Okay.
Lucky you.
- Are you a Monroe-ver?
Well' I went here' let's just leave it at that, I guess.
Do you have one of the large blown-up pictures of your younger self
- hanging around here?
- I do, kind of.
Right there.
Gorgeous.
- Good times.
What do you do?
What brings you here?
I came with somebody who went to school here.
- Really?
- Bobby Long.
No shit.
That's who my friend's hitting on right now.
See right there?
- Really.
- One dressed like Hannah Montana?
In L.A., we call that look "Nickelodeon chic."
- Wait, L. A?
Los Angeles?
- California.
That's awesome, man.
What do you do out there?
- I'm an actor.
- Wow, that's really impressive.
- Thank you, thank you.
- In fucking movies?
"Fucking movies." Pretty much.
Look at you.
What...?
Anything I've seen?
What movies?
Oh' all sorts of movies with all-male casts.
All-male casts.
Like Glengarry Glen Ross?
Like that?
Like Glen and Gary Suck Ross' Meaty Cock and Drop Their Hairy Nuts in His Eager Mouth.
- Is that like a sequel?
- Sort of.
- It's a re-imagining.
- Oh, like The Wiz.
More erotic and with less women.
No women' to be exact.
I apologize in advance if I am out of line here, but are you in gay porn?
- Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?
- I thought you recognized me, that's...
- Oh, okay, I get it.
You're not in my demographic' so I'm not insulted.
- Not really.
Who's your demographic?
- Do you love pussy?
- I do.
- Then not you.
Oh' okay.
I came here tonight hoping to seduce you and bring you back to my apartment and sleep with you to, uh, get back at you, you know, for calling me Stinky Linky all those years ago.
Wow.
That is a weird revenge plot.
- You must be a terrible lay for that.
- What?
No, I'm great.
I mean, I've had enough practice and everything.
That...
Wow, that sounded not good.
I fuck a lot.
That's what I meant to say.
That doesn't sound good either.
Wow.
You're a lot funnier than I remember.
Thank you.
Gosh, you turned out to be such a nice guy.
It just...
You know' it makes it even easier to just...
To just say this.
Would you like to come back to my place and maybe open a bottle of wine and have ourselves a real high school reunion?
- I...
- Hello, Miriam.
Beat it, we're talking.
- I wanted to introduce you to Brandon.
- Salutations.
- Bobby's boyfriend.
- Bobby who?
- Bobby me.
- Bobby Long.
Brandon is the star of such adult fare as...
What was that one called again?
You Better Shut Your Mouth or I'm Gonna Fuck It.
That's right.
I'm surprised I forgot that.
Are you fucking with me?
No, they're fucking with each other.
Oh' my God.
- No.
- What?
Granny Panties?
- Excuse me?
- How can you tell?
This is so crazy.
I was literally just watching you, like, right before we got here.
This is so crazy.
This is you, right?
My name's Granny Panties, and nobody wants to fuck me.
Nothing's whiter than my big gay ass...
Where'd you get that?
Oh' I entered "gay" and "ass," and it was the top hit.
It's had 200,000 views in three hours.
Honey' you are, like...
I'm jealous right now because you're, like, super famous.
Baby, please take our picture.
I get a picture with Granny Panties.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is awesome.
- All right, smile.
Okay' got it.
- Did you get it?
- Oh, thank you very much.
- E-mail me that.
Oh' because he's the worst photographer.
Okay' good.
- You're gay?
- Yeah.
And I'm on the Internet wearing a diaper?
Who knew you'd come to Pittsburgh and meet a celebrity?
I'm gonna binge-drink now until I pass out.
Okay.
She'll be fine.
So you guys suck each other's cocks, huh?
Oh' like crazy.
Okay, that's enough, I think.
I'm embarrassing him.
I love when he's embarrassed.
He's not living out loud, so he gets all like, ooh.
- You are totally in love, aren't you?
- Zachary' we are.
Wow, I...
Oh' God' I just wanna eat him up, yum, yum.
Save some for me' yum, yum, yum.
- I can't keep my hands off him.
- You've had one too many.
Although he does most of the eating in the sack.
In the sack and of the sack.
All right, that's enough.
Look, you've drunk too much.
You do this every time.
You get too Mary for everybody in the room
- and you can't contain yourself.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
And by containing myself, do you mean containing myself in a closet?
In a closet of denial?
Is that...?
No, no, no.
Holy shit, this just got real.
This is exactly why you haven't met my mother.
You don't know how to ease people into this situation.
- You just force your way in every time.
- I thought, maybe for one second in this godforsaken town, I could be myself.
I'm so sorry.
No, you're right' I should just butch up and pretend that I don't love it when you shove your dick in my mouth.
- This is the best night of my life.
- Am I making a spectacle?
- I could make a much bigger scene.
- You really are.
I'm sorry.
Pittsburgh.
Listen up' Monroe-vers.
My name is Brandon St. Randy' and I love Bobby Long.
- Fucking A.
- Is that enough?
Is that enough of a scene?
I could start doing worse than that.
The reason you haven't taken me to your mother's...
Your mother with her makeup and all her drinking, she's in the closet too.
- They fight just like real people.
- I thought I'd be a conduit for you...
Thank you.
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm not.
- Thank you.
- I love you.
- I'll e-mail you.
- Zack, it was so nice to meet you.
And I will be patient with you.
I will be there on your journey.
I will be your Sherpa up the mountain of gayness.
Well' might as well see how many hits Granny Panties is up to, huh?
Did I do that?
Thanks, George.
What kind of evil fucks turn off your power the day...?
No, the night before Thanksgiving?
Who does that?
Can you get an advance on your card?
Fleshlight maxed-out my $200 limit.
Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.
This is bad.
If we don't come up with rent, we're gonna get locked out.
Who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.
Which means by the time we get home, there's no heat either.
Well' I think it's time we put what we always talked about into effect.
- You're gonna have to start hooking.
- You know, you jest, but these are the exact circumstances people find themselves in right before they start having sex for money.
- Yeah.
- Or making porn.
Oh, my God, yeah.
- What?
You got an idea?
We could make a porno.
- Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?
No, that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me?
That's a rad idea.
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend, he said he makes a hundred grand a year because he shoots and distributes his own porno flicks.
If it's so easy, how come everybody doesn't do it?
Because other people have options and dignity, which we do not have, which puts us in an amazingly advantageous position.
Fuck you, I have dignity.
Where?
Is it hidden in your gigantic underpants that are plastered all over the Internet?
Is that where you hide your dignity?
Every woman has a pair of those period panties.
That's, like, a fact.
Okay.
Families.
I bet people don't make porno, because they have families.
But luckily, your parents are dead.
Sorry.
My grandparents are dead.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
So who are we gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone mainstream now.
It's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks in it.
Look at Paris Hilton.
She throat-fucks a guy in night vision, now she's selling fragrances to tweens.
And I'm pretty sure she's legally retarded.
That's for tweens?
Have you seen that Joe Francis guy who made Girls Gone Wild?
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot piece of shit in the world and he has a jet and a fucking island.
Look, there's got to be a less extreme solution to our financial woes here.
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper route.
- I don't have a bike.
- Be a waiter.
No one wants me around their food.
Would you eat food that I gave you?
I would not eat food that you gave me, that's true.
I mean, nobody wants to see us fuck, Zack.
Everybody wants to see anybody fuck.
I hate Rosie O'Donnell, but if someone said' "I got a tape of Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid,"
I'd be like, "Why aren't we watching that right now?"
Because she's famous.
Hello.
So are you.
You're fucking Granny Panties.
My underwear and your ass are famous' we're not.
So who the F would wanna watch us fuck?
- At least 800 people.
- The jerks we went to school with?
- Are you serious?
- Of course.
If you heard that someone we graduated with was in a fucking porno movie, you'd watch it, right?
I'd watch that guy Brandon suck a cock, I just met him.
With this mailing list, we have almost a thousand people that would definitely buy a porno we were in just to be like,
"Hey, I sat next to that guy in Civics.
Look at his fucking dick."
We sell a thousand copies at 20 bucks a pop, bam' we have paid off our bills.
So' what do you think?
- I don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.
Oh' wow, like you've never done that before.
How many guys have you met in a bar, taken home, banged with your mouth and then never talked to again?
That's what we call a stranger.
Dude, I don't one-night mouth-fuck anybody that I pick up in bars.
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in the porno movie for some weird reason.
I guess...
We could fuck.
- Ew.
- Fuck you.
I mean, you're a nice-enough-looking guy and everything...
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're an all-right-enough-looking girl.
- How does that feel?
- Dude' I'm just saying it'd be weird and wrong, you know, like fucking my brother.
Okay, seriously, we're just talking about sex, okay?
It's for a purpose.
It's for getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.
- Wow.
- Just explain to your private beforehand,
"Look' this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash."
- Oh, my God.
- What?
You're just doing this because you've always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?
Yes.
I've gone my whole life pretending that I want nothing to do with you, just hoping one day we'd be in such dire financial straits that I could use it to finally make my move on you.
You're just being sarcastic.
- I am.
See' I was pretending to cry right there.
I guess it's not like it'd be creepy, like if we got way too drunk one night and accidentally fucked, you know?
No.
We'd be going in with the understanding that it's...
A business decision.
Strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.
- Right.
- And by end,
I mean, I'll be waxing your ass.
Fuck you.
I'm not even letting you see my ass.
I've seen your ass and the rest of you naked around a billion times already.
- That goes both ways, buddy.
- You've never seen my dick.
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.
Are you kidding?
That party we went to where you got blasted, and Houls dared you to give yourself head, and we all watched you try for, like, an hour.
Oh' yeah.
Thanks by the way, for fucking letting me do that.
Thank you.
Oh' God.
We really do know too much about each other.
See' and this would really just be one more thing.
I mean, look at us.
It's Thanksgiving and we're huddled around a flaming fucking garbage can like a couple of steno bums.
I mean, this could give us a chance to pay off our debt, pay our bills, get a fucking nicer apartment with heat in it maybe.
What are you doing?
Miriam Linky, will you have sex with me on camera for money?
I will.
A producer?
- Yeah.
- Guy who gets to finance the movie.
- You think I got that kind of money?
We just need that.
What you're about to spend on the flat screen.
Now I can't get my flat screen?
Fuck that.
No, no, no.
With your cut of the profits, you're gonna get two flat screens.
One in your living room, one in your bathroom.
One in the bathroom?
You know, it's always been my dream to watch shit while I shit.
Everyone with an ass loves to watch shit while they shit.
- I'm gonna make that happen for you.
- I don't know, man.
What else the producer do?
- Um, they help with the casting.
- What's casting?
Finding the people to be in the movie.
- I get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.
Like, I can look at a titty, make sure there ain't no moles on there?
- You can look at both titties, man.
- Man.
I've been looking at the same busted titties for the past almost 20 years.
- I'm due for another new titty.
- Please help us.
Please.
Please.
Yes.
Yes.
I love you.
Well' don't mind that smell.
We had some homeless people squatting in here.
You know, they'd void their bowels everywhere but the bathroom.
Anyway, you pick up the poop and you've got yourself a movie studio.
Why don't we shoot in your apartment?
No power.
You wanna pay our electric bill?
- You motherfuckers...
- We'll take it.
Bring it back.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Oh' Jesus.
Oh' Jesus.
Oh' God.
Come on.
Why the fuck do I have to do everything?
Fuckers.
Hey, what is that?
Fucking guys.
This fucking team, man.
They fucking suck.
I'm gonna hatefuck the shit out of you, ref.
- Dude.
- It's cool.
- He's my cousin.
- Hey.
Didn't you used to videotape the varsity basketball games in high school?
Just the away games.
I did it because I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.
Which one?
Whichever one wanted to fuck the guy who taped the varsity games.
- Aw.
- Still know how to work a camera?
- Who cares what the title is?
- The porn I liked when I was a kid, it was always, like, a spoof of a popular movie, you know?
Like, um, Edward Penishands.
Okay, so we need a mildly clever, vaguely dirty title, that sounds like a real movie
- and sums up what you're gonna see.
- Correct.
An American Werewolf in Brenda?
Fuckback Mountain?
- Too soon?
A Cock-in-Lips Now?
- Next.
Cradle the balls.
Work the shaft.
Jerk my come-crayon and let me color you white.
I need cock and I need it now.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
It's "puss" as in pussy.
Oh' because I was like' who would wanna fuck puss?
I want to slam my ham in your can, woman.
Scene.
- This guy is amazing.
- This guy's great-looking too.
I wanna fuck him.
Hi, my name's Delaney and I'm a producer.
I really don't know what it means.
I'm gonna be honest' this is my first time.
You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna touch you or nothing like that.
- All right.
- I have a wife, you know.
We're happy.
I mean, not happy' but it's cool, you know.
Just so you know, there will be some fucking.
- We'll talk about that if you get the part.
- Okay.
I mean, not...
We won't be fucking, there'll be fucking in the movie.
Like I said' I got a wife.
She don't play that shit.
- She is a crazy bitch.
- Yep.
It's my job as the producer to see what you got.
So if that makes you uncomfortable in any way, you don't have to show me anything you don't wanna show me, because...
I love the movies.
- Lawrence of a Labia.
- No.
- Oh, come on.
- Dawn of the Dick.
Yeah, but how are zombies doing it at all sexy?
I want to eat your brain and your ass.
- Dude.
- Sci-fi.
Yeah.
Close Encounters With a Turd From Behind.
- I don't know what that means.
- Just asses.
Fucking deep in asses.
What?
We're making a porno and we just need to know what you would be or would not be interested in doing.
If anything.
- No anal.
- Oh, definitely no anal.
Anal and hugging.
I don't do ass stuff.
- Anal.
- Ah, fuck.
- Oh, wait, oral.
I like anal.
- Yay.
Okay, well, so, uh, do you have any special skills?
Special skills?
I can get a boner really quick and it sticks straight up.
- Is that really a special skill?
- I think.
- Can you show us what you mean?
- Sure.
Oh' that is special.
Yeah, you're hired, Mr...
- Who are you again?
- Lester.
Lester "The Molester" Cockinshtuff.
- No.
- Wow.
That is the best porn name I've ever heard' man.
I can have a porn name?
- Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.
Are you Granny Panties?
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The panties are actually in the house.
- I'll get them.
- Whoa.
The Wrath of Cunt.
- We never made a Star Sex 1.
I guess we can lose Star Sex 3:
The Search for Cock, then.
- Cocunt.
- What's that?
It's Cocoon with a cunt.
So Delaney tells us you have a special talent of some sort.
I don't know if I'd call it a special talent, but it's a little something I picked up doing bachelor parties.
It would probably be easier if I just showed you.
- Great.
- The floor is yours.
So a movie, huh?
That could be fun.
Holy fuck.
Her name's Bubbles.
- Invasion of the Potty-Snatchers?
- That's like MAD Magazine stupid.
Well' fuck you' okay?
You try to think of a good sci-fi porno title.
It's hard.
There's gotta be one we haven't thought of that would say it all' not be ridiculously filthy and off-putting, and still have instant recognition with our audience.
- I got it.
- I got it.
- Star Whores.
- Yeah.
It's funny' right?
See' we figured this opens us up to an even bigger sales market beyond the people we went to school with.
People who like comics and sci-fi.
Comics?
Like "Ziggy"?
"Ziggy"?
Is that even in fucking papers anymore?
No, man.
Fuck you. "Ziggy" is a comic' right next to "Family Circus."
No, like Spider-Man and shit, you know?
There's always a shitload of Star Wars nerds at those comic-book shows.
So we sell them a Princess Leia they can really fucking jerk off to.
- That'd be me, Princess Lay-Her.
- Who am I playing?
You' my friend, are the lead role of Lubed Guy-Baller.
Man' he's gonna be balling dudes?
I thought you said this was boys on girls.
If I have to fuck a guy' okay, but I'd rather fuck a girl.
What's wrong with you, boy?
- We'll change the name to Sky-Baller.
- Sky-Baller.
I will be Hung So-low.
Delaney, my friend, you are On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
Man' I can't be in no porno.
My wife will kill me.
Hump me, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
You're my only hump.
On the other hand, fuck my wife.
Unfortunately, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over does not have any sex in the movie but the droids do, l-CUP and R2-T-Bag.
I robot.
And Stacey over here is gonna play Darth Vibrator.
- I'm the bad guy?
- She's not a guy, Zack.
I know that because I'm not a fucking idiot.
In our movie, Darth Vibrator is a bad girl who wants to fuck the galaxy, literally' and it's up to Lubed and Hung to stop her with their cocks.
- You and me get to have sex, then?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- I know.
Isn't that awesome?
Hold up, hold up.
So who's all having sex with who in this movie?
As of last night, I was having sex with Zack.
What?
Han Solo ain't never had no sex with Princess Leia in the Star Wars.
Guys' this isn't a literal adaptation here.
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.
Kind of like The Wiz or like a parody.
With lots of anal.
- Cool.
- I know, isn't that awesome?
I have a question, do Princess Lay-Her and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?
Uh, no, because they're brother and sister, and according to Miri' brothers and sisters can't fuck.
But you said, that this wasn't a literal translation, so that means Lester's character could have sex with Miri's character.
Because I would love to fucking eat her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.
Dream on, pal, it's never gonna happen, okay?
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See' she's fine...
Wait, what?
Yep.
I mean, everyone else is having sex with more than one person in this movie all of a sudden, so I think it's' you know' not fair if I'm only fucking you.
Guys, read amongst yourselves, okay?
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Look, Miri, we got plenty of sex going on in this thing, you don't have to do that.
Zack, it's fine.
I mean I have slept with way worse-looking guys than Lester.
I just wanna do my part for the movie like everyone else.
You're having sex in the movie, you don't need to fuck someone else.
- You're good.
- I'm only fucking you' though.
So don't we need to vary it up to keep it fair?
Fair for...?
I don't...
What?
Fair for who?
What are these, blood diamonds we're talking about?
Fair for everyone else who is fucking more than one person, a.k.a. you' in the movie.
- I mean, fine...
- All right.
I mean, if you don't care...
I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
Fuck.
I don't give a shit.
Like you said, you know, you've fucked bigger idiots than Lester.
Holy shit.
Are we really gonna shoot this in outer space?
Maybe not bigger idiots.
Thank you.
- Cut.
All right, guys, that's it.
- Yeah.
Make sure you leave your costume so we know they're here for tomorrow.
Mostly, everybody, thank you so much for helping us get ready' you know.
Cleaning this place out, building the sets, sewing the costumes, it's just...
I mean, it's really amazing.
Thank you.
Seriously, thanks.
But this is just the beginning, guys.
If Star Whores works, and it will' we are set up for sequels galore.
The Empire Strikes Ass.
- Return of the Brown-Eye.
- The Phantom Man-Ass.
And Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter.
- Okay.
- Revenge of the Shit.
- You got it?
- Yeah, no, we got it.
Ew.
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.
- We'll talk about that one.
We're gonna have a lot of fun' but more importantly, we're gonna make a lot of fucking money' okay?
- Yeah.
- So get ready for greatness, people.
Tomorrow we start principal photography.
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
- All right, good night, you guys.
- We got a movie.
- What?
- Nothing.
I think someone should acknowledge how insane and amazing this is
- and it's all because of you.
- I don't know.
It's just a porno.
You know what I mean.
You've really come into your own.
Shut the fuck up.
So speaking of coming into things' ready for tomorrow?
Twenty years' we're finally gonna know what it's like to have sex with each other.
You say that like you've been wondering what it'd be like to sleep with me for a while now.
Why the fuck do you think I started hanging out with you?
I knew it.
Here, help.
Let's just promise that it's not gonna change anything between us, okay?
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Some guys can't keep sex in perspective.
If anyone's gotta keep this in perspective, it's you, okay?
I don't want you getting all mushy and gooey on me after I give you the best orgasm you've ever had.
Oh' like you know what you're doing down there at all.
I actually don't.
Where's the clitoris?
Is it in your ass?
Just, you know, make sure you kind of whoop it up and act like I'm a stud who knows what he's doing' okay?
Just be a pal.
Oh' dude, I am gonna Meryl Streep the fuck out of this tomorrow, you watch.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
No.
Really, thank you.
For everything.
You're welcome.
Less than 12 hours and we make Monroeville history.
- I really hope nothing goes wrong.
- It's a movie.
What could go wrong?
What are you doing?
What's up?
- What the fuck?
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait.
- Wait.
- Stop.
Stop.
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck is going on?
Condos is what's going on, as soon as this shit-hole's demo'd.
No, you gotta stop it right now.
We rented this place for a month from Mr. Jenkins.
Sounds like your Mr. Jenkins was full of shit.
Luxury Homesteads bought this place a month ago.
I'm gonna kill that lying old fuck.
You're gonna have to go Florida, that's where he moved.
We've got thousands of dollars of equipment in there.
- Please.
- If you wanna sift through this rubble when we're done, be my guest.
Hey, get that fucking beam down.
This is the last thing you wanna hear.
If you don't get an advance,
I don't think we're gonna keep a roof over our heads.
I got an advance already.
It went into all the costumes.
- So all our money's gone?
- All your money?
Never mind what my wife's gonna do when there ain't no new snow tires, or when she sees I charged a video camera.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this' man.
I just wanted to see some free titties.
That's all.
But there's no such thing as free titties' is there, Zack?
- Is there?
- Fuck this noise.
Why don't we get another camera, and shoot something else?
Where are we gonna do that?
Got another sound stage?
Sound stage?
We had a shit-covered garage we turned into a sound stage.
We find someplace new and we do it again.
How?
Okay, I'm broke, man.
No, make that' I was broke.
Now I am really tapped out.
I have to get another job to pay Delaney back.
So please tell me, how can I afford to start over?
- What can I get you?
- Yeah, can I get a, uh...?
Too fucking late.
Cappuccino, 3.50.
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
I mean, I'm a total loser in every single other aspect of my life.
What made me think I could do something as simple as filming people fucking?
We have no money left, nowhere to shoot, no sets, we have no fucking cameras.
Here.
It's time I go back to my regular life where I am a quiet fuckup who doesn't cost anybody any money and knows his goddamn position behind this fucking counter making cappuccinos for this fucking guy.
Oh' yeah.
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
Oh' yeah.
Yeah.
Fuck, yes.
Zack.
You sneaky Indian motherfucker.
I tell you, yes.
Swallow My Cockuccino.
- What?
- That's it.
That's the movie.
Why didn't I think of it before?
We don't need sets or a stage.
Look at all this production value, waiting to have balls on it.
Hold up.
You wanna shoot a dirty movie here, where we work?
Yes.
Fuck, yes, I do.
You know how many stories I have from working here?
How many times I've been laid right there after hours?
You've never gotten laid here after hours.
I know.
Thank you for reminding me.
But I always wish I had, and that's what porno is.
It's fantasy.
It's taking the normal and making it abnormal by fucking it.
Don't do that.
The little dog don't like that.
How did you get a camera?
By being a terrible, untrustworthy employee, that's how.
Give me today, I'll bang out a script.
Meet me back here after closing.
We're gonna launch arching ropes of jism all over this motherfucker.
Peace.
I like that guy but if he tries to fuck that little dog tonight for real,
I'm calling the Humane Society.
It's called Bean-N-Gone, so get the fuck out of here.
Hey, Barry.
Stand by, Stace' picture's up.
- Okay.
Roll tape.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 12, Take 1.
And action.
I'd like a double espresso so I can stay up all night because I'm in the mood to fuck.
Well' I am a whore-ista, so I love to fuck.
Would you like to fuck me?
Holy fuck.
You mean, after you're done with your shift?
I mean during my shift.
- Sorry.
- Keep going, keep going.
With your shaft.
Let us fuck.
Cue music.
Okay, open up to camera, guys.
Let us see it.
More tongue.
Little less tongue.
Oh' that was good.
Cue effects.
Oh' yeah, like that.
Oh' yeah.
See' I told you it would work.
Didn't I tell you?
It looks amazing.
It's incredible.
Oh' the beans hurt.
Easy.
- Move in for coverage.
- Nice.
That's why we got him.
- Nice.
I'm impressed.
- Get in there, Deacon.
- Come on.
- Like that?
Like that.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
- Pull out a bit, actually.
- That's hot.
No, not you, Lester.
Put it back in.
Kiss the muscle.
- I kiss the muscle.
- You kiss the muscle.
- Can he slap her ass a little?
- Don't be a fucking pervert, dude.
- Stir, come on.
Stir.
- Yeah, stir it.
Stir it, baby.
Hey.
- Holy.
- Shit.
Are you guys still open?
No.
We close at 9.
I need coffee so I'm drive home.
- Okay.
Yeah.
- Thank you.
That's a cute kitty.
Okay.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You guys see the game?
I was at it.
Fucking Roethlisberger, the quarterback, was all fucking'
"Hug it' chug it, football.
All night." Heh-heh.
Okay, pal' here you go.
On the house.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Have a good one.
- Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- I said, have a good one.
Oh.
- Okay.
Keep moving.
- You and your little dog.
Go Steelers.
Action.
Oh' yeah.
Yeah, yeah, like that.
Oh' fuck it' chuck it' football.
Oh' yeah.
Oh' God' this is good.
You take it.
You take it.
Take it, Barry.
Oh, take it.
Take it, Barry.
Take it.
I'm disturbed at how turned on I am by this.
- Shit, dude' it's almost 6.
- Oh, fuck.
Okay, that's a wrap, everybody, yeah.
Let's give a hand to our hotties with the bodies from last night.
Stacey, Lester, Bubbles, Barry' whoo.
Yeah.
- Nice.
Okay, when we come back tonight, we finish up the venti-vulva scene' and then we get into me and Miri's stuff.
Again' amazing first night, everybody.
Thank you so much.
Let us fuck.
- Hey' how'd it look?
- How do you think it looked?
It looked like shit going into other shit, in focus.
What an artist.
That was Kurosawa's motto. "Shit going into other shit."
Oh' man, I can't believe you gotta work now.
It's okay.
You know, honestly, I don't think I could sleep.
- I'm pretty, like, pumped up right now.
- Right?
It was amazing.
It was awesome.
I think the cast and crew had a good time.
- We were getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.
I just wanna keep shooting people boning all day.
I don't think I've ever met the ambitious Zack Brown before.
- Well' I'm trying to pay the bills, so...
- It's not a bad thing.
I think it looks good on you.
Come on, hurry.
Come on, come on' come on.
Wait a minute.
- You guys never did it before?
- It's fine.
You know, we talked about it and it's just for the movie.
We're friends' you know' we're just friends.
And we will always just be just friends, so...
Listen' I have some extra lube from last night.
I understand it's kind of hard getting wet when everyone's watching.
At least it was for Barry.
- I don't know if I am gonna need it.
- Really?
Yeah, I think I'm just excited.
Uh-huh.
At the idea of people watching' not because of Zack.
Oh' God.
Zack could never have that effect on me in a million years.
- Hello, Miriam.
- Oh, hey.
Wow.
- Your face.
- Yeah.
Weird, huh?
I don't think I've seen your face since senior year.
I think I made a mistake.
I did it for you so you wouldn't get road rash during our scene, but I should have asked first' I look like a fucking beluga whale.
I think I'll be going now.
Okay.
All I keep thinking is we should've done a trial run at home last week or something.
- Oh, my God.
Right?
- I know.
- You're still cool to do it, though, right?
- Yeah, um.
Totally.
Are you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I'm, uh...
- Honestly, I'm a little nervous, I guess.
- You are?
- It's kind of a big deal.
- It is?
Yeah, you know, it's our first time together since our auspicious debut on viral video.
Oh' yeah.
That's a fuckload of pressure for a director.
As a director, please.
What about the anxiety I'm feeling as an actress?
- Did I pick the right project?
- Yeah.
What about this follow-up?
Julia Roberts followed Pretty Waman with Sleeping With the Enemy.
I'm following Granny Panties with Swallow My Cockuccino.
Only difference is this movie's about cock-sucking and her movie just sucked cock, period.
- The only difference, yeah.
- The end was pretty rad.
I liked that.
- When she kills him.
- With a gun.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- She calls the cops first.
- She calls it in first.
- It was so awesome.
- Awesome, yeah.
So I guess we should do this.
I think we should probably wait just until I lose another 20 or 30 pounds.
Stop it.
You look good.
Thanks.
So, what about me?
How do I look?
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful, so I guess it's not a big deal, but you look amazing.
- Okay.
Let's go make a porno.
- Okay.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 8, Take 1.
Come here.
- I'm over...?
All right, settle.
Action.
Who could it be?
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm a delivery man and I have some cream for you.
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.
I work out.
So do you want me to give you your cream now?
I've been waiting for it all day.
- Fuck.
Come on.
- Oops.
Keep going.
I spilled my cream.
Do you mind?
I don't mind.
Especially if you spill it on my face.
Let us fuck.
- Fix my shirt.
Think I should?
- Okay.
Let me see them titties.
Actually, you know what?
Sorry, I don't think we should show them.
- What?
- We shouldn't show your breasts.
- Aren't you gonna take your shirt off?
- I'm just gonna open it.
You're not gonna take it off?
Why not?
My tits are bigger than yours.
I don't wanna show that.
She's not gonna show her tits?
I showed my cock and my asshole.
- Okay, I'll do your pants.
- Back and forth. okay.
- Holy shit.
- Where's that delivery?
I can't believe this.
I was delivering cream, and look what's happening.
- Jesus, what is that, a rumba?
- What's a rumba?
That awkward movement.
- Should I take your underpants off?
- Yeah, take them off.
What the fuck?
How does this work?
They're just like...
I'll do it.
- I'll do mine, you just...
You do yours.
- I'll do my pants.
Granny panties.
Just get on with it already.
I'm gonna fuck you with my pecker.
Dude, that's really dirty.
- That's too dirty?
- That offends me.
- Penis?
- Fine.
- I'm gonna fuck you with my penis.
- I can't wait.
For my penis.
Be careful, Miri.
Okay, there we go.
Just keep rolling, keep rolling.
- I'll walk forward.
- Fucking cream is coming.
This is the worst porno I've ever seen.
Get over here, delivery man.
- Let's fuck on these beans.
- You okay?
- Yup.
Okay' all right.
- Just leave them.
Just leave them.
- They're really distracting.
- You should leave them.
- You gotta get your...
There you go.
- Okay' okay.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.
This okay?
Okay.
Okay, uh.
- We'll start kissing on three' okay?
- Okay.
One, two, three.
Go.
I'm ready.
- I'm ready.
- Okay.
Deacon.
- Deacon.
Deacon.
- What?
Did you see Lost this week, man?
I missed it.
What happened?
They're on the island, off the island.
Who can follow that?
I think they're in hell.
Would you all shut the motherfuck up?
I want you to come.
- I want you to come with me.
- Okay.
Oh' God.
Oh' God.
Cut.
That's it?
It's over?
Ain't he supposed to come on her titties?
Well' it wasn't what we'd shot-listed' but that was nice.
- It was so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack.
Thanks, Lester, uh.
It wasn't just me, though, guys.
Give it up for my radiant costar here, Miri.
Nice.
- Um, show's over in here.
Let's move out' start lighting the next scene.
- All right.
- Let's do it.
You looked so beautiful.
- Thanks.
I thought they were gonna be fucking hard.
- It was pretty.
- Pretty don't sell.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
You good, Mir?
You need anything?
I'm just gonna take a minute, okay?
Okay, uh.
I'll just be out there.
Yeah.
- That was fun.
- Yeah, fun.
"Fun." You fucking douche.
Wow.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You working on a rewrite?
- Yeah, just for tonight's scene.
- I'm ready to go when you are, though.
- Okay.
You know, before we go, I...
I'm thinking that, uh, it's a good idea if we talk about what happened last night.
- Oh.
- I mean, we don't have to' but I think...
Okay, yeah, uh.
I kind of dropped the ball on that, I guess, huh?
- No, no.
It's...
- To be honest, it was...
You know, I didn't realize how weird it would be for me.
Weird?
Like...
Weird how?
Acting and directing at the same time.
It's a lot to process, you know.
For the first time' I thought my balls didn't have enough hair on them.
That's not what I meant.
I know what you meant.
How you feeling about it?
I guess, um...
I feel like...
Like we...
- Holy fuck.
- The power's on.
Did you do this?
How did this happen?
I burned the bills.
How could we have done that?
- The water.
- The water.
Come on, come on' come on.
Yeah!
- We can shower in our home again.
- We are liquid.
Greetings.
Have you heard the good news about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?
Oh' my God, did you guys do this?
We got tired of you taking showers at our places all the time.
So we took up a collection amongst ourselves.
And chipped away at your mountain of debt.
You guys paid off our massive utilities bills?
- How did you afford that?
- I stole my old lady's bingo winnings.
And Mistress Bubbles did a bachelor party tonight at which yours truly was a guest star, thank you very much.
- Oh.
- Whoa.
Don't get too excited.
We didn't pay off your whole bill.
Just a month of each.
They agreed to turn everything back on?
At 9 at night?
How does that work?
Stacey knows somebody that works at Power and Light.
- You guys...
- This is amazing.
You didn't have to do this.
You didn't have to put us in your movie.
- Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.
- Or put us in your movie either.
- We said that already.
Guys, honestly, I don't know what to say.
You can start by saying we can take tonight off so we can have our wrap party right now.
Guys, we're not wrapped.
We still have four days of shooting left.
Excuse me.
In my "producorial" capacity,
I'm shutting the movie down for a night so we can get a little silly.
Go' go' go.
- Yes.
- Yes.
You all drink.
Was it just amazing with him, after all those years of not knowing?
It was, um, weird.
- But good.
- My scene with Zack's tomorrow.
You don't say.
But I'm a little nervous.
I was thinking about trying to get with him tonight.
- Really?
- I mean, if you don't mind.
You are just friends and all' so I didn't think it would be a biggie.
- It wouldn't be a biggie, would it?
- No.
No, no.
It's not a biggie.
What?
No.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Stacey' I'm not married to the guy, so...
I don't know.
You guys just looked kind of intimate last night.
- We did?
- Yeah.
Well' we're just better actors than I thought, I think, so you know what?
If you wanna get with him' you should just go ask him.
- He'd be really excited to hear that.
- Yeah?
For real, you don't mind?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
All the quarters are on the ground.
Hey, Stace.
- Hey' Zack.
Come on, are you guys playing or what?
Well' I'm bummed, but I totally get it.
It's no problem to work with Lester again.
He has a nice cock.
Well' you're a trouper, Stace.
Oh' but if I start making weird faces or anything during the scene' it's just because I've been constipated all day.
Oh' shit' uh.
We don't have to shoot the scene tonight.
No, I want to.
Anal's great for when you're constipated.
It totally loosens you up.
I use ex-lax' but good to know.
Okay, I never thought I would have that conversation.
So are we starting with Lester and Stacey tonight?
We were supposed to start with Lester and Miri.
I know.
She...
We're not gonna do that.
I don't think Miri's gonna do that.
Hey.
So where are we shooting this?
Over here?
- What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.
Our scene's tonight, right?
Can I talk to you for a minute in the back?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
What do you want me to shoot here?
Start with the close-ups of Lester and Stacey.
Give me a second, man.
What an artist.
Okay, uh.
Did I do something wrong to you?
No.
Then why are you here?
I'm here for the same reason you're here.
To make the movie.
Okay, just, like' for your own personal information, you're acting really weird right now.
I'm acting weird?
I think you're acting weird right now.
Oh' I'm acting...
How exactly am I acting weird?
You've been trying to keep me from fucking anybody but you since we started this thing.
Maybe I was thinking about your feelings.
Were you thinking of my feelings when you were banging Stacey?
Because that'd be really sad for Stacey.
She told me that you told her that that was okay.
I told her that it was okay to ask you.
Holy shit.
I get it.
I fucking get it.
It was a test.
That whole thing was a fucking test, is that it?
If it was, how do you think you did?
We had a discussion, Miri.
We had...
Actually, we had many discussions about how it was just sex
- and how we wouldn't let it get weird.
- I'm not acting weird.
You're acting like a jealous girlfriend is what the fuck you're acting like.
- I am not your girlfriend.
- I know that.
You're not my boyfriend, so why are we having this conversation right now?
Because you're about to fuck Lester to spite me, it seems like.
Did you fuck Stacey to spite me?
No.
You fucked her like you fucked every other bitch and never gave a shit how I felt about it.
- Well' that was before.
- Before what?
Look, don't fucking pretend that the other night, you and me, right there, that that didn't mean anything to you, that you didn't feel it too.
Oh.
You're not getting all gooey on me here, are you, Zack?
You know what?
If you were any other bitch I didn't give a rat's ass about,
I would tell you to go fuck yourself right now because I fucking hate this game-playing shit.
But you, you mean more to me than that' so I'm just gonna lay this out on front street.
I know you felt something big, something real the other night when we were together because I felt it too.
We tried to fuck and instead, we wound up making love.
So if this is what you need to hear in order to keep you from fucking Lester, if this is what you need, then fine.
Here it is, I'm gonna say it.
I love you, Miri.
Happy?
Oh' Jesus.
You better get ahold of yourself, Zack, because we just fucked.
Okay.
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?
But you did.
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.
Wait...
All right, don't forget I'm down here.
Watch that pullout, huh?
Yeah.
Mmm.
This is some damn good coffee.
- Where you going?
- Getting the fuck out of here.
We gotta finish this movie.
Yo!
You believe this shit?
Do you believe this shit?
What the fuck just happened in there?
I'll tell you what just happened in there.
That chick frosted me like I was a fucking cake.
Zack.
Okay, seriously' get a picture of me right now.
I'm hunting humans.
- Dude' check it out.
Ooh.
- Oh, shit.
Seriously, let's shoot the shit out of this bitch.
- Where you aiming at?
- Cock shots?
Cock shots.
We shot you in the balls, cunt nugget.
Well' it's my job to get shot in the balls, so... oh, they're gone.
Excuse me.
Didn't you used to work at the Bean-N-Gone in Monroeville?
I sure as shit hope this pays better, I tell you.
So why don't they just shoot you with a puck?
What do you mean?
I mean, what does paintball got to do with hockey?
Nothing, I guess.
- So ain't no prizes or...?
- No, no.
So, what are they paying $5 for?
To shoot a Broad Street Bully in the balls.
White people are fucked up.
Yup' they sure are.
It's a living.
You've been getting the checks I've been sending?
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Probably didn't save you from a brutal tongue-lashing, though, huh?
You know, the wife never found out about the camera, because I paid off the bills.
How did you manage that?
- Because now I'm Oprah rich.
- No way.
- The post office fucking settled?
- Hundred-sixty large' son.
- Nice, man.
Congratulations.
- A beautiful day, thank you very much.
I thought you made that whole thing up.
No, no.
It was very real.
You can believe it.
Even though she's spending all of it.
Well' since you ain't gonna ask me, I'll just go ahead and tell you.
- No, I have not seen Miri.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.
Oh' I suppose you weren't gonna ask about your movie, neither?
Look, that's why I came down here.
I need you to come take a look at it.
- I'm not interested.
Sorry.
- You'd better get interested
- because you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?
The story doesn't make sense.
- The story?
- The story doesn't make sense.
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?
It's a movie, dog, and a movie's gotta have an ending, which we don't have at the moment.
Come shot, credits.
There's your fucking ending.
Do me this favor, okay?
When you're done getting your nuts blown off' come back to humble Monroeville to my crib for a couple hours' check out the flick, you tell me what's missing.
No.
I'll tell you what, you do that, you don't owe me shit no more.
- Really?
- Really.
- Is your wife home?
- Yes.
- Maybe I should leave the pads on.
- You got some extra ones?
Hey, honey.
Where the fuck you been?
And who in the fuck is this now?
Would you calm down, woman?
Goddamn.
You already left one white boy down in my basement while you off gallivanting and shit.
What if this motherfucker
- was all grabby on me?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
Oh' what in the fuck is that supposed to mean?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
- White boys love me.
White boy.
- I said, white boy.
- Yeah?
You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?
- Should I say yes?
- Just say yes.
Yeah.
- Why don't you, uh, head downstairs?
- Oh, okay.
It's just through this hallway.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
What the fuck you looking at?
Why you gotta be yelling at me in front of my director?
- Oh, he's a director?
- Yeah.
I didn't know that.
Shit, he's a director.
Well' why don't he direct my ass to a new husband?
How about that shit?
- That's the bedroom.
- Keep talking, maybe he will.
Oh' don't nobody want them saggy-ass balls!
Saggy balls?
Look at these sagging-ass titties you got around here.
- You could tie these together.
- Motherfucker, we match.
Oh' shit.
Where's my paintball gun at?
Look at you, editor and DP.
You got your shit covered, man.
Please, don't ever say "shit-covered" to me again.
Roll the film for the man, please, so we can see what he thinks.
Just jump through it.
I ain't got all night.
The bitch is on me.
"Nigga Rich Productions." Classy.
- Yeah, DreamWorks was taken.
- Was it?
Plus' it sounds like an underground gay fuck club.
"I met a guy at DreamWorks." Yeah.
All right, so we got Lester and Stacey fucking.
Then we got Barry and Bubbles fucking.
And then this boring bullshit.
Okay, just, uh, go to the next scene, would you?
Uh...
- What next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?
We never shot it.
- Why not?
- Because after you left that night,
Miri came out of the backroom and said she couldn't do it.
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped?
So...
- Wait, so Miri...
- Never fucked nobody.
Just you.
Now, I wonder why she did that.
- Hm.
- Hm.
You see, there was a time when I was just a bitter old fuck making coffees, and Stacey was just a lap dancer and Barry and Bubbles didn't know each other and this fool here, hell, I don't even know what he was.
- A white supremacist.
- Man' fuck you.
Then two people come along and showed us something we didn't know existed.
A world of possibilities where plain old people just like us could do something special.
Even if it's something as simple as filming people fucking.
Sometimes we just need someone to show us something we can't see for ourselves
and then we're changed forever.
So as you can see' our movie ain't got no ending.
Every movie needs an ending' don't it?
Peace.
Delaney, you're a slick cupid motherfucker.
Ain't love grand?
Why the fuck is this white boy running through my goddamn house?
Sometimes.
Miri.
- Miri.
- Zack?
Miri.
I'm sorry.
- Get out.
- Close the door.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over...
- Just close the fucking door' Zack.
I never slept with Stacey that night, okay?
I swear to God.
When we got into my room, you know what we did?
We talked about you, and us and how things were different and how I was too much of a fucking pussy to just tell you how I felt about you.
And I know...
I know that that's only because of all the stupid shit we said about how we wouldn't let sex change us, but it did.
It changed me.
That has to be love, right?
It has to be love and just so you know, I can't go back to being just friends anymore,
- because I just can't.
- Good.
And I think...
I think that you feel the same way.
Because that night after I left, you didn't fuck Lester.
What's up, Zack?
You know what?
I don't care that you're fucking Lester, okay?
How's that?
- Oh, shit.
- I don't wanna be with anyone but you.
So I will wait forever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life because I love you, and I have for as long as I can remember.
And I would rather die than be without you, Miriam Linky.
Miri's last name is Linky?
You're gonna fuck a guy who doesn't know your last name?
Or that you beat up Carl Roth in the sixth grade?
I know that.
Or what your senior prom dress would've looked like had we gone but we decided not to, and we got drunk alone instead.
Or that you washed your hair in the toilet.
We're not fucking' Zack.
Or that you're not fucking Zack...
What?
I asked her to fuck me.
She wouldn't do it.
I even tried to talk her into giving me the fucking Dutch rudder.
Shot me down on that too.
- And a Dutch rudder is?
- Don't know what a Dutch rudder...?
All right, you grab your dick, then you have someone else work your arm.
Here, let me show you.
All right, grab my arm.
I'm grabbing my dick, you're grabbing my arm.
Now work it.
Work my arm.
See that shit?
Work it up and down.
It's like someone else is jerking you off.
Okay.
There's the double Dutch rudder, which' I grab my dick, you grab your dick, you work my arm, I work your arm' same time.
It's like jerking off together but not gay.
We're not touching dicks, each other's dicks anyway.
I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.
It feels good, sir.
Try me, come on.
Sorry to change the subject on you, Lester, but if you're not fucking Miri, why is your dick out right now?
Because I live here now, and I like to be naked.
- What?
- When you moved out, she couldn't afford to pay her rent by herself, so I moved in to help.
But you just came out of her room.
That's my room now.
She moved in your old room.
Wait, wait, wait.
She changed rooms?
Yeah, she said she did it because she missed the smell of you or some shit.
I don't smell anything.
But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.
- Night, Zack.
- Night.
Do you?
Then why are you crying?
Because I missed you so much.
Me too.
I love you.
- I love you, I love you.
- I love you.
I don't mean to alarm you but I think I just jerked off Lester a little bit.
- The Dutch rudder?
- Yeah, it's ingenious, right?
If you ask me nicely, I will Dutch-rudder you the rest of our lives.
Good.
I'm getting tired of fucking the Fleshlight.
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.
- What'd it feel like?
- Like fucking a flashlight.
Wrong room.
- Oh, God.
That's gross.
Let us fuck.
Hello.
Welcome to Nigga Rich Productions' home of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, the production house for the couple looking to put a little spice in their sex life.
- Shall we take a look around?
- Fuck me so hard.
Oh, God.
First, you'll meet for a consultation with one of our romance-ologists, who'll coach you through that initial awkward stage before you're camera-ready.
So we will start off with some erotic massage and some...
Dude.
Some light petting.
That sounds good.
Are you guys sure you don't wanna do some, uh, butt-sack work too?
- Uh, let's move on' shall we?
- Why?
From their break-out hit, Swallow My Cockuccino, to the multi-million selling Swallow My Cockuccino II and the award-winning Star Whores saga, including Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter,
Zack and Miri have proven time and again that they know how to shoot hot sex.
As an actor, I've sometimes brought my work home with me inappropriately.
When you're telling your real-life lover in the bedroom' to' you know' bend over while you cake your hand in K-Y, it is a sign that the romance is dead, I think.
Then we turned to the professionals at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
Oh' my God, they totally saved our civil union.
They filmed what was inside of us and not what was coming out of us necessarily.
It helped me see his asshole as not just a come dumpster, but a sign of his beauty' his flower.
It became a, uh, gorgeous orchid.
Orchids grow in sort of the filthiest conditions.
That's what his asshole became to me.
This beautiful flower amidst shit.
- Honey, they get the metaphor.
- I don't think they do.
Let's just say, thank you to Zack and Miri.
It's helped us out, it's helped our friends.
Enrique?
Park?
Park?
Enrique?
Can we get a little love for Zack and Miri?
They don't even know what's going on, they're so pilled up.
But don't take his word for it.
Just ask our co-founders.
- Hi.
I'm Miri Linky Brown.
- I'm Zack Linky Brown.
Here at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, we're dedicated
- to committing your love...
- Or lust.
- to high-end, quality production digital video.
A forever keepsake of your passion.
That's right, Miri.
Why set up a camera at the end of your bed and settle for one unflattering angle, when you could let the professionals dazzle and delight your senses with an array of shots so masterfully rendered you'll swear Martin Scorsese snuck into your room
and caught you fucking?
And remember' we're not just the presidents of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
We're also clients.
Call now to set up your appointment
Way to fuck, Zack.

You little motherfucker!
Get up, Zack.
Come on, I don't wanna be late for work.
MIRI:
- Ahh!
Get out!
- Jesus, fuck!
Close the door if you're gonna take a shit.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over, it was not closed.
- Close the door, Zack!
- Okay, okay.
MIRI:
- God.
- Fine.
- What's that thing?
- It's a hand warmer.
[ SIGHS ]
We're going now.
- You smell that?
Is that the car?
Fuck.
- Oh, goddamn it.
- What?
What?
- Oh, it's wedged in my taint.
- What is?
- It got wedged in my taint.
- What?
- It's stuck under my balls.
- It's between my balls and my leg.
- What's happening?
- Please, pull over.
Pull the fuck over!
- Okay, all right!
Jesus, okay.
ZACK:
- It's about to move up to my ass.
MIRI:
- What?
ZACK:
The movement makes it hotter.
It's tucked under them.
It's stuck under them.
[ GRUNTING ]
Oh, fuck.
I think I burned my ball hair off.
[ LAUGHING ]
It's not funny.
Can you help me pick out an outfit for tonight?
I'm working till 6.
- Well, I can try stuff on at the store.
- The store?
No, how about instead, you get a friend?
But you are my friend.
I mean a girl friend, jeez.
[ JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ]
Mr. Delaney, can you work for me tomorrow?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
Then you must come in the next day, I tell you.
- It's Black Friday.
- Black Friday?
It's the biggest mall-shopping day of the year.
And since the mall is just up the street, I would like you to come out and work.
- On Black Friday.
- Oh, yeah.
All right, you want me to work on Moolie Monday too?
- I'm sorry?
- How about Nigga Tuesday?
- Nigga Tuesday?
This a new holiday?
- You come to a brother and tell him he gotta work on Black Friday.
You got any idea how racist that sounds?
Telling me to work.
What, you think you own me?
- I never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?
You thought,
"I'm gonna lay down the law for this nigga, I put food on his table, clothes on his nigga baby backs, and he ain't gonna say shit."
- This ain't Amistad.
- You shut up.
You goddamn right this ain't Amistad.
I can't wait till the post office settles my disability suit because then I'm gonna be out this motherfucker.
I'm gonna be Oprah rich.
Y'all can kiss my ass.
You know what?
Fuck you.
Fuck you, and suck cock.
- To hell with you.
DELANEY:
- To hell with you.
- Zachary will work.
Zack, my boy.
- Yeah.
- The customer with the harelip--
- Oh, yeah.
--speak me, say you were playing baseball here the other night.
Wiffle ball.
And, uh, no, that wasn't me.
Maybe the harelip makes it sound like "baseball."
ZACK:
Yeah, maybe you hear with an accent.
- Fuck you, okay?
- Okay.
One day, I'm gonna put a camera over there, and then I can tell--
I'll know everything you do when I'm gone.
Everything.
Scratch your balls, take a shit, everything, I tell you, okay?
Okay.
Fucker.
I hate both of you ebony and ivory motherfuckers, I tell you.
- Why is he so fucking high-strung?
- "Fuck off, I tell you.
Very good."
Can you believe that Gandhi motherfucker, telling me I gotta work on Black Friday?
Ain't that some shit?
- Yeah.
- Like I don't wanna do shopping.
Biggest sales day of the year.
I'm getting a flat-screen TV, believe that.
That's my fault, I should tell you.
I asked for Friday morning off, I'm sorry.
- For what?
- I actually need a lot of recovery time.
Tonight is me and Miri's ten-year high school reunion.
I'm just gonna get fucking alcohol poisoning.
- Reunion?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
- Isn't that fucked up that they do that?
They say it's the best chance to get everyone together.
People come back in town for the holidays.
But they could have it in the middle of the summer at a blowjob contest that I was judging, and it would still be retarded.
- So why you going, then?
- Miri's making me go.
Why you always bending over backwards for that girl,
- knowing she ain't giving up no ass?
- We got a good thing going.
She pays half the rent, does dishes, she wakes me up in the morning.
Why complicate that with sex?
Besides, man, I've known her since the first grade.
You don't fuck someone you met in the first grade.
Excuse me, I met my wife in kindergarten.
We got married senior year, and she has been the queen of my world ever since.
- What if you could do it all over again?
- I'd jerk off and live by myself.
That woman is the bane of my existence.
- See?
- Excuse me, can I get a coffee, black?
Can't you see we talking, white?
ZACK:
If you're gonna continue to emasculate me with this Barbie dress-up shit,
I'm using your laptop.
Don't forget to smack it when you turn it on, otherwise the screen doesn't come on.
[ COMPUTER PLAYS FANFARE ]
Why don't you spring and get a new one?
Same reason I don't spring for clothes for tonight, I'm broke.
There's a chick who works at Teen Juice at the mall, you know.
I gave her a good deal on yarn,
- so she's letting me borrow this stuff.
- Yo, bro.
[ ZACK LAUGHING ]
MIRI:
- What?
- You're buying a vibrator online.
- What's wrong with the one you have?
MIRI:
- It died last week.
Look at the size of those fucking panties.
Shoot that shit.
Shoot it.
ZACK:
My God, who even knew Amazon sold shit like this?
This is incredible.
- Those are fucking granny panties.
MIRI:
- Okay,
A, I don't appreciate you violating the sanctity of my Amazon Wish List page, and B, I'm not buying that thing from Amazon, because it turns out I don't have a credit card they take.
[ ZACK GRUNTS ]
- Oh, shit.
- I'm sorry, guys.
Am I in the way?
You're a fucking faggot, all right?
Let's go to Starbucks.
- He's a shitty barista anyways.
- Cock.
- And he throws like a bitch.
ZACK:
- You know what else I throw?
My nut sack in your coffees, so how did that taste, fucker?
We saw your girlfriend in her underwear, cunt nugget.
Well, too bad she's not my girlfriend, you little fuck-
- Oh, they're gone.
MIRI:
Are you still talking to me?
Uh, just said, I'm gonna look up more fuck toys on Amazon.
Oh, holy shit.
- They sell the Fleshlight here too.
- What's that?
It's a fucking pocket pussy that is shaped like a flashlight
"for discretionary jacking off."
That way if you get caught, no one thinks it's weird.
You're just a guy who likes to fuck his flashlight.
I am totally buying this shit.
Whoa, if you've got money to burn, how about paying the electric bill?
- That's due already?
- November's is probably due now, but I was talking about September's.
Tell me this doesn't rock.
You kind of look like Ronald McDonald.
That makes me want some McNuggets.
Why would you wanna buy a pocket pussy anyway?
That is so sad.
What?
Excuse me, I forgot about the nobility that accompanies coming with a fucking vibrator.
Think a kid in Darfur gets saved every time a vibrator makes you come?
No.
- "Real feel action"?
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
If you start fucking machines, I'm moving out.
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a machine.
How come you get to fuck something with a motor in it?
I've never met a man who can make me come like a vibrator does.
That's bullshit.
You get to be Buck Rogers having sex in the 25th century with fucking Twiki and Dr. Theopolis.
I'm stuck to a bottle of Jergens in the bathroom.
Holy bejesus.
You do not use my Jergens to jack it in our bathroom.
ZACK:
No, you know what I do actually, is I light a bunch of candles and I sprawl out on my sheets and I listen to Sting.
No, I'm a guy.
Give me two Popsicle sticks and a rubber band,
I'll find a way to fuck it, like a filthy MacGyver.
Oh, my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.
How about this?
I don't get why you're putting so much effort into this thing.
I thought we were just gonna go to sit around and make fun of everybody.
I can't wear anything that I already own and expect to bring home Bobby Long.
Bobby fucking Long?
No way.
Didn't that guy call you "Stinky Linky"?
Yeah, that was then, okay?
Maybe now he can save me a fortune in Amazon bills.
Maybe you can fuck our landlord so we can at least keep a roof over our heads.
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.
Hey, I bought skates with last week's paycheck
- and I need those to skate with.
- Oh.
And this week's will barely cover the past two water bills, so...
Is this sexy?
Yeah, in like a To Catch a Predator kind of way, it is pretty fucking sexy.
Then we're done.
[ SHOWER SPLASHING AND PIPES CREAKING ]
What the fuck?
Zack.
- You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?
- They shut it off.
- Oh, shit.
Just, uh--
Help me get this shit out of my hair.
Just use the water out of the toilet.
- There's poo in there.
- Not that part.
- The back part of the toilet thing.
- Oh, that makes sense.
MIRI:
Take the cup there and then scoop it in, there you go.
Here, I'll lean back and you can just, you know, pour it down like-
- Like that.
ZACK:
You're harshing my buzz, you know.
This is so lame.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Whoa!
All right, one hour tops, then we're gone.
Or I had an idea.
We could just not go at all, which would rock.
Even though we're broke and we've never amounted to anything, we're still better than these people, right?
No.
Not at all.
We're probably not even as good as most of them, unless one of them is a crackhead or something.
Just tell me I'm prettier than when we graduated.
You look about the same.
Definitely not prettier, but around the same.
I'm thinner, though, right?
A little?
Not really.
Well, good pep talk.
Fuck.
[ INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE ]
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.
- You don't recognize us, do you?
- Um, no, sorry.
Zack Brown, Miri Linky.
Were you the one they called Stinky Linky?
Oh, no, no one ever called me that.
Oh.
- Great.
What does yours say?
- What the fuck?
Come on.
- I'm sure I had a nickname.
Nothing?
- All right, you have a great time, and before you go, don't forget your copy of The Roving Roe-Ver.
What the fuck's this shit?
That is not shit, that would be our bi-monthly newsletter.
- Awesome.
BETSY:
- It updates you
- on what everyone's doing.
- Finally.
I love your enthusiasm.
Here you go.
Write your e-mail address on that and I'll be sure to add you to our 800-member-strong mailing list.
We had 800 people in our graduating class?
Yes, and only 250 R.S.V.P.'d.
Doesn't that suck, Mary?
- Miri.
- You married, Bets?
- I am.
Two kids.
- Wow, that's beautiful.
- Awesome.
- You wanna fuck me later?
- Uh, no, I'm married.
- Okay, cool.
If you change your mind,
- I'll be in there getting shitfaced.
- He will.
- Just so you know, I eat the pussy.
- He does.
Ah, tempting.
Again, no.
- Shall we?
- Sir.
Bye, Bets.

- Get the fuck off of me.

Have you seen that big blowup picture they have of me?
Yeah, it's--
My hair is terrible.
I can't believe I even wore my hair like that.
That's before I knew about styling products, you know.
It makes a big difference in life.
But you live and learn, though, right?
I mean, ten years ago, Pittsburgh, who knew anything about fashion?
Back in the day, our hairstyle, oh...
Hey, stranger.
- Whoa.
Stinky Linky.
- Yeah.
Although it's just Miri now.
- Give me a hug.
- Oh, okay.
- Hi, heh, heh, heh.
- Hi.
Wow.
- How have you been?
- Great, great.
- Yeah?
- You look fantastic.
Wow, that is not something that you would have said to me ten years ago.
- Well, I've grown up.
- Yes.
Yes, you have.
You just look...
Ooh, heh, heh.
- Well, listen to you.

- Look at him.
- Who?
- My stupid husband.
No fucking shit.
John Butterfield?
You actually married John Butterfield?
- That's amazing.
- Don't ever get married.
It sucks.
You stop appreciating each other and run out of shit to talk about after the first year.
But look at him now, chatty as fuck.
Flirting up a storm with that cheerleader nimrod Monica Von.
You want me to maybe flirt with you so he can see it, even it up a bit?
I don't wanna get even.
If I was gonna do anything, I'd wanna one-up the asshole.
You can give me a handjob in the girls' locker room.
- Fine, but make it fast.
- Fuck, yeah.
Are you staying in town for a while or--?
Just tonight.
I fly back to L.A. tomorrow.
L.A., wow, Los Angeles.
Gosh, Bobby Long, coming up in the world.
- With Mrs. Long, I bet, huh?
- No, no, no.
No Mrs. Long for me.
- Then can I be honest with you?
- Sure.
Um...
Whew.
I think I need a drink.
Do you need a drink?
Because I need a drink to say this.
- I've got a beer already, so--
- Oh, great, thank you.
I think there's a cigarette butt in there.
Yup.
Sorry about the elbow.

Don't worry, we weren't in the same class or anything.
- Okay.

- Are you a Monroe-ver?

- hanging around here?
- I do, kind of.

- Gorgeous.
- Good times.

- Really?
- Bobby Long.

- Really.
- One dressed like Hannah Montana?

- Thank you, thank you.
- In fucking movies?
"Fucking movies." Pretty much.
Look at you.
What--?
Anything I've seen?
What movies?
Oh, all sorts of movies with all-male casts.
All-male casts.
Like Glengarry Glen Ross?
Like that?
Like Glen and Gary Suck Ross' Meaty Cock and Drop Their Hairy Nuts in His Eager Mouth.
- Is that like a sequel?
- Sort of.
- It's a re-imagining.
- Oh, like The Wiz.
More erotic and with less women.
No women, to be exact.
I apologize in advance if I am out of line here, but are you in gay porn?
- Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?
- I thought you recognized me, that's--
- Oh, okay, I get it.
You're not in my demographic, so I'm not insulted.
- Not really.
Who's your demographic?
- Do you love pussy?
- I do.
- Then not you.
Oh, okay.
I came here tonight hoping to seduce you and bring you back to my apartment and sleep with you to, uh, get back at you, you know, for calling me Stinky Linky all those years ago.
Wow.
That is a weird revenge plot.
- You must be a terrible lay for that.
- What?
No, I'm great.
I mean, I've had enough practice and everything.
That--
Wow, that sounded not good.
I fuck a lot.
That's what I meant to say.
That doesn't sound good either. wow.
You're a lot funnier than I remember.
Thank you.
Gosh, you turned out to be such a nice guy.
It just-
- You know, it makes it even easier to just-
- To just say this.
Would you like to come back to my place and maybe open a bottle of wine and have ourselves a real high school reunion?
- I--
- Hello, Miriam.
Beat it, we're talking.
- I wanted to introduce you to Brandon.
- Salutations.
- Bobby's boyfriend.
- Bobby who?
- Bobby me.
- Bobby Long.
Brandon is the star of such adult fare as-
- What was that one called again?
You Better Shut Your Mouth or I'm Gonna Fuck It.
That's right.
I'm surprised I forgot that.
Are you fucking with me?
No, they're fucking with each other.
Oh, my God.
- No.
- What?
Granny Panties?
- Excuse me?
- How can you tell?
This is so crazy.
I was literally just watching you, like, right before we got here.
This is so crazy.
This is you, right?
TEEN 1 [ ON VIDEO ] :
My name's Granny Panties, and nobody wants to fuck me.
TEEN 2:
Nothing's whiter than my big gay ass--
Where'd you get that?
Oh, I entered "gay" and "ass," and it was the top hit.
It's had 200,000 views in three hours.
Honey, you are, like--
I'm jealous right now because you're, like, super famous.
Baby, please take our picture.
I get a picture with Granny Panties.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is awesome.
- All right, smile.
Okay, got it.
- Did you get it?
- Oh, thank you very much.
- E-mail me that.
Oh, because he's the worst photographer.
Okay, good.
- You're gay?
- Yeah.
And I'm on the Internet wearing a diaper?
Who knew you'd come to Pittsburgh and meet a celebrity?
I'm gonna binge-drink now until I pass out.
Okay.
She'll be fine.
So you guys suck each other's cocks, huh?
Oh, like crazy.
[ LAUGHING ]
Okay, that's enough, I think.
I'm embarrassing him.
I love when he's embarrassed.
He's not living out loud, so he gets all like, ooh.
- You are totally in love, aren't you?
- Zachary, we are.
Wow, I--
Oh, God, I just wanna eat him up, yum, yum.
Save some for me, yum, yum, yum.
- I can't keep my hands off him.
- You've had one too many.
Although he does most of the eating in the sack.
In the sack and of the sack.
All right, that's enough.
Look, you've drunk too much.
You do this every time.
You get too Mary for everybody in the room
- and you can't contain yourself.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
And by containing myself, do you mean containing myself in a closet?
In a closet of denial?
Is that--?
No, no, no.
Holy shit, this just got real.
This is exactly why you haven't met my mother.
You don't know how to ease people into this situation.
- You just force your way in every time.
- I thought, maybe for one second in this godforsaken town, I could be myself.
I'm so sorry.
No, you're right, I should just butch up and pretend that I don't love it when you shove your dick in my mouth.
- This is the best night of my life.
BRANDON:
- Am I making a spectacle?
- I could make a much bigger scene.
- You really are.
I'm sorry.
Pittsburgh.
Listen up, Monroe-vers.
My name is Brandon St. Randy, and I love Bobby Long.
- Fucking A. BRANDON:
- Is that enough?
Is that enough of a scene?
I could start doing worse than that.
The reason you haven't taken me to your mother's--
Your mother with her makeup and all her drinking, she's in the closet too.
- They fight just like real people.
- I thought I'd be a conduit for you--
Thank you.
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm not.
- Thank you.
- I love you.
- I'll e-mail you.
- Zack, it was so nice to meet you.
And I will be patient with you.
I will be there on your journey.
I will be your Sherpa up the mountain of gayness.
Well, might as well see how many hits Granny Panties is up to, huh?
[ COMPUTER PLAYS FANFARE ]
Did I do that?
[ MUSIC PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS ]
Thanks, George.
What kind of evil fucks turn off your power the day--?
No, the night before Thanksgiving?
Who does that?
Can you get an advance on your card?
Fleshlight maxed-out my $200 limit.
Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.
This is bad.
If we don't come up with rent, we're gonna get locked out.
Who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.
Which means by the time we get home, there's no heat either.
Well, I think it's time we put what we always talked about into effect.
- You're gonna have to start hooking.
- You know, you jest, but these are the exact circumstances people find themselves in right before they start having sex for money.
- Yeah.
- Or making porn.
ZACK:
- Oh, my God, yeah.
- What?
You got an idea?
We could make a porno.
- Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?
No, that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me?
That's a rad idea.
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend, he said he makes a hundred grand a year because he shoots and distributes his own porno flicks.
If it's so easy, how come everybody doesn't do it?
Because other people have options and dignity, which we do not have, which puts us in an amazingly advantageous position.
Fuck you, I have dignity.
Where?
Is it hidden in your gigantic underpants that are plastered all over the Internet?
Is that where you hide your dignity?
Every woman has a pair of those period panties.
That's, like, a fact.
Okay.
Families.
I bet people don't make porno, because they have families.
But luckily, your parents are dead.
Sorry.
My grandparents are dead.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
So who are we gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone mainstream now.
It's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks in it.
Look at Paris Hilton.
She throat-fucks a guy in night vision, now she's selling fragrances to tweens.
And I'm pretty sure she's legally retarded.
That's for tweens?
Have you seen that Joe Francis guy who made Girls Gone Wild?
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot piece of shit in the world and he has a jet and a fucking island.
Look, there's got to be a less extreme solution to our financial woes here.
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper route.
- I don't have a bike.
- Be a waiter.
No one wants me around their food.
Would you eat food that I gave you?
I would not eat food that you gave me, that's true.
MIRI:
I mean, nobody wants to see us fuck, Zack.
ZACK:
Everybody wants to see anybody fuck.
I hate Rosie O'Donnell, but if someone said, "I got a tape of Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid,"
I'd be like, "Why aren't we watching that right now?"
Because she's famous.
Hello.
So are you.
You're fucking Granny Panties.
My underwear and your ass are famous, we're not.
So who the F would wanna watch us fuck?
- At least 800 people.
- The jerks we went to school with?
- Are you serious?
- Of course.
If you heard that someone we graduated with was in a fucking porno movie, you'd watch it, right?
I'd watch that guy Brandon suck a cock, I just met him.
With this mailing list, we have almost a thousand people that would definitely buy a porno we were in just to be like,
"Hey, I sat next to that guy in Civics.
Look at his fucking dick."
We sell a thousand copies at 20 bucks a pop, bam, we have paid off our bills.
ZACK:
- So, what do you think?
- I don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.
Oh, wow, like you've never done that before.
How many guys have you met in a bar, taken home, banged with your mouth and then never talked to again?
That's what we call a stranger.
Dude, I don't one-night mouth-fuck anybody that I pick up in bars.
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in the porno movie for some weird reason.
I guess...
We could fuck.
- Ew.
- Fuck you.
I mean, you're a nice-enough-looking guy and everything--
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're an all-right-enough-looking girl.
- How does that feel?
- Dude, I'm just saying it'd be weird and wrong, you know, like fucking my brother.
Okay, seriously, we're just talking about sex, okay?
It's for a purpose.
It's for getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.
- Wow.
- Just explain to your private beforehand,
"Look, this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash."
- Oh, my God.
- What?
You're just doing this because you've always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?
Yes.
I've gone my whole life pretending that I want nothing to do with you, just hoping one day we'd be in such dire financial straits that I could use it to finally make my move on you.
MIRI:
- You're just being sarcastic.
- I am.
See, I was pretending to cry right there.
MIRI:
I guess it's not like it'd be creepy, like if we got way too drunk one night and accidentally fucked, you know?
No.
We'd be going in with the understanding that it's--
A business decision.
Strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.
- Right.
- And by end,
I mean, I'll be waxing your ass.
Fuck you.
I'm not even letting you see my ass.
I've seen your ass and the rest of you naked around a billion times already.
- That goes both ways, buddy.
- You've never seen my dick.
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.
Are you kidding?
That party we went to where you got blasted, and Houls dared you to give yourself head, and we all watched you try for, like, an hour.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks by the way, for fucking letting me do that.
Thank you.
Oh, God.
We really do know too much about each other.
See, and this would really just be one more thing.
I mean, look at us.
It's Thanksgiving and we're huddled around a flaming fucking garbage can like a couple of steno bums.
I mean, this could give us a chance to pay off our debt, pay our bills, get a fucking nicer apartment with heat in it maybe.
What are you doing?
Miriam Linky, will you have sex with me on camera for money?
I will.
DELANEY:
- A producer?
ZACK:
- Yeah.
- Guy who gets to finance the movie.
- You think I got that kind of money?
We just need that.
What you're about to spend on the flat screen.
Now I can't get my flat screen?
Fuck that.
No, no, no.
With your cut of the profits, you're gonna get two flat screens.
One in your living room, one in your bathroom.
One in the bathroom?
You know, it's always been my dream to watch shit while I shit.
Everyone with an ass loves to watch shit while they shit.
- I'm gonna make that happen for you.
- I don't know, man.
What else the producer do?
- Um, they help with the casting.
- What's casting?
Finding the people to be in the movie.
- I get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.
Like, I can look at a titty, make sure there ain't no moles on there?
- You can look at both titties, man.
- Man.
I've been looking at the same busted titties for the past almost 20 years.
- I'm due for another new titty.
- Please help us.
Please.
Please.
Yes.
Yes.
I love you.
Well, don't mind that smell.
We had some homeless people squatting in here.
You know, they'd void their bowels everywhere but the bathroom.
Anyway, you pick up the poop and you've got yourself a movie studio.
Why don't we shoot in your apartment?
No power.
You wanna pay our electric bill?
- You motherfuckers...
- We'll take it.
[ WHISTLE BLOWS ]
MAN 1 :
- Bring it back.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
DEACON:
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, God.
Come on.
Why the fuck do I have to do everything?
Fuckers.
[ CROWD CHEERS ]
MAN 2:
Hey, what is that?
DEACON:
Fucking guys.
This fucking team, man.
They fucking suck.
[ MAN 2 SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ]
I'm gonna hatefuck the shit out of you, ref.
- Dude.
- It's cool.
- He's my cousin.
- Hey.
Didn't you used to videotape the varsity basketball games in high school?
Just the away games.
I did it because I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.
Which one?
Whichever one wanted to fuck the guy who taped the varsity games.
- Aw.
- Still know how to work a camera?
- Who cares what the title is?
- The porn I liked when I was a kid, it was always, like, a spoof of a popular movie, you know?
Like, um, Edward Penishands.
Okay, so we need a mildly clever, vaguely dirty title, that sounds like a real movie
- and sums up what you're gonna see.
- Correct.
An American Werewolf in Brenda?
Fuckback Mountain?
- Too soon?
A Cock-in-Lips Now?
MIRI :
- Next.
Cradle the balls.
Work the shaft.
Jerk my come-crayon and let me color you white.
I need cock and I need it now.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
It's "puss" as in pussy.
Oh, because I was like, who would wanna fuck puss?
I want to slam my ham in your can, woman.
Scene.
- This guy is amazing.
- This guy's great-looking too.
I wanna fuck him.
DELANEY:
Hi, my name's Delaney and I'm a producer.
I really don't know what it means.
I'm gonna be honest, this is my first time.
You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna touch you or nothing like that.
- All right.
- I have a wife, you know.
We're happy.
I mean, not happy, but it's cool, you know.
Just so you know, there will be some fucking.
- We'll talk about that if you get the part.
- Okay.
I mean, not-
- We won't be fucking, there'll be fucking in the movie.
Like I said, I got a wife.
She don't play that shit.
- She is a crazy bitch.
- Yep.
It's my job as the producer to see what you got.
So if that makes you uncomfortable in any way, you don't have to show me anything you don't wanna show me, because--
I love the movies.
- Lawrence of a Labia.
- No.
- Oh, come on.
- Dawn of the Dick.
Yeah, but how are zombies doing it at all sexy?
I want to eat your brain and your ass.
[ GROANING ]
- Dude.
- Sci-fi.
Yeah.
Close Encounters With a Turd From Behind.
- I don't know what that means.
- Just asses.
Fucking deep in asses.
[ TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ]
What?
We're making a porno and we just need to know what you would be or would not be interested in doing.
If anything.
- No anal.
- Oh, definitely no anal.
Anal and hugging.
I don't do ass stuff.
- Anal.
- Ah, fuck.
- Oh, wait, oral.
I like anal.
- Yay.
Okay, well, so, uh, do you have any special skills?
Special skills?
I can get a boner really quick and it sticks straight up.
- Is that really a special skill?
- I think.
- Can you show us what you mean?
- Sure.
Oh, that is special.
[ ZACK CHUCKLES ]
Yeah, you're hired, Mr.--
- Who are you again?
- Lester.
Lester "The Molester" Cockinshtuff.
- No.
- Wow.
That is the best porn name I've ever heard, man.
I can have a porn name?
- Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.
Are you Granny Panties?
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The panties are actually in the house.
- I'll get them.
- Whoa.
- Star Sex 2:
The Wrath of Cunt.
MIRI:
- We never made a Star Sex 1.
I guess we can lose Star Sex 3:
The Search for Cock, then.
- Cocunt.
- What's that?
It's Cocoon with a cunt.
[ LAUGHING ]
So Delaney tells us you have a special talent of some sort.
I don't know if I'd call it a special talent, but it's a little something I picked up doing bachelor parties.
It would probably be easier if I just showed you.
- Great.
- The floor is yours.
So a movie, huh?
That could be fun.
Holy fuck.
Her name, Bubbles.
- Invasion of the Potty-Snatchers?
- That's like MAD Magazine stupid.
Well, fuck you, okay?
You try to think of a good sci-fi porno title.
It's hard.
MIRI:
There's gotta be one we haven't thought of that would say it all, not be ridiculously filthy and off-putting, and still have instant recognition with our audience.
- I got it.
- I got it.
- Star Whores.
- Yeah.
It's funny, right?
See, we figured this opens us up to an even bigger sales market beyond the people we went to school with.
People who like comics and sci-fi.
Comics?
Like "Ziggy"?
"Ziggy"?
Is that even in fucking papers anymore?
No, man.
Fuck you. "Ziggy" is a comic, right next to "Family Circus."
No, like Spider-Man and shit, you know?
There's always a shitload of Star Wars nerds at those comic-book shows.
So we sell them a Princess Leia they can really fucking jerk off to.
- That'd be me, Princess Lay-Her.
- Who am I playing?
You, my friend, are the lead role of Lubed Guy-Baller.
Man, he's gonna be balling dudes?
I thought you said this was boys on girls.
If I have to fuck a guy, okay, but I'd rather fuck a girl.
What's wrong with you, boy?
- We'll change the name to Sky-Baller.
- Sky-Baller.
I will be Hung So-low.
Delaney, my friend, you are On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
Man, I can't be in no porno.
My wife will kill me.
Hump me, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
You're my only hump.
On the other hand, fuck my wife.
Unfortunately, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over does not have any sex in the movie but the droids do, I-CUP and R2-T-Bag.
I robot.
And Stacey over here is gonna play Darth Vibrator.
- I'm the bad guy?
- She's not a guy, Zack.
I know that because I'm not a fucking idiot.
In our movie, Darth Vibrator is a bad girl who wants to fuck the galaxy, literally, and it's up to Lubed and Hung to stop her with their cocks.
- You and me get to have sex, then?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- I know.
Isn't that awesome?
Hold up, hold up.
So who's all having sex with who in this movie?
As of last night, I was having sex with Zack.
What?
Han Solo ain't never had no sex with Princess Leia in the Star Wars.
ZACK:
Guys, this isn't a literal adaptation here.
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.
Kind of like The Wiz or like a parody.
With lots of anal.
- Cool.
- I know, isn't that awesome?
I have a question, do Princess Lay-Her and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?
Uh, no, because they're brother and sister, and according to Miri, brothers and sisters can't fuck.
But you said, that this wasn't a literal translation, so that means Lester's character could have sex with Miri's character.
Because I would love to fucking eat her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.
Dream on, pal, it's never gonna happen, okay?
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See, she's fine-
- Wait, what?
Yep.
I mean, everyone else is having sex with more than one person in this movie all of a sudden, so I think it's, you know, not fair if I'm only fucking you.
Guys, read amongst yourselves, okay?
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Look, Miri, we got plenty of sex going on in this thing, you don't have to do that.
Zack, it's fine.
I mean I have slept with way worse-looking guys than Lester.
I just wanna do my part for the movie like everyone else.
You're having sex in the movie, you don't need to fuck someone else.
- You're good.
- I'm only fucking you, though.
So don't we need to vary it up to keep it fair?
Fair for--?
I don't-
- What?
Fair for who?
What are these, blood diamonds we're talking about?
Fair for everyone else who is fucking more than one person, a.k.a. you, in the movie.
- I mean, fine--
- All right.
I mean, if you don't care--
I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
Fuck.
I don't give a shit.
Like you said, you know, you've fucked bigger idiots than Lester.
Holy shit.
Are we really gonna shoot this in outer space?
Maybe not bigger idiots.
[ MOUTHS ] Thank you.
- Cut.
All right, guys, that's it.
- Yeah.
Make sure you leave your costume so we know they're here for tomorrow.
Mostly, everybody, thank you so much for helping us get ready, you know.
Cleaning this place out, building the sets, sewing the costumes, it's just--
I mean, it's really amazing.
Thank you.
ZACK:
Seriously, thanks.
But this is just the beginning, guys.
If Star Whores works, and it will, we are set up for sequels galore.
The Empire Strikes Ass.
- Return of the Brown-Eye.
- The Phantom Man-Ass.
And Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter.
- Okay.
- Revenge of the Shit.
- You got it?
- Yeah, no, we got it.
Ew.
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.
- We'll talk about that one.
We're gonna have a lot of fun, but more importantly, we're gonna make a lot of fucking money, okay?
- Yeah.
- So get ready for greatness, people.
Tomorrow we start principal photography.
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
- All right, good night, you guys.
- We got a movie.
- What?
- Nothing.
I think someone should acknowledge how insane and amazing this is
- and it's all because of you.
- I don't know.
It's just a porno.
You know what I mean.
You've really come into your own.
Shut the fuck up.
So speaking of coming into things, ready for tomorrow?
Twenty years, we're finally gonna know what it's like to have sex with each other.
You say that like you've been wondering what it'd be like to sleep with me for a while now.
Why the fuck do you think I started hanging out with you?
I knew it.
Here, help.
Let's just promise that it's not gonna change anything between us, okay?
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Some guys can't keep sex in perspective.
If anyone's gotta keep this in perspective, it's you, okay?
I don't want you getting all mushy and gooey on me after I give you the best orgasm you've ever had.
Oh, like you know what you're doing down there at all.
I actually don't.
Where's the clitoris?
Is it in your ass?
Just, you know, make sure you kind of whoop it up and act like I'm a stud who knows what he's doing, okay?
Just be a pal.
Oh, dude, I am gonna Meryl Streep the fuck out of this tomorrow, you watch.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
No.
Really, thank you.
For everything.
You're welcome.
Less than 12 hours and we make Monroeville history.
- I really hope nothing goes wrong.
- It's a movie.
What could go wrong?
ZACK:
What are you doing?
DELANEY:
- What's up?
- What the fuck?
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait.
- Wait.
- Stop.
Stop.
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck is going on?
Condos is what's going on, as soon as this shit-hole's demo'd.
No, you gotta stop it right now.
We rented this place for a month from Mr. Jenkins.
Sounds like your Mr. Jenkins was full of shit.
Luxury Homesteads bought this place a month ago.
I'm gonna kill that lying old fuck.
You're gonna have to go Florida, that's where he moved.
We've got thousands of dollars of equipment in there.
- Please.
- If you wanna sift through this rubble when we're done, be my guest.
Hey, get that fucking beam down.
MIRI:
This is the last thing you wanna hear.
If you don't get an advance,
I don't think we're gonna keep a roof over our heads.
I got an advance already.
It went into all the costumes.
- So all our money's gone?
- All your money?
Never mind what my wife's gonna do when there ain't no new snow tires, or when she sees I charged a video camera.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this, man.
DELANEY:
I just wanted to see some free titties.
That's all.
But there's no such thing as free titties, is there, Zack?
- Is there?
- Fuck this noise.
Why don't we get another camera, and shoot something else?
Where are we gonna do that?
Got another sound stage?
Sound stage?
We had a shit-covered garage we turned into a sound stage.
We find someplace new and we do it again.
[ DOOR SQUEAKS ]
How?
Okay, I'm broke, man.
No, make that, I was broke.
Now I am really tapped out.
I have to get another job to pay Delaney back.
So please tell me, how can I afford to start over?
- What can I get you?
- Yeah, can I get a, uh--?
Too fucking late.
Cappuccino, 3.50.
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
I mean, I'm a total loser in every single other aspect of my life.
What made me think I could do something as simple as filming people fucking?
We have no money left, nowhere to shoot, no sets, we have no fucking cameras.
Here.
It's time I go back to my regular life where I am a quiet fuckup who doesn't cost anybody any money and knows his goddamn position behind this fucking counter making cappuccinos for this fucking guy.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
ZACK:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Fuck, yes.
Zack.
[ CHUCKLES ]
You sneaky Indian motherfucker.
I tell you, yes.
Swallow My Cockuccino.
- What?
- That's it.
That's the movie.
Why didn't I think of it before?
We don't need sets or a stage.
Look at all this production value, waiting to have balls on it.
Hold up.
You wanna shoot a dirty movie here, where we work?
Yes.
Fuck, yes, I do.
You know how many stories I have from working here?
How many times I've been laid right there after hours?
You've never gotten laid here after hours.
I know.
Thank you for reminding me.
But I always wish I had, and that's what porno is.
It's fantasy.
It's taking the normal and making it abnormal by fucking it.
Don't do that.
The little dog don't like that.
How did you get a camera?
By being a terrible, untrustworthy employee, that's how.
Give me today, I'll bang out a script.
Meet me back here after closing.
We're gonna launch arching ropes of jism all over this motherfucker.
Peace.
I like that guy but if he tries to fuck that little dog tonight for real,
I'm calling the Humane Society.
It's called Bean-N-Gone, so get the fuck out of here.
Hey, Barry.
ZACK:
- Stand by, Stace, picture's up.
- Okay.
ZACK:
Roll tape.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 12, Take 1.
ZACK:
And action.
I'd like a double espresso so I can stay up all night because I'm in the mood to fuck.
Well, I am a whore-ista, so I love to fuck.
Would you like to fuck me?
Holy fuck.
You mean, after you're done with your shift?
I mean during my shift.
- Sorry.
- Keep going, keep going.
With your shaft.
Let us fuck.
Cue music.
[ FUNK MUSIC PLAYING ]
Okay, open up to camera, guys.
Let us see it.
More tongue.
Little less tongue.
Oh, that was good.
[ CASH REGISTER BEEPING ]
Cue effects.
[ MOANING ]
Oh, yeah, like that.
Oh, yeah.
See, I told you it would work.
Didn't I tell you?
It looks amazing.
It's incredible.
STACEY:
Oh, the beans hurt.
Easy.
- Move in for coverage.
- Nice.
That's why we got him.
- Nice.
I'm impressed.
- Get in there, Deacon.
- Come on.
- Like that?
Like that.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
- Pull out a bit, actually.
STACEY:
- That's hot.
No, not you, Lester.
Put it back in.
Kiss the muscle.
- I kiss the muscle.
- You kiss the muscle.
- Can he slap her ass a little?
- Don't be a fucking pervert, dude.
- Stir, come on.
Stir.
- Yeah, stir it.
Stir it, baby.
Hey.
- Holy.
- Shit.
Are you guys still open?
No.
We close at 9.
I need coffee so I'm drive home.
- Okay.
Yeah.
MAN:
- Thank you.
That's a cute kitty.
Okay.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You guys see the game?
I was at it.
Fucking Roethlisberger, the quarterback, was all fucking,
"Hug it, chug it, football.
All night." Heh-heh.
Okay, pal, here you go.
On the house.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Have a good one.
- Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- I said, have a good one.
Oh.
- Okay.
Keep moving.
MAN:
- You and your little dog.
Go Steelers.
Action.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, like that.
Oh, fuck it, chuck it, football.
Oh, yeah.
BARRY:
Oh, God, this is good.
[ BARRY MOANING ]
You take it.
You take it.
Take it, Barry.
Oh, take it.
Take it, Barry.
Take it.
I'm disturbed at how turned on I am by this.
- Shit, dude, it's almost 6.
- Oh, fuck.
Okay, that's a wrap, everybody, yeah.
Let's give a hand to our hotties with the bodies from last night.
Stacey, Lester, Bubbles, Barry, whoo.
LESTER:
- Yeah.
ZACK:
- Nice.
Okay, when we come back tonight, we finish up the venti-vulva scene, and then we get into me and Miri's stuff.
Again, amazing first night, everybody.
Thank you so much.
Let us fuck.
- Hey, how'd it look?
- How do you think it looked?
It looked like shit going into other shit, in focus.
What an artist.
That was Kurosawa's motto. "Shit going into other shit."
Oh, man, I can't believe you gotta work now.
It's okay.
You know, honestly, I don't think I could sleep.
- I'm pretty, like, pumped up right now.
- Right?
It was amazing.
It was awesome.
I think the cast and crew had a good time.
- We were getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.
I just wanna keep shooting people boning all day.
I don't think I've ever met the ambitious Zack Brown before.
- Well, I'm trying to pay the bills, so...
- It's not a bad thing.
I think it looks good on you.
ZACK:
Come on, hurry.
Come on, come on, come on.
BUBBLES:
Wait a minute.
- You guys never did it before?
MIRI:
- It's fine.
You know, we talked about it and it's just for the movie.
We're friends, you know, we're just friends.
And we will always just be just friends, so...
Listen, I have some extra lube from last night.
I understand it's kind of hard getting wet when everyone's watching.
At least it was for Barry.
- I don't know if I am gonna need it.
- Really?
Yeah, I think I'm just excited.
Uh-huh.
At the idea of people watching, not because of Zack.
Oh, God.
Zack could never have that effect on me in a million years.
- Hello, Miriam.
- Oh, hey.
Wow.
- Your face.
- Yeah.
Weird, huh?
I don't think I've seen your face since senior year.
ZACK:
I think I made a mistake.
I did it for you so you wouldn't get road rash during our scene, but I should have asked first, I look like a fucking beluga whale.
I think I'll be going now.
ZACK:
Okay.
[ CLEARING THROAT ]
All I keep thinking is we should've done a trial run at home last week or something.
- Oh, my God.
Right?
- I know.
[ LAUGHING ]
- You're still cool to do it, though, right?
- Yeah, um.
Totally.
Are you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I'm, uh...
- Honestly, I'm a little nervous, I guess.
- You are?
- It's kind of a big deal.
- It is?
Yeah, you know, it's our first time together since our auspicious debut on viral video.
Oh, yeah.
That's a fuckload of pressure for a director.
As a director, please.
What about the anxiety I'm feeling as an actress?
- Did I pick the right project?
- Yeah.
What about this follow-up?
Julia Roberts followed Pretty Woman with Sleeping With the Enemy.
I'm following Granny Panties with Swallow My Cockuccino.
Only difference is this movie's about cock-sucking and her movie just sucked cock, period.
- The only difference, yeah.
- The end was pretty rad.
I liked that.
- When she kills him.
- with a gun.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- She calls the cops first.
- She calls it in first.
- It was so awesome.
- Awesome, yeah.
So I guess we should do this.
I think we should probably wait just until I lose another 20 or 30 pounds.
Stop it.
You look good.
Thanks.
So, what about me?
How do I look?
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful, so I guess it's not a big deal, but you look amazing.
- Okay.
Let's go make a porno.
- Okay.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 8, Take 1.
DEACON:
- Come here.
- I'm over--?
All right, settle.
Action.
[ KNOCKING ON DOOR ]
Who could it be?
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm a delivery man and I have some cream for you.
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.
I work out.
So do you want me to give you your cream now?
I've been waiting for it all day.
- Fuck.
Come on.
- Oops.
[ WHISPERS ] Keep going.
I spilled my cream.
Do you mind?
I don't mind.
Especially if you spill it on my face.
Let us fuck.
[ ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ]
- Fix my shirt.
Think I should?
- Okay.
Let me see them titties.
Actually, you know what?
Sorry, I don't think we should show them.
- What?
- We shouldn't show your breasts.
- Aren't you gonna take your shirt off?
- I'm just gonna open it.
You're not gonna take it off?
Why not?
My tits are bigger than yours.
I don't wanna show that.
She's not gonna show her tits?
I showed my cock and my asshole.
- Okay, I'll do your pants.
- Back and forth. okay.
- Holy shit.
- Where's that delivery?
I can't believe this.
I was delivering cream, and look what's happening.
- Jesus, what is that, a rumba?
- What's a rumba?
That awkward movement.
- Should I take your underpants off?
- Yeah, take them off.
ZACK:
What the fuck?
How does this work?
They're just like-
- I'll do it.
- I'll do mine, you just-
- You do yours.
- I'll do my pants.
Granny panties.
Just get on with it already.
I'm gonna fuck you with my pecker.
Dude, that's really dirty.
- That's too dirty?
- That offends me.
- Penis?
- Fine.
- I'm gonna fuck you with my penis.
- I can't wait.
For my penis.
Be careful, Miri.
Okay, there we go.
Just keep rolling, keep rolling.
- I'll walk forward.
- Fucking cream is coming.
This is the worst porno I've ever seen.
MIRI:
- Get over here, delivery man.
ZACK:
- Let's fuck on these beans.
[ GRUNTING ]
- You okay?
- Yup.
ZACK:
- Okay, all right.
- Just leave them.
Just leave them.
- They're really distracting.
- You should leave them.
- You gotta get your-
- There you go.
ZACK:
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.
This okay?
Okay.
Okay, uh.
- We'll start kissing on three, okay?
- Okay.
One, two, three.
Go.
MIRI:
I'm ready.
- I'm ready.
- Okay.
Deacon.
- Deacon.
Deacon.
- What?
Did you see Lost this week, man?
I missed it.
What happened?
They're on the island, off the island.
Who can follow that?
I think they're in hell.
Would you all shut the motherfuck up?
[ MOANING ]
I want you to come.
- I want you to come with me.
- Okay.
Oh, God.
ZACK:
Oh, God.
Cut.
That's it?
It's over?
Ain't he supposed to come on her titties?
Well, it wasn't what we'd shot-listed, but that was nice.
- It was so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack.
Thanks, Lester, uh.
It wasn't just me, though, guys.
Give it up for my radiant costar here, Miri.
[ CHEERING ]
LESTER:
- Nice.
- Um, show's over in here.
Let's move out, start lighting the next scene.
- All right.
LESTER:
- Let's do it.
BUBBLES:
- You looked so beautiful.
- Thanks.
DELANEY:
I thought they were gonna be fucking hard.
- It was pretty.
DELANEY:
- Pretty don't sell.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
You good, Mir?
You need anything?
I'm just gonna take a minute, okay?
Okay, uh.
I'll just be out there.
Yeah.
- That was fun.
- Yeah, fun.
ZACK [ WHISPERS ] :
"Fun." You fucking douche.
[ SIGHS ]
Wow.
- Hey.
ZACK:
- Hey.
- You working on a rewrite?
- Yeah, just for tonight's scene.
- I'm ready to go when you are, though.
- Okay.
You know, before we go, I...
I'm thinking that, uh, it's a good idea if we talk about what happened last night.
- Oh.
- I mean, we don't have to, but I think--
Okay, yeah, uh.
I kind of dropped the ball on that, I guess, huh?
- No, no.
It's...
- To be honest, it was...
You know, I didn't realize how weird it would be for me.
Weird?
Like-
- Weird how?
Acting and directing at the same time.
It's a lot to process, you know.
For the first time, I thought my balls didn't have enough hair on them.
That's not what I meant.
I know what you meant.
How you feeling about it?
I guess, um...
I feel like...
Like we...
- Holy fuck.
- The power's on.
Did you do this?
ZACK:
How did this happen?
I burned the bills.
How could we have done that?
- The water.
- The water.
MIRI:
Come on, come on, come on.
Yeah!
- We can shower in our home again.
- We are liquid.
[ KNOCKING ON DOOR ]
Greetings.
Have you heard the good news about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?
Oh, my God, did you guys do this?
We got tired of you taking showers at our places all the time.
So we took up a collection amongst ourselves.
And chipped away at your mountain of debt.
You guys paid off our massive utilities bills?
- How did you afford that?
- I stole my old lady's bingo winnings.
And Mistress Bubbles did a bachelor party tonight at which yours truly was a guest star, thank you very much.
- Oh.
- Whoa.
Don't get too excited.
We didn't pay off your whole bill.
Just a month of each.
They agreed to turn everything back on?
At 9 at night?
How does that work?
Stacey knows somebody that works at Power and Light.
- You guys...
- This is amazing.
You didn't have to do this.
You didn't have to put us in your movie.
- Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.
- Or put us in your movie either.
- We said that already.
Guys, honestly, I don't know what to say.
You can start by saying we can take tonight off so we can have our wrap party right now.
Guys, we're not wrapped.
We still have four days of shooting left.
Excuse me.
In my "producorial" capacity,
I'm shutting the movie down for a night so we can get a little silly.
[ DMX'S "PARTY UP (UP IN HERE)" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ]
[ THE PIXIES' "HEY" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ]
[ COIN CLINKING AND PEOPLE CHATTERING ]
Go, go, go.
- Yes.
- Yes.
[ LAUGHING ]
You all drink.
Was it just amazing with him, after all those years of not knowing?
It was, um, weird.
- But good.
- My scene with Zack's tomorrow.
You don't say.
But I'm a little nervous.
I was thinking about trying to get with him tonight.
- Really?
- I mean, if you don't mind.
You are just friends and all, so I didn't think it would be a biggie.
- It wouldn't be a biggie, would it?
- No.
No, no.
It's not a biggie.
What?
No.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Stacey, I'm not married to the guy, so...
I don't know.
You guys just looked kind of intimate last night.
- We did?
- Yeah.
Well, we're just better actors than I thought, I think, so you know what?
If you wanna get with him, you should just go ask him.
- He'd be really excited to hear that.
- Yeah?
For real, you don't mind?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
DEACON:
All the quarters are on the ground.
ZACK:
- Hey, Stace.
- Hey, Zack.
[ WHISPERING ]
DEACON:
Come on, are you guys playing or what?
[ INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE ]
Well, I'm bummed, but I totally get it.
It's no problem to work with Lester again.
He has a nice cock.
Well, you're a trouper, Stace.
Oh, but if I start making weird faces or anything during the scene, it's just because I've been constipated all day.
Oh, shit, uh.
We don't have to shoot the scene tonight.
No, I want to.
Anal's great for when you're constipated.
It totally loosens you up.
I use ex-lax, but good to know.
Okay, I never thought I would have that conversation.
So are we starting with Lester and Stacey tonight?
We were supposed to start with Lester and Miri.
I know.
She-
- We're not gonna do that.
I don't think Miri's gonna...
[ KNOCKING ON DOOR ]
...do that.
Hey.
So where are we shooting this?
Over here?
- What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.
Our scene's tonight, right?
Can I talk to you for a minute in the back?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
What do you want me to shoot here?
Start with the close-ups of Lester and Stacey.
Give me a second, man.
What an artist.
Okay, uh.
Did I do something wrong to you?
No.
Then why are you here?
I'm here for the same reason you're here.
To make the movie.
Okay, just, like, for your own personal information, you're acting really weird right now.
I'm acting weird?
I think you're acting weird right now.
Oh, I'm acting-- How exactly am I acting weird?
You've been trying to keep me from fucking anybody but you since we started this thing.
Maybe I was thinking about your feelings.
Were you thinking of my feelings when you were banging Stacey?
Because that'd be really sad for Stacey.
She told me that you told her that that was okay.
I told her that it was okay to ask you.
Holy shit.
I get it.
I fucking get it.
It was a test.
That whole thing was a fucking test, is that it?
If it was, how do you think you did?
We had a discussion, Miri.
We had-
- Actually, we had many discussions about how it was just sex
- and how we wouldn't let it get weird.
- I'm not acting weird.
You're acting like a jealous girlfriend is what the fuck you're acting like.
- I am not your girlfriend.
- I know that.
You're not my boyfriend, so why are we having this conversation right now?
Because you're about to fuck Lester to spite me, it seems like.
Did you fuck Stacey to spite me?
No.
You fucked her like you fucked every other bitch and never gave a shit how I felt about it.
- Well, that was before.
- Before what?
Look, don't fucking pretend that the other night, you and me, right there, that that didn't mean anything to you, that you didn't feel it too.
Oh.
You're not getting all gooey on me here, are you, Zack?
You know what?
If you were any other bitch I didn't give a rat's ass about,
I would tell you to go fuck yourself right now because I fucking hate this game-playing shit.
But you, you mean more to me than that, so I'm just gonna lay this out on front street.
I know you felt something big, something real the other night when we were together because I felt it too.
We tried to fuck and instead, we wound up making love.
So if this is what you need to hear in order to keep you from fucking Lester, if this is what you need, then fine.
Here it is, I'm gonna say it.
I love you, Miri.
Happy?
Oh, Jesus.
You better get ahold of yourself, Zack, because we just fucked.
Okay.
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?
But you did.
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.
[ WHISPERS ] Wait--
All right, don't forget I'm down here.
Watch that pullout, huh?
STACEY:
Yeah.
Mmm.
This is some damn good coffee.
- Where you going?
- Getting the fuck out of here.
We gotta finish this movie.
[ GASPS ]
Yo!
[ COUGHING AND GROANING ]
You believe this shit?
Do you believe this shit?
What the fuck just happened in there?
I'll tell you what just happened in there.
That chick frosted me like I was a fucking cake.
Zack.
TEEN 1 :
Okay, seriously, get a picture of me right now.
I'm hunting humans.
- Dude, check it out.
Ooh.
- Oh, shit.
Seriously, let's shoot the shit out of this bitch.
- Where you aiming at?
- Cock shots?
Cock shots.
[ BUZZER RINGS ]
[ BUZZER RINGS ]
We shot you in the balls, cunt nugget.
Well, it's my job to get shot in the balls, so-
- Oh, they're gone.
MAN:
Excuse me.
Didn't you used to work at the Bean-N-Gone in Monroeville?
I sure as shit hope this pays better, I tell you.
[ CHATTERING ]
So why don't they just shoot you with a puck?
What do you mean?
I mean, what does paintball got to do with hockey?
Nothing, I guess.
- So ain't no prizes or--?
- No, no.
So, what are they paying $5 for?
To shoot a Broad Street Bully in the balls.
White people are fucked up.
Yup, they sure are.
It's a living.
You've been getting the checks I've been sending?
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Probably didn't save you from a brutal tongue-lashing, though, huh?
You know, the wife never found out about the camera, because I paid off the bills.
How did you manage that?
- Because now I'm Oprah rich.
- No way.
- The post office fucking settled?
- Hundred-sixty large, son.
- Nice, man.
Congratulations.
- A beautiful day, thank you very much.
I thought you made that whole thing up.
No, no.
It was very real.
You can believe it.
Even though she's spending all of it.
Well, since you ain't gonna ask me, I'll just go ahead and tell you.
- No, I have not seen Miri.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.
Oh, I suppose you weren't gonna ask about your movie, neither?
Look, that's why I came down here.
I need you to come take a look at it.
- I'm not interested.
Sorry.
- You'd better get interested
- because you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?
The story doesn't make sense.
- The story?
- The story doesn't make sense.
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?
It's a movie, dog, and a movie's gotta have an ending, which we don't have at the moment.
Come shot, credits.
There's your fucking ending.
Do me this favor, okay?
When you're done getting your nuts blown off, come back to humble Monroeville to my crib for a couple hours, check out the flick, you tell me what's missing.
No.
I'll tell you what, you do that, you don't owe me shit no more.
- Really?
- Really.
- Is your wife home?
- Yes.
- Maybe I should leave the pads on.
- You got some extra ones?
Hey, honey.
Where the fuck you been?
And who in the fuck is this now?
Would you calm down, woman?
Goddamn.
You already left one white boy down in my basement while you off gallivanting and shit.
What if this motherfucker
- was all grabby on me?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
Oh, what in the fuck is that supposed to mean?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
WIFE:
- White boys love me.
White boy.
- I said, white boy.
- Yeah?
You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?
- Should I say yes?
- Just say yes.
Yeah.
- Why don't you, uh, head downstairs?
- Oh, okay.
It's just through this hallway.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
What the fuck you looking at?
Why you gotta be yelling at me in front of my director?
- Oh, he's a director?
- Yeah.
I didn't know that.
Shit, he's a director.
Well, why don't he direct my ass to a new husband?
How about that shit?
- That's the bedroom.
DELANEY:
- Keep talking, maybe he will.
Oh, don't nobody want them saggy-ass balls!
Saggy balls?
Look at these sagging-ass titties you got around here.
- You could tie these together.
- Motherfucker, we match.
Oh, shit.
Where's my paintball gun at?
Look at you, editor and DP.
You got your shit covered, man.
Please, don't ever say "shit-covered" to me again.
Roll the film for the man, please, so we can see what he thinks.
Just jump through it.
I ain't got all night.
The bitch is on me.
"Nigga Rich Productions." Classy.
- Yeah, DreamWorks was taken.
- Was it?
Plus, it sounds like an underground gay fuck club.
"I met a guy at DreamWorks." Yeah.
All right, so we got Lester and Stacey fucking.
Then we got Barry and Bubbles fucking.
And then this boring bullshit.
Okay, just, uh, go to the next scene, would you?
Uh...
- What next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?
We never shot it.
- Why not?
- Because after you left that night,
Miri came out of the backroom and said she couldn't do it.
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped?
So...
- Wait, so Miri--
- Never fucked nobody.
Just you.
Now, I wonder why she did that.
- Hm.
- Hm.
You see, there was a time when I was just a bitter old fuck making coffees, and Stacey was just a lap dancer and Barry and Bubbles didn't know each other and this fool here, hell, I don't even know what he was.
- A white supremacist.
- Man, fuck you.
Then two people come along and showed us something we didn't know existed.
A world of possibilities where plain old people just like us could do something special.
Even if it's something as simple as filming people fucking.
Sometimes we just need someone to show us something we can't see for ourselves
and then we're changed forever.
So as you can see, our movie ain't got no ending.
Every movie needs an ending, don't it?
Peace.
Delaney, you're a slick cupid motherfucker.
Ain't love grand?
WIFE:
Why the fuck is this white boy running through my goddamn house?
[ DOOR SLAMS ]
Sometimes.
Miri.
- Miri.
MIRI:
- Zack?
ZACK:
- Miri.
I'm sorry.
MIRI:
- Get out.
- Close the door.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over--
- Just close the fucking door, Zack.
I never slept with Stacey that night, okay?
I swear to God.
When we got into my room, you know what we did?
We talked about you, and us and how things were different and how I was too much of a fucking pussy to just tell you how I felt about you.
And I know-
- I know that that's only because of all the stupid shit we said about how we wouldn't let sex change us, but it did.
It changed me.
That has to be love, right?
It has to be love and just so you know, I can't go back to being just friends anymore,
- because I just can't.
- Good.
And I think--
I think that you feel the same way.
Because that night after I left, you didn't fuck Lester.
What's up, Zack?
You know what?
I don't care that you're fucking Lester, okay?
How's that?
- Oh, shit.
- I don't wanna be with anyone but you.
So I will wait forever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life because I love you, and I have for as long as I can remember.
And I would rather die than be without you, Miriam Linky.
Miri's last name is Linky?
You're gonna fuck a guy who doesn't know your last name?
Or that you beat up Carl Roth in the sixth grade?
I know that.
Or what your senior prom dress would've looked like had we gone but we decided not to, and we got drunk alone instead.
Or that you washed your hair in the toilet.
We're not fucking, Zack.
Or that you're not fucking Zack-- What?
I asked her to fuck me.
She wouldn't do it.
I even tried to talk her into giving me the fucking Dutch rudder.
Shot me down on that too.
- And a Dutch rudder is?
- Don't know what a Dutch rudder--?
All right, you grab your dick, then you have someone else work your arm.
Here, let me show you.
All right, grab my arm.
I'm grabbing my dick, you're grabbing my arm.
Now work it.
Work my arm.
See that shit?
Work it up and down.
It's like someone else is jerking you off.
Okay.
There's the double Dutch rudder, which, I grab my dick, you grab your dick, you work my arm, I work your arm, same time.
It's like jerking off together but not gay.
We're not touching dicks, each other's dicks anyway.
I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.
It feels good, sir.
Try me, come on.
Sorry to change the subject on you, Lester, but if you're not fucking Miri, why is your dick out right now?
Because I live here now, and I like to be naked.
- What?
- When you moved out, she couldn't afford to pay her rent by herself, so I moved in to help.
But you just came out of her room.
That's my room now.
She moved in your old room.
Wait, wait, wait.
She changed rooms?
Yeah, she said she did it because she missed the smell of you or some shit.
[ SNIFFS ]
I don't smell anything.
But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.
- Night, Zack.
- Night.
Do you?
Then why are you crying?
Because I missed you so much.
ZACK:
Me too.
I love you.
- I love you, I love you.
ZACK:
- I love you.
I don't mean to alarm you but I think I just jerked off Lester a little bit.
- The Dutch rudder?
- Yeah, it's ingenious, right?
If you ask me nicely, I will Dutch-rudder you the rest of our lives.
Good.
I'm getting tired of fucking the Fleshlight.
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.
- What'd it feel like?
- Like fucking a flashlight.
LESTER:
- Wrong room.
- Oh, God.
That's gross.
Let us fuck.
You little motherfucker!
Get up, Zack.
Come on, I don't wanna be late for work.
- Ahh!
Get out!
- Jesus, fuck!
Close the door if you're gonna take a shit.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over, it was not closed.
- Close the door, Zack!
- Okay, okay.
- God.
- Fine.
- What's that thing?
- It's a hand warmer.
We're going now.
- You smell that?
Is that the car?
Fuck.
- Oh, goddamn it.
- What?
What?
- Oh, it's wedged in my taint.
- What is?
- It got wedged in my taint.
- What?
- It's stuck under my balls.
- It's between my balls and my leg.
- What's happening?
- Please, pull over.
Pull the fuck over!
- Okay, all right!
Jesus, okay.
- It's about to move up to my ass.
- What?
The movement makes it hotter.
It's tucked under them.
It's stuck under them.
Oh, fuck.
I think I burned my ball hair off.
It's not funny.
Can you help me pick out an outfit for tonight?
I'm working till 6.
- Well, I can try stuff on at the store.
- The store?
No, how about instead, you get a friend?
But you are my friend.
I mean a girl friend, jeez.
Mr. Delaney, can you work for me tomorrow?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
Then you must come in the next day, I tell you.
- It's Black Friday.
- Black Friday?
It's the biggest mall-shopping day of the year.
And since the mall is just up the street, I would like you to come out and work.
- On Black Friday.
- Oh, yeah.
All right, you want me to work on Moolie Monday too?
- I'm sorry?
- How about Nigga Tuesday?
- Nigga Tuesday?
This a new holiday?
- You come to a brother and tell him he gotta work on Black Friday.
You got any idea how racist that sounds?
Telling me to work.
What, you think you own me?
- I never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?
You thought,
"I'm gonna lay down the law for this nigga, I put food on his table, clothes on his nigga baby backs, and he ain't gonna say shit."
- This ain't Amistad.
- You shut up.
You goddamn right this ain't Amistad.
I can't wait till the post office settles my disability suit because then I'm gonna be out this motherfucker.
I'm gonna be Oprah rich.
Y'all can kiss my ass.
You know what?
Fuck you.
Fuck you, and suck cock.
- To hell with you.
- To hell with you.
- Zachary will work.
Zack, my boy.
- Yeah.
- The customer with the harelip--
- Oh, yeah.
--speak me, say you were playing baseball here the other night.
Wiffle ball.
And, uh, no, that wasn't me.
Maybe the harelip makes it sound like "baseball."
Yeah, maybe you hear with an accent.
- Fuck you, okay?
- Okay.
One day, I'm gonna put a camera over there, and then I can tell--
I'll know everything you do when I'm gone.
Everything.
Scratch your balls, take a shit, everything, I tell you, okay?
Okay.
Fucker.
I hate both of you ebony and ivory motherfuckers, I tell you.
- Why is he so fucking high-strung?
- "Fuck off, I tell you.
Very good."
Can you believe that Gandhi motherfucker, telling me I gotta work on Black Friday?
Ain't that some shit?
- Yeah.
- Like I don't wanna do shopping.
Biggest sales day of the year.
I'm getting a flat-screen TV, believe that.
That's my fault, I should tell you.
I asked for Friday morning off, I'm sorry.
- For what?
- I actually need a lot of recovery time.
Tonight is me and Miri's ten-year high school reunion.
I'm just gonna get fucking alcohol poisoning.
- Reunion?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
- Isn't that fucked up that they do that?
They say it's the best chance to get everyone together.
People come back in town for the holidays.
But they could have it in the middle of the summer at a blowjob contest that I was judging, and it would still be retarded.
- So why you going, then?
- Miri's making me go.
Why you always bending over backwards for that girl,
- knowing she ain't giving up no ass?
- We got a good thing going.
She pays half the rent, does dishes, she wakes me up in the morning.
Why complicate that with sex?
Besides, man, I've known her since the first grade.
You don't fuck someone you met in the first grade.
Excuse me, I met my wife in kindergarten.
We got married senior year, and she has been the queen of my world ever since.
- What if you could do it all over again?
- I'd jerk off and live by myself.
That woman is the bane of my existence.
- See?
- Excuse me, can I get a coffee, black?
Can't you see we talking, white?
If you're gonna continue to emasculate me with this Barbie dress-up shit,
I'm using your laptop.
Don't forget to smack it when you turn it on, otherwise the screen doesn't come on.
Why don't you spring and get a new one?
Same reason I don't spring for clothes for tonight, I'm broke.
There's a chick who works at Teen Juice at the mall, you know.
I gave her a good deal on yarn,
- so she's letting me borrow this stuff.
- Yo, bro.
- What?
- You're buying a vibrator online.
- What's wrong with the one you have?
- It died last week.
Look at the size of those fucking panties.
Shoot that shit.
Shoot it.
My God, who even knew Amazon sold shit like this?
This is incredible.
- Those are fucking granny panties.
- Okay,
A, I don't appreciate you violating the sanctity of my Amazon Wish List page, and B, I'm not buying that thing from Amazon, because it turns out I don't have a credit card they take.
- Oh, shit.
- I'm sorry, guys.
Am I in the way?
You're a fucking faggot, all right?
Let's go to Starbucks.
- He's a shitty barista anyways.
- Cock.
- And he throws like a bitch.
- You know what else I throw?
My nut sack in your coffees, so how did that taste, fucker?
We saw your girlfriend in her underwear, cunt nugget.
Well, too bad she's not my girlfriend, you little fuck-
- Oh, they're gone.
Are you still talking to me?
Uh, just said, I'm gonna look up more fuck toys on Amazon.
Oh, holy shit.
- They sell the Fleshlight here too.
- What's that?
It's a fucking pocket pussy that is shaped like a flashlight
"for discretionary jacking off."
That way if you get caught, no one thinks it's weird.
You're just a guy who likes to fuck his flashlight.
I am totally buying this shit.
Whoa, if you've got money to burn, how about paying the electric bill?
- That's due already?
- November's is probably due now, but I was talking about September's.
Tell me this doesn't rock.
You kind of look like Ronald McDonald.
That makes me want some McNuggets.
Why would you wanna buy a pocket pussy anyway?
That is so sad.
What?
Excuse me, I forgot about the nobility that accompanies coming with a fucking vibrator.
Think a kid in Darfur gets saved every time a vibrator makes you come?
No.
- "Real feel action"?
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
If you start fucking machines, I'm moving out.
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a machine.
How come you get to fuck something with a motor in it?
I've never met a man who can make me come like a vibrator does.
That's bullshit.
You get to be Buck Rogers having sex in the 25th century with fucking Twiki and Dr. Theopolis.
I'm stuck to a bottle of Jergens in the bathroom.
Holy bejesus.
You do not use my Jergens to jack it in our bathroom.
No, you know what I do actually, is I light a bunch of candles and I sprawl out on my sheets and I listen to Sting.
No, I'm a guy.
Give me two Popsicle sticks and a rubber band,
I'll find a way to fuck it, like a filthy MacGyver.
Oh, my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.
How about this?
I don't get why you're putting so much effort into this thing.
I thought we were just gonna go to sit around and make fun of everybody.
I can't wear anything that I already own and expect to bring home Bobby Long.
Bobby fucking Long?
No way.
Didn't that guy call you "Stinky Linky"?
Yeah, that was then, okay?
Maybe now he can save me a fortune in Amazon bills.
Maybe you can fuck our landlord so we can at least keep a roof over our heads.
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.
Hey, I bought skates with last week's paycheck
- and I need those to skate with.
- Oh.
And this week's will barely cover the past two water bills, so...
Is this sexy?
Yeah, in like a To Catch a Predator kind of way, it is pretty fucking sexy.
Then we're done.
What the fuck?
Zack.
- You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?
- They shut it off.
- Oh, shit.
Just, uh--
Help me get this shit out of my hair.
Just use the water out of the toilet.
- There's poo in there.
- Not that part.
- The back part of the toilet thing.
- Oh, that makes sense.
Take the cup there and then scoop it in, there you go.
Here, I'll lean back and you can just, you know, pour it down like-
- Like that.
You're harshing my buzz, you know.
This is so lame.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Whoa!
All right, one hour tops, then we're gone.
Or I had an idea.
We could just not go at all, which would rock.
Even though we're broke and we've never amounted to anything, we're still better than these people, right?
No.
Not at all.
We're probably not even as good as most of them, unless one of them is a crackhead or something.
Just tell me I'm prettier than when we graduated.
You look about the same.
Definitely not prettier, but around the same.
I'm thinner, though, right?
A little?
Not really.
Well, good pep talk.
Fuck.
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.
- You don't recognize us, do you?
- Um, no, sorry.
Zack Brown, Miri Linky.
Were you the one they called Stinky Linky?
Oh, no, no one ever called me that.
Oh.
- Great.
What does yours say?
- What the fuck?
Come on.
- I'm sure I had a nickname.
Nothing?
- All right, you have a great time, and before you go, don't forget your copy of The Roving Roe-Ver.
What the fuck's this shit?
That is not shit, that would be our bi-monthly newsletter.
- Awesome.
- It updates you
- on what everyone's doing.
- Finally.
I love your enthusiasm.
Here you go.
Write your e-mail address on that and I'll be sure to add you to our 800-member-strong mailing list.
We had 800 people in our graduating class?
Yes, and only 250 R.S.V.P.'d.
Doesn't that suck, Mary?
- Miri.
- You married, Bets?
- I am.
Two kids.
- Wow, that's beautiful.
- Awesome.
- You wanna fuck me later?
- Uh, no, I'm married.
- Okay, cool.
If you change your mind,
- I'll be in there getting shitfaced.
- He will.
- Just so you know, I eat the pussy.
- He does.
Ah, tempting.
Again, no.
- Shall we?
- Sir.
Bye, Bets.
Think about it.
¶ "LET ME CLEAR MY THROAT" by DJ KOOL ¶
Enjoy.
Can I get two beers, please?
You want a beer?
- Yeah.
- Three beers.
- Thank you.
- Here you go.
Is that Zack?
Or am I Zack?
Whoa, ho, ho.
Oh, wow.
- Never gets old, huh?
- The other Zack.
Oh, in my world, nobody calls me "the other Zack,"
now that this guy's not around anymore, huh?
- Get the fuck off of me.
- There can be only one.
- What?
- Highlander, man?
The Kurgan.
Remember?
I'd yell it at you whenever we passed each other in the hallway?
Like it was yesterday, man.
Awesome.
Awesome.
Awesome.
God, you guys have so much to catch up on.
Whoo.
- No.
- I'm gonna let you get to it.
- Bitch.
- Bitch.
¶ "SEX AND CANDY" by MARCY PLAYGROUND ¶
Have you seen that big blowup picture they have of me?
Yeah, it's--
My hair is terrible.
I can't believe I even wore my hair like that.
That's before I knew about styling products, you know.
It makes a big difference in life.
But you live and learn, though, right?
I mean, ten years ago, Pittsburgh, who knew anything about fashion?
Back in the day, our hairstyle, oh...
Hey, stranger.
- Whoa.
Stinky Linky.
- Yeah.
Although it's just Miri now.
- Give me a hug.
- Oh, okay.
- Hi, heh, heh, heh.
- Hi.
Wow.
- How have you been?
- Great, great.
- Yeah?
- You look fantastic.
Wow, that is not something that you would have said to me ten years ago.
- Well, I've grown up.
- Yes.
Yes, you have.
You just look...
Ooh, heh, heh.
- Well, listen to you.
Thank you.
- No, don't thank me, just fuck me.
¶ "STEAL MY SUNSHINE" by LEN ¶
Roxanne.
Hey.
Someone I like, what are the odds, huh?
Zack Brown, we had four years of Spanish together.
Why does no one recognize me?
- Am I thinner?
Is that it?
- Look at him.
- Who?
- My stupid husband.
No fucking shit.
John Butterfield?
You actually married John Butterfield?
- That's amazing.
- Don't ever get married.
It sucks.
You stop appreciating each other and run out of shit to talk about after the first year.
But look at him now, chatty as fuck.
Flirting up a storm with that cheerleader nimrod Monica Von.
You want me to maybe flirt with you so he can see it, even it up a bit?
I don't wanna get even.
If I was gonna do anything, I'd wanna one-up the asshole.
You can give me a handjob in the girls' locker room.
- Fine, but make it fast.
- Fuck, yeah.
Are you staying in town for a while or--?
Just tonight.
I fly back to L.A. tomorrow.
L.A., wow, Los Angeles.
Gosh, Bobby Long, coming up in the world.
- With Mrs. Long, I bet, huh?
- No, no, no.
No Mrs. Long for me.
- Then can I be honest with you?
- Sure.
Um...
Whew.
I think I need a drink.
Do you need a drink?
Because I need a drink to say this.
- I've got a beer already, so--
- Oh, great, thank you.
I think there's a cigarette butt in there.
Yup.
Sorry about the elbow.
¶ "SMALLTOWN BOY" by BRONSKI BEAT ¶
There can be only one.
Can I get a beer, please?
Thank you very much.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
My friend's making an ass of herself hitting on her high school crush.
Oh, God, that's so sad.
It's so Miri, is what it is.
I'm Zack, by the way.
Brandon.
Don't worry, we weren't in the same class or anything.
- Okay.
Lucky you.
- Are you a Monroe-ver?
Well, I went here, let's just leave it at that, I guess.
Do you have one of the large blown-up pictures of your younger self
- hanging around here?
- I do, kind of.
Right there.
- Gorgeous.
- Good times.
What do you do?
What brings you here?
I came with somebody who went to school here.
- Really?
- Bobby Long.
No shit.
That's who my friend's hitting on right now.
See right there?
- Really.
- One dressed like Hannah Montana?
In L.A., we call that look "Nickelodeon chic."
- Wait, L.A.?
Los Angeles?
- California.
That's awesome, man.
What do you do out there?
- I'm an actor.
- Wow, that's really impressive.
- Thank you, thank you.
- In fucking movies?
"Fucking movies." Pretty much.
Look at you.
What--?
Anything I've seen?
What movies?
Oh, all sorts of movies with all-male casts.
All-male casts.
Like Glengarry Glen Ross?
Like that?
Like Glen and Gary Suck Ross' Meaty Cock and Drop Their Hairy Nuts in His Eager Mouth.
- Is that like a sequel?
- Sort of.
- It's a re-imagining.
- Oh, like The Wiz.
More erotic and with less women.
No women, to be exact.
I apologize in advance if I am out of line here, but are you in gay porn?
- Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?
- I thought you recognized me, that's--
- Oh, okay, I get it.
You're not in my demographic, so I'm not insulted.
- Not really.
Who's your demographic?
- Do you love pussy?
- I do.
- Then not you.
Oh, okay.
I came here tonight hoping to seduce you and bring you back to my apartment and sleep with you to, uh, get back at you, you know, for calling me Stinky Linky all those years ago.
Wow.
That is a weird revenge plot.
- You must be a terrible lay for that.
- What?
No, I'm great.
I mean, I've had enough practice and everything.
That--
Wow, that sounded not good.
I fuck a lot.
That's what I meant to say.
That doesn't sound good either.
Wow.
You're a lot funnier than I remember.
Thank you.
Gosh, you turned out to be such a nice guy.
It just-
- You know, it makes it even easier to just-
- To just say this.
Would you like to come back to my place and maybe open a bottle of wine and have ourselves a real high school reunion?
- I--
- Hello, Miriam.
Beat it, we're talking.
- I wanted to introduce you to Brandon.
- Salutations.
- Bobby's boyfriend.
- Bobby who?
- Bobby me.
- Bobby Long.
Brandon is the star of such adult fare as-
- What was that one called again?
You Better Shut Your Mouth or I'm Gonna Fuck It.
That's right.
I'm surprised I forgot that.
Are you fucking with me?
No, they're fucking with each other.
Oh, my God.
- No.
- What?
Granny Panties?
- Excuse me?
- How can you tell?
This is so crazy.
I was literally just watching you, like, right before we got here.
This is so crazy.
This is you, right?
My name's Granny Panties, and nobody wants to fuck me.
Nothing's whiter than my big gay ass--
Where'd you get that?
Oh, I entered "gay" and "ass," and it was the top hit.
It's had 200,000 views in three hours.
Honey, you are, like--
I'm jealous right now because you're, like, super famous.
Baby, please take our picture.
I get a picture with Granny Panties.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is awesome.
- All right, smile.
Okay, got it.
- Did you get it?
- Oh, thank you very much.
- E-mail me that.
Oh, because he's the worst photographer.
Okay, good.
- You're gay?
- Yeah.
And I'm on the Internet wearing a diaper?
Who knew you'd come to Pittsburgh and meet a celebrity?
I'm gonna binge-drink now until I pass out.
Okay.
She'll be fine.
So you guys suck each other's cocks, huh?
Oh, like crazy.
Okay, that's enough, I think.
I'm embarrassing him.
I love when he's embarrassed.
He's not living out loud, so he gets all like, ooh.
- You are totally in love, aren't you?
- Zachary, we are.
Wow, I--
Oh, God, I just wanna eat him up, yum, yum.
Save some for me, yum, yum, yum.
- I can't keep my hands off him.
- You've had one too many.
Although he does most of the eating in the sack.
In the sack and of the sack.
All right, that's enough.
Look, you've drunk too much.
You do this every time.
You get too Mary for everybody in the room
- and you can't contain yourself.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
And by containing myself, do you mean containing myself in a closet?
In a closet of denial?
Is that--?
No, no, no.
Holy shit, this just got real.
This is exactly why you haven't met my mother.
You don't know how to ease people into this situation.
- You just force your way in every time.
- I thought, maybe for one second in this godforsaken town, I could be myself.
I'm so sorry.
No, you're right, I should just butch up and pretend that I don't love it when you shove your dick in my mouth.
- This is the best night of my life.
- Am I making a spectacle?
- I could make a much bigger scene.
- You really are.
I'm sorry.
Pittsburgh.
Listen up, Monroe-vers.
My name is Brandon St. Randy, and I love Bobby Long.
- Fucking A.
- Is that enough?
Is that enough of a scene?
I could start doing worse than that.
The reason you haven't taken me to your mother's--
Your mother with her makeup and all her drinking, she's in the closet too.
- They fight just like real people.
- I thought I'd be a conduit for you--
Thank you.
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm not.
- Thank you.
- I love you.
- I'll e-mail you.
- Zack, it was so nice to meet you.
And I will be patient with you.
I will be there on your journey.
I will be your Sherpa up the mountain of gayness.
Well, might as well see how many hits Granny Panties is up to, huh?
Did I do that?
Thanks, George.
What kind of evil fucks turn off your power the day--?
No, the night before Thanksgiving?
Who does that?
Can you get an advance on your card?
Fleshlight maxed-out my $200 limit.
Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.
This is bad.
If we don't come up with rent, we're gonna get locked out.
Who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.
Which means by the time we get home, there's no heat either.
Well, I think it's time we put what we always talked about into effect.
- You're gonna have to start hooking.
- You know, you jest, but these are the exact circumstances people find themselves in right before they start having sex for money.
- Yeah.
- Or making porn.
- Oh, my God, yeah.
- What?
You got an idea?
We could make a porno.
- Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?
No, that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me?
That's a rad idea.
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend, he said he makes a hundred grand a year because he shoots and distributes his own porno flicks.
If it's so easy, how come everybody doesn't do it?
Because other people have options and dignity, which we do not have, which puts us in an amazingly advantageous position.
Fuck you, I have dignity.
Where?
Is it hidden in your gigantic underpants that are plastered all over the Internet?
Is that where you hide your dignity?
Every woman has a pair of those period panties.
That's, like, a fact.
Okay.
Families.
I bet people don't make porno, because they have families.
But luckily, your parents are dead.
Sorry.
My grandparents are dead.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
So who are we gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone mainstream now.
It's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks in it.
Look at Paris Hilton.
She throat-fucks a guy in night vision, now she's selling fragrances to tweens.
And I'm pretty sure she's legally retarded.
That's for tweens?
Have you seen that Joe Francis guy who made Girls Gone Wild?
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot piece of shit in the world and he has a jet and a fucking island.
Look, there's got to be a less extreme solution to our financial woes here.
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper route.
- I don't have a bike.
- Be a waiter.
No one wants me around their food.
Would you eat food that I gave you?
I would not eat food that you gave me, that's true.
I mean, nobody wants to see us fuck, Zack.
Everybody wants to see anybody fuck.
I hate Rosie O'Donnell, but if someone said, "I got a tape of Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid,"
I'd be like, "Why aren't we watching that right now?"
Because she's famous.
Hello.
So are you.
You're fucking Granny Panties.
My underwear and your ass are famous, we're not.
So who the F would wanna watch us fuck?
- At least 800 people.
- The jerks we went to school with?
- Are you serious?
- Of course.
If you heard that someone we graduated with was in a fucking porno movie, you'd watch it, right?
I'd watch that guy Brandon suck a cock, I just met him.
With this mailing list, we have almost a thousand people that would definitely buy a porno we were in just to be like,
"Hey, I sat next to that guy in Civics.
Look at his fucking dick."
We sell a thousand copies at 20 bucks a pop, bam, we have paid off our bills.
- So, what do you think?
- I don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.
Oh, wow, like you've never done that before.
How many guys have you met in a bar, taken home, banged with your mouth and then never talked to again?
That's what we call a stranger.
Dude, I don't one-night mouth-fuck anybody that I pick up in bars.
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in the porno movie for some weird reason.
I guess...
We could fuck.
- Ew.
- Fuck you.
I mean, you're a nice-enough-looking guy and everything--
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're an all-right-enough-looking girl.
- How does that feel?
- Dude, I'm just saying it'd be weird and wrong, you know, like fucking my brother.
Okay, seriously, we're just talking about sex, okay?
It's for a purpose.
It's for getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.
- Wow.
- Just explain to your private beforehand,
"Look, this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash."
- Oh, my God.
- What?
You're just doing this because you've always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?
Yes.
I've gone my whole life pretending that I want nothing to do with you, just hoping one day we'd be in such dire financial straits that I could use it to finally make my move on you.
- You're just being sarcastic.
- I am.
See, I was pretending to cry right there.
I guess it's not like it'd be creepy, like if we got way too drunk one night and accidentally fucked, you know?
No.
We'd be going in with the understanding that it's--
A business decision.
Strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.
- Right.
- And by end,
I mean, I'll be waxing your ass.
Fuck you.
I'm not even letting you see my ass.
I've seen your ass and the rest of you naked around a billion times already.
- That goes both ways, buddy.
- You've never seen my dick.
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.
Are you kidding?
That party we went to where you got blasted, and Houls dared you to give yourself head, and we all watched you try for, like, an hour.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks by the way, for fucking letting me do that.
Thank you.
Oh, God.
We really do know too much about each other.
See, and this would really just be one more thing.
I mean, look at us.
It's Thanksgiving and we're huddled around a flaming fucking garbage can like a couple of steno bums.
I mean, this could give us a chance to pay off our debt, pay our bills, get a fucking nicer apartment with heat in it maybe.
What are you doing?
Miriam Linky, will you have sex with me on camera for money?
I will.
- A producer?
- Yeah.
- Guy who gets to finance the movie.
- You think I got that kind of money?
We just need that.
What you're about to spend on the flat screen.
Now I can't get my flat screen?
Fuck that.
No, no, no.
With your cut of the profits, you're gonna get two flat screens.
One in your living room, one in your bathroom.
One in the bathroom?
You know, it's always been my dream to watch shit while I shit.
Everyone with an ass loves to watch shit while they shit.
- I'm gonna make that happen for you.
- I don't know, man.
What else the producer do?
- Um, they help with the casting.
- What's casting?
Finding the people to be in the movie.
- I get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.
Like, I can look at a titty, make sure there ain't no moles on there?
- You can look at both titties, man.
- Man.
I've been looking at the same busted titties for the past almost 20 years.
- I'm due for another new titty.
- Please help us.
Please.
Please.
Yes.
Yes.
I love you.
Well, don't mind that smell.
We had some homeless people squatting in here.
You know, they'd void their bowels everywhere but the bathroom.
Anyway, you pick up the poop and you've got yourself a movie studio.
Why don't we shoot in your apartment?
No power.
You wanna pay our electric bill?
- You motherfuckers...
- We'll take it.
- Bring it back.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, God.
Come on.
Why the fuck do I have to do everything?
Fuckers.
Hey, what is that?
Fucking guys.
This fucking team, man.
They fucking suck.
I'm gonna hatefuck the shit out of you, ref.
- Dude.
- It's cool.
- He's my cousin.
- Hey.
Didn't you used to videotape the varsity basketball games in high school?
Just the away games.
I did it because I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.
Which one?
Whichever one wanted to fuck the guy who taped the varsity games.
- Aw.
- Still know how to work a camera?
- Who cares what the title is?
- The porn I liked when I was a kid, it was always, like, a spoof of a popular movie, you know?
Like, um, Edward Penishands.
Okay, so we need a mildly clever, vaguely dirty title, that sounds like a real movie
- and sums up what you're gonna see.
- Correct.
An American Werewolf in Brenda?
Fuckback Mountain?
- Too soon?
A Cock-in-Lips Now?
- Next.
Cradle the balls.
Work the shaft.
Jerk my come-crayon and let me color you white.
I need cock and I need it now.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
It's "puss" as in pussy.
Oh, because I was like, who would wanna fuck puss?
I want to slam my ham in your can, woman.
Scene.
- This guy is amazing.
- This guy's great-looking too.
I wanna fuck him.
Hi, my name's Delaney and I'm a producer.
I really don't know what it means.
I'm gonna be honest, this is my first time.
You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna touch you or nothing like that.
- All right.
- I have a wife, you know.
We're happy.
I mean, not happy, but it's cool, you know.
Just so you know, there will be some fucking.
- We'll talk about that if you get the part.
- Okay.
I mean, not-
- We won't be fucking, there'll be fucking in the movie.
Like I said, I got a wife.
She don't play that shit.
- She is a crazy bitch.
- Yep.
It's my job as the producer to see what you got.
So if that makes you uncomfortable in any way, you don't have to show me anything you don't wanna show me, because--
I love the movies.
- Lawrence of a Labia.
- No.
- Oh, come on.
- Dawn of the Dick.
Yeah, but how are zombies doing it at all sexy?
I want to eat your brain and your ass.
- Dude.
- Sci-fi.
Yeah.
Close Encounters With a Turd From Behind.
- I don't know what that means.
- Just asses.
Fucking deep in asses.
What?
We're making a porno and we just need to know what you would be or would not be interested in doing.
If anything.
- No anal.
- Oh, definitely no anal.
Anal and hugging.
I don't do ass stuff.
- Anal.
- Ah, fuck.
- Oh, wait, oral.
I like anal.
- Yay.
Okay, well, so, uh, do you have any special skills?
Special skills?
I can get a boner really quick and it sticks straight up.
- Is that really a special skill?
- I think.
- Can you show us what you mean?
- Sure.
Oh, that is special.
Yeah, you're hired, Mr.--
- Who are you again?
- Lester.
Lester "The Molester" Cockinshtuff.
- No.
- Wow.
That is the best porn name I've ever heard, man.
I can have a porn name?
- Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.
Are you Granny Panties?
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The panties are actually in the house.
- I'll get them.
- Whoa.
- Star Sex 2:
The Wrath of Cunt.
- We never made a Star Sex 1.
I guess we can lose Star Sex 3:
The Search for Cock, then.
- Cocunt.
- What's that?
It's Cocoon with a cunt.
So Delaney tells us you have a special talent of some sort.
I don't know if I'd call it a special talent, but it's a little something I picked up doing bachelor parties.
It would probably be easier if I just showed you.
- Great.
- The floor is yours.
So a movie, huh?
That could be fun.
Holy fuck.
Her name, Bubbles.
- Invasion of the Potty-Snatchers?
- That's like MAD Magazine stupid.
Well, fuck you, okay?
You try to think of a good sci-fi porno title.
It's hard.
There's gotta be one we haven't thought of that would say it all, not be ridiculously filthy and off-putting, and still have instant recognition with our audience.
- I got it.
- I got it.
- Star Whores.
- Yeah.
It's funny, right?
See, we figured this opens us up to an even bigger sales market beyond the people we went to school with.
People who like comics and sci-fi.
Comics?
Like "Ziggy"?
"Ziggy"?
Is that even in fucking papers anymore?
No, man.
Fuck you. "Ziggy" is a comic, right next to "Family Circus."
No, like Spider-Man and shit, you know?
There's always a shitload of Star Wars nerds at those comic-book shows.
So we sell them a Princess Leia they can really fucking jerk off to.
- That'd be me, Princess Lay-Her.
- Who am I playing?
You, my friend, are the lead role of Lubed Guy-Baller.
Man, he's gonna be balling dudes?
I thought you said this was boys on girls.
If I have to fuck a guy, okay, but I'd rather fuck a girl.
What's wrong with you, boy?
- We'll change the name to Sky-Baller.
- Sky-Baller.
I will be Hung So-low.
Delaney, my friend, you are On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
Man, I can't be in no porno.
My wife will kill me.
Hump me, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
You're my only hump.
On the other hand, fuck my wife.
Unfortunately, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over does not have any sex in the movie but the droids do, I-CUP and R2-T-Bag.
I robot.
And Stacey over here is gonna play Darth Vibrator.
- I'm the bad guy?
- She's not a guy, Zack.
I know that because I'm not a fucking idiot.
In our movie, Darth Vibrator is a bad girl who wants to fuck the galaxy, literally, and it's up to Lubed and Hung to stop her with their cocks.
- You and me get to have sex, then?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- I know.
Isn't that awesome?
Hold up, hold up.
So who's all having sex with who in this movie?
As of last night, I was having sex with Zack.
What?
Han Solo ain't never had no sex with Princess Leia in the Star Wars.
Guys, this isn't a literal adaptation here.
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.
Kind of like The Wiz or like a parody.
With lots of anal.
- Cool.
- I know, isn't that awesome?
I have a question, do Princess Lay-Her and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?
Uh, no, because they're brother and sister, and according to Miri, brothers and sisters can't fuck.
But you said, that this wasn't a literal translation, so that means Lester's character could have sex with Miri's character.
Because I would love to fucking eat her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.
Dream on, pal, it's never gonna happen, okay?
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See, she's fine-
- Wait, what?
Yep.
I mean, everyone else is having sex with more than one person in this movie all of a sudden, so I think it's, you know, not fair if I'm only fucking you.
Guys, read amongst yourselves, okay?
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Look, Miri, we got plenty of sex going on in this thing, you don't have to do that.
Zack, it's fine.
I mean I have slept with way worse-looking guys than Lester.
I just wanna do my part for the movie like everyone else.
You're having sex in the movie, you don't need to fuck someone else.
- You're good.
- I'm only fucking you, though.
So don't we need to vary it up to keep it fair?
Fair for--?
I don't-
- What?
Fair for who?
What are these, blood diamonds we're talking about?
Fair for everyone else who is fucking more than one person, a.k.a. you, in the movie.
- I mean, fine--
- All right.
I mean, if you don't care--
I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
Fuck.
I don't give a shit.
Like you said, you know, you've fucked bigger idiots than Lester.
Holy shit.
Are we really gonna shoot this in outer space?
Maybe not bigger idiots.
Thank you.
- Cut.
All right, guys, that's it.
- Yeah.
Make sure you leave your costume so we know they're here for tomorrow.
Mostly, everybody, thank you so much for helping us get ready, you know.
Cleaning this place out, building the sets, sewing the costumes, it's just--
I mean, it's really amazing.
Thank you.
Seriously, thanks.
But this is just the beginning, guys.
If Star Whores works, and it will, we are set up for sequels galore.
The Empire Strikes Ass.
- Return of the Brown-Eye.
- The Phantom Man-Ass.
And Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter.
- Okay.
- Revenge of the Shit.
- You got it?
- Yeah, no, we got it.
Ew.
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.
- We'll talk about that one.
We're gonna have a lot of fun, but more importantly, we're gonna make a lot of fucking money, okay?
- Yeah.
- So get ready for greatness, people.
Tomorrow we start principal photography.
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
- All right, good night, you guys.
- We got a movie.
- What?
- Nothing.
I think someone should acknowledge how insane and amazing this is
- and it's all because of you.
- I don't know.
It's just a porno.
You know what I mean.
You've really come into your own.
Shut the fuck up.
So speaking of coming into things, ready for tomorrow?
Twenty years, we're finally gonna know what it's like to have sex with each other.
You say that like you've been wondering what it'd be like to sleep with me for a while now.
Why the fuck do you think I started hanging out with you?
I knew it.
Here, help.
Let's just promise that it's not gonna change anything between us, okay?
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Some guys can't keep sex in perspective.
If anyone's gotta keep this in perspective, it's you, okay?
I don't want you getting all mushy and gooey on me after I give you the best orgasm you've ever had.
Oh, like you know what you're doing down there at all.
I actually don't.
Where's the clitoris?
Is it in your ass?
Just, you know, make sure you kind of whoop it up and act like I'm a stud who knows what he's doing, okay?
Just be a pal.
Oh, dude, I am gonna Meryl Streep the fuck out of this tomorrow, you watch.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
No.
Really, thank you.
For everything.
You're welcome.
Less than 12 hours and we make Monroeville history.
- I really hope nothing goes wrong.
- It's a movie.
What could go wrong?
What are you doing?
- What's up?
- What the fuck?
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait.
- Wait.
- Stop.
Stop.
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck is going on?
Condos is what's going on, as soon as this shit-hole's demo'd.
No, you gotta stop it right now.
We rented this place for a month from Mr. Jenkins.
Sounds like your Mr. Jenkins was full of shit.
Luxury Homesteads bought this place a month ago.
I'm gonna kill that lying old fuck.
You're gonna have to go Florida, that's where he moved.
We've got thousands of dollars of equipment in there.
- Please.
- If you wanna sift through this rubble when we're done, be my guest.
Hey, get that fucking beam down.
This is the last thing you wanna hear.
If you don't get an advance,
I don't think we're gonna keep a roof over our heads.
I got an advance already.
It went into all the costumes.
- So all our money's gone?
- All your money?
Never mind what my wife's gonna do when there ain't no new snow tires, or when she sees I charged a video camera.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this, man.
I just wanted to see some free titties.
That's all.
But there's no such thing as free titties, is there, Zack?
- Is there?
- Fuck this noise.
Why don't we get another camera, and shoot something else?
Where are we gonna do that?
Got another sound stage?
Sound stage?
We had a shit-covered garage we turned into a sound stage.
We find someplace new and we do it again.
How?
Okay, I'm broke, man.
No, make that, I was broke.
Now I am really tapped out.
I have to get another job to pay Delaney back.
So please tell me, how can I afford to start over?
- What can I get you?
- Yeah, can I get a, uh--?
Too fucking late.
Cappuccino, 3.50.
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
I mean, I'm a total loser in every single other aspect of my life.
What made me think I could do something as simple as filming people fucking?
We have no money left, nowhere to shoot, no sets, we have no fucking cameras.
Here.
It's time I go back to my regular life where I am a quiet fuckup who doesn't cost anybody any money and knows his goddamn position behind this fucking counter making cappuccinos for this fucking guy.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Fuck, yes.
Zack.
You sneaky Indian motherfucker.
I tell you, yes.
Swallow My Cockuccino.
- What?
- That's it.
That's the movie.
Why didn't I think of it before?
We don't need sets or a stage.
Look at all this production value, waiting to have balls on it.
Hold up.
You wanna shoot a dirty movie here, where we work?
Yes.
Fuck, yes, I do.
You know how many stories I have from working here?
How many times I've been laid right there after hours?
You've never gotten laid here after hours.
I know.
Thank you for reminding me.
But I always wish I had, and that's what porno is.
It's fantasy.
It's taking the normal and making it abnormal by fucking it.
Don't do that.
The little dog don't like that.
How did you get a camera?
By being a terrible, untrustworthy employee, that's how.
Give me today, I'll bang out a script.
Meet me back here after closing.
We're gonna launch arching ropes of jism all over this motherfucker.
Peace.
I like that guy but if he tries to fuck that little dog tonight for real,
I'm calling the Humane Society.
It's called Bean-N-Gone, so get the fuck out of here.
Hey, Barry.
- Stand by, Stace, picture's up.
- Okay.
Roll tape.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 12, Take 1.
And action.
I'd like a double espresso so I can stay up all night because I'm in the mood to fuck.
Well, I am a whore-ista, so I love to fuck.
Would you like to fuck me?
Holy fuck.
You mean, after you're done with your shift?
I mean during my shift.
- Sorry.
- Keep going, keep going.
With your shaft.
Let us fuck.
Cue music.
Okay, open up to camera, guys.
Let us see it.
More tongue.
Little less tongue.
Oh, that was good.
Cue effects.
Oh, yeah, like that.
Oh, yeah.
See, I told you it would work.
Didn't I tell you?
It looks amazing.
It's incredible.
Oh, the beans hurt.
Easy.
- Move in for coverage.
- Nice.
That's why we got him.
- Nice.
I'm impressed.
- Get in there, Deacon.
- Come on.
- Like that?
Like that.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
- Pull out a bit, actually.
- That's hot.
No, not you, Lester.
Put it back in.
Kiss the muscle.
- I kiss the muscle.
- You kiss the muscle.
- Can he slap her ass a little?
- Don't be a fucking pervert, dude.
- Stir, come on.
Stir.
- Yeah, stir it.
Stir it, baby.
Hey.
- Holy.
- Shit.
Are you guys still open?
No.
We close at 9.
I need coffee so I'm drive home.
- Okay.
Yeah.
- Thank you.
That's a cute kitty.
Okay.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You guys see the game?
I was at it.
Fucking Roethlisberger, the quarterback, was all fucking,
"Hug it, chug it, football.
All night." Heh-heh.
Okay, pal, here you go.
On the house.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Have a good one.
- Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- I said, have a good one.
Oh.
- Okay.
Keep moving.
- You and your little dog.
Go Steelers.
Action.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, like that.
Oh, fuck it, chuck it, football.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, God, this is good.
You take it.
You take it.
Take it, Barry.
Oh, take it.
Take it, Barry.
Take it.
I'm disturbed at how turned on I am by this.
- Shit, dude, it's almost 6.
- Oh, fuck.
Okay, that's a wrap, everybody, yeah.
Let's give a hand to our hotties with the bodies from last night.
Stacey, Lester, Bubbles, Barry, whoo.
- Yeah.
- Nice.
Okay, when we come back tonight, we finish up the venti-vulva scene, and then we get into me and Miri's stuff.
Again, amazing first night, everybody.
Thank you so much.
Let us fuck.
- Hey, how'd it look?
- How do you think it looked?
It looked like shit going into other shit, in focus.
What an artist.
That was Kurosawa's motto. "Shit going into other shit."
Oh, man, I can't believe you gotta work now.
It's okay.
You know, honestly, I don't think I could sleep.
- I'm pretty, like, pumped up right now.
- Right?
It was amazing.
It was awesome.
I think the cast and crew had a good time.
- We were getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.
I just wanna keep shooting people boning all day.
I don't think I've ever met the ambitious Zack Brown before.
- Well, I'm trying to pay the bills, so...
- It's not a bad thing.
I think it looks good on you.
Come on, hurry.
Come on, come on, come on.
Wait a minute.
- You guys never did it before?
- It's fine.
You know, we talked about it and it's just for the movie.
We're friends, you know, we're just friends.
And we will always just be just friends, so...
Listen, I have some extra lube from last night.
I understand it's kind of hard getting wet when everyone's watching.
At least it was for Barry.
- I don't know if I am gonna need it.
- Really?
Yeah, I think I'm just excited.
Uh-huh.
At the idea of people watching, not because of Zack.
Oh, God.
Zack could never have that effect on me in a million years.
- Hello, Miriam.
- Oh, hey.
Wow.
- Your face.
- Yeah.
Weird, huh?
I don't think I've seen your face since senior year.
I think I made a mistake.
I did it for you so you wouldn't get road rash during our scene, but I should have asked first, I look like a fucking beluga whale.
I think I'll be going now.
Okay.
All I keep thinking is we should've done a trial run at home last week or something.
- Oh, my God.
Right?
- I know.
- You're still cool to do it, though, right?
- Yeah, um.
Totally.
Are you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I'm, uh...
- Honestly, I'm a little nervous, I guess.
- You are?
- It's kind of a big deal.
- It is?
Yeah, you know, it's our first time together since our auspicious debut on viral video.
Oh, yeah.
That's a fuckload of pressure for a director.
As a director, please.
What about the anxiety I'm feeling as an actress?
- Did I pick the right project?
- Yeah.
What about this follow-up?
Julia Roberts followed Pretty Woman with Sleeping With the Enemy.
I'm following Granny Panties with Swallow My Cockuccino.
Only difference is this movie's about cock-sucking and her movie just sucked cock, period.
- The only difference, yeah.
- The end was pretty rad.
I liked that.
- When she kills him.
- with a gun.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- She calls the cops first.
- She calls it in first.
- It was so awesome.
- Awesome, yeah.
So I guess we should do this.
I think we should probably wait just until I lose another 20 or 30 pounds.
Stop it.
You look good.
Thanks.
So, what about me?
How do I look?
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful, so I guess it's not a big deal, but you look amazing.
- Okay.
Let's go make a porno.
- Okay.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 8, Take 1.
- Come here.
- I'm over--?
All right, settle.
Action.
Who could it be?
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm a delivery man and I have some cream for you.
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.
I work out.
So do you want me to give you your cream now?
I've been waiting for it all day.
- Fuck.
Come on.
- Oops.
Keep going.
I spilled my cream.
Do you mind?
I don't mind.
Especially if you spill it on my face.
Let us fuck.
- Fix my shirt.
Think I should?
- Okay.
Let me see them titties.
Actually, you know what?
Sorry, I don't think we should show them.
- What?
- We shouldn't show your breasts.
- Aren't you gonna take your shirt off?
- I'm just gonna open it.
You're not gonna take it off?
Why not?
My tits are bigger than yours.
I don't wanna show that.
She's not gonna show her tits?
I showed my cock and my asshole.
- Okay, I'll do your pants.
- Back and forth. okay.
- Holy shit.
- Where's that delivery?
I can't believe this.
I was delivering cream, and look what's happening.
- Jesus, what is that, a rumba?
- What's a rumba?
That awkward movement.
- Should I take your underpants off?
- Yeah, take them off.
What the fuck?
How does this work?
They're just like-
- I'll do it.
- I'll do mine, you just-
- You do yours.
- I'll do my pants.
Granny panties.
Just get on with it already.
I'm gonna fuck you with my pecker.
Dude, that's really dirty.
- That's too dirty?
- That offends me.
- Penis?
- Fine.
- I'm gonna fuck you with my penis.
- I can't wait.
For my penis.
Be careful, Miri.
Okay, there we go.
Just keep rolling, keep rolling.
- I'll walk forward.
- Fucking cream is coming.
This is the worst porno I've ever seen.
- Get over here, delivery man.
- Let's fuck on these beans.
- You okay?
- Yup.
- Okay, all right.
- Just leave them.
Just leave them.
- They're really distracting.
- You should leave them.
- You gotta get your-
- There you go.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.
This okay?
Okay.
Okay, uh.
- We'll start kissing on three, okay?
- Okay.
One, two, three.
Go.
I'm ready.
- I'm ready.
- Okay.
Deacon.
- Deacon.
Deacon.
- What?
Did you see Lost this week, man?
I missed it.
What happened?
They're on the island, off the island.
Who can follow that?
I think they're in hell.
Would you all shut the motherfuck up?
I want you to come.
- I want you to come with me.
- Okay.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Cut.
That's it?
It's over?
Ain't he supposed to come on her titties?
Well, it wasn't what we'd shot-listed, but that was nice.
- It was so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack.
Thanks, Lester, uh.
It wasn't just me, though, guys.
Give it up for my radiant costar here, Miri.
- Nice.
- Um, show's over in here.
Let's move out, start lighting the next scene.
- All right.
- Let's do it.
- You looked so beautiful.
- Thanks.
I thought they were gonna be fucking hard.
- It was pretty.
- Pretty don't sell.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
You good, Mir?
You need anything?
I'm just gonna take a minute, okay?
Okay, uh.
I'll just be out there.
Yeah.
- That was fun.
- Yeah, fun.
"Fun." You fucking douche.
Wow.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You working on a rewrite?
- Yeah, just for tonight's scene.
- I'm ready to go when you are, though.
- Okay.
You know, before we go, I...
I'm thinking that, uh, it's a good idea if we talk about what happened last night.
- Oh.
- I mean, we don't have to, but I think--
Okay, yeah, uh.
I kind of dropped the ball on that, I guess, huh?
- No, no.
It's...
- To be honest, it was...
You know, I didn't realize how weird it would be for me.
Weird?
Like-
- Weird how?
Acting and directing at the same time.
It's a lot to process, you know.
For the first time, I thought my balls didn't have enough hair on them.
That's not what I meant.
I know what you meant.
How you feeling about it?
I guess, um...
I feel like...
Like we...
- Holy fuck.
- The power's on.
Did you do this?
How did this happen?
I burned the bills.
How could we have done that?
- The water.
- The water.
Come on, come on, come on.
Yeah!
- We can shower in our home again.
- We are liquid.
Greetings.
Have you heard the good news about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?
Oh, my God, did you guys do this?
We got tired of you taking showers at our places all the time.
So we took up a collection amongst ourselves.
And chipped away at your mountain of debt.
You guys paid off our massive utilities bills?
- How did you afford that?
- I stole my old lady's bingo winnings.
And Mistress Bubbles did a bachelor party tonight at which yours truly was a guest star, thank you very much.
- Oh.
- Whoa.
Don't get too excited.
We didn't pay off your whole bill.
Just a month of each.
They agreed to turn everything back on?
At 9 at night?
How does that work?
Stacey knows somebody that works at Power and Light.
- You guys...
- This is amazing.
You didn't have to do this.
You didn't have to put us in your movie.
- Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.
- Or put us in your movie either.
- We said that already.
Guys, honestly, I don't know what to say.
You can start by saying we can take tonight off so we can have our wrap party right now.
Guys, we're not wrapped.
We still have four days of shooting left.
Excuse me.
In my "producorial" capacity,
I'm shutting the movie down for a night so we can get a little silly.
¶ "PARTY UP (UP IN HERE)" by DMX ¶
¶ "HEY" by THE PIXIES ¶
Go, go, go.
- Yes.
- Yes.
You all drink.
Was it just amazing with him, after all those years of not knowing?
It was, um, weird.
- But good.
- My scene with Zack's tomorrow.
You don't say.
But I'm a little nervous.
I was thinking about trying to get with him tonight.
- Really?
- I mean, if you don't mind.
You are just friends and all, so I didn't think it would be a biggie.
- It wouldn't be a biggie, would it?
- No.
No, no.
It's not a biggie.
What?
No.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Stacey, I'm not married to the guy, so...
I don't know.
You guys just looked kind of intimate last night.
- We did?
- Yeah.
Well, we're just better actors than I thought, I think, so you know what?
If you wanna get with him, you should just go ask him.
- He'd be really excited to hear that.
- Yeah?
For real, you don't mind?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
All the quarters are on the ground.
- Hey, Stace.
- Hey, Zack.
Come on, are you guys playing or what?
Well, I'm bummed, but I totally get it.
It's no problem to work with Lester again.
He has a nice cock.
Well, you're a trouper, Stace.
Oh, but if I start making weird faces or anything during the scene, it's just because I've been constipated all day.
Oh, shit, uh.
We don't have to shoot the scene tonight.
No, I want to.
Anal's great for when you're constipated.
It totally loosens you up.
I use ex-lax, but good to know.
Okay, I never thought I would have that conversation.
So are we starting with Lester and Stacey tonight?
We were supposed to start with Lester and Miri.
I know.
She-
- We're not gonna do that.
I don't think Miri's gonna do that.
Hey.
So where are we shooting this?
Over here?
- What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.
Our scene's tonight, right?
Can I talk to you for a minute in the back?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
What do you want me to shoot here?
Start with the close-ups of Lester and Stacey.
Give me a second, man.
What an artist.
Okay, uh.
Did I do something wrong to you?
No.
Then why are you here?
I'm here for the same reason you're here.
To make the movie.
Okay, just, like, for your own personal information, you're acting really weird right now.
I'm acting weird?
I think you're acting weird right now.
Oh, I'm acting-- How exactly am I acting weird?
You've been trying to keep me from fucking anybody but you since we started this thing.
Maybe I was thinking about your feelings.
Were you thinking of my feelings when you were banging Stacey?
Because that'd be really sad for Stacey.
She told me that you told her that that was okay.
I told her that it was okay to ask you.
Holy shit.
I get it.
I fucking get it.
It was a test.
That whole thing was a fucking test, is that it?
If it was, how do you think you did?
We had a discussion, Miri.
We had-
- Actually, we had many discussions about how it was just sex
- and how we wouldn't let it get weird.
- I'm not acting weird.
You're acting like a jealous girlfriend is what the fuck you're acting like.
- I am not your girlfriend.
- I know that.
You're not my boyfriend, so why are we having this conversation right now?
Because you're about to fuck Lester to spite me, it seems like.
Did you fuck Stacey to spite me?
No.
You fucked her like you fucked every other bitch and never gave a shit how I felt about it.
- Well, that was before.
- Before what?
Look, don't fucking pretend that the other night, you and me, right there, that that didn't mean anything to you, that you didn't feel it too.
Oh.
You're not getting all gooey on me here, are you, Zack?
You know what?
If you were any other bitch I didn't give a rat's ass about,
I would tell you to go fuck yourself right now because I fucking hate this game-playing shit.
But you, you mean more to me than that, so I'm just gonna lay this out on front street.
I know you felt something big, something real the other night when we were together because I felt it too.
We tried to fuck and instead, we wound up making love.
So if this is what you need to hear in order to keep you from fucking Lester, if this is what you need, then fine.
Here it is, I'm gonna say it.
I love you, Miri.
Happy?
Oh, Jesus.
You better get ahold of yourself, Zack, because we just fucked.
Okay.
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?
But you did.
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.
Wait--
All right, don't forget I'm down here.
Watch that pullout, huh?
Yeah.
Mmm.
This is some damn good coffee.
- Where you going?
- Getting the fuck out of here.
We gotta finish this movie.
Yo!
You believe this shit?
Do you believe this shit?
What the fuck just happened in there?
I'll tell you what just happened in there.
That chick frosted me like I was a fucking cake.
Zack.
Okay, seriously, get a picture of me right now.
I'm hunting humans.
- Dude, check it out.
Ooh.
- Oh, shit.
Seriously, let's shoot the shit out of this bitch.
- Where you aiming at?
- Cock shots?
Cock shots.
We shot you in the balls, cunt nugget.
Well, it's my job to get shot in the balls, so-
- Oh, they're gone.
Excuse me.
Didn't you used to work at the Bean-N-Gone in Monroeville?
I sure as shit hope this pays better, I tell you.
So why don't they just shoot you with a puck?
What do you mean?
I mean, what does paintball got to do with hockey?
Nothing, I guess.
- So ain't no prizes or--?
- No, no.
So, what are they paying $5 for?
To shoot a Broad Street Bully in the balls.
White people are fucked up.
Yup, they sure are.
It's a living.
You've been getting the checks I've been sending?
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Probably didn't save you from a brutal tongue-lashing, though, huh?
You know, the wife never found out about the camera, because I paid off the bills.
How did you manage that?
- Because now I'm Oprah rich.
- No way.
- The post office fucking settled?
- Hundred-sixty large, son.
- Nice, man.
Congratulations.
- A beautiful day, thank you very much.
I thought you made that whole thing up.
No, no.
It was very real.
You can believe it.
Even though she's spending all of it.
Well, since you ain't gonna ask me, I'll just go ahead and tell you.
- No, I have not seen Miri.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.
Oh, I suppose you weren't gonna ask about your movie, neither?
Look, that's why I came down here.
I need you to come take a look at it.
- I'm not interested.
Sorry.
- You'd better get interested
- because you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?
The story doesn't make sense.
- The story?
- The story doesn't make sense.
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?
It's a movie, dog, and a movie's gotta have an ending, which we don't have at the moment.
Come shot, credits.
There's your fucking ending.
Do me this favor, okay?
When you're done getting your nuts blown off, come back to humble Monroeville to my crib for a couple hours, check out the flick, you tell me what's missing.
No.
I'll tell you what, you do that, you don't owe me shit no more.
- Really?
- Really.
- Is your wife home?
- Yes.
- Maybe I should leave the pads on.
- You got some extra ones?
Hey, honey.
Where the fuck you been?
And who in the fuck is this now?
Would you calm down, woman?
Goddamn.
You already left one white boy down in my basement while you off gallivanting and shit.
What if this motherfucker
- was all grabby on me?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
Oh, what in the fuck is that supposed to mean?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
- White boys love me.
White boy.
- I said, white boy.
- Yeah?
You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?
- Should I say yes?
- Just say yes.
Yeah.
- Why don't you, uh, head downstairs?
- Oh, okay.
It's just through this hallway.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
What the fuck you looking at?
Why you gotta be yelling at me in front of my director?
- Oh, he's a director?
- Yeah.
I didn't know that.
Shit, he's a director.
Well, why don't he direct my ass to a new husband?
How about that shit?
- That's the bedroom.
- Keep talking, maybe he will.
Oh, don't nobody want them saggy-ass balls!
Saggy balls?
Look at these sagging-ass titties you got around here.
- You could tie these together.
- Motherfucker, we match.
Oh, shit.
Where's my paintball gun at?
Look at you, editor and DP.
You got your shit covered, man.
Please, don't ever say "shit-covered" to me again.
Roll the film for the man, please, so we can see what he thinks.
Just jump through it.
I ain't got all night.
The bitch is on me.
"Nigga Rich Productions." Classy.
- Yeah, DreamWorks was taken.
- Was it?
Plus, it sounds like an underground gay fuck club.
"I met a guy at DreamWorks." Yeah.
All right, so we got Lester and Stacey fucking.
Then we got Barry and Bubbles fucking.
And then this boring bullshit.
Okay, just, uh, go to the next scene, would you?
Uh...
- What next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?
We never shot it.
- Why not?
- Because after you left that night,
Miri came out of the backroom and said she couldn't do it.
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped?
So...
- Wait, so Miri--
- Never fucked nobody.
Just you.
Now, I wonder why she did that.
- Hm.
- Hm.
You see, there was a time when I was just a bitter old fuck making coffees, and Stacey was just a lap dancer and Barry and Bubbles didn't know each other and this fool here, hell, I don't even know what he was.
- A white supremacist.
- Man, fuck you.
Then two people come along and showed us something we didn't know existed.
A world of possibilities where plain old people just like us could do something special.
Even if it's something as simple as filming people fucking.
Sometimes we just need someone to show us something we can't see for ourselves
and then we're changed forever.
So as you can see, our movie ain't got no ending.
Every movie needs an ending, don't it?
Peace.
Delaney, you're a slick cupid motherfucker.
Ain't love grand?
Why the fuck is this white boy running through my goddamn house?
Sometimes.
Miri.
- Miri.
- Zack?
- Miri.
I'm sorry.
- Get out.
- Close the door.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over--
- Just close the fucking door, Zack.
I never slept with Stacey that night, okay?
I swear to God.
When we got into my room, you know what we did?
We talked about you, and us and how things were different and how I was too much of a fucking pussy to just tell you how I felt about you.
And I know-
- I know that that's only because of all the stupid shit we said about how we wouldn't let sex change us, but it did.
It changed me.
That has to be love, right?
It has to be love and just so you know, I can't go back to being just friends anymore,
- because I just can't.
- Good.
And I think--
I think that you feel the same way.
Because that night after I left, you didn't fuck Lester.
What's up, Zack?
You know what?
I don't care that you're fucking Lester, okay?
How's that?
- Oh, shit.
- I don't wanna be with anyone but you.
So I will wait forever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life because I love you, and I have for as long as I can remember.
And I would rather die than be without you, Miriam Linky.
Miri's last name is Linky?
You're gonna fuck a guy who doesn't know your last name?
Or that you beat up Carl Roth in the sixth grade?
I know that.
Or what your senior prom dress would've looked like had we gone but we decided not to, and we got drunk alone instead.
Or that you washed your hair in the toilet.
We're not fucking, Zack.
Or that you're not fucking Zack-- What?
I asked her to fuck me.
She wouldn't do it.
I even tried to talk her into giving me the fucking Dutch rudder.
Shot me down on that too.
- And a Dutch rudder is?
- Don't know what a Dutch rudder--?
All right, you grab your dick, then you have someone else work your arm.
Here, let me show you.
All right, grab my arm.
I'm grabbing my dick, you're grabbing my arm.
Now work it.
Work my arm.
See that shit?
Work it up and down.
It's like someone else is jerking you off.
Okay.
There's the double Dutch rudder, which, I grab my dick, you grab your dick, you work my arm, I work your arm, same time.
It's like jerking off together but not gay.
We're not touching dicks, each other's dicks anyway.
I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.
It feels good, sir.
Try me, come on.
Sorry to change the subject on you, Lester, but if you're not fucking Miri, why is your dick out right now?
Because I live here now, and I like to be naked.
- What?
- When you moved out, she couldn't afford to pay her rent by herself, so I moved in to help.
But you just came out of her room.
That's my room now.
She moved in your old room.
Wait, wait, wait.
She changed rooms?
Yeah, she said she did it because she missed the smell of you or some shit.
I don't smell anything.
But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.
- Night, Zack.
- Night.
Do you?
Then why are you crying?
Because I missed you so much.
Me too.
I love you.
- I love you, I love you.
- I love you.
I don't mean to alarm you but I think I just jerked off Lester a little bit.
- The Dutch rudder?
- Yeah, it's ingenious, right?
If you ask me nicely, I will Dutch-rudder you the rest of our lives.
Good.
I'm getting tired of fucking the Fleshlight.
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.
- What'd it feel like?
- Like fucking a flashlight.
- Wrong room.
- Oh, God.
That's gross.
Let us fuck.
Hello.
Welcome to Nigga Rich Productions, home of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, the production house for the couple looking to put a little spice in their sex life.
- Shall we take a look around?
- Fuck me so hard.
Oh, God.
First, you'll meet for a consultation with one of our romance-ologists, who'll coach you through that initial awkward stage before you're camera-ready.
So we will start off with some erotic massage and some--
Dude.
Some light petting.
That sounds good.
Are you guys sure you don't wanna do some, uh, butt-sack work too?
- Uh, let's move on, shall we?
- Why?
From their break-out hit, Swallow My Cockuccino, to the multi-million selling Swallow My Cockuccino II and the award-winning Star Whores saga, including Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter,
Zack and Miri have proven time and again that they know how to shoot hot sex.
As an actor, I've sometimes brought my work home with me inappropriately.
When you're telling your real-life lover in the bedroom, to, you know, bend over while you cake your hand in K-Y, it is a sign that the romance is dead, I think.
Then we turned to the professionals at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
Oh, my God, they totally saved our civil union.
They filmed what was inside of us and not what was coming out of us necessarily.
It helped me see his asshole as not just a come dumpster, but a sign of his beauty, his flower.
It became a, uh, gorgeous orchid.
Orchids grow in sort of the filthiest conditions.
That's what his asshole became to me.
This beautiful flower amidst shit.
- Honey, they get the metaphor.
- I don't think they do.
Let's just say, thank you to Zack and Miri.
It's helped us out, it's helped our friends.
Enrique?
Park?
Park?
Enrique?
Can we get a little love for Zack and Miri?
They don't even know what's going on, they're so pilled up.
But don't take his word for it.
Just ask our co-founders.
- Hi.
I'm Miri Linky Brown.
- I'm Zack Linky Brown.
Here at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, we're dedicated
- to committing your love--
- Or lust.
--to high-end, quality production digital video.
A forever keepsake of your passion.
That's right, Miri.
Why set up a camera at the end of your bed and settle for one unflattering angle, when you could let the professionals dazzle and delight your senses with an array of shots so masterfully rendered you'll swear Martin Scorsese snuck into your room
and caught you fucking?
And remember, we're not just the presidents of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
We're also clients.
Call now to set up your appointment
Way to fuck, Zack.
Get up Zack.
Come on, I don't wanna be late from work.
- Get out!
- Jesus, why not close the fucking door if you're gonna take a shit?
- It was closed!
- No, it was closed over, it was not closed.
- Shut the fucking door!
- Okay, okay.
- What's that thing?
- It's a hand warmer.
We're going now.
Do you smell that?
Is that the car?
- Oh, God.
- What?
- Oh, no.
- What?
- What?
- It's stuck in my balls.
What's happening?
- Pull over, pull over.
- Okay, alright!
Oh fuck.
I think I burned my ball hair off.
It's not funny.
Can you help me pick out an outfit for tonight?
I'm working till six.
Well, I can try stuff on at the store.
The store?
No, how about instead you get a friend?
But you are my friend.
- I meant a girl friend.
- Can you work for me tomorrow?
- Tomorrow is Thanksgiving.
- Then you must come in the next day, I tell you.
- It's Black Friday.
- Black Friday?
It's the biggest mall shopping day of the year.
And since the mall is just up in the street, I would like you to come and work.
- On Black Friday?
- Oh yeah.
- And we work on Movie Monday too?
- Sorry?
How about "Nigger Tuesday"?
Nigger Tuesday?
Is this a new day holiday?
You come to brother and tell him he gotta work on Black Friday
You got any idea how racist that sounds?
Telling me to come here and work, what do you think you own me?
- I never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?
You thought to yourself:
Oh I'm gonna for this nigger, cause I put food on his table and clothes on his little nigger baby backs and he ain't gonna say shit.
- To say I'm a star.
- You shut up.
You're God damn right to say I'm a star.
Can't wait until the post office settle my disability suit, cause Deann I will be out this mother fucker.
- You can kiss my ass.
- You know what?
Fuck you, fuck you and suck cock.
The hell with you.
- The hell with you.
- Zack, my boy.
- Yeah?
A customer with a hair lip speak me say you've been watching baseball here the other night.
Football.
And no, that wasn't me.
Maybe the hair lip makes it sound like baseball.
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe you hear it with an accent.
Fuck you, okay?
One day I'm gonna put a camera there and I can tell, I know, everything you do when I'm gone.
Everything.
Scratch your balls, take a shit.
Everything, I tell you.
Okay?
Fucker.
I hear both of you mother fuckers, I tell you.
- Why is he so fucking ice trunk?
- Fuck off, I tell you.
Very good, hmm?
Ghandi mother fucker telling me I gotta work on Black Friday, and do some shit.
Like I don't wanna do some shopping too.
Biggest sales day of the year.
I'm getting me a flat screen TV, you couldn't believe that.
That is actually my fault, I should tell you.
I asked for Friday morning off, so..
- Sorry about that.
- For what?
I actually just need a lot of recovery time.
Tonight is me and Miri's ten-year-high school reunion
I'm just gonna get fucking alcohol poisoning.
- Reunion?
- Yeah.
- Tomorrow is Thanksgiving.
- I know, isn't that fucked up when they do that?
Like, they say it is the best chance to get everyone together.
People come back to the town for holidays..
But you know what?
They can have it in the middle of the summer at a fucking blow job contest that I was judging, and it would still be retarded.
- So why are you going there?
- Miri is making me go.
Listen to him, why are you always bend over backwards for the girl, knowing she ain't getting annoyance.
We got a good thing going, man.
She pays out the rent, she does the dishes she wakes me up in the morning.
Why complicate that with sex?
Besides man, I've know her since the first grade.
You don't fuck someone you've met in the first grade.
Excuse me, I've met my wife in kinder garden
We got married in Senior year and she has been the queen of my world ever since.
- But what if you could do it all over again?
- I would jerk off and live by myself.
- That woman is the ban of my existence.
- See!
Excuse me, can I get a cup of coffee?
- Black.
- Can't you see we're talking, White?
If you're gonna continue to emasculate me with this barbie dress up shit
- I'm using your laptop.
- Don't forget to smack it when you turn it on otherwise the screen doesn't come on.
- Why don't you spring get a new one of these?
- Same reason I don't spring for clothes for tonight:
I'm broke.
There's a chick who works at Teen Juice at the mall, you know
And I gave her a good deal in Yearn's so she's letting me borrow this stuff for tonight.
What?
A vibrator online.
- What's wrong with the one you have?
- It died last week.
Look at the size of those fucking panties.
Shoot that shit, shoot it.
Who even knew Amazon sold shit like this.
This is incredible!
Those are fucking granny panties.
Okay, A:
I don't appreciate you violating the sanctity of my Amazon wish list page
And B:
I'm not buying that thing on Amazon, because turns out the over credit card they take
Oh shit.
I'm sorry guys, am I in the way?
You're fucking fagot alright.
Let's go to Starbucks.
And he throws like a bitch.
You know what else I throw: my nuts sacking your coffees, so how does that taste fucker?
We saw your girl friend in her under wear.
Well, too bad she's not my girl friend you little fucker..
Are you still talking to me?
Just said I'm gonna look up more fuck toys on Amazon.
Holy shit, at least they have a flash light here too.
- What's that?
- It's a fucking pocket pussy
That is shaped like a flash light for discretionary jacking off.
That when you get caught no-one thinks it's weird, you're just a guy who likes to fuck his flash light.
- I'm totally buying this shit.
- Wow, if you got money to burn..
How about paying the electric bill?
- It's due already?
- Well, November's probably but I was talking about September's.
Tell me, this doesn't rock.
Kinda look like you're fucking Ronald McDonald.
That makes me want some McNuggets.
Why would you wanna buy a pocket pussy anyway?
That is so sad.
What?
Excuse me, I forgot about the nobility that a company is coming with a fucking vibrator.
Real, seal, action..
Oh my God, if you start fucking little machines
I'm moving out.
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a little machine.
How come you get to fuck something with a motor in it, and I can't?
Cause I've never met a man who can make me come like a vibrator does.
That is fucking bullshit.
...ball of jerkings in the bathroom?
Holy Jesus, you do not use my jerkings to jack in our bathroom.
No you know what I do actually, is I light bunch of candles
And I sprawl out on my sheets and I listen to Sting.
Now I'm a guy..
Give me two popsicle sticks and a rubber band, I'll find a way to fuck it
Like a filthy McGyver.
- Oh my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.
- How about this?
- I don't get why you're putting so much effort in this thing anyway?
I thought we were like, just gonna go sit around and make fun of everybody.
Well, I can't wear anything that I've already on and expect to bring home Bobby Long.
Bobby fucking Long?
No way!
Didn't that guy call you Stinky Linky?
Yeah that was then, okay?
Maybe now he can save me a fortune in Amazon bills.
Maybe you can fuck our landlord, so we can at least keep roof over our heads.
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.
Hey, I bought skates with last week's pay check and I need those, to skate with.
And this week's I'll barely cover the past two water bills so..
Is this sexy?
Yeah, in like to a catch a predator kind of way it is pretty fucking sexy.
Then we're done.
Zack.
You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?
They shut it off.
- Oh shit, just..
Help me get this shit out off my hair.
Just use the water out of the toilet.
There's poo in there.
Not that part!
The back part of the toilet thing.
Take that cup there and then put in, there you go.
Here I'll just lean back if you could just
You know, pour it down like that.
Don't look, don't look.
Alright, one hour tops and then we're gone.
Or I had an idea, we could just not go at all, which would rock.
Look, even though we're broke and we've never gone to anything, we're still better than these people, right?
No, not at all.
We're probably not even as good as most of them, unless one of them is crackhead or something.
Just tell me I'm prettier than when we graduated.
You look about the same.
Definitely not prettier.
But around the same.
I'm thinner though right, little?
Not really.
Well, good pep talk.
Fuck!
- Tadaa!
- Tadaa.
- You don't recognize us, do you?
- No, sorry.
Zack Brown and Miri Linky.
- Are you the one they called Stinky Linky?
- Oh no, no-one ever called me that.
Oh great, what does yours say?
- What the fuck?
!
Come on, I'm sure I had a nickname.
- Nothing?
- Alright, well you guys have a great time.
And before you go, don't forget your copy of the Roving Roe-Ver.
- What the fuck is this shit?
- That is not shit.
That would be our bimonthly newsletter.
You know, it updates you on what everyone's doing in their lives.
- Finally!
- I love your enthusiasm.
Here you go, write your e-mail address down on that and I'll be sure to add you to our 800-hundred-member strong mailing list.
We had 800 people in our graduating class?
Yes, and only 250 RSVP.
- Doesn't that suck, Mary?
- Miri.
- Are you married, Beths?
- I am.
Two kids.
- Wow, that's beautiful.
- Awesome.
Wanna fuck me later?
- Oh no, I'm married.
- OK, cool.
Well, if you change your mind I'll be there getting shit face.
Just so you know, I eat the pussy.
Tempting..
Again, no.
- Show we?
- Sir.
Bye Beths.
Think about it.
I love your pussy.
Can I get two beers, please?
- You want a beer?
- Yeah.
Three beers.
Thank you.
Is that Zack?
Or am I Zack?
Never gets old, huh?
- The other Zack.
- In my world nobody calls me the other Zack.
Now that this guy is not around anymore, huh?
- Get the fuck off of me.
- There can be only one.
- What?
- Do not you remember?
Remember?
I yelled at you when we passed each other at the hall way.
Like it was yesterday, man.
Awesome, awesome.
- Awesome.
God!
You guys have so much to catch up on.
- I'm gonna let you get to it.
- Bitch.
See that big blow up picture they have of me?
My hair is terrible.
I can't believe I wore my hair like that.
It's before I knew about styling products.
Makes a big difference in life.
You live and learn though, right?
I mean, ten years ago.
It's before we knew anything about fashion.
Back in the day.
Or hairstyle.
Hey, stranger.
- Whoah, Stinky Linky?
- Yeah.
Although, it's just Miri now.
- Give me a hug.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Wow.
- How have you been?
- Great, great.
- Yeah?
- You look fantastic.
Wow, that is not something that you would've said to me ten years ago.
Well, I've grown up.
Yes.
Yes you have.
You just look..
Listen to you..
Thank you.
No don't thank me, just fuck me.
Roxanne.
Someone I like, what are the odds, huh?
Zack Brown, we had four years Spanish together.
Why does no-one recognize me?
Am I thinner, is that it?
Look at him.
- Who?
- My stupid husband.
No fucking shit!
John Butterfield, you actually married John Butterfield!
- That's amazing!
- Don't ever get married, it sucks.
You stop appreciating each other and you runs us up to talk about it first year.
But look at him now.
Flirting up with that cheerleader named Monica Vahn.
You want me to maybe flirt with you so he can see?
Even it up a bit?
I don't wanna get even.
If I was gonna do anything I wanna wine up the asshole.
You can give me a hand job in the girls' locker room.
- Fine, but make it fast.
- Fuck yeah!
Are you staying in town for a while?
Just tonight.
I fly back to L.A. tomorrow.
Wow, Los Angeles!
Gosh, Bobby Long.
Coming up in the world.
With Mrs. Long, I bet.
No, No, no, No Mrs. Long for me.
- Can I be honest with you?
- Sure.
I think I need a drink.
Do you need a drink?
Cause I need a drink to say this.
- I've got a beer already so..
- Oh great, thank you.
I think there's a cigarette butt in there.
Yup.
Sorry about the elbow.
I can be only one.
A beer, please.
Thank you very much.
Oh Jesus Christ, my friend is making a total ass of herself ending her old high school crush.
Oh God, that's so sad.
It's so Miri, that's what it is.
I'm Zack by the way.
Brandon.
Oh don't worry we weren't at the same class or anything.
Okay, lucky you.
- Oh, you went Rover?
- Well, I went here.
Let's just leave it at that, I guess.
- Do you have one of the large flown pictures of yourself hanging around here?
- I do.
Kind of, right there.
- Gorgeous.
- Good times.
What do you do?
What brings you here?
Oh, I came with somebody who went school here.
Bobby Long.
No shit!
That's who my friend is hitting on right now!
See, right there.
- Really?
- There the one dressed up like Hannah Montana.
In L.A. we call that look deglodion chŽek.
- L.A.?
Los Angeles?
- California.
That's awesome man.
What do you do out there?
I'm an actor.
- Wow, that's really impressive.
- Thank you, thank you.
- And fucking movies?
- Fucking movies, pretty much.
Look at you.
What, anything I've seen?
- What movies?
- Oh, all sorts of movies with all male cast.
All male cast.
Like Glenn Gary and Ross?
Like "Glenn and Gary suck Ross' midi cock and drop their hairy nuts in his eager mouth".
- Like a seakwell?
- Sort off.
It is a re-imagining.
- Ah, like the whiz.
More erotic and with less women.
No women, to be exact.
I apologize in advance if I'm out of line here,
But are you in gay porn?
- Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?
I thought you recognized me at first, that's why..
- Oh, okay I get it.
- You're not my demographic so I'm not insulted.
- Not really.
Who is your demographic?
- Do you love pussy?
- I do.
- Then not you.
I came here tonight hoping to seduce you and bring back to my apartment and sleep with you
to get back at you for calling me Stinky Linky all those years ago.
Wow, that is a weird revenge flat.
- You must be a terrible lay for that..
- What?
No, I'm great.
I mean I've had enough practice and everything..
Wow, that sounded not good.
I fuck a lot.
That's what I meant to say.
That doesn't sound good either.
Wow.
You're a lot funnier than I remembered.
Thank you.
Gosh, you turned out to be such a nice guy.
Wow, it's just.. you know, it makes even easier to just say this..
Would you like to come back to my place and maybe open a bottle of wine and..
have ourselves a high school reunion?
- I..
- Hello Miriam.
- Beat it, we're talking.
- I just wanted to introduce you to Brandon.
- Salutations.
Bobby's boyfriend.
- Bobby who?
- Bobby me.
Bobby Long.
Brandon is the star of such adult fair..
What was that one called again?
"You'd better shut your mouth or I'm gonna fuck it"
That's right.
I'm surprised I forgot that.
- Are you fucking with me?
- No, they are fucking with each other.
Oh my God.
- No!
- What?
- Granny Panties?
- Excuse me?
- How can you tell?
- This is so crazy.
I was literally just watching you like right before we got here.
This is so crazy.
This is you, right?
- My name's Granny Panties and nobody wants to fuck me.
Nothing's whiter than my big gay ass.
- Where did you get that?
- Oh, I entered gay and ass, and it was the top hit.
It's had 200 thousand views in three hours.
Honey, you are like..
I'm actually jealous right now, cause you are like super famous.
Baby, please take our picture.
I need a picture with Granny Panties.
This is awesome.
Alright, smile.
Did you get it?
Oh thank you, baby.
- E-mail me that.
- Yeah, cause he's the worst photographer.
Okay, good.
- You're gay?
- Yeah.
And I'm on the internet wearing.. a diaper?
Who knew you'd come to Pittsburgh and meet a celebrity?
- I'm gonna drink now till I pass out.
- Okay.
She'll be fine.
So you guys suck each other's cocks?
Oh, like crazy.
- Okay, that's enough.
- Oh, I'm embarrassing him.
I love when he gets embarrassed.
He's not living out loud you know, so he gets all like..
- You guys are totally in love, aren't you?
- Zackhary, we are.
Oh god, I just want..
I just wanna eat him up.
I can't keep my hands off him.
You know what, although he does most of the eating in the sack, if you know what I mean
- In the sack and off the sack.
- Alright, that's enough.
Look, you've drank too much.
You do this every time.
You can't contain yourself.
Oh, I'm sorry.
And by containing myself, you mean containing myself in the closet?
In the closet of denial?
Is that..?
No, no, no.
- Oh shit, this is real.
- No, but this is exactly why you haven't met my mother.
Because you don't know how to ease people into this situation.
- Baby.
- .. just force your way in, every time.
Baby, I thought maybe for one second in this town I could be myself.
I'm so sorry.
No, you're right..
I should just butch up and pretend that I don't love it
When you shove your dick in my mouth.
This is the best night of my life.
Am I making a spectacle, cause I could make a much bigger scene.
- Really are
I'm sorry.
Pittsburgh, listen up Man-Rovers..
My name is
- Brandon St. Randy and I love Bobby Long.
- Fucking A!
Is that enough for you?
Is that enough for a scene?
Cause I could start do a lot worst than that
And the reason, the reason you haven't taken me to your mother's.
Your mother with a make-up and all her drinking
She's in the closet, too.
- They fight just like real people.
- I thought, I could be a conduit for you.
- Thank you.
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm not.
Thank you.
- I love you.
- I'll e-mail you, Brandon.
- Zack, it was so nice to meet you.
And I will be patient with you, I will be there on your journey.
I will be your ship up the mountain of gayness.
Well, about to see what Granny Panties is up to, huh?
Do you hear that?
What kind of evil fucks turn off your power the day..
No, the night before Thanksgiving.
- Who does that?
- Can you get advance on your credit card?
Flash light.
Back stab my 200-dollar women.
Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.
This is bad.
If we don't come up some rent we're gonna be locked out the apartment.
So, who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.
Which means, by the time we get home, there's no heat either.
Well, I think it's time we put what we always talked about into effect.
You're gonna have to start hooking.
You know, these are the exact circumstances people find themselves in right before they start having sex for money.
Or making porn.
Sexy.
- Oh my God, yeah.
- What?
You got an idea?
We could make a porno.
Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?
No, yeah that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me?
That's a great idea.
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend
He said he makes a hundred grand a year, because he shoots and distributes his own porno films.
If it's so easy, how come everybody doesn't do it?
Because other people have options and dignity.
Which we do not have.
Which puts us in amazingly adventitious position.
Fuck you, I have dignity.
- Where?
Is it hidden in your gigantic under pants that are blasted all over the internet?
- Is that were you hide your dignity?
- Every woman has a pair of those period panties.
That's like a fact.
- OK, families.
I bet most people don't make porno, because they have families.
But luckily, your parents are dead
Sorry.
My grandparents are dead.
- Sorry.
Thank you.
So who we're gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone main stream now, it's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks in it.
Look at Paris Hilton.
Now she's selling fragrances to Tween's.
And I'm pretty sure she's legally retarded.
- Tween's?
- Have you seen that Jul Francis guy who made Girl Gone Wild?
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot piece of shit in the world, and he has a jet and a fucking island.
Look, there's gotta be a less extreme solution to our financial whoas here.
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper out.
- I don't have bike.
- You could be a waiter.
No-one wants me around their food.
- Would you eat food that I gave you?
- Not if you gave me it, that's true.
Nobody wants so see us fuck, Zack.
- Everybody wants to see anybody fuck
I hate Rosie O'Donnell, but if someone said
"I got a tape of Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid", I would be like why the fuck aren't we watching that right now?
- Cause she's famous, hello?
- So are you, you're fucking granny panties.
My underwear and your ass are famous, we're not.
- So who the f would want to watch us fuck?
- At least 800 people.
You jerk went to school?
Are you serious?
Of course, I'm serious.
If you heard this one we graduated with
Was in a fucking porno movie, you watch it, right?
I'd watch the Brandon guy suck a cock.
I just met him.
With this mailing list, we have almost a thousand people
That would definitely buy a porno we arranged, just to be like "hey, I sit next to that guy in Civic's.
Look at his fucking dick!"
We sold a thousand copies at 25 bucks a pop.
Bam!
We have payed off our bills.
- So, what do you think?
- Nah, I don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.
Oh, wow.
Like you've never done that before.
How many guys have you met in a bar, taken home..
Banged..
with your mouth and then never talked to again?
- That's what we call a stranger.
- Dude, I don't one night mouth fuck anybody that I pick up in bars.
Okay, fine.
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in porno movie
For some weird reason..
I guess..
- We could fuck.
- Yuck.
- Fuck you.
- I mean, you're nice enough looking guy and everything..
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're old enough looking girl.
How does that feel?
Dude, I'm just saying it would be weird and wrong, you know, like fucking my brother.
Ok, seriously.
We're just talking about sex, okay?
And it's for a purpose, if we're getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.
And you just explain to your private before hand.
Look, this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash.
- Oh my God.
- What?
You're just doing this, cause you've always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?
Yes, I've gone my whole life pretending that I want nothing to do with you.
Just hoping, one day we'd be in such dinar financial straight
So I could use it to finally make my move on you.
- You're just being sarcastic.
- I am.
See, I was pretending cry right there.
I guess it's not gonna be like creepy.
Like if we just got way too drunk one night and accidentally fucked.
No.
We would be going in with the understanding that it's..
- A business decision.
- Strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.
Right.
And by end, I mean I'll be waxing your ass.
Oh fuck you!
I'm not even letting you see my ass.
I've seen your ass and the rest of you naked around a billion times already.
Well, that goes both ways, buddy.
You've never seen my dick.
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.
Are you kidding!
That part when we went to, where you got blasted
And then we all watched you try for like an hour.
Thanks by the way for fucking letting me do that, thank you.
Oh God, we really do know too much about each other.
This would really just be one more thing.
I mean, look at us, it's Thanksgiving we're hulling around flaming
Fucking garbage can like a couple of steno bums.
I mean, this could give us chance to pay off our debt, pay our bills, get a fucking nice apartment with a heat in it maybe.
What is wrong?
Miriam Linky, will you have sex with me on camera for money?
I will.
Who's the producer?
He's the guy who gets to finance the movie.
Hell, what made you think I got that kind of money?
We just need that.
We just need what you're about to spend on the flat screen.
And I can't get my flat screen!
Fuck that.
No, no, no, no.
Dude, with your kind of profits, you can get two flat screens you have one in your living room, and one in your bath room.
One in the bath room?
That has always been my dream..
Watched it while I shit.
Everyone with an ass loves to watch it while they shit.
- I'm gonna make that happen for you, man.
- I don't know, man.
What else does the producer do?
They help with the casting.
- What's casting?
- It's finding the people to be in the movie.
- Oh, so I get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.
Like I can look at the titties and make sure there ain't no moles on them?
- You can look both titties, man.
- Oh man..
I'm looking at the same busted titties for the past almost 20 years.
- I'm due for another new tittie.
- Please, help us.
Yes!
Yes, I love you.
Well, don't mind that smell.
But we had some homeless people squatting in here.
You know what, they would avoid their balls everywhere but the bathroom.
Anyway, you pick up the poop and you got yourself a movie studio.
Or we could just shoot this thing in your apartment?
No power.
You wanna pay the electric bill?
- You mother fuckers.
- We'll take it.
Come on, come on, come on.
Oh Jesus.
Come on.
Why the fuck do I have to do everything?
Fucking God..
They fucking suck.
I'm gonna hate fuck the shit out of you Reff.
- Dude.
- It's cool.
He's my cousin.
Didn't you use to video tape the varsity basketball games in high school, or something?
Just the away games.
I did it, cause I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.
- Which one?
- Every one who wanted to fuck a guy who taped the varsity games.
You still have your video camera?
Who cares what the title is?
The porn I liked, when I was a kid, it was always like a spoof of a popular movie.
Like..
Edward Penis Hands.
- Okay, so we need a mildly clever dirty title, that sounds like a real movie and will basically sum up what you're gonna say.
- "An American Werewolf and Brenda" - "Fuck Back Mountain"
Too soon?
Next.
- Jerk my crayon and let me color your white.
I need talking, I need it now.
- I'm fucking you in the puss.
- I'm fucking you in the puss..
- It's puss as in pussy.
- Oh, because I was like..
Who would wanna fuck puss.
I want to slam my ham in your canvaman.
Scene.
- This guy is amazing.
- This guy is great looking too.
Hi, My name is Delaney and I'm a producer, if you know what I mean.
Let's be honest, my first time.
You don't have to worry..
- I'm gonna touch you, nothing like that.
- Alright.
I have a wife, we're happy..
We're not happy but it's cool.
Just so you know, there will be some fucking but uh..
We'll talk about that if you get the part.
- Okay.
- I mean, not we won't be fucking.
There will be fucking in the movie.
Like I said I got a wife and she don't play that shit.
She's crazy bitch.
- Yup.
- It's my job as the producer to see what you got.
So..
To make sure you're comfortable in any way.
You don't have to show me anything you don't wanna show me, cause..
I love the movies.
- "Lawrence of a Labia"
- No.
- "Dawn of the Dick"
- Yeah, but how are zombies doing it all sexy.
- I want to eat your brain and your ass.
- Dude..
- Scifi, yeah!
Closing counters with a turk from behind.
- I don't know what that means.
- Just asses.
Fucking keeping asses.
- What?
- We're making a porno
And we just need to know what you would be or would not be interested in doing.
- If anything..
- No anal.
- Oh, definitely not anal.
- Anal and hugging.
- I don't do ass stuff.
- Anal.
Oh fuck.
Oh wait oral, I like anal.
Okay, so do you have any special skills?
Special skills?
I can get balling really quick, and it sticks straight up.
- Is that really special skills?
- I think it is.
Can you show us what you mean?
Sure.
Oh, that is special.
Yeah, you're hired.
Mr..
Who are you again?
Lester, Lester the Molester Cocking Stuff.
Wow, that is the best porn name I've ever heard, man.
I can have a porn name?
Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.
Are you Granny Panties?
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The Granny Panties are actually in the house, I'll get them.
"Star Sex II" ~ N3krA ~
We never made our "Star Sex I".
I guess we'll lose the "Star Sex III" "The Search For Cock" then.
- Cock-ant
- What's that?
It's cuckoon with a cant.
So, Delaney told us you have a special talent of some sort.
I don't know if I call it a special talent, but it's a little something I picked up during bachelor parties.
- It would probably be easier if I just showed you.
- The floor is yours.
So a movie, huh?
That could be fun.
Fuck.
Her name Bubbles.
- "Vas-ion of the party snatches"
- It's like mad magazines.
Oh fuck you, okay.
You try to think of a good scifi porno title, it's hard.
There's gotta be one we haven't thought of.
That would say it all, not be ridiculously filthy and off putting.
And still have in some recognition with our audience.
I got it!
- "Star Whores"?
- Yeah, funny right?
See, we figured this opens us up to even bigger sales market.
Beyond the people we went school with, people who like comics and scifi.
Comics?
Like Ziggy?
Ziggy?
Is that even in fucking papers anymore?
No, man.
Fuck you.
Ziggy is a comic.
It's right next to Family Circus.
No,like Spider Man and shit, you know.
There's always a shit load of those Star Wars nerds at those car-pic shows.
So we sell them a Princess Leia, that they can really fuck and jerk off, too.
That would be me, Princess Lay Her.
- Who am I planned?
- You, my friend, are the lead role of Luke the Guy Baller.
Oh man, he gonna be balling dudes?
I thought you said it was just boys on girls.
If I had to fuck a guy, okay, but I would rather fuck a girl.
- What's wrong with you, boy?
- We'll change the name to uh..
to Sky Baller.
I will be Hung Solo.
Delaney my friend,
- You are On Your Knees Bend Over.
- Man, I can't be in no porno movie
- My wife will kill me.
- Hump me, On Your Knees Bend Over, your my only hump.
On the other hand, fuck my wife.
Unfortunately, On Your Knees Bend Over is not having sex in the movie, but the drawings do.
ICUP and R2T fag.
- I robot.
- And Stacey over here is gonna play
Darth Vibrator.
- I'm the bad guy?
- It's not a guy, Zack.
- I know that, cause I'm not a fucking idiot.
In our movie, the Darth Vibrator is a bad girl who wants to fuck the galaxy, literally.
And it's up to Luke and Hung to stop her.
- With their cocks.
- See, you and me get to have sex then.
- Cool.
- Yeah, I know.
Hold up, so who are having sex with who, in this movie?
I was about to say I was having sex with Zack.
What?
Hung Solo ain't never had no sex with Princess Leia
In the Star Wars.
Oh, guys look, this isn't a literal adaptation here
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.
Kind of like the Whiz.
With lots of anal.
- Cool.
I have a question.
Do Princess Lay Her and Luke Sky Baller have sex?
No.
Because they're brother and sister.
And according to Miri brother and sister can't fuck.
But you actually said that this wasn't literal translation so that means, Lester's character could have sex with Miri's character.
Cause I would love to fuck and eat her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.
Well, dream on Pall, cause it's never gonna happen, okay?
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See, she's fine..
Wait, what?
Yup.
I mean, everyone else is having sex with more than one person in this movie all the sudden
So, I think it's, you know, not fair if I'm only fucking you.
Guys, read them up to yourselves.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Look Mir, we got plenty of sex going on in this thing already.
You don't have to do that.
Zack, it's fine.
I mean, I have slept with way worse looking guys than Lester.
And I just want to do my part for the movie like everyone else.
You're having sex in the movie already, so you don't need to fuck someone else, you're good.
I'm only fucking you though so, don't we need to vary it up
Keep it fair?
- Fair for who?
What are these blood diamonds we're talking about.
I mean, come on!
Fair for everyone else who is fucking more than one person..
A.k. a you, in the movie.
I mean fine.
- Alright then.
- If you don't care.
- I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
I don't give a shit.
Like you said fuck
Holy shit.
Are we really gonna shoot this in out of space?
Maybe not bigger idiots.
Star Whores
Cut.
Alright guys, that's it.
So everyone just make sure you leave costumes, so we know they're here for tomorrow, okay?
But mostly, everybody, thank you so much for helping us get ready.
Cleaning this place out, building the sets and sowing the costumes.
- It's really amazing, thank you.
- Seriously, thanks.
But this is just the beginning guys.
If Star Whores works,
And it will.
We're set up for..
"The Empire Strikes Ass" - "The Return of the Brown Eye"
- "The Phantom Man Ass"
- And The Revenge of the Shit
The all anal final chapter.
- Okay.
- The Revenge of the Shit, you got it?
Yeah, no, we got it.
We'll talk about that one.
We're gonna have a lot of fun, but more importantly,
We're gonna make a lot of fucking money, okay?
So get ready for greatness people.
Tomorrow we start
Alright.
Good night, you guys.
- What?
- Nothing.
I just think someone should
Knowledge how completely insane and amazing this is.
And it's all because of you.
Ah, no.
It's just a porno.
You know what I mean.
You're really coming to your own.
Shut the fuck up.
So, speaking off coming in things, ready for tomorrow?
20 years finally getting to know what it's like to have sex with each other.
Wow, you say that like you've been wondering what it'd be like sleep with me for a while now.
Why the fuck do you think I started hanging out with you?
I knew it.
Here, help me.
Let's just promise that, this is not gonna change anything between us, okay?
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Some guys can't keep sex in prospective.
If anyone is gonna keep this in prospective, it's you.
I don't want you to get all mooshie and gooey on me after I give you the best orgasm you've ever had in your life.
Oh right, like you know what you're doing down there at all.
I actually don't.
Where's the clitoris, is it in your ass?
Just so you know, make sure you kind of whoop it up and act like I'm a stud, who knows what he's doing.
Just be a pall.
Oh, dude.
I'm gonna marital street the fuck out of this,
You watch.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
No really..
Thank you.
For everything.
You're welcome.
Less than 12 hours, we make Monroewill history.
I hope nothing goes wrong.
It's a movie, what could go wrong?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What the fuck is going on?
No, you gotta stop it now!
We rented this place for a month
From Mr. Jenkings.
Nah, sounds like your Mr. Jenkings is full of shit.
I'm gonna kill that lying old fuck!
You're gonna have to go down to Florida to do so.
That's where he moved.
We got thousands of dollars of equipment there, man.
Please.
Hey, if you wanna shift trough this ravel, be my guest.
Hey, get that fucking beam down!
I know this is probably the last thing you wanna hear right now, but
If you don't get an advance on your salary,
I don't think we're gonna keep a roof over our heads.
I got an advance already-
Went it all on the costumes.
- So all our money is gone?
All your money?
Never mind, what my wife is gonna do to me when there ain't no new snow tires
But when she sees a charged video camera-
Sorry I dragged you into this, man.
I just wanted to see some free titties.
That's all.
But there's no such thing as free titties..
Is there, Zack?
Is there?
Fuck this noise.
Why we don't just get another camera and shoot something else?
Where we gonna do that?
You got another sound stage?
What sound stage?
We had a shit covered garage we turned into a sound stage.
We find some place new, and we do it again.
How?
I'm broke, man.
No, make that I was broke..
Now I'm really tapped out.
I'll have to get another job just to pay Delaney back, so please tell me, how can I afford to start over?
- What can I get ya?
- Yeah, can I get..
Too fucking late.
Cappuccino, $ 3.50.
Honestly, I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
I'm a total loser in every single other aspect of my life.
What made you think, I could do as simple as filming
People fucking.
We have no money left, no where to shoot, we have no sets
We have no fucking cameras.
Here!
It's time I go back to my old regular life
Where I'm a quiet fuck, who does not cost anybody any money
And knows his God damn position behind this fucking counter
Making cappuccinos for this fucking guy.
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
Yeah.
Fuck yes!
You sneaky Indian mother fucker, I tell you.
Yes!
- Swallow My Cockacino!
- What?
That's it.
That's the movie.
Why didn't I think it before.
We don't need sets
Or a stage.
Look at all this production value.
Waiting to have balls on it!
Hold up.
You wanna shoot the movie here,
- Where we work?
- Yes!
Fuck.
Yes I do!
Do you know how many stories I have from working here?
How many times I've been laid right there after hours?
You've never got laid here after hours.
I know!
Thank you for reminding me.
But I always wish I had.
And that's what porno is.
A fantasy.
If taking the normal, and making it abnormal
By fucking it.
- Don't do that.
Little dog don't like that.
- How the fuck did you get a camera?
By being a terrible, untrustworthy employee.
That's how!
Give me a day, I'll bang out a script.
Meet me here after closing.
We're gonna load gism all over this mother fucker!
Peace!
I like that guy.
But if he tries to fuck that little dog tonight for real, I'm calling Humane Society.
Called Bean-n-Gone, so get the fuck out of here.
Vamos, Stacey.
Is already recording
Swallow My Cockacino,
Scene 12, take 1.
And action.
I'd like a double espresso, so I could stay up all night,
Cause I'm in the mood to fuck.
I'm Hornista, so I love to fuck.
Would you like to fuck me?
Holy fuck.
You mean, after you're done with your shift?
I mean during my shift.
Keep going, keep going.
With your shaft.
Let us fuck!
Music.
Okay, open up the tamer guys.
Let us see it.
More tongue.
Little less tongue.
See, I told you it's work.
Look, it's amazing.
Incredible.
Pull out of it actually.
No, not you Lester.
Can you slap ass and not be a pervert, dude.
Yeah!
Stir it.
Hey.
You guys still open?
No.
We close at nine.
I need coffee so I can drive home.
That's a cute kitty.
You guys see the game?
I was at it.
The quarter back was all fucking..
- All night!
- Okay, pall.
Here, on the house!
- I love you, man
- Love you too.
Have a good one, okay?
Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- I said have a good one.
You and your little dog.
- Action!
- Oh, yes!
Oh God, this is good.
Take it!
You take it!
Take it Barry!
- Take it.
- I'm disturbed how turned on I am by this.
Oh shit, there's someone.
Okay, that's a wrap everybody.
Yeah!
Let's give a hand to hottest with the bodies form last night.
Stacey, Lester, Bubbles, Barry.
Okay.
We come back tonight
We finish up the scene and then we get to me and Miri stuff.
Again..
Amazing first night everybody.
Thank you so much.
Let's us fuck.
- Hey, how did it look?
- How do you think it looked?
Looked like shit going in other shit.
What an artist.
That was careless motto: shit going in other shit.
Oh man, I can't believe you gotta work now.
It's okay.
You know what?
Honestly, I don't think I could sleep.
I pretty like pumped up right now.
- Right?
It was amazing.
It was awesome.
I think the cast and crew had a good time.
- We we're getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.
I wanna keep shooting people boning all fucking day.
I don't think I've ever met the ambitious Zack Brown before.
Well, trying to pay the bill so..
It's not a bad thing.
I think it looks good on you.
Come on, hurry!
Wait a minute, you guys never did it before?
It's fine, you know..
We talked about it.
And it's just for the movie.
We're friends, you know.
We're just friends.
We will always just be just friends so..
Listen, I have some extra loop from last night..
I mean, I understand it's hard to get wet when everyone's watching.
At least it was for Barry.
I don't know if I'm gonna need it
- Really?
Yeah, I think I'm just..
Excited.
Of the idea people watching, not because of Zack.
Oh my God.
Zack Brown could never had that effect on me in a million years.
- Hello Miriam.
- Oh, hi..
- Your Face.
- Yeah.
Weird, huh?
I don't think I've seen your face since Senior year.
I think, I made a mistake.
I did it for you, you know, so you didn't get a road rash
During our scene, but I should've asked first.
I look like fucking baloogle whale.
- I think I'll be going now.
- Okay..
All I keep thinking, we should've done a trial run a home.
- Oh my God, right?
- Yeah, I know.
- You're still cool to do it, right?
- Yeah, totally.
- Are you?
- Yeah.
Honestly, I'm a little nervous I guess.
It's..
- It's kind of a big deal.
- It is?
Yeah, you know.
It's..
Our first time together.
Since our auspicious debut on viral video.
- Yeah.
- That's a fuck load of pressure for a director.
As a director?
Please.
What about the anxiety I'm feeling as an actress?
- Then I picked the right project.
- Yeah, right.
What about this follow-up here?
I mean, Julia Roberts followed
Pretty Woman with Sleeping With the Enemy, you know?
I'm following Granny Panties with Swallow My Cockacino.
True.
The only difference is, this movie is about cock sucking
- And her movie just sucked cock.
Period.
- Yeah, the only difference.
The end was pretty rag.
I like that.
She kills them..
- With a gun.
Yeah, it was so awesome.
So I guess we should do this.
I think we should probably wait
Just until I lose another 20-30 pounds.
- Stop it.
You look good.
- Thanks.
So, what about me?
How do I look?
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful so..
I guess it's not a big deal.
But you look amazing.
Okay.
Let's go to make a pointer.
Swallow My Cockacino.
Scene 8, take 1.
Alright, settle.
Action.
Who could it be?
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm the delivery man, and I have some cream for you.
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.
I work out.
So..
Do you want me to give you your cream now?
I've been waiting for it all day.
- Oops.
- I spilled my cream.
- Do you mind?
- I don't mind.
Especially if you spill it on my face.
Let us fuck!
Let me see them, titties.
Actually, you know what, sorry I don't think we should show 'em.
- What?
- We shouldn't show your breasts.
- Are you gonna take your shirt off?
- I ain't take my shirt off.
I'm just gonna open it actually.
You're not gonna take it off?
Why not?
My tits are bigger than yours for fuck sake.
It'd look weird.
I don't wanna show that.
She's not gonna show her tits?
I shoved my cock in my asshole.
- Where's that delivery?
- I can't believe this.
I was delivering cream and look what's happening.
Jesus, what is that?
A rumba?
- What's a rumba?
- That akword movement.
Should we take your pants off?
- Yeah.
Oh, fuck.
How does this work?
You know what, I'll do it.
I'll do mine.
I'm gonna fuck you with my pecker.
Dude, that's really dirty.
- That's too dirty?
- Yeah, it offends me.
- I'm gonna fuck you with my penis.
- I can't wait.
For my penis.
Be careful, Miri.
Okay.
Just keep rolling.
Fucking cream is coming.
This is the worst porno I've ever seen.
- Get over here, delivery man.
- Let's fuck on these beans.
Just leave 'em.
- It's really distracting.
It's all good?
We'll start kissing on three, okay?
1, 2, 3.
Go.
- Deacon
- What?
Did you see Lost this week?
I missed it.
What happened?
Oh dude.
They're on the island, they off the island.
Who can follow that shit.
I think they're in hell.
- Would you shut the fuck up.
- Cut.
- That's it?
It's over?
Ain't it supposed to come with titties?
Well, it wasn't what we adjusted but that was nice.
- You were so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack!
Thanks, Lester.
Wasn't just me though guys.
Give it up
For my radiant co-star here, Miri.
Show's over in here.
Let's move it on to a fourth lying scene.
Alright.
Let's do it.
- You look beautiful.
- I thought they would be
- Fucking hard.
- But it was pretty.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
- You're good Mir?
You need anything?
- I'm just gonna take a minute, okay?
- Okay.
I'll just be up there.
- Yeah.
- That was fun.
- Yeah.
Fun..
- Hey, are you alright?
- Yeah.
Just for tonight scene, I'm ready to go when you are though.
You know, before we go..
I'm thinking
It's a good idea if we
Talk about what happened last night.
I mean, we don't have to but..
Okay, yeah.
I kind of dropped the ball in that I guess, huh?
- No, no.
It's..
- To be honest..
It was..
I didn't know how weird it would be for me.
Weird?
Weird like how?
Acting and directing at the same time.
It's a lot to process..
First time I thought my balls didn't have enough hair on them.
- That's not what I meant.
- I know what you meant.
How are you feeling about it?
I guess..
I feel like..
Like we..
- Holy fuck!
- The light is on!
Did you do this?
- No, I burned the bills how come..
- The water.
Come on, come on.
Yeah!
- We can shower in our home again!
- We got liquid.
Greetings!
Have you heard the good news about
Our Lord of savior Jesus Christ?
Oh my God, did you guys do this?
We got tired of you guys taking showers at our places all the time.
So we took up a collection amongs ourselves.
And shipped away your a mountain of debt.
You guys paid off our massive utilities bills?
How did you afford that?
I stole my old lady's bingo winnings.
And mistress Bubbles did a bachelor party tonight which yours truly
Was a guest star.
Thank you very much.
But don't get too excited, cause we didn't pay off your whole bill
Just a month of each.
And they agreed to turn everything back on?
Yeah nine at night?
How does that work?
Stacey knows somebody that works at power and light.
- You guys..
- This is amazing..
You didn't have to do this.
And you guys didn't have to put us in your movie either.
- Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.
- Or put us in your movie either.
- We said that already.
Guys, honestly..
I don't know what to say.
Well, you could start off by saying we could take tonight off so we could
Have our rap party right now.
Guys, we're not wrapped though.
We still have four days of shootings left.
Um, excuse me.
In my producorial capacity,
I'm shutting the movie down for tonight
So we can get lost silly.
Go, go, go, go!
- Yeah!
- Yes!
Is it just amazing after all those years not knowing?
It was.. weird.
But good.
I have my next scene with Zack tomorrow.
- You don't say?
But I'm little nervous.
- I was thinking about trying to get with him tonight.
- Really?
I mean if you don't mind.
You guys are just friends and all.
So I didn't think it would be a biggie..
It wouldn't be a biggie, would it?
No, no.
It's not a biggie.
Why?
No.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, Stacey.
I'm not married to the guy so..
I don't know.
You guys just looked kind of intimate last night.
- We did?
- Yeah.
Well, we're just better actors than I thought, I think.
You know what?
If you want to get with him, you should just go and ask him.
- He'd be really excited to hear that.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- For real?
You don't mind?
Cool.
All the quarters are on the ground.
Come on, you guys playing or what?
Well, I'm bummed.
But I totally get it and it's no problem to work with Lester again.
- He has a nice cock.
- Oh.
Well, you're a trooper Stass.
Oh, but if I start making weird faces during the scene, it's just cause I've been constipated all day.
Oh shit.
We don't have to shoot this scene tonight.
No I want to.
It feels great when you're constipated.
It totally loosens yo up.
I use exlax, but good to know.
Okay.
Never thought I'd have that conversation.
So are we starting with Lester and Stacey tonight,
Cause we were supposed to start with Lester and Miri.
Oh, yeah.
We're not gonna do that anymore.
I don't think Miri's gonna..
wanna..
Do that.
So where are we shooting this?
Over here?
- What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.
Our scene is tonight, right?
Can I talk you for a minute in the back?
Sure.
What do you want me to shoot here, Zack?
Just start with the close-ups of Lester and Stacey.
Give me a second!
What an artist.
Did I do something wrong to you?
- Then why are you here?
- I'm here for the same reason you're here.
To make the movie.
Okay, just like for your own personal information..
You're acting really fucking weird right now.
I'm acting weird?
Cause I think you're acting fucking weird right now.
How exactly am I acting weird?
Well, for one thing, you've been trying to keep me from fucking
Anybody but you since we started this thing.
Maybe, I was thinking about your feelings.
Were you thinking about my feelings last night
When you were banging Stacey, cause that would be really sad for Stacey?
She told me, that you told her that it was okay.
I told it was okay, to ask you.
Holy shit.
I get it!
I fucking get it.
It was a test.
That whole fucking thing was a test.
Is that it?
If it was, how do you think you did?
We had a discussion.
We actually had many discussions..
About how, it was just sex and how we wouldn't let it get weird.
- Then I'm not acting weird.
- No, you're acting like a jealous
- Fucking girl friend is what he fuck you're acting like.
- I'm not your girlfriend.
- Oh, I know that.
- And you're not my boyfriend
So why the fuck are we having this conversation right now?
Because you're about to fuck Lester to spite me!
- It seems like.
- Did you fuck Stacey to spite me?
No, you fucked her just like you fucked every other stupid bitch
And never gave a shit how I felt about it.
- That was before
- Before what?
Don't fucking pretend, that the other night you and me there..
That that didn't mean anything to you.
That you didn't feel it too.
Oh, you're not getting all gooey on me here, are you Zack?
You know what?
If you were any other bitch,
I wouldn't give a rat's ass about, I would tell you to go fuck yourself right now,
Because, I fucking hate this game playing shit.
But you, you mean more to me than that.
So I'm just gonna lay this out on the front street.
I know you feel something big, something real the other night when we were together
Because I felt it too.
We tried to fuck, and instead
We wound out making love.
So if this is it what you need to hear
In order to keep you from fucking Lester.
If this is what you need, fine.
Here it is.
I'm gonna say it.
I love you, Miri.
- Happy?
- Oh Jesus.
You better get hold of yourself, Zack, cause we just fucked.
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?
- But you did.
You know what..
Oh shit.
What?
Alright guys, don't forget I'm down here watch that pull out, huh?
This is some damn good coffee.
Hey man, where are you going?
- Get the fuck out of here.
We gotta finish this movie.
Can you believe this shit?
- Do you believe this shit?
- What the fuck just happened in there?
I'll tell you what just happened in there..
That chick frosted me, like a fucking cake!
Three Months Later...
Seriously, we shoot the shit out of this bitch.
- Cock shots?
- Cock shots.
We shot you in the balls!
Well, it's my job to get shot in the balls so..
Excuse me..
Didn't you use to work in the Bean-N-Gone coffee shop?
I sure shit hope this pays better, I tell you.
So why don't they just shoot you with a puck?
- What do you mean?
- I mean, what does paintball gotta do with hockey?
Nothing, I guess..
So, ain't no prices or..?
In the balls.
Yeah, they sure are.
It's a living though..
Oh, you get the checks I've been senting you?
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Well, I didn't save you from the brutal tongue lashing though, huh?
Well, you know, the wife never found out about the camera, cause
- I payed off the bills.
- How did you manage that?
- Because now I'm rich.
- No way!
- The post office fucking settled?
- Hundred and sixty large, son.
Nice man!
Congratulations.
It's a beautiful day, thank you very much.
- I thought you made that all thing up.
It's very real, you can believe it.
No, she's spending off.
Well, since you ain't gonna ask me..
I just go ahead and tell you..
No, I have not seen Miri.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.
Oh.
I suppose you weren't gonna ask about your movie either.
Look, that's why I came down here, cause
I need you to come and take a look at it.
- I'm not interested, man
- Well, you better get interested,
Cause you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?
- The story doesn't make sense.
- The story?
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?
It's a movie, dog.
And a movie's gotta have an ending.
- Which we don't have at the moment.
- Credits.
- There's your fucking ending.
- Do me this favor, okay?
When you're done getting your nuts blown off, come back to humble Mornoewill to my crib for couple hours.
Check out the flick, you tell me what's missing.
I'll tell you what.
You do that, you don't know me shit no more.
- Really?
- Really.
- Is your wife home?
- Yes.
Maybe I should leave the patch on, huh?
You got some extra ones?
- Hey honey.
- Where the fuck you've been?
- And who the fuck is this now?
- Would you calm down woman?
God damn!
You already left one white boy down in my basement.
What if that mother fucker was grabby on me?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
- Oh, what in the fuck was that supposed to mean?
!
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you!
- White boys love me!
White boy?
- I said white boy!
- Yeah?
- You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?
- Should I say yes?
- Say yes.
- Yes.
Why don't you uh..?
Head down stairs..
- It's through this hall way.
- Nice to meet you.
You too.
What the fuck are you looking at?
Why you gotta be up in here yelling at me in front of my director?
- Oh, he's the director?
- Yeah.
I didn't know he's the director.
Okay, well, why don't he direct my ass into a new mother fucking husband.
How about that shit?
Oh, don't nobody want them saggy ass balls!
- Saggy balls?
Look how saggy ass titties you got run around here?
Oh, then mother fucker we match!
Oh shit.
- Where's my paintball gun at?
- Look at you, editor and DP
You got your shit covered, man
Please, don't ever say shit covered to me again.
Roll the film for the man please, so we can see what he thinks.
Just jump to it though, I ain't gotta all night.
The bitch is on me.
Nigga Rich Productions, classy
- Yeah, Dream Works was taken.
- Was it?
Plus it sounds like underground gay fuck club.
"I met a guy at Dream Works" Yeah.
Alright, so we got Lester and Stacey fucking.
And then we got Barry and Bubbles fucking.
And then this boring bullshit.
Okay, just go to the next scene would you?
- Ah, what next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?
- We never shot it.
- Why not?
Because, after you left that night
Miri came out of the back room and said she couldn't do it.
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped?
So..
- Wait..
So Miri..?
- Never fucked nobody.
Just you.
Now, I wonder why she did that.
You see, there was the time when I was just a bitter old fuck
Making coffees.
And stacey was just a lap dancer.
And Barry and Bubbles didn't know each other.
And this fool here, hell, I don't even know what he was!
- A white supremacist.
- Ah, fuck you.
Then two people come along
And showed us something, we didn't know existed.
A world of possibilities
Where plain old people, just like us
Can do something special.
Even if it's someone filming people fucking.
Sometimes..
We just need someone to show us something
We can't see for ourselves.
And it will change for ever.
So as you can see, our movie ain't got no ending.
And every movie needs an ending, don't it?
Thanks.
Delaney, you're a slick cupid mother fucker
Ain't love grand?
- Why the fuck is this white boy doing in our God damn house?
Sometimes.
- No, get out!
- I'm sorry..
Close the door for once.
- It was closed over
- Just close the fucking door, Zack
I never slept with Stacey that night, okay?
I swear to God.
But when we got into my room, you know what we did?
We talked about you
And us
And how things were different and how I was too much of a fucking pussy
To just tell you how I felt about you.
And I know, I know that's only because of all the stupid shit we said about how we wouldn't let sex change us, but it did
It changed me.
That has to be love, right?
It has to be love, and..
Just so you know, I can't go back being just friends anymore because..
I just can't.
And I think you feel the same way.
Because that night after I left, you didn't fuck Lester
What's up, Zack?
You know what?
I do not care that you're fucking Lester, okay?
How's that?
Because I don't wanna be with anyone but you
So I will wait for ever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life.
Because I love you and I have for as long as I can remember
And I would rather die than be without you, Miriam Linky.
Miri's lastname is Linky?
You're gonna fuck a guy who doesn't know your lastname?
Or that you beat Cole Rothen in the sixth grade?
- I know that
Or what your senior prom dress would've looked like, had we gone, but we decided not to and we got drunk alone instead.
Or that you wash your hair in the toilet.
- We're not fucking, Zack
- Or that you're not fucking Zack
- What?
- Yeah I mean, I asked her to fuck me but she wouldn't do it.
Then I even tried to talk her in to give me the fucking Dutch Rider
Shut me down on that, too.
- And the Dutch Rider is..?
- You don't know what Dutch Rider is?
Oh look, you grab your dick, and then you have someone else work you arm
Let me show you
You grab my arm, I'll grab my dick You grab my arm now work it.
Work my arm.
See that shit?
Work it up and down.
See?
It's like someone else striking you off.
And of course, there's the double Dutch Rider.
Which I grab my dick, you grab your dick, you work my arm, I'll work your arm.
Same time
Same time, it's like jerking off together but not gay
We're not touching dicks
Each other's dicks anyway, I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.
It feels good.
Try me, come on.
Sorry to change the subject on you Lester, but
If you're not fucking Miri, why is your dick out right now?
Cause I live here now and I like to be naked.
- Huh?
When you moved out, she couldn't afford to pay the rent by herself so I moved in to help.
- But who's keeping her room?
That's my room now, she moved in your old room.
She changed rooms?
Yeah, she said she did it, cause she missed the smell of yours or some shit.
I don't smell anything.
But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.
- Goodnight, Zack
- Good night
Do you?
- Why are you crying?
- Because I missed you so much!
I love you.
- I love you, I love you
- I love you
I don't mean to alarm you, but I think I just jerked off Lester a little bit.
- The Dutch Rider?
- Yeah, it's genius, right?
If you ask me that, I say I will Dutch Rider you for the rest of our lives.
Oh, good.
I'm getting tired of fucking the flash light.
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.
- How did it feel like?
- Feels like fucking a flash light.
You little motherfucker!
Get up, Zack.
Come on, I don't wanna be late for work.
Ahh!
Get out!
- Jesus, fuck!
Close the door if you're gonna take a shit.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over, it was not closed.
- Close the door, Zack!
- Okay, okay.
God.
- Fine.
- What's that thing?
- It's a hand warmer.
We're going now.
- You smell that?
Is that the car?
Fuck.
- Oh, goddamn it.
- What?
What?
- Oh, it's wedged in my taint.
- What is?
- It got wedged in my taint.
- What?
- It's stuck under my balls.
- It's between my balls and my leg.
- What's happening?
- Please, pull over.
Pull the fuck over!
- All right, all right!
Jesus, all right!
It's about to move up to my ass.
- What?
The movement makes it hotter.
It's tucked under them.
It's stuck under them.
Oh, fuck.
I think I burned my ball hair off.
It's not funny.
Can you help me pick out an outfit for tonight?
I'm working till 6.
- Well, I can try stuff on at the store.
- The store?
No, how about instead, you get a friend?
But you are my friend.
I mean a girl friend, jeez.
Mr. Delaney, can you work for me tomorrow?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
Then you must come in the next day, I tell you.
- It's Black Friday.
- Black Friday?
It's the biggest mall-shopping day of the year.
And since the mall is just up the street, I would like you to come out and work.
- On Black Friday.
- Oh, yeah.
All right, you want me to work on Moolie Monday too?
- I'm sorry?
- How about Nigga Tuesday?
- Nigga Tuesday?
Is this a new holiday?
- You come to a brother and tell him he gotta work on Black Friday.
You got any idea how racist that sounds?
Telling me to work.
What, you think you own me?
- I never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?
You thought,
"I'm gonna lay down the law for this nigga, I put food on his table, clothes on his nigga baby backs, and he ain't gonna say shit."
- This ain't Amistad.
- You shut up.
You goddamn right this ain't Amistad.
I can't wait till the post office settles my disability suit because then I'm gonna be out this motherfucker.
I'm gonna be Oprah rich.
Y'all can kiss my ass.
You know what?
Fuck you.
Fuck you, and suck cock.
- To hell with you.
- To hell with you.
- Zachary will work.
Zack, my boy.
- Yeah.
- The customer with the harelip...
- Oh, yeah.
- speak me, say you were playing baseball here the other night.
Wiffle ball.
And, uh, no, that wasn't me.
Maybe the harelip makes it sound like "baseball."
Yeah, maybe you hear with an accent.
- Fuck you, okay?
- Okay.
One day, I'm gonna put a camera over there, and then I can tell...
I'll know everything you do when I'm gone.
Everything.
Scratch your balls, take a shit, everything, I tell you, okay?
Okay.
Fucker.
I hate both of you ebony and ivory motherfuckers, I tell you.
- Why is he so fucking high-strung?
- "Fuck off, I tell you.
Very good."
Can you believe that Gandhi motherfucker, telling me I gotta work on Black Friday?
Ain't that some shit?
- Yeah.
- Like I don't wanna do shopping.
Biggest sales day of the year.
I'm getting a flat-screen TV, believe that.
That's my fault, I should tell you.
I asked for Friday morning off, I'm sorry.
- For what?
- I actually need a lot of recovery time.
Tonight is me and Miri's ten-year high school reunion.
I'm just gonna get fucking alcohol poisoning.
- Reunion?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
- Isn't that fucked up that they do that?
They say it's the best chance to get everyone together.
People come back in town for the holidays.
But they could have it in the middle of the summer at a blowjob contest that I was judging, and it would still be retarded.
- So why you going, then?
- Miri's making me go.
Why you always bending over backwards for that girl,
- knowing she ain't giving up no ass?
- We got a good thing going.
She pays half the rent, does dishes, she wakes me up in the morning.
Why complicate that with sex?
Besides, man, I've known her since the first grade.
You don't fuck someone you met in the first grade.
Excuse me, I met my wife in kindergarten.
We got married senior year, and she has been the queen of my world ever since.
- What if you could do it all over again?
- I'd jerk off and live by myself.
That woman is the bane of my existence.
- See?
- Excuse me, can I get a coffee, black?
Can't you see we talking, white?
If you're gonna continue to emasculate me with this Barbie dress-up shit,
I'm using your laptop.
Don't forget to smack it when you turn it on, otherwise the screen doesn't come on.
Why don't you spring and get a new one?
Same reason I don't spring for clothes for tonight, I'm broke.
There's a chick who works at Teen Juice at the mall, you know.
I gave her a good deal on yarn,
- so she's letting me borrow this stuff.
- Yo, bro.
What?
- You're buying a vibrator online.
- What's wrong with the one you have?
- It died last week.
Look at the size of those fucking panties.
Shoot that shit.
Shoot it.
My God, who even knew Amazon sold shit like this?
This is incredible.
- Those are fucking granny panties.
- Okay,
A, I don't appreciate you violating the sanctity of my Amazon Wish List page, and B, I'm not buying that thing from Amazon, because it turns out I don't have a credit card they take.
- Oh, shit.
- I'm sorry, guys.
Am I in the way?
You're a fucking faggot, all right?
Let's go to Starbucks.
- He's a shitty barista anyways.
- Cock.
- And he throws like a bitch.
- You know what else I throw?
My nut sack in your coffees, so how did that taste, fucker?
We saw your girlfriend in her underwear, cunt nugget.
Well, too bad she's not my girlfriend, you little fuck...
Oh, they're gone.
Are you still talking to me?
Uh, just said, I'm gonna look up more fuck toys on Amazon.
Oh, holy shit.
- They sell the Fleshlight here too.
- What's that?
It's a fucking pocket pussy that is shaped like a flashlight
"for discretionary jacking off."
That way if you get caught, no one thinks it's weird.
You're just a guy who likes to fuck his flashlight.
I am totally buying this shit.
Whoa, if you've got money to burn, how about paying the electric bill?
- That's due already?
- November's is probably due now, but I was talking about September's.
Tell me this doesn't rock.
You kind of look like Ronald McDonald.
That makes me want some McNuggets.
Why would you wanna buy a pocket pussy anyway?
That is so sad.
What?
Excuse me, I forgot about the nobility that accompanies coming with a fucking vibrator.
Think a kid in Darfur gets saved every time a vibrator makes you come?
No.
- "Real feel action"?
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
If you start fucking machines, I'm moving out.
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a machine.
How come you get to fuck something with a motor in it?
I've never met a man who can make me come like a vibrator does.
That's bullshit.
You get to be Buck Rogers having sex in the 25th century with fucking Twiki and Dr. Theopolis.
I'm stuck to a bottle of Jergens in the bathroom.
Holy bejesus.
You do not use my Jergens to jack it in our bathroom.
No, you know what I do actually, is I light a bunch of candles and I sprawl out on my sheets and I listen to Sting.
No, I'm a guy.
Give me two Popsicle sticks and a rubber band,
I'll find a way to fuck it, like a filthy MacGyver.
Oh, my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.
How about this?
I don't get why you're putting so much effort into this thing.
I thought we were just gonna go to sit around and make fun of everybody.
I can't wear anything that I already own and expect to bring home Bobby Long.
Bobby fucking Long?
No way.
Didn't that guy call you "Stinky Linky"?
Yeah, that was then, okay?
Maybe now he can save me a fortune in Amazon bills.
Maybe you can fuck our landlord so we can at least keep a roof over our heads.
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.
Hey, I bought skates with last week's paycheck and I need those to skate with.
And this week's will barely cover the past two water bills, so...
Is this sexy?
Yeah, in like a To Catch a Predator kind of way, it is pretty fucking sexy.
Then we're done.
What the fuck?
Zack.
- You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?
- They shut it off.
- Oh, shit.
Just...
Help me get this shit out of my hair.
Just use the water out of the toilet.
- There's poo in there.
- Not that part.
- The back part of the toilet thing.
- Oh, that makes sense.
Take the cup there and then scoop it in, there you go.
Here, I'll lean back and you can just, you know, pour it down like...
Like that.
You're harshing my buzz, you know.
This is so lame.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Whoa!
All right, one hour tops, then we're gone.
Or I had an idea.
We could just not go at all, which would rock.
Even though we're broke and we've never amounted to anything, we're still better than these people, right?
No.
Not at all.
We're probably not even as good as most of them, unless one of them is a crackhead or something.
Just tell me I'm prettier than when we graduated.
You look about the same.
Definitely not prettier, but around the same.
I'm thinner, though, right?
A little?
Not really.
Well, good pep talk.
Fuck.
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.
- You don't recognize us, do you?
- Um, no, sorry.
Zack Brown, Miri Linky.
Were you the one they called Stinky Linky?
Oh, no, no one ever called me that.
- Great.
What does yours say?
- What the fuck?
Come on.
- I'm sure I had a nickname.
Nothing?
- All right, you have a great time, and before you go, don't forget your copy of The Roving Roe-Ver.
What the fuck's this shit?
That is not shit, that would be our bi-monthly newsletter.
- Awesome.
- It updates you
- on what everyone's doing.
- Finally.
I love your enthusiasm.
Here you go.
Write your e-mail address on that and I'll be sure to add you to our 800-member-strong mailing list.
We had 800 people in our graduating class?
Yes, and only 250 R.S.V.P.'d.
Doesn't that suck, Mary?
- Miri.
- You married, Bets?
- I am.
Two kids.
- Wow, that's beautiful.
- Awesome.
- You wanna fuck me later?
- Uh, no, I'm married.
- Okay, cool.
If you change your mind,
- I'll be in there getting shitfaced.
- He will.
- Just so you know, I eat the pussy.
- He does.
Ah, tempting.
Again, no.
- Shall we?
- Sir.
Bye, Bets.
Think about it.
Enjoy.
Can I get two beers, please?
You want a beer?
- Yeah.
- Three beers.
- Thank you.
- Here you go.
Is that Zack?
Or am I Zack?
- Never gets old, huh?
- The other Zack.
Oh, in my world, nobody calls me "the other Zack,"
now that this guy's not around anymore, huh?
- Get the fuck off of me.
- There can be only one.
- What?
- Highlander, man?
The Kurgan.
Remember?
I'd yell it at you whenever we passed each other in the hallway?
Like it was yesterday, man.
Awesome.
Awesome.
Awesome.
God, you guys have so much to catch up on.
Whoo.
- No.
- I'm gonna let you get to it.
Bitch.
Have you seen that big blowup picture they have of me?
Yeah, it's...
My hair is terrible.
I can't believe I even wore my hair like that.
That's before I knew about styling products, you know.
It makes a big difference in life.
But you live and learn, though, right?
I mean, ten years ago, Pittsburgh, who knew anything about fashion?
Back in the day, our hairstyle, oh...
Hey, stranger.
- Whoa.
Stinky Linky.
- Yeah.
Although it's just Miri now.
- Give me a hug.
- Oh, okay.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- How have you been?
- Great, great.
- Yeah?
- You look fantastic.
Wow, that is not something that you would have said to me ten years ago.
- Well, I've grown up.
- Yes.
Yes, you have.
You just look...
Ooh, heh, heh.
- Well, listen to you.
Thank you.
- No, don't thank me, just fuck me.
Roxanne.
Hey.
Someone I like, what are the odds, huh?
Zack Brown, we had four years of Spanish together.
Why does no one recognize me?
- Am I thinner?
Is that it?
- Look at him.
- Who?
- My stupid husband.
No fucking shit.
John Butterfield?
You actually married John Butterfield?
- That's amazing.
- Don't ever get married.
It sucks.
You stop appreciating each other and run out of shit to talk about after the first year.
But look at him now, chatty as fuck.
Flirting up a storm with that cheerleader nimrod Monica Von.
You want me to maybe flirt with you so he can see it, even it up a bit?
I don't wanna get even.
If I was gonna do anything, I'd wanna one-up the asshole.
You can give me a handjob in the girls' locker room.
- Fine, but make it fast.
- Fuck, yeah.
Are you staying in town for a while or...?
Just tonight.
I fly back to L.A. tomorrow.
L.A., wow, Los Angeles.
Gosh, Bobby Long, coming up in the world.
- With Mrs. Long, I bet, huh?
- No, no, no.
No Mrs. Long for me.
- Then can I be honest with you?
- Sure.
Um...
Whew.
I think I need a drink.
Do you need a drink?
Because I need a drink to say this.
- I've got a beer already, so...
- Oh, great, thank you.
I think there's a cigarette butt in there.
Yup.
Sorry about the elbow.
There can be only one.
Can I get a beer, please?
Thank you very much.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
My friend's making an ass of herself hitting on her high school crush.
Oh, God, that's so sad.
It's so Miri, is what it is.
I'm Zack, by the way.
Brandon.
Don't worry, we weren't in the same class or anything.
- Okay.
Lucky you.
- Are you a Monroe-ver?
Well, I went here, let's just leave it at that, I guess.
Do you have one of the large blown-up pictures of your younger self
- hanging around here?
- I do, kind of.
Right there.
Gorgeous.
- Good times.
What do you do?
What brings you here?
I came with somebody who went to school here.
- Really?
- Bobby Long.
No shit.
That's who my friend's hitting on right now.
See right there?
- Really.
- One dressed like Hannah Montana?
In L.A., we call that look "Nickelodeon chic."
- Wait, L. A.?
Los Angeles?
- California.
That's awesome, man.
What do you do out there?
- I'm an actor.
- Wow, that's really impressive.
- Thank you, thank you.
- In fucking movies?
"Fucking movies." Pretty much.
Look at you.
What...?
Anything I've seen?
What movies?
Oh, all sorts of movies with all-male casts.
All-male casts.
Like Glengarry Glen Ross?
Like that?
Like Glen and Gary Suck Ross, Meaty Cock and Drop Their Hairy Nuts in His Eager Mouth.
- Is that like a sequel?
- Sort of.
- It's a re-imagining.
- Oh, like The Wiz.
More erotic and with less women.
No women, to be exact.
I apologize in advance if I am out of line here, but are you in gay porn?
- Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?
- I thought you recognized me, that's...
- Oh, okay, I get it.
You're not in my demographic, so I'm not insulted.
- Not really.
Who's your demographic?
- Do you love pussy?
- I do.
- Then not you.
Oh, okay.
I came here tonight hoping to seduce you and bring you back to my apartment and sleep with you to, uh, get back at you, you know, for calling me Stinky Linky all those years ago.
That is a weird revenge plot.
- You must be a terrible lay for that.
- What?
No, I'm great.
I mean, I've had enough practice and everything.
That...
Wow, that sounded not good.
I fuck a lot.
That's what I meant to say.
That doesn't sound good either.
You're a lot funnier than I remember.
Thank you.
Gosh, you turned out to be such a nice guy.
It just...
You know, it makes it even easier to just...
To just say this.
Would you like to come back to my place and maybe open a bottle of wine and have ourselves a real high school reunion?
- I...
- Hello, Miriam.
Beat it, we're talking.
- I wanted to introduce you to Brandon.
- Salutations.
- Bobby's boyfriend.
- Bobby who?
- Bobby me.
- Bobby Long.
Brandon is the star of such adult fare as...
What was that one called again?
You Better Shut Your Mouth or I'm Gonna Fuck It.
That's right.
I'm surprised I forgot that.
Are you fucking with me?
No, they're fucking with each other.
Oh, my God.
- No.
- What?
Granny Panties?
- Excuse me?
- How can you tell?
This is so crazy.
I was literally just watching you, like, right before we got here.
This is so crazy.
This is you, right?
My name's Granny Panties, and nobody wants to fuck me.
Nothing's whiter than my big gay ass...
Where'd you get that?
Oh, I entered "gay" and "ass," and it was the top hit.
It's had 200,000 views in three hours.
Honey, you are, like...
I'm jealous right now because you're, like, super famous.
Baby, please take our picture.
I get a picture with Granny Panties.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is awesome.
- All right, smile.
Okay, got it.
- Did you get it?
- Oh, thank you very much.
- E-mail me that.
Oh, because he's the worst photographer.
Okay, good.
- You're gay?
- Yeah.
And I'm on the Internet wearing a diaper?
Who knew you'd come to Pittsburgh and meet a celebrity?
I'm gonna binge-drink now until I pass out.
Okay.
She'll be fine.
So you guys suck each other's cocks, huh?
Oh, like crazy.
Okay, that's enough, I think.
I'm embarrassing him.
I love when he's embarrassed.
He's not living out loud, so he gets all like, ooh.
- You are totally in love, aren't you?
- Zachary, we are.
Wow, I...
Oh, God, I just wanna eat him up, yum, yum.
Save some for me, yum, yum, yum.
- I can't keep my hands off him.
- You've had one too many.
Although he does most of the eating in the sack.
In the sack and of the sack.
All right, that's enough.
Look, you've drunk too much.
You do this every time.
You get too Mary for everybody in the room
- and you can't contain yourself.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
And by containing myself, do you mean containing myself in a closet?
In a closet of denial?
Is that...?
No, no, no.
Holy shit, this just got real.
This is exactly why you haven't met my mother.
You don't know how to ease people into this situation.
- You just force your way in every time.
- I thought, maybe for one second in this godforsaken town, I could be myself.
I'm so sorry.
No, you're right, I should just butch up and pretend that I don't love it when you shove your dick in my mouth.
- This is the best night of my life.
- Am I making a spectacle?
- I could make a much bigger scene.
- You really are.
I'm sorry.
Pittsburgh.
Listen up, Monroe-vers.
My name is Brandon St. Randy, and I love Bobby Long.
- Fucking A.
- Is that enough?
Is that enough of a scene?
I could start doing worse than that.
The reason you haven't taken me to your mother's...
Your mother with her makeup and all her drinking, she's in the closet too.
- They fight just like real people.
- I thought I'd be a conduit for you...
Thank you.
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm not.
- Thank you.
- I love you.
- I'll e-mail you.
- Zack, it was so nice to meet you.
And I will be patient with you.
I will be there on your journey.
I will be your Sherpa up the mountain of gayness.
Well, might as well see how many hits Granny Panties is up to, huh?
Did I do that?
Thanks, George.
What kind of evil fucks turn off your power the day...?
No, the night before Thanksgiving?
Who does that?
Can you get an advance on your card?
Fleshlight maxed-out my $200 limit.
Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.
This is bad.
If we don't come up with rent, we're gonna get locked out.
Who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.
Which means by the time we get home, there's no heat either.
Well, I think it's time we put what we always talked about into effect.
- You're gonna have to start hooking.
- You know, you jest, but these are the exact circumstances people find themselves in right before they start having sex for money.
- Yeah.
- Or making porn.
Oh, my God, yeah.
- What?
You got an idea?
We could make a porno.
- Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?
No, that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me?
That's a rad idea.
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend, he said he makes a hundred grand a year because he shoots and distributes his own porno flicks.
If it's so easy, how come everybody doesn't do it?
Because other people have options and dignity, which we do not have, which puts us in an amazingly advantageous position.
Fuck you, I have dignity.
Where?
Is it hidden in your gigantic underpants that are plastered all over the Internet?
Is that where you hide your dignity?
Every woman has a pair of those period panties.
That's, like, a fact.
Okay.
Families.
I bet people don't make porno, because they have families.
But luckily, your parents are dead.
Sorry.
My grandparents are dead.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
So who are we gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone mainstream now.
It's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks in it.
Look at Paris Hilton.
She throat-fucks a guy in night vision, now she's selling fragrances to tweens.
And I'm pretty sure she's legally retarded.
That's for tweens?
Have you seen that Joe Francis guy who made Girls Gone Wild?
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot piece of shit in the world and he has a jet and a fucking island.
Look, there's got to be a less extreme solution to our financial woes here.
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper route.
- I don't have a bike.
- Be a waiter.
No one wants me around their food.
Would you eat food that I gave you?
I would not eat food that you gave me, that's true.
I mean, nobody wants to see us fuck, Zack.
Everybody wants to see anybody fuck.
I hate Rosie O'Donnell, but if someone said, "I got a tape of Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid,"
I'd be like, "Why aren't we watching that right now?"
Because she's famous.
Hello.
So are you.
You're fucking Granny Panties.
My underwear and your ass are famous, we're not.
So who the F would wanna watch us fuck?
- At least 800 people.
- The jerks we went to school with?
- Are you serious?
- Of course.
If you heard that someone we graduated with was in a fucking porno movie, you'd watch it, right?
I'd watch that guy Brandon suck a cock, I just met him.
With this mailing list, we have almost a thousand people that would definitely buy a porno we were in just to be like,
"Hey, I sat next to that guy in Civics.
Look at his fucking dick."
We sell a thousand copies at 20 bucks a pop, bam, we have paid off our bills.
So, what do you think?
- I don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.
Oh, wow, like you've never done that before.
How many guys have you met in a bar, taken home, banged with your mouth and then never talked to again?
That's what we call a stranger.
Dude, I don't one-night mouth-fuck anybody that I pick up in bars.
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in the porno movie for some weird reason.
I guess...
We could fuck.
- Ew.
- Fuck you.
I mean, you're a nice-enough-looking guy and everything...
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're an all-right-enough-looking girl.
- How does that feel?
- Dude, I'm just saying it'd be weird and wrong, you know, like fucking my brother.
Okay, seriously, we're just talking about sex, okay?
It's for a purpose.
It's for getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.
- Wow.
- Just explain to your private beforehand,
"Look, this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash."
- Oh, my God.
- What?
You're just doing this because you've always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?
Yes.
I've gone my whole life pretending that I want nothing to do with you, just hoping one day we'd be in such dire financial straits that I could use it to finally make my move on you.
You're just being sarcastic.
- I am.
See, I was pretending to cry right there.
I guess it's not like it'd be creepy, like if we got way too drunk one night and accidentally fucked, you know?
No.
We'd be going in with the understanding that it's...
A business decision.
Strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.
- Right.
- And by end,
I mean, I'll be waxing your ass.
Fuck you.
I'm not even letting you see my ass.
I've seen your ass and the rest of you naked around a billion times already.
- That goes both ways, buddy.
- You've never seen my dick.
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.
Are you kidding?
That party we went to where you got blasted, and Houls dared you to give yourself head, and we all watched you try for, like, an hour.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks by the way, for fucking letting me do that.
Thank you.
Oh, God.
We really do know too much about each other.
See, and this would really just be one more thing.
I mean, look at us.
It's Thanksgiving and we're huddled around a flaming fucking garbage can like a couple of steno bums.
I mean, this could give us a chance to pay off our debt, pay our bills, get a fucking nicer apartment with heat in it maybe.
What are you doing?
Miriam Linky, will you have sex with me on camera for money?
I will.
A producer?
- Yeah.
- Guy who gets to finance the movie.
- You think I got that kind of money?
We just need that.
What you're about to spend on the flat screen.
Now I can't get my flat screen?
Fuck that.
No, no, no.
With your cut of the profits, you're gonna get two flat screens.
One in your living room, one in your bathroom.
One in the bathroom?
You know, it's always been my dream to watch shit while I shit.
Everyone with an ass loves to watch shit while they shit.
- I'm gonna make that happen for you.
- I don't know, man.
What else the producer do?
- Um, they help with the casting.
- What's casting?
Finding the people to be in the movie.
- I get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.
Like, I can look at a titty, make sure there ain't no moles on there?
- You can look at both titties, man.
- Man.
I've been looking at the same busted titties for the past almost 20 years.
- I'm due for another new titty.
- Please help us.
Please.
Please.
Yes.
Yes.
I love you.
Well, don't mind that smell.
We had some homeless people squatting in here.
You know, they'd void their bowels everywhere but the bathroom.
Anyway, you pick up the poop and you've got yourself a movie studio.
Why don't we shoot in your apartment?
No power.
You wanna pay our electric bill?
- You motherfuckers...
- We'll take it.
Bring it back.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, God.
Come on.
Why the fuck do I have to do everything?
Fuckers.
Hey, what is that?
Fucking guys.
This fucking team, man.
They fucking suck.
I'm gonna hatefuck the shit out of you, ref.
- Dude.
- It's cool.
- He's my cousin.
- Hey.
Didn't you used to videotape the varsity basketball games in high school?
Just the away games.
I did it because I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.
Which one?
Whichever one wanted to fuck the guy who taped the varsity games.
- Aw.
- Still know how to work a camera?
- Who cares what the title is?
- The porn I liked when I was a kid, it was always, like, a spoof of a popular movie, you know?
Like, um, Edward Penishands.
Okay, so we need a mildly clever, vaguely dirty title, that sounds like a real movie
- and sums up what you're gonna see.
- Correct.
An American Werewolf in Brenda?
Fuckback Mountain?
- Too soon?
A Cock-in-Lips Now?
- Next.
Cradle the balls.
Work the shaft.
Jerk my come-crayon and let me color you white.
I need cock and I need it now.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
It's "puss" as in pussy.
Oh, because I was like, who would wanna fuck puss?
I want to slam my ham in your can, woman.
Scene.
- This guy is amazing.
- This guy's great-looking too.
I wanna fuck him.
Hi, my name's Delaney and I'm a producer.
I really don't know what it means.
I'm gonna be honest, this is my first time.
You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna touch you or nothing like that.
- All right.
- I have a wife, you know.
We're happy.
I mean, not happy, but it's cool, you know.
Just so you know, there will be some fucking.
- We'll talk about that if you get the part.
- Okay.
I mean, not...
We won't be fucking, there'll be fucking in the movie.
Like I said, I got a wife.
She don't play that shit.
- She is a crazy bitch.
- Yep.
It's my job as the producer to see what you got.
So if that makes you uncomfortable in any way, you don't have to show me anything you don't wanna show me, because...
I love the movies.
- Lawrence of a Labia.
- No.
- Oh, come on.
- Dawn of the Dick.
Yeah, but how are zombies doing it at all sexy?
I want to eat your brain and your ass.
- Dude.
- Sci-fi.
Yeah.
Close Encounters With a Turd From Behind.
- I don't know what that means.
- Just asses.
Fucking deep in asses.
What?
We're making a porno and we just need to know what you would be or would not be interested in doing.
If anything.
- No anal.
- Oh, definitely no anal.
Anal and hugging.
I don't do ass stuff.
- Anal.
- Ah, fuck.
- Oh, wait, oral.
I like anal.
- Yay.
Okay, well, so, uh, do you have any special skills?
Special skills?
I can get a boner really quick and it sticks straight up.
- Is that really a special skill?
- I think.
- Can you show us what you mean?
- Sure.
Oh, that is special.
Yeah, you're hired, Mr...
- Who are you again?
- Lester.
Lester "The Molester" Cockinshtuff.
No.
That is the best porn name I've ever heard, man.
I can have a porn name?
- Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.
Are you Granny Panties?
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The panties are actually in the house.
- I'll get them.
- Whoa.
The Wrath of Cunt.
- We never made a Star Sex 1.
I guess we can lose Star Sex 3:
The Search for Cock, then.
- Cocunt.
- What's that?
It's Cocoon with a cunt.
So Delaney tells us you have a special talent of some sort.
I don't know if I'd call it a special talent, but it's a little something I picked up doing bachelor parties.
It would probably be easier if I just showed you.
- Great.
- The floor is yours.
So a movie, huh?
That could be fun.
Holy fuck.
Her name's Bubbles.
- Invasion of the Potty-Snatchers?
- That's like MAD Magazine stupid.
Well, fuck you, okay?
You try to think of a good sci-fi porno title.
It's hard.
There's gotta be one we haven't thought of that would say it all, not be ridiculously filthy and off-putting, and still have instant recognition with our audience.
- I got it.
- I got it.
- Star Whores.
- Yeah.
It's funny, right?
See, we figured this opens us up to an even bigger sales market beyond the people we went to school with.
People who like comics and sci-fi.
Comics?
Like "Ziggy"?
"Ziggy"?
Is that even in fucking papers anymore?
No, man.
Fuck you. "Ziggy" is a comic, right next to "Family Circus."
No, like Spider-Man and shit, you know?
There's always a shitload of Star Wars nerds at those comic-book shows.
So we sell them a Princess Leia they can really fucking jerk off to.
- That'd be me, Princess Lay-Her.
- Who am I playing?
You, my friend, are the lead role of Lubed Guy-Baller.
Man, he's gonna be balling dudes?
I thought you said this was boys on girls.
If I have to fuck a guy, okay, but I'd rather fuck a girl.
What's wrong with you, boy?
- We'll change the name to Sky-Baller.
- Sky-Baller.
I will be Hung So-low.
Delaney, my friend, you are On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
Man, I can't be in no porno.
My wife will kill me.
Hump me, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
You're my only hump.
On the other hand, fuck my wife.
Unfortunately, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over does not have any sex in the movie but the droids do, l-CUP and R2-T-Bag.
I robot.
And Stacey over here is gonna play Darth Vibrator.
- I'm the bad guy?
- She's not a guy, Zack.
I know that because I'm not a fucking idiot.
In our movie, Darth Vibrator is a bad girl who wants to fuck the galaxy, literally, and it's up to Lubed and Hung to stop her with their cocks.
- You and me get to have sex, then?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- I know.
Isn't that awesome?
Hold up, hold up.
So who's all having sex with who in this movie?
As of last night, I was having sex with Zack.
What?
Han Solo ain't never had no sex with Princess Leia in the Star Wars.
Guys, this isn't a literal adaptation here.
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.
Kind of like The Wiz or like a parody.
With lots of anal.
- Cool.
- I know, isn't that awesome?
I have a question, do Princess Lay-Her and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?
Uh, no, because they're brother and sister, and according to Miri, brothers and sisters can't fuck.
But you said, that this wasn't a literal translation, so that means Lester's character could have sex with Miri's character.
Because I would love to fucking eat her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.
Dream on, pal, it's never gonna happen, okay?
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See, she's fine...
Wait, what?
Yep.
I mean, everyone else is having sex with more than one person in this movie all of a sudden, so I think it's, you know, not fair if I'm only fucking you.
Guys, read amongst yourselves, okay?
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Look, Miri, we got plenty of sex going on in this thing, you don't have to do that.
Zack, it's fine.
I mean I have slept with way worse-looking guys than Lester.
I just wanna do my part for the movie like everyone else.
You're having sex in the movie, you don't need to fuck someone else.
- You're good.
- I'm only fucking you, though.
So don't we need to vary it up to keep it fair?
Fair for...?
I don't...
What?
Fair for who?
What are these, blood diamonds we're talking about?
Fair for everyone else who is fucking more than one person, a.k.a. you, in the movie.
- I mean, fine...
- All right.
I mean, if you don't care...
I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
Fuck.
I don't give a shit.
Like you said, you know, you've fucked bigger idiots than Lester.
Holy shit.
Are we really gonna shoot this in outer space?
Maybe not bigger idiots.
Thank you.
- Cut.
All right, guys, that's it.
- Yeah.
Make sure you leave your costume so we know they're here for tomorrow.
Mostly, everybody, thank you so much for helping us get ready, you know.
Cleaning this place out, building the sets, sewing the costumes, it's just...
I mean, it's really amazing.
Thank you.
Seriously, thanks.
But this is just the beginning, guys.
If Star Whores works, and it will, we are set up for sequels galore.
The Empire Strikes Ass.
- Return of the Brown-Eye.
- The Phantom Man-Ass.
And Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter.
- Okay.
- Revenge of the Shit.
- You got it?
- Yeah, no, we got it.
Ew.
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.
- We'll talk about that one.
We're gonna have a lot of fun, but more importantly, we're gonna make a lot of fucking money, okay?
- Yeah.
- So get ready for greatness, people.
Tomorrow we start principal photography.
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
- All right, good night, you guys.
- We got a movie.
- What?
- Nothing.
I think someone should acknowledge how insane and amazing this is
- and it's all because of you.
- I don't know.
It's just a porno.
You know what I mean.
You've really come into your own.
Shut the fuck up.
So speaking of coming into things, ready for tomorrow?
Twenty years, we're finally gonna know what it's like to have sex with each other.
You say that like you've been wondering what it'd be like to sleep with me for a while now.
Why the fuck do you think I started hanging out with you?
I knew it.
Here, help.
Let's just promise that it's not gonna change anything between us, okay?
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Some guys can't keep sex in perspective.
If anyone's gotta keep this in perspective, it's you, okay?
I don't want you getting all mushy and gooey on me after I give you the best orgasm you've ever had.
Oh, like you know what you're doing down there at all.
I actually don't.
Where's the clitoris?
Is it in your ass?
Just, you know, make sure you kind of whoop it up and act like I'm a stud who knows what he's doing, okay?
Just be a pal.
Oh, dude, I am gonna Meryl Streep the fuck out of this tomorrow, you watch.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
No.
Really, thank you.
For everything.
You're welcome.
Less than 12 hours and we make Monroeville history.
- I really hope nothing goes wrong.
- It's a movie.
What could go wrong?
What are you doing?
What's up?
- What the fuck?
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait.
- Wait.
- Stop.
Stop.
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck is going on?
Condos is what's going on, as soon as this shit-hole's demo'd.
No, you gotta stop it right now.
We rented this place for a month from Mr. Jenkins.
Sounds like your Mr. Jenkins was full of shit.
Luxury Homesteads bought this place a month ago.
I'm gonna kill that lying old fuck.
You're gonna have to go Florida, that's where he moved.
We've got thousands of dollars of equipment in there.
- Please.
- If you wanna sift through this rubble when we're done, be my guest.
Hey, get that fucking beam down.
This is the last thing you wanna hear.
If you don't get an advance,
I don't think we're gonna keep a roof over our heads.
I got an advance already.
It went into all the costumes.
- So all our money's gone?
- All your money?
Never mind what my wife's gonna do when there ain't no new snow tires, or when she sees I charged a video camera.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this, man.
I just wanted to see some free titties.
That's all.
But there's no such thing as free titties, is there, Zack?
- Is there?
- Fuck this noise.
Why don't we get another camera, and shoot something else?
Where are we gonna do that?
Got another sound stage?
Sound stage?
We had a shit-covered garage we turned into a sound stage.
We find someplace new and we do it again.
How?
Okay, I'm broke, man.
No, make that, I was broke.
Now I am really tapped out.
I have to get another job to pay Delaney back.
So please tell me, how can I afford to start over?
- What can I get you?
- Yeah, can I get a, uh...?
Too fucking late.
Cappuccino, 3.50.
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
I mean, I'm a total loser in every single other aspect of my life.
What made me think I could do something as simple as filming people fucking?
We have no money left, nowhere to shoot, no sets, we have no fucking cameras.
Here.
It's time I go back to my regular life where I am a quiet fuckup who doesn't cost anybody any money and knows his goddamn position behind this fucking counter making cappuccinos for this fucking guy.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Fuck, yes.
Zack.
You sneaky Indian motherfucker.
I tell you, yes.
Swallow My Cockuccino.
- What?
- That's it.
That's the movie.
Why didn't I think of it before?
We don't need sets or a stage.
Look at all this production value, waiting to have balls on it.
Hold up.
You wanna shoot a dirty movie here, where we work?
Yes.
Fuck, yes, I do.
You know how many stories I have from working here?
How many times I've been laid right there after hours?
You've never gotten laid here after hours.
I know.
Thank you for reminding me.
But I always wish I had, and that's what porno is.
It's fantasy.
It's taking the normal and making it abnormal by fucking it.
Don't do that.
The little dog don't like that.
How did you get a camera?
By being a terrible, untrustworthy employee, that's how.
Give me today, I'll bang out a script.
Meet me back here after closing.
We're gonna launch arching ropes of jism all over this motherfucker.
Peace.
I like that guy but if he tries to fuck that little dog tonight for real,
I'm calling the Humane Society.
It's called Bean-N-Gone, so get the fuck out of here.
Hey, Barry.
Stand by, Stace, picture's up.
- Okay.
Roll tape.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 12, Take 1.
And action.
I'd like a double espresso so I can stay up all night because I'm in the mood to fuck.
Well, I am a whore-ista, so I love to fuck.
Would you like to fuck me?
Holy fuck.
You mean, after you're done with your shift?
I mean during my shift.
- Sorry.
- Keep going, keep going.
With your shaft.
Let us fuck.
Cue music.
Okay, open up to camera, guys.
Let us see it.
More tongue.
Little less tongue.
Oh, that was good.
Cue effects.
Oh, yeah, like that.
Oh, yeah.
See, I told you it would work.
Didn't I tell you?
It looks amazing.
It's incredible.
Oh, the beans hurt.
Easy.
- Move in for coverage.
- Nice.
That's why we got him.
- Nice.
I'm impressed.
- Get in there, Deacon.
- Come on.
- Like that?
Like that.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
- Pull out a bit, actually.
- That's hot.
No, not you, Lester.
Put it back in.
Kiss the muscle.
- I kiss the muscle.
- You kiss the muscle.
- Can he slap her ass a little?
- Don't be a fucking pervert, dude.
- Stir, come on.
Stir.
- Yeah, stir it.
Stir it, baby.
Hey.
- Holy.
- Shit.
Are you guys still open?
No.
We close at 9.
I need coffee so I'm drive home.
- Okay.
Yeah.
- Thank you.
That's a cute kitty.
Okay.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You guys see the game?
I was at it.
Fucking Roethlisberger, the quarterback, was all fucking,
"Hug it, chug it, football.
All night." Heh-heh.
Okay, pal, here you go.
On the house.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Have a good one.
- Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- I said, have a good one.
- Okay.
Keep moving.
- You and your little dog.
Go Steelers.
Action.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, like that.
Oh, fuck it, chuck it, football.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, God, this is good.
You take it.
You take it.
Take it, Barry.
Oh, take it.
Take it, Barry.
Take it.
I'm disturbed at how turned on I am by this.
- Shit, dude, it's almost 6.
- Oh, fuck.
Okay, that's a wrap, everybody, yeah.
Let's give a hand to our hotties with the bodies from last night.
Stacey, Lester, Bubbles, Barry, whoo.
Yeah.
- Nice.
Okay, when we come back tonight, we finish up the venti-vulva scene, and then we get into me and Miri's stuff.
Again, amazing first night, everybody.
Thank you so much.
Let us fuck.
- Hey, how'd it look?
- How do you think it looked?
It looked like shit going into other shit, in focus.
What an artist.
That was Kurosawa's motto. "Shit going into other shit."
Oh, man, I can't believe you gotta work now.
It's okay.
You know, honestly, I don't think I could sleep.
- I'm pretty, like, pumped up right now.
- Right?
It was amazing.
It was awesome.
I think the cast and crew had a good time.
- We were getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.
I just wanna keep shooting people boning all day.
I don't think I've ever met the ambitious Zack Brown before.
- Well, I'm trying to pay the bills, so...
- It's not a bad thing.
I think it looks good on you.
Come on, hurry.
Come on, come on, come on.
Wait a minute.
- You guys never did it before?
- It's fine.
You know, we talked about it and it's just for the movie.
We're friends, you know, we're just friends.
And we will always just be just friends, so...
Listen, I have some extra lube from last night.
I understand it's kind of hard getting wet when everyone's watching.
At least it was for Barry.
- I don't know if I am gonna need it.
- Really?
Yeah, I think I'm just excited.
At the idea of people watching, not because of Zack.
Oh, God.
Zack could never have that effect on me in a million years.
- Hello, Miriam.
- Oh, hey.
- Your face.
- Yeah.
Weird, huh?
I don't think I've seen your face since senior year.
I think I made a mistake.
I did it for you so you wouldn't get road rash during our scene, but I should have asked first, I look like a fucking beluga whale.
I think I'll be going now.
Okay.
All I keep thinking is we should've done a trial run at home last week or something.
- Oh, my God.
Right?
- I know.
- You're still cool to do it, though, right?
- Yeah, um.
Totally.
Are you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I'm...
- Honestly, I'm a little nervous, I guess.
- You are?
- It's kind of a big deal.
- It is?
Yeah, you know, it's our first time together since our auspicious debut on viral video.
Oh, yeah.
That's a fuckload of pressure for a director.
As a director, please.
What about the anxiety I'm feeling as an actress?
- Did I pick the right project?
- Yeah.
What about this follow-up?
Julia Roberts followed Pretty Waman with Sleeping With the Enemy.
I'm following Granny Panties with Swallow My Cockuccino.
Only difference is this movie's about cock-sucking and her movie just sucked cock, period.
- The only difference, yeah.
- The end was pretty rad.
I liked that.
- When she kills him.
- With a gun.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- She calls the cops first.
- She calls it in first.
- It was so awesome.
- Awesome, yeah.
So I guess we should do this.
I think we should probably wait just until I lose another 20 or 30 pounds.
Stop it.
You look good.
Thanks.
So, what about me?
How do I look?
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful, so I guess it's not a big deal, but you look amazing.
- Okay.
Let's go make a porno.
- Okay.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 8, Take 1.
Come here.
- I'm over...?
All right, settle.
Action.
Who could it be?
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm a delivery man and I have some cream for you.
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.
I work out.
So do you want me to give you your cream now?
I've been waiting for it all day.
- Fuck.
Come on.
- Oops.
Keep going.
I spilled my cream.
Do you mind?
I don't mind.
Especially if you spill it on my face.
Let us fuck.
- Fix my shirt.
Think I should?
- Okay.
Let me see them titties.
Actually, you know what?
Sorry, I don't think we should show them.
- What?
- We shouldn't show your breasts.
- Aren't you gonna take your shirt off?
- I'm just gonna open it.
You're not gonna take it off?
Why not?
My tits are bigger than yours.
I don't wanna show that.
She's not gonna show her tits?
I showed my cock and my asshole.
- Okay, I'll do your pants.
- Back and forth. okay.
- Holy shit.
- Where's that delivery?
I can't believe this.
I was delivering cream, and look what's happening.
- Jesus, what is that, a rumba?
- What's a rumba?
That awkward movement.
- Should I take your underpants off?
- Yeah, take them off.
What the fuck?
How does this work?
They're just like...
I'll do it.
- I'll do mine, you just...
You do yours.
- I'll do my pants.
Granny panties.
Just get on with it already.
I'm gonna fuck you with my pecker.
Dude, that's really dirty.
- That's too dirty?
- That offends me.
- Penis?
- Fine.
- I'm gonna fuck you with my penis.
- I can't wait.
For my penis.
Be careful, Miri.
Okay, there we go.
Just keep rolling, keep rolling.
- I'll walk forward.
- Fucking cream is coming.
This is the worst porno I've ever seen.
Get over here, delivery man.
- Let's fuck on these beans.
- You okay?
- Yup.
Okay, all right.
- Just leave them.
Just leave them.
- They're really distracting.
- You should leave them.
- You gotta get your...
There you go.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.
This okay?
Okay.
Okay.
- We'll start kissing on three, okay?
- Okay.
One, two, three.
Go.
I'm ready.
- I'm ready.
- Okay.
Deacon.
- Deacon.
Deacon.
- What?
Did you see Lost this week, man?
I missed it.
What happened?
They're on the island, off the island.
Who can follow that?
I think they're in hell.
Would you all shut the motherfuck up?
I want you to come.
- I want you to come with me.
- Okay.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Cut.
That's it?
It's over?
Ain't he supposed to come on her titties?
Well, it wasn't what we'd shot-listed, but that was nice.
- It was so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack.
Thanks, Lester, uh.
It wasn't just me, though, guys.
Give it up for my radiant costar here, Miri.
Nice.
- Um, show's over in here.
Let's move out, start lighting the next scene.
- All right.
- Let's do it.
You looked so beautiful.
- Thanks.
I thought they were gonna be fucking hard.
- It was pretty.
- Pretty don't sell.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
You good, Mir?
You need anything?
I'm just gonna take a minute, okay?
Okay, uh.
I'll just be out there.
Yeah.
- That was fun.
- Yeah, fun.
"Fun." You fucking douche.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You working on a rewrite?
- Yeah, just for tonight's scene.
- I'm ready to go when you are, though.
- Okay.
You know, before we go, I...
I'm thinking that, uh, it's a good idea if we talk about what happened last night.
- Oh.
- I mean, we don't have to, but I think...
Okay, yeah, uh.
I kind of dropped the ball on that, I guess, huh?
- No, no.
It's...
- To be honest, it was...
You know, I didn't realize how weird it would be for me.
Weird?
Like...
Weird how?
Acting and directing at the same time.
It's a lot to process, you know.
For the first time, I thought my balls didn't have enough hair on them.
That's not what I meant.
I know what you meant.
How you feeling about it?
I guess, um...
I feel like...
Like we...
- Holy fuck.
- The power's on.
Did you do this?
How did this happen?
I burned the bills.
How could we have done that?
- The water.
- The water.
Come on, come on, come on.
Yeah!
- We can shower in our home again.
- We are liquid.
Greetings.
Have you heard the good news about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?
Oh, my God, did you guys do this?
We got tired of you taking showers at our places all the time.
So we took up a collection amongst ourselves.
And chipped away at your mountain of debt.
You guys paid off our massive utilities bills?
- How did you afford that?
- I stole my old lady's bingo winnings.
And Mistress Bubbles did a bachelor party tonight at which yours truly was a guest star, thank you very much.
Don't get too excited.
We didn't pay off your whole bill.
Just a month of each.
They agreed to turn everything back on?
At 9 at night?
How does that work?
Stacey knows somebody that works at Power and Light.
- You guys...
- This is amazing.
You didn't have to do this.
You didn't have to put us in your movie.
- Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.
- Or put us in your movie either.
- We said that already.
Guys, honestly, I don't know what to say.
You can start by saying we can take tonight off so we can have our wrap party right now.
Guys, we're not wrapped.
We still have four days of shooting left.
Excuse me.
In my "producorial" capacity,
I'm shutting the movie down for a night so we can get a little silly.
Go, go, go.
- Yes.
- Yes.
You all drink.
Was it just amazing with him, after all those years of not knowing?
It was, um, weird.
- But good.
- My scene with Zack's tomorrow.
You don't say.
But I'm a little nervous.
I was thinking about trying to get with him tonight.
- Really?
- I mean, if you don't mind.
You are just friends and all, so I didn't think it would be a biggie.
- It wouldn't be a biggie, would it?
- No.
No, no.
It's not a biggie.
What?
No.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Stacey, I'm not married to the guy, so...
I don't know.
You guys just looked kind of intimate last night.
- We did?
- Yeah.
Well, we're just better actors than I thought, I think, so you know what?
If you wanna get with him, you should just go ask him.
- He'd be really excited to hear that.
- Yeah?
For real, you don't mind?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
All the quarters are on the ground.
Hey, Stace.
- Hey, Zack.
Come on, are you guys playing or what?
Well, I'm bummed, but I totally get it.
It's no problem to work with Lester again.
He has a nice cock.
Well, you're a trouper, Stace.
Oh, but if I start making weird faces or anything during the scene, it's just because I've been constipated all day.
Oh, shit, uh.
We don't have to shoot the scene tonight.
No, I want to.
Anal's great for when you're constipated.
It totally loosens you up.
I use ex-lax, but good to know.
Okay, I never thought I would have that conversation.
So are we starting with Lester and Stacey tonight?
We were supposed to start with Lester and Miri.
I know.
She...
We're not gonna do that.
I don't think Miri's gonna do that.
Hey.
So where are we shooting this?
Over here?
- What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.
Our scene's tonight, right?
Can I talk to you for a minute in the back?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
What do you want me to shoot here?
Start with the close-ups of Lester and Stacey.
Give me a second, man.
What an artist.
Okay, uh.
Did I do something wrong to you?
No.
Then why are you here?
I'm here for the same reason you're here.
To make the movie.
Okay, just, like, for your own personal information, you're acting really weird right now.
I'm acting weird?
I think you're acting weird right now.
Oh, I'm acting...
How exactly am I acting weird?
You've been trying to keep me from fucking anybody but you since we started this thing.
Maybe I was thinking about your feelings.
Were you thinking of my feelings when you were banging Stacey?
Because that'd be really sad for Stacey.
She told me that you told her that that was okay.
I told her that it was okay to ask you.
Holy shit.
I get it.
I fucking get it.
It was a test.
That whole thing was a fucking test, is that it?
If it was, how do you think you did?
We had a discussion, Miri.
We had...
Actually, we had many discussions about how it was just sex
- and how we wouldn't let it get weird.
- I'm not acting weird.
You're acting like a jealous girlfriend is what the fuck you're acting like.
- I am not your girlfriend.
- I know that.
You're not my boyfriend, so why are we having this conversation right now?
Because you're about to fuck Lester to spite me, it seems like.
Did you fuck Stacey to spite me?
No.
You fucked her like you fucked every other bitch and never gave a shit how I felt about it.
- Well, that was before.
- Before what?
Look, don't fucking pretend that the other night, you and me, right there, that that didn't mean anything to you, that you didn't feel it too.
Oh.
You're not getting all gooey on me here, are you, Zack?
You know what?
If you were any other bitch I didn't give a rat's ass about,
I would tell you to go fuck yourself right now because I fucking hate this game-playing shit.
But you, you mean more to me than that, so I'm just gonna lay this out on front street.
I know you felt something big, something real the other night when we were together because I felt it too.
We tried to fuck and instead, we wound up making love.
So if this is what you need to hear in order to keep you from fucking Lester, if this is what you need, then fine.
Here it is, I'm gonna say it.
I love you, Miri.
Happy?
Oh, Jesus.
You better get ahold of yourself, Zack, because we just fucked.
Okay.
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?
But you did.
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.
Wait...
All right, don't forget I'm down here.
Watch that pullout, huh?
Yeah.
Mmm.
This is some damn good coffee.
- Where you going?
- Getting the fuck out of here.
We gotta finish this movie.
Yo!
You believe this shit?
Do you believe this shit?
What the fuck just happened in there?
I'll tell you what just happened in there.
That chick frosted me like I was a fucking cake.
Zack.
Okay, seriously, get a picture of me right now.
I'm hunting humans.
- Dude, check it out.
Ooh.
- Oh, shit.
Seriously, let's shoot the shit out of this bitch.
- Where you aiming at?
- Cock shots?
Cock shots.
We shot you in the balls, cunt nugget.
Well, it's my job to get shot in the balls, so... oh, they're gone.
Excuse me.
Didn't you used to work at the Bean-N-Gone in Monroeville?
I sure as shit hope this pays better, I tell you.
So why don't they just shoot you with a puck?
What do you mean?
I mean, what does paintball got to do with hockey?
Nothing, I guess.
- So ain't no prizes or...?
- No, no.
So, what are they paying $5 for?
To shoot a Broad Street Bully in the balls.
White people are fucked up.
Yup, they sure are.
It's a living.
You've been getting the checks I've been sending?
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Probably didn't save you from a brutal tongue-lashing, though, huh?
You know, the wife never found out about the camera, because I paid off the bills.
How did you manage that?
- Because now I'm Oprah rich.
- No way.
- The post office fucking settled?
- Hundred-sixty large, son.
- Nice, man.
Congratulations.
- A beautiful day, thank you very much.
I thought you made that whole thing up.
No, no.
It was very real.
You can believe it.
Even though she's spending all of it.
Well, since you ain't gonna ask me, I'll just go ahead and tell you.
- No, I have not seen Miri.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.
Oh, I suppose you weren't gonna ask about your movie, neither?
Look, that's why I came down here.
I need you to come take a look at it.
- I'm not interested.
Sorry.
- You'd better get interested
- because you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?
The story doesn't make sense.
- The story?
- The story doesn't make sense.
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?
It's a movie, dog, and a movie's gotta have an ending, which we don't have at the moment.
Come shot, credits.
There's your fucking ending.
Do me this favor, okay?
When you're done getting your nuts blown off, come back to humble Monroeville to my crib for a couple hours, check out the flick, you tell me what's missing.
No.
I'll tell you what, you do that, you don't owe me shit no more.
- Really?
- Really.
- Is your wife home?
- Yes.
- Maybe I should leave the pads on.
- You got some extra ones?
Hey, honey.
Where the fuck you been?
And who in the fuck is this now?
Would you calm down, woman?
Goddamn.
You already left one white boy down in my basement while you off gallivanting and shit.
What if this motherfucker
- was all grabby on me?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
Oh, what in the fuck is that supposed to mean?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
- White boys love me.
White boy.
- I said, white boy.
- Yeah?
You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?
- Should I say yes?
- Just say yes.
Yeah.
- Why don't you, uh, head downstairs?
- Oh, okay.
It's just through this hallway.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
What the fuck you looking at?
Why you gotta be yelling at me in front of my director?
- Oh, he's a director?
- Yeah.
I didn't know that.
Shit, he's a director.
Well, why don't he direct my ass to a new husband?
How about that shit?
- That's the bedroom.
- Keep talking, maybe he will.
Oh, don't nobody want them saggy-ass balls!
Saggy balls?
Look at these sagging-ass titties you got around here.
- You could tie these together.
- Motherfucker, we match.
Oh, shit.
Where's my paintball gun at?
Look at you, editor and DP.
You got your shit covered, man.
Please, don't ever say "shit-covered" to me again.
Roll the film for the man, please, so we can see what he thinks.
Just jump through it.
I ain't got all night.
The bitch is on me.
"Nigga Rich Productions." Classy.
- Yeah, DreamWorks was taken.
- Was it?
Plus, it sounds like an underground gay fuck club.
"I met a guy at DreamWorks." Yeah.
All right, so we got Lester and Stacey fucking.
Then we got Barry and Bubbles fucking.
And then this boring bullshit.
Okay, just, uh, go to the next scene, would you?
- What next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?
We never shot it.
- Why not?
- Because after you left that night,
Miri came out of the backroom and said she couldn't do it.
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped?
So...
- Wait, so Miri...
- Never fucked nobody.
Just you.
Now, I wonder why she did that.
You see, there was a time when I was just a bitter old fuck making coffees, and Stacey was just a lap dancer and Barry and Bubbles didn't know each other and this fool here, hell, I don't even know what he was.
- A white supremacist.
- Man, fuck you.
Then two people come along and showed us something we didn't know existed.
A world of possibilities where plain old people just like us could do something special.
Even if it's something as simple as filming people fucking.
Sometimes we just need someone to show us something we can't see for ourselves
and then we're changed forever.
So as you can see, our movie ain't got no ending.
Every movie needs an ending, don't it?
Peace.
Delaney, you're a slick cupid motherfucker.
Ain't love grand?
Why the fuck is this white boy running through my goddamn house?
Sometimes.
Miri.
- Miri.
- Zack?
Miri.
I'm sorry.
- Get out.
- Close the door.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over...
- Just close the fucking door, Zack.
I never slept with Stacey that night, okay?
I swear to God.
When we got into my room, you know what we did?
We talked about you, and us and how things were different and how I was too much of a fucking pussy to just tell you how I felt about you.
And I know...
I know that that's only because of all the stupid shit we said about how we wouldn't let sex change us, but it did.
It changed me.
That has to be love, right?
It has to be love and just so you know, I can't go back to being just friends anymore,
- because I just can't.
- Good.
And I think...
I think that you feel the same way.
Because that night after I left, you didn't fuck Lester.
What's up, Zack?
You know what?
I don't care that you're fucking Lester, okay?
How's that?
- Oh, shit.
- I don't wanna be with anyone but you.
So I will wait forever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life because I love you, and I have for as long as I can remember.
And I would rather die than be without you, Miriam Linky.
Miri's last name is Linky?
You're gonna fuck a guy who doesn't know your last name?
Or that you beat up Carl Roth in the sixth grade?
I know that.
Or what your senior prom dress would've looked like had we gone but we decided not to, and we got drunk alone instead.
Or that you washed your hair in the toilet.
We're not fucking, Zack.
Or that you're not fucking Zack...
What?
I asked her to fuck me.
She wouldn't do it.
I even tried to talk her into giving me the fucking Dutch rudder.
Shot me down on that too.
- And a Dutch rudder is?
- Don't know what a Dutch rudder...?
All right, you grab your dick, then you have someone else work your arm.
Here, let me show you.
All right, grab my arm.
I'm grabbing my dick, you're grabbing my arm.
Now work it.
Work my arm.
See that shit?
Work it up and down.
It's like someone else is jerking you off.
Okay.
There's the double Dutch rudder, which, I grab my dick, you grab your dick, you work my arm, I work your arm, same time.
It's like jerking off together but not gay.
We're not touching dicks, each other's dicks anyway.
I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.
It feels good, sir.
Try me, come on.
Sorry to change the subject on you, Lester, but if you're not fucking Miri, why is your dick out right now?
Because I live here now, and I like to be naked.
- What?
- When you moved out, she couldn't afford to pay her rent by herself, so I moved in to help.
But you just came out of her room.
That's my room now.
She moved in your old room.
Wait, wait, wait.
She changed rooms?
Yeah, she said she did it because she missed the smell of you or some shit.
I don't smell anything.
But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.
- Night, Zack.
- Night.
Do you?
Then why are you crying?
Because I missed you so much.
Me too.
I love you.
- I love you, I love you.
- I love you.
I don't mean to alarm you but I think I just jerked off Lester a little bit.
- The Dutch rudder?
- Yeah, it's ingenious, right?
If you ask me nicely, I will Dutch-rudder you the rest of our lives.
Good.
I'm getting tired of fucking the Fleshlight.
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.
- What'd it feel like?
- Like fucking a flashlight.
Wrong room.
- Oh, God.
That's gross.
Let us fuck.
Hello.
Welcome to Nigga Rich Productions, home of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, the production house for the couple looking to put a little spice in their sex life.
- Shall we take a look around?
- Fuck me so hard.
Oh, God.
First, you'll meet for a consultation with one of our romance-ologists, who'll coach you through that initial awkward stage before you're camera-ready.
So we will start off with some erotic massage and some...
Dude.
Some light petting.
That sounds good.
Are you guys sure you don't wanna do some, uh, butt-sack work too?
- Uh, let's move on, shall we?
- Why?
From their break-out hit, Swallow My Cockuccino, to the multi-million selling Swallow My Cockuccino II and the award-winning Star Whores saga, including Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter,
Zack and Miri have proven time and again that they know how to shoot hot sex.
As an actor, I've sometimes brought my work home with me inappropriately.
When you're telling your real-life lover in the bedroom, to, you know, bend over while you cake your hand in K-Y, it is a sign that the romance is dead, I think.
Then we turned to the professionals at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
Oh, my God, they totally saved our civil union.
They filmed what was inside of us and not what was coming out of us necessarily.
It helped me see his asshole as not just a come dumpster, but a sign of his beauty, his flower.
It became a, uh, gorgeous orchid.
Orchids grow in sort of the filthiest conditions.
That's what his asshole became to me.
This beautiful flower amidst shit.
- Honey, they get the metaphor.
- I don't think they do.
Let's just say, thank you to Zack and Miri.
It's helped us out, it's helped our friends.
Enrique?
Park?
Park?
Enrique?
Can we get a little love for Zack and Miri?
They don't even know what's going on, they're so pilled up.
But don't take his word for it.
Just ask our co-founders.
- Hi.
I'm Miri Linky Brown.
- I'm Zack Linky Brown.
Here at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, we're dedicated
- to committing your love...
- Or lust.
- to high-end, quality production digital video.
A forever keepsake of your passion.
That's right, Miri.
Why set up a camera at the end of your bed and settle for one unflattering angle, when you could let the professionals dazzle and delight your senses with an array of shots so masterfully rendered you'll swear Martin Scorsese snuck into your room
and caught you fucking?
And remember, we're not just the presidents of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
We're also clients.
Call now to set up your appointment
Way to fuck, Zack.
Subtitles by LeapinLar
You little motherfucker!
Get up, Zack.
Come on, I don't wanna be late for work.
- Ahh!
Get out!
- Jesus, fuck!
Close the door if you're gonna take a shit.
- It was closed.
- It was closed over, it was not closed.
- Close the door, Zack!
- Okay, okay.
- God.
- Fine.
- What's that thing?
- It's a hand warmer.
We're going now.
- You smell that?
Is that the car?
Fuck.
- Oh, goddamn it.
- What?
What?
- Oh, it's wedged in my taint.
- What is?
- It got wedged in my taint.
- What?
- It's stuck under my balls.
- It's between my balls and my leg.
- What's happening?
- Please, pull over.
Pull the fuck over!
- Okay, all right!
Jesus, okay.
- It's about to move up to my ass.
- What?
The movement makes it hotter.
It's tucked under them.
It's stuck under them.
Oh, fuck.
I think I burned my ball hair off.
It's not funny.
Can you help me pick out an outfit for tonight?
I'm working till 6.
- Well, I can try stuff on at the store.
- The store?
No, how about instead, you get a friend?
But you are my friend.
I mean a girl friend, jeez.
Mr. Delaney, can you work for me tomorrow?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
Then you must come in the next day, I tell you.
- It's Black Friday.
- Black Friday?
It's the biggest mall-shopping day of the year.
And since the mall is just up the street, I would like you to come out and work.
- On Black Friday.
- Oh, yeah.
All right, you want me to work on Moolie Monday too?
- I'm sorry?
- How about Nigga Tuesday?
- Nigga Tuesday?
This a new holiday?
- You come to a brother and tell him he gotta work on Black Friday.
You got any idea how racist that sounds?
Telling me to work.
What, you think you own me?
- I never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?
You thought,
"I'm gonna lay down the law for this nigga, I put food on his table, clothes on his nigga baby backs, and he ain't gonna say shit."
- This ain't Amistad.
- You shut up.
You goddamn right this ain't Amistad.
I can't wait till the post office settles my disability suit because then I'm gonna be out this motherfucker.
I'm gonna be Oprah rich.
Y'all can kiss my ass.
You know what?
Fuck you.
Fuck you, and suck cock.
- To hell with you.
- To hell with you.
- Zachary will work.
Zack, my boy.
- Yeah.
- The customer with the harelip...
- Oh, yeah.
...speak me, say you were playing baseball here the other night.
Wiffle ball.
And, uh, no, that wasn't me.
Maybe the harelip makes it sound like "baseball."
Yeah, maybe you hear with an accent.
- Fuck you, okay?
- Okay.
One day, I'm gonna put a camera over there, and then I can tell...
I'll know everything you do when I'm gone.
Everything.
Scratch your balls, take a shit, everything, I tell you, okay?
Okay.
Fucker.
I hate both of you ebony and ivory motherfuckers, I tell you.
- Why is he so fucking high-strung?
- "Fuck off, I tell you.
Very good."
Can you believe that Gandhi motherfucker, telling me I gotta work on Black Friday?
Ain't that some shit?
- Yeah.
- Like I don't wanna do shopping.
Biggest sales day of the year.
I'm getting a flat-screen TV, believe that.
That's my fault, I should tell you.
I asked for Friday morning off, I'm sorry.
- For what?
- I actually need a lot of recovery time.
Tonight is me and Miri's ten-year high school reunion.
I'm just gonna get fucking alcohol poisoning.
- Reunion?
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
- Isn't that fucked up that they do that?
They say it's the best chance to get everyone together.
People come back in town for the holidays.
But they could have it in the middle of the summer at a blowjob contest that I was judging, and it would still be retarded.
- So why you going, then?
- Miri's making me go.
Why you always bending over backwards for that girl,
- knowing she ain't giving up no ass?
- We got a good thing going.
She pays half the rent, does dishes, she wakes me up in the morning.
Why complicate that with sex?
Besides, man, I've known her since the first grade.
You don't fuck someone you met in the first grade.
Excuse me, I met my wife in kindergarten.
We got married senior year, and she has been the queen of my world ever since.
- What if you could do it all over again?
- I'd jerk off and live by myself.
That woman is the bane of my existence.
- See?
- Excuse me, can I get a coffee, black?
Can't you see we talking, white?
If you're gonna continue to emasculate me with this Barbie dress-up shit,
I'm using your laptop.
Don't forget to smack it when you turn it on, otherwise the screen doesn't come on.
Why don't you spring and get a new one?
Same reason I don't spring for clothes for tonight, I'm broke.
There's a chick who works at Teen Juice at the mall, you know.
I gave her a good deal on yarn,
- so she's letting me borrow this stuff.
- Yo, bro.
- What?
- You're buying a vibrator online.
- What's wrong with the one you have?
- It died last week.
Look at the size of those fucking panties.
Shoot that shit.
Shoot it.
My God, who even knew Amazon sold shit like this?
This is incredible.
- Those are fucking granny panties.
- Okay,
A, I don't appreciate you violating the sanctity of my Amazon Wish List page, and B, I'm not buying that thing from Amazon, because it turns out I don't have a credit card they take.
- Oh, shit.
- I'm sorry, guys.
Am I in the way?
You're a fucking faggot, all right?
Let's go to Starbucks.
- He's a shitty barista anyways.
- Cock.
- And he throws like a bitch.
- You know what else I throw?
My nut sack in your coffees, so how did that taste, fucker?
We saw your girlfriend in her underwear, cunt nugget.
Well, too bad she's not my girlfriend, you little fuck...
Oh, they're gone.
Are you still talking to me?
Uh, just said, I'm gonna look up more fuck toys on Amazon.
Oh, holy shit.
- They sell the Fleshlight here too.
- What's that?
It's a fucking pocket pussy that is shaped like a flashlight
"for discretionary jacking off."
That way if you get caught, no one thinks it's weird.
You're just a guy who likes to fuck his flashlight.
I am totally buying this shit.
Whoa, if you've got money to burn, how about paying the electric bill?
- That's due already?
- November's is probably due now, but I was talking about September's.
Tell me this doesn't rock.
You kind of look like Ronald McDonald.
That makes me want some McNuggets.
Why would you wanna buy a pocket pussy anyway?
That is so sad.
What?
Excuse me, I forgot about the nobility that accompanies coming with a fucking vibrator.
Think a kid in Darfur gets saved every time a vibrator makes you come?
No.
- "Real feel action"?
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
If you start fucking machines, I'm moving out.
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a machine.
How come you get to fuck something with a motor in it?
I've never met a man who can make me come like a vibrator does.
That's bullshit.
You get to be Buck Rogers having sex in the 25th century with fucking Twiki and Dr. Theopolis.
I'm stuck to a bottle of Jergens in the bathroom.
Holy bejesus.
You do not use my Jergens to jack it in our bathroom.
No, you know what I do actually, is I light a bunch of candles and I sprawl out on my sheets and I listen to Sting.
No, I'm a guy.
Give me two Popsicle sticks and a rubber band,
I'll find a way to fuck it, like a filthy MacGyver.
Oh, my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.
How about this?
I don't get why you're putting so much effort into this thing.
I thought we were just gonna go to sit around and make fun of everybody.
I can't wear anything that I already own and expect to bring home Bobby Long.
Bobby fucking Long?
No way.
Didn't that guy call you "Stinky Linky"?
Yeah, that was then, okay?
Maybe now he can save me a fortune in Amazon bills.
Maybe you can fuck our landlord so we can at least keep a roof over our heads.
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.
Hey, I bought skates with last week's paycheck
- and I need those to skate with.
- Oh.
And this week's will barely cover the past two water bills, so...
Is this sexy?
Yeah, in like a To Catch a Predator kind of way, it is pretty fucking sexy.
Then we're done.
What the fuck?
Zack.
- You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?
- They shut it off.
- Oh, shit.
Just, uh...
Help me get this shit out of my hair.
Just use the water out of the toilet.
- There's poo in there.
- Not that part.
- The back part of the toilet thing.
- Oh, that makes sense.
Take the cup there and then scoop it in, there you go.
Here, I'll lean back and you can just, you know, pour it down like...
Like that.
You're harshing my buzz, you know.
This is so lame.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Whoa!
All right, one hour tops, then we're gone.
Or I had an idea.
We could just not go at all, which would rock.
Even though we're broke and we've never amounted to anything, we're still better than these people, right?
No.
Not at all.
We're probably not even as good as most of them, unless one of them is a crackhead or something.
Just tell me I'm prettier than when we graduated.
You look about the same.
Definitely not prettier, but around the same.
I'm thinner, though, right?
A little?
Not really.
Well, good pep talk.
Fuck.
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.
- You don't recognize us, do you?
- Um, no, sorry.
Zack Brown, Miri Linky.
Were you the one they called Stinky Linky?
Oh, no, no one ever called me that.
Oh.
- Great.
What does yours say?
- What the fuck?
Come on.
- I'm sure I had a nickname.
Nothing?
- All right, you have a great time, and before you go, don't forget your copy of The Roving Roe-Ver.
What the fuck's this shit?
That is not shit, that would be our bi-monthly newsletter.
- Awesome.
- It updates you
- on what everyone's doing.
- Finally.
I love your enthusiasm.
Here you go.
Write your e-mail address on that and I'll be sure to add you to our 800-member-strong mailing list.
We had 800 people in our graduating class?
Yes, and only 250 R.S.V.P.'d.
Doesn't that suck, Mary?
- Miri.
- You married, Bets?
- I am.
Two kids.
- Wow, that's beautiful.
- Awesome.
- You wanna fuck me later?
- Uh, no, I'm married.
- Okay, cool.
If you change your mind,
- I'll be in there getting shitfaced.
- He will.
- Just so you know, I eat the pussy.
- He does.
Ah, tempting.
Again, no.
- Shall we?
- Sir.
Bye, Bets.
Think about it.
¶ "LET ME CLEAR MY THROAT" by DJ KOOL ¶
Enjoy.
Can I get two beers, please?
You want a beer?
- Yeah.
- Three beers.
- Thank you.
- Here you go.
Is that Zack?
Or am I Zack?
Whoa, ho, ho.
Oh, wow.
- Never gets old, huh?
- The other Zack.
Oh, in my world, nobody calls me "the other Zack,"
now that this guy's not around anymore, huh?
- Get the fuck off of me.
- There can be only one.
- What?
- Highlander, man?
The Kurgan.
Remember?
I'd yell it at you whenever we passed each other in the hallway?
Like it was yesterday, man.
Awesome.
Awesome.
Awesome.
God, you guys have so much to catch up on.
Whoo.
- No.
- I'm gonna let you get to it.
- Bitch.
- Bitch.
¶ "SEX AND CANDY" by MARCY PLAYGROUND ¶
Have you seen that big blowup picture they have of me?
Yeah, it's...
My hair is terrible.
I can't believe I even wore my hair like that.
That's before I knew about styling products, you know.
It makes a big difference in life.
But you live and learn, though, right?
I mean, ten years ago, Pittsburgh, who knew anything about fashion?
Back in the day, our hairstyle, oh...
Hey, stranger.
- Whoa.
Stinky Linky.
- Yeah.
Although it's just Miri now.
- Give me a hug.
- Oh, okay.
- Hi, heh, heh, heh.
- Hi.
Wow.
- How have you been?
- Great, great.
- Yeah?
- You look fantastic.
Wow, that is not something that you would have said to me ten years ago.
- Well, I've grown up.
- Yes.
Yes, you have.
You just look...
Ooh, heh, heh.
- Well, listen to you.
Thank you.
- No, don't thank me, just fuck me.
¶ "STEAL MY SUNSHINE" by LEN ¶
Roxanne.
Hey.
Someone I like, what are the odds, huh?
Zack Brown, we had four years of Spanish together.
Why does no one recognize me?
- Am I thinner?
Is that it?
- Look at him.
- Who?
- My stupid husband.
No fucking shit.
John Butterfield?
You actually married John Butterfield?
- That's amazing.
- Don't ever get married.
It sucks.
You stop appreciating each other and run out of shit to talk about after the first year.
But look at him now, chatty as fuck.
Flirting up a storm with that cheerleader nimrod Monica Von.
You want me to maybe flirt with you so he can see it, even it up a bit?
I don't wanna get even.
If I was gonna do anything, I'd wanna one-up the asshole.
You can give me a handjob in the girls' locker room.
- Fine, but make it fast.
- Fuck, yeah.
Are you staying in town for a while or...?
Just tonight.
I fly back to L.A. tomorrow.
L.A., wow, Los Angeles.
Gosh, Bobby Long, coming up in the world.
- With Mrs. Long, I bet, huh?
- No, no, no.
No Mrs. Long for me.
- Then can I be honest with you?
- Sure.
Um...
Whew.
I think I need a drink.
Do you need a drink?
Because I need a drink to say this.
- I've got a beer already, so...
- Oh, great, thank you.
I think there's a cigarette butt in there.
Yup.
Sorry about the elbow.
¶ "SMALLTOWN BOY" by BRONSKI BEAT ¶
There can be only one.
Can I get a beer, please?
Thank you very much.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
My friend's making an ass of herself hitting on her high school crush.
Oh, God, that's so sad.
It's so Miri, is what it is.
I'm Zack, by the way.
Brandon.
Don't worry, we weren't in the same class or anything.
- Okay.
Lucky you.
- Are you a Monroe-ver?
Well, I went here, let's just leave it at that, I guess.
Do you have one of the large blown-up pictures of your younger self
- hanging around here?
- I do, kind of.
Right there.
- Gorgeous.
- Good times.
What do you do?
What brings you here?
I came with somebody who went to school here.
- Really?
- Bobby Long.
No shit.
That's who my friend's hitting on right now.
See right there?
- Really.
- One dressed like Hannah Montana?
In L.A., we call that look "Nickelodeon chic."
- Wait, L.A.?
Los Angeles?
- California.
That's awesome, man.
What do you do out there?
- I'm an actor.
- Wow, that's really impressive.
- Thank you, thank you.
- In fucking movies?
"Fucking movies." Pretty much.
Look at you.
What...?
Anything I've seen?
What movies?
Oh, all sorts of movies with all-male casts.
All-male casts.
Like Glengarry Glen Ross?
Like that?
Like Glen and Gary Suck Ross' Meaty Cock and Drop Their Hairy Nuts in His Eager Mouth.
- Is that like a sequel?
- Sort of.
- It's a re-imagining.
- Oh, like The Wiz.
More erotic and with less women.
No women, to be exact.
I apologize in advance if I am out of line here, but are you in gay porn?
- Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?
- I thought you recognized me, that's...
- Oh, okay, I get it.
You're not in my demographic, so I'm not insulted.
- Not really.
Who's your demographic?
- Do you love pussy?
- I do.
- Then not you.
Oh, okay.
I came here tonight hoping to seduce you and bring you back to my apartment and sleep with you to, uh, get back at you, you know, for calling me Stinky Linky all those years ago.
Wow.
That is a weird revenge plot.
- You must be a terrible lay for that.
- What?
No, I'm great.
I mean, I've had enough practice and everything.
That...
Wow, that sounded not good.
I fuck a lot.
That's what I meant to say.
That doesn't sound good either.
Wow.
You're a lot funnier than I remember.
Thank you.
Gosh, you turned out to be such a nice guy.
It just...
You know, it makes it even easier to just...
To just say this.
Would you like to come back to my place and maybe open a bottle of wine and have ourselves a real high school reunion?
- I...
- Hello, Miriam.
Beat it, we're talking.
- I wanted to introduce you to Brandon.
- Salutations.
- Bobby's boyfriend.
- Bobby who?
- Bobby me.
- Bobby Long.
Brandon is the star of such adult fare as...
What was that one called again?
You Better Shut Your Mouth or I'm Gonna Fuck It.
That's right.
I'm surprised I forgot that.
Are you fucking with me?
No, they're fucking with each other.
Oh, my God.
- No.
- What?
Granny Panties?
- Excuse me?
- How can you tell?
This is so crazy.
I was literally just watching you, like, right before we got here.
This is so crazy.
This is you, right?
My name's Granny Panties, and nobody wants to fuck me.
Nothing's whiter than my big gay ass...
Where'd you get that?
Oh, I entered "gay" and "ass," and it was the top hit.
It's had 200,000 views in three hours.
Honey, you are, like...
I'm jealous right now because you're, like, super famous.
Baby, please take our picture.
I get a picture with Granny Panties.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is awesome.
- All right, smile.
Okay, got it.
- Did you get it?
- Oh, thank you very much.
- E-mail me that.
Oh, because he's the worst photographer.
Okay, good.
- You're gay?
- Yeah.
And I'm on the Internet wearing a diaper?
Who knew you'd come to Pittsburgh and meet a celebrity?
I'm gonna binge-drink now until I pass out.
Okay.
She'll be fine.
So you guys suck each other's cocks, huh?
Oh, like crazy.
Okay, that's enough, I think.
I'm embarrassing him.
I love when he's embarrassed.
He's not living out loud, so he gets all like, ooh.
- You are totally in love, aren't you?
- Zachary, we are.
Wow, I...
Oh, God, I just wanna eat him up, yum, yum.
Save some for me, yum, yum, yum.
- I can't keep my hands off him.
- You've had one too many.
Although he does most of the eating in the sack.
In the sack and of the sack.
All right, that's enough.
Look, you've drunk too much.
You do this every time.
You get too Mary for everybody in the room
- and you can't contain yourself.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
And by containing myself, do you mean containing myself in a closet?
In a closet of denial?
Is that...?
No, no, no.
Holy shit, this just got real.
This is exactly why you haven't met my mother.
You don't know how to ease people into this situation.
- You just force your way in every time.
- I thought, maybe for one second in this godforsaken town, I could be myself.
I'm so sorry.
No, you're right, I should just butch up and pretend that I don't love it when you shove your dick in my mouth.
- This is the best night of my life.
- Am I making a spectacle?
- I could make a much bigger scene.
- You really are.
I'm sorry.
Pittsburgh.
Listen up, Monroe-vers.
My name is Brandon St. Randy, and I love Bobby Long.
- Fucking A.
- Is that enough?
Is that enough of a scene?
I could start doing worse than that.
The reason you haven't taken me to your mother's...
Your mother with her makeup and all her drinking, she's in the closet too.
- They fight just like real people.
- I thought I'd be a conduit for you...
Thank you.
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm not.
- Thank you.
- I love you.
- I'll e-mail you.
- Zack, it was so nice to meet you.
And I will be patient with you.
I will be there on your journey.
I will be your Sherpa up the mountain of gayness.
Well, might as well see how many hits Granny Panties is up to, huh?
Did I do that?
Thanks, George.
What kind of evil fucks turn off your power the day...?
No, the night before Thanksgiving?
Who does that?
Can you get an advance on your card?
Fleshlight maxed-out my $200 limit.
Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.
This is bad.
If we don't come up with rent, we're gonna get locked out.
Who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.
Which means by the time we get home, there's no heat either.
Well, I think it's time we put what we always talked about into effect.
- You're gonna have to start hooking.
- You know, you jest, but these are the exact circumstances people find themselves in right before they start having sex for money.
- Yeah.
- Or making porn.
- Oh, my God, yeah.
- What?
You got an idea?
We could make a porno.
- Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?
No, that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me?
That's a rad idea.
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend, he said he makes a hundred grand a year because he shoots and distributes his own porno flicks.
If it's so easy, how come everybody doesn't do it?
Because other people have options and dignity, which we do not have, which puts us in an amazingly advantageous position.
Fuck you, I have dignity.
Where?
Is it hidden in your gigantic underpants that are plastered all over the Internet?
Is that where you hide your dignity?
Every woman has a pair of those period panties.
That's, like, a fact.
Okay.
Families.
I bet people don't make porno, because they have families.
But luckily, your parents are dead.
Sorry.
My grandparents are dead.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
So who are we gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone mainstream now.
It's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks in it.
Look at Paris Hilton.
She throat-fucks a guy in night vision, now she's selling fragrances to tweens.
And I'm pretty sure she's legally retarded.
That's for tweens?
Have you seen that Joe Francis guy who made Girls Gone Wild?
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot piece of shit in the world and he has a jet and a fucking island.
Look, there's got to be a less extreme solution to our financial woes here.
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper route.
- I don't have a bike.
- Be a waiter.
No one wants me around their food.
Would you eat food that I gave you?
I would not eat food that you gave me, that's true.
I mean, nobody wants to see us fuck, Zack.
Everybody wants to see anybody fuck.
I hate Rosie O'Donnell, but if someone said, "I got a tape of Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid,"
I'd be like, "Why aren't we watching that right now?"
Because she's famous.
Hello.
So are you.
You're fucking Granny Panties.
My underwear and your ass are famous, we're not.
So who the F would wanna watch us fuck?
- At least 800 people.
- The jerks we went to school with?
- Are you serious?
- Of course.
If you heard that someone we graduated with was in a fucking porno movie, you'd watch it, right?
I'd watch that guy Brandon suck a cock, I just met him.
With this mailing list, we have almost a thousand people that would definitely buy a porno we were in just to be like,
"Hey, I sat next to that guy in Civics.
Look at his fucking dick."
We sell a thousand copies at 20 bucks a pop, bam, we have paid off our bills.
- So, what do you think?
- I don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.
Oh, wow, like you've never done that before.
How many guys have you met in a bar, taken home, banged with your mouth and then never talked to again?
That's what we call a stranger.
Dude, I don't one-night mouth-fuck anybody that I pick up in bars.
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in the porno movie for some weird reason.
I guess...
We could fuck.
- Ew.
- Fuck you.
I mean, you're a nice-enough-looking guy and everything...
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're an all-right-enough-looking girl.
- How does that feel?
- Dude, I'm just saying it'd be weird and wrong, you know, like fucking my brother.
Okay, seriously, we're just talking about sex, okay?
It's for a purpose.
It's for getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.
- Wow.
- Just explain to your private beforehand,
"Look, this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash."
- Oh, my God.
- What?
You're just doing this because you've always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?
Yes.
I've gone my whole life pretending that I want nothing to do with you, just hoping one day we'd be in such dire financial straits that I could use it to finally make my move on you.
- You're just being sarcastic.
- I am.
See, I was pretending to cry right there.
I guess it's not like it'd be creepy, like if we got way too drunk one night and accidentally fucked, you know?
No.
We'd be going in with the understanding that it's...
A business decision.
Strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.
- Right.
- And by end,
I mean, I'll be waxing your ass.
Fuck you.
I'm not even letting you see my ass.
I've seen your ass and the rest of you naked around a billion times already.
- That goes both ways, buddy.
- You've never seen my dick.
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.
Are you kidding?
That party we went to where you got blasted, and Houls dared you to give yourself head, and we all watched you try for, like, an hour.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks by the way, for fucking letting me do that.
Thank you.
Oh, God.
We really do know too much about each other.
See, and this would really just be one more thing.
I mean, look at us.
It's Thanksgiving and we're huddled around a flaming fucking garbage can like a couple of steno bums.
I mean, this could give us a chance to pay off our debt, pay our bills, get a fucking nicer apartment with heat in it maybe.
What are you doing?
Miriam Linky, will you have sex with me on camera for money?
I will.
- A producer?
- Yeah.
- Guy who gets to finance the movie.
- You think I got that kind of money?
We just need that.
What you're about to spend on the flat screen.
Now I can't get my flat screen?
Fuck that.
No, no, no.
With your cut of the profits, you're gonna get two flat screens.
One in your living room, one in your bathroom.
One in the bathroom?
You know, it's always been my dream to watch shit while I shit.
Everyone with an ass loves to watch shit while they shit.
- I'm gonna make that happen for you.
- I don't know, man.
What else the producer do?
- Um, they help with the casting.
- What's casting?
Finding the people to be in the movie.
- I get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.
Like, I can look at a titty, make sure there ain't no moles on there?
- You can look at both titties, man.
- Man.
I've been looking at the same busted titties for the past almost 20 years.
- I'm due for another new titty.
- Please help us.
Please.
Please.
Yes.
Yes.
I love you.
Well, don't mind that smell.
We had some homeless people squatting in here.
You know, they'd void their bowels everywhere but the bathroom.
Anyway, you pick up the poop and you've got yourself a movie studio.
Why don't we shoot in your apartment?
No power.
You wanna pay our electric bill?
- You motherfuckers...
- We'll take it.
- Bring it back.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, God.
Come on.
Why the fuck do I have to do everything?
Fuckers.
Hey, what is that?
Fucking guys.
This fucking team, man.
They fucking suck.
I'm gonna hatefuck the shit out of you, ref.
- Dude.
- It's cool.
- He's my cousin.
- Hey.
Didn't you used to videotape the varsity basketball games in high school?
Just the away games.
I did it because I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.
Which one?
Whichever one wanted to fuck the guy who taped the varsity games.
- Aw.
- Still know how to work a camera?
- Who cares what the title is?
- The porn I liked when I was a kid, it was always, like, a spoof of a popular movie, you know?
Like, um, Edward Penishands.
Okay, so we need a mildly clever, vaguely dirty title, that sounds like a real movie
- and sums up what you're gonna see.
- Correct.
An American Werewolf in Brenda?
Fuckback Mountain?
- Too soon?
A Cock-in-Lips Now?
- Next.
Cradle the balls.
Work the shaft.
Jerk my come-crayon and let me color you white.
I need cock and I need it now.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
I'm fucking you in the puss.
It's "puss" as in pussy.
Oh, because I was like, who would wanna fuck puss?
I want to slam my ham in your can, woman.
Scene.
- This guy is amazing.
- This guy's great-looking too.
I wanna fuck him.
Hi, my name's Delaney and I'm a producer.
I really don't know what it means.
I'm gonna be honest, this is my first time.
You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna touch you or nothing like that.
- All right.
- I have a wife, you know.
We're happy.
I mean, not happy, but it's cool, you know.
Just so you know, there will be some fucking.
- We'll talk about that if you get the part.
- Okay.
I mean, not...
We won't be fucking, there'll be fucking in the movie.
Like I said, I got a wife.
She don't play that shit.
- She is a crazy bitch.
- Yep.
It's my job as the producer to see what you got.
So if that makes you uncomfortable in any way, you don't have to show me anything you don't wanna show me, because...
I love the movies.
- Lawrence of a Labia.
- No.
- Oh, come on.
- Dawn of the Dick.
Yeah, but how are zombies doing it at all sexy?
I want to eat your brain and your ass.
- Dude.
- Sci-fi.
Yeah.
Close Encounters With a Turd From Behind.
- I don't know what that means.
- Just asses.
Fucking deep in asses.
What?
We're making a porno and we just need to know what you would be or would not be interested in doing.
If anything.
- No anal.
- Oh, definitely no anal.
Anal and hugging.
I don't do ass stuff.
- Anal.
- Ah, fuck.
- Oh, wait, oral.
I like anal.
- Yay.
Okay, well, so, uh, do you have any special skills?
Special skills?
I can get a boner really quick and it sticks straight up.
- Is that really a special skill?
- I think.
- Can you show us what you mean?
- Sure.
Oh, that is special.
Yeah, you're hired, Mr...
- Who are you again?
- Lester.
Lester "The Molester" Cockinshtuff.
- No.
- Wow.
That is the best porn name I've ever heard, man.
I can have a porn name?
- Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.
Are you Granny Panties?
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The panties are actually in the house.
- I'll get them.
- Whoa.
- Star Sex 2:
The Wrath of Cunt.
- We never made a Star Sex 1.
I guess we can lose Star Sex 3:
The Search for Cock, then.
- Cocunt.
- What's that?
It's Cocoon with a cunt.
So Delaney tells us you have a special talent of some sort.
I don't know if I'd call it a special talent, but it's a little something I picked up doing bachelor parties.
It would probably be easier if I just showed you.
- Great.
- The floor is yours.
So a movie, huh?
That could be fun.
Holy fuck.
Her name, Bubbles.
- Invasion of the Potty-Snatchers?
- That's like MAD Magazine stupid.
Well, fuck you, okay?
You try to think of a good sci-fi porno title.
It's hard.
There's gotta be one we haven't thought of that would say it all, not be ridiculously filthy and off-putting, and still have instant recognition with our audience.
- I got it.
- I got it.
- Star Whores.
- Yeah.
It's funny, right?
See, we figured this opens us up to an even bigger sales market beyond the people we went to school with.
People who like comics and sci-fi.
Comics?
Like "Ziggy"?
"Ziggy"?
Is that even in fucking papers anymore?
No, man.
Fuck you. "Ziggy" is a comic, right next to "Family Circus."
No, like Spider-Man and shit, you know?
There's always a shitload of Star Wars nerds at those comic-book shows.
So we sell them a Princess Leia they can really fucking jerk off to.
- That'd be me, Princess Lay-Her.
- Who am I playing?
You, my friend, are the lead role of Lubed Guy-Baller.
Man, he's gonna be balling dudes?
I thought you said this was boys on girls.
If I have to fuck a guy, okay, but I'd rather fuck a girl.
What's wrong with you, boy?
- We'll change the name to Sky-Baller.
- Sky-Baller.
I will be Hung So-low.
Delaney, my friend, you are On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
Man, I can't be in no porno.
My wife will kill me.
Hump me, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
You're my only hump.
On the other hand, fuck my wife.
Unfortunately, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over does not have any sex in the movie but the droids do, I-CUP and R2-T-Bag.
I robot.
And Stacey over here is gonna play Darth Vibrator.
- I'm the bad guy?
- She's not a guy, Zack.
I know that because I'm not a fucking idiot.
In our movie, Darth Vibrator is a bad girl who wants to fuck the galaxy, literally, and it's up to Lubed and Hung to stop her with their cocks.
- You and me get to have sex, then?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- I know.
Isn't that awesome?
Hold up, hold up.
So who's all having sex with who in this movie?
As of last night, I was having sex with Zack.
What?
Han Solo ain't never had no sex with Princess Leia in the Star Wars.
Guys, this isn't a literal adaptation here.
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.
Kind of like The Wiz or like a parody.
With lots of anal.
- Cool.
- I know, isn't that awesome?
I have a question, do Princess Lay-Her and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?
Uh, no, because they're brother and sister, and according to Miri, brothers and sisters can't fuck.
But you said, that this wasn't a literal translation, so that means Lester's character could have sex with Miri's character.
Because I would love to fucking eat her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.
Dream on, pal, it's never gonna happen, okay?
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See, she's fine...
Wait, what?
Yep.
I mean, everyone else is having sex with more than one person in this movie all of a sudden, so I think it's, you know, not fair if I'm only fucking you.
Guys, read amongst yourselves, okay?
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Look, Miri, we got plenty of sex going on in this thing, you don't have to do that.
Zack, it's fine.
I mean I have slept with way worse-looking guys than Lester.
I just wanna do my part for the movie like everyone else.
You're having sex in the movie, you don't need to fuck someone else.
- You're good.
- I'm only fucking you, though.
So don't we need to vary it up to keep it fair?
Fair for...?
I don't...
What?
Fair for who?
What are these, blood diamonds we're talking about?
Fair for everyone else who is fucking more than one person, a.k.a. you, in the movie.
- I mean, fine...
- All right.
I mean, if you don't care...
I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
Fuck.
I don't give a shit.
Like you said, you know, you've fucked bigger idiots than Lester.
Holy shit.
Are we really gonna shoot this in outer space?
Maybe not bigger idiots.
Thank you.
- Cut.
All right, guys, that's it.
- Yeah.
Make sure you leave your costume so we know they're here for tomorrow.
Mostly, everybody, thank you so much for helping us get ready, you know.
Cleaning this place out, building the sets, sewing the costumes, it's just...
I mean, it's really amazing.
Thank you.
Seriously, thanks.
But this is just the beginning, guys.
If Star Whores works, and it will, we are set up for sequels galore.
The Empire Strikes Ass.
- Return of the Brown-Eye.
- The Phantom Man-Ass.
And Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter.
- Okay.
- Revenge of the Shit.
- You got it?
- Yeah, no, we got it.
Ew.
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.
- We'll talk about that one.
We're gonna have a lot of fun, but more importantly, we're gonna make a lot of fucking money, okay?
- Yeah.
- So get ready for greatness, people.
Tomorrow we start principal photography.
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
- All right, good night, you guys.
- We got a movie.
- What?
- Nothing.
I think someone should acknowledge how insane and amazing this is
- and it's all because of you.
- I don't know.
It's just a porno.
You know what I mean.
You've really come into your own.
Shut the fuck up.
So speaking of coming into things, ready for tomorrow?
Twenty years, we're finally gonna know what it's like to have sex with each other.
You say that like you've been wondering what it'd be like to sleep with me for a while now.
Why the fuck do you think I started hanging out with you?
I knew it.
Here, help.
Let's just promise that it's not gonna change anything between us, okay?
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Some guys can't keep sex in perspective.
If anyone's gotta keep this in perspective, it's you, okay?
I don't want you getting all mushy and gooey on me after I give you the best orgasm you've ever had.
Oh, like you know what you're doing down there at all.
I actually don't.
Where's the clitoris?
Is it in your ass?
Just, you know, make sure you kind of whoop it up and act like I'm a stud who knows what he's doing, okay?
Just be a pal.
Oh, dude, I am gonna Meryl Streep the fuck out of this tomorrow, you watch.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
No.
Really, thank you.
For everything.
You're welcome.
Less than 12 hours and we make Monroeville history.
- I really hope nothing goes wrong.
- It's a movie.
What could go wrong?
What are you doing?
- What's up?
- What the fuck?
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait.
- Wait.
- Stop.
Stop.
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck is going on?
Condos is what's going on, as soon as this shit-hole's demo'd.
No, you gotta stop it right now.
We rented this place for a month from Mr. Jenkins.
Sounds like your Mr. Jenkins was full of shit.
Luxury Homesteads bought this place a month ago.
I'm gonna kill that lying old fuck.
You're gonna have to go Florida, that's where he moved.
We've got thousands of dollars of equipment in there.
- Please.
- If you wanna sift through this rubble when we're done, be my guest.
Hey, get that fucking beam down.
This is the last thing you wanna hear.
If you don't get an advance,
I don't think we're gonna keep a roof over our heads.
I got an advance already.
It went into all the costumes.
- So all our money's gone?
- All your money?
Never mind what my wife's gonna do when there ain't no new snow tires, or when she sees I charged a video camera.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this, man.
I just wanted to see some free titties.
That's all.
But there's no such thing as free titties, is there, Zack?
- Is there?
- Fuck this noise.
Why don't we get another camera, and shoot something else?
Where are we gonna do that?
Got another sound stage?
Sound stage?
We had a shit-covered garage we turned into a sound stage.
We find someplace new and we do it again.
How?
Okay, I'm broke, man.
No, make that, I was broke.
Now I am really tapped out.
I have to get another job to pay Delaney back.
So please tell me, how can I afford to start over?
- What can I get you?
- Yeah, can I get a, uh...?
Too fucking late.
Cappuccino, 3.50.
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
I mean, I'm a total loser in every single other aspect of my life.
What made me think I could do something as simple as filming people fucking?
We have no money left, nowhere to shoot, no sets, we have no fucking cameras.
Here.
It's time I go back to my regular life where I am a quiet fuckup who doesn't cost anybody any money and knows his goddamn position behind this fucking counter making cappuccinos for this fucking guy.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Fuck, yes.
Zack.
You sneaky Indian motherfucker.
I tell you, yes.
Swallow My Cockuccino.
- What?
- That's it.
That's the movie.
Why didn't I think of it before?
We don't need sets or a stage.
Look at all this production value, waiting to have balls on it.
Hold up.
You wanna shoot a dirty movie here, where we work?
Yes.
Fuck, yes, I do.
You know how many stories I have from working here?
How many times I've been laid right there after hours?
You've never gotten laid here after hours.
I know.
Thank you for reminding me.
But I always wish I had, and that's what porno is.
It's fantasy.
It's taking the normal and making it abnormal by fucking it.
Don't do that.
The little dog don't like that.
How did you get a camera?
By being a terrible, untrustworthy employee, that's how.
Give me today, I'll bang out a script.
Meet me back here after closing.
We're gonna launch arching ropes of jism all over this motherfucker.
Peace.
I like that guy but if he tries to fuck that little dog tonight for real,
I'm calling the Humane Society.
It's called Bean-N-Gone, so get the fuck out of here.
Hey, Barry.
- Stand by, Stace, picture's up.
- Okay.
Roll tape.
Swallow My Cockuccino, Scene 12, Take 1.
And action.
I'd like a double espresso so I can stay up all night because I'm in the mood to fuck.
Well, I am a whore-ista, so I love to fuck.
Would you like to fuck me?
Holy fuck.
You mean, after you're done with your shift?
I mean during my shift.
- Sorry.
- Keep going, keep going.
With your shaft.
Let us fuck.
Cue music.
Okay, open up to camera, guys.
Let us see it.
More tongue.
Little less tongue.
Oh, that was good.
Cue effects.
Oh, yeah, like that.
Oh, yeah.
See, I told you it would work.
Didn't I tell you?
It looks amazing.
It's incredible.
Oh, the beans hurt.
Easy.
- Move in for coverage.
- Nice.
That's why we got him.
- Nice.
I'm impressed.
- Get in there, Deacon.
- Come on.
- Like that?
Like that.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
- Pull out a bit, actually.
- That's hot.
No, not you, Lester.
Put it back in.
Kiss the muscle.
- I kiss the muscle.
- You kiss the muscle.
- Can he slap her ass a little?
- Don't be a fucking pervert, dude.
- Stir, come on.
Stir.
- Yeah, stir it.
Stir it, baby.
Hey.
- Holy.
- Shit.
Are you guys still open?
No.
We close at 9.
I need coffee so I'm drive home.
- Okay.
Yeah.
- Thank you.
That's a cute kitty.
Okay.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You guys see the game?
I was at it.
Fucking Roethlisberger, the quarterback, was all fucking,
"Hug it, chug it, football.
All night." Heh-heh.
Okay, pal, here you go.
On the house.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Have a good one.
- Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- I said, have a good one.
Oh.
- Okay.
Keep moving.
- You and your little dog.
Go Steelers.
Action.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, like that.
Oh, fuck it, chuck it, football.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, God, this is good.
You take it.
You take it.
Take it, Barry.
Oh, take it.
Take it, Barry.
Take it.
I'm disturbed at how turned on I am by this.
- Shit, dude, it's almost 6.
- Oh, fuck.
Okay, that's a wrap, everybody, yeah.
Let's give a hand to our hotties with the bodies from last night.
Stacey, Lester, Bubbles, Barry, whoo.
- Yeah.
- Nice.
Okay, when we come back tonight, we finish up the venti-vulva scene, and then we get into me and Miri's stuff.
Again, amazing first night, everybody.
Thank you so much.
Let us fuck.
- Hey, how'd it look?
- How do you think it looked?
It looked like shit going into other shit, in focus.
What an artist.
That was Kurosawa's motto. "Shit going into other shit."
Oh, man, I can't believe you gotta work now.
It's okay.
You know, honestly, I don't think I could sleep.
- I'm pretty, like, pumped up right now.
- Right?
It was amazing.
It was awesome.
I think the cast and crew had a good time.
- We were getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.
I just wanna keep shooting people boning all day.
I don't think I've ever met the ambitious Zack Brown before.
- Well, I'm trying to pay the bills, so...
- It's not a bad thing.
I think it looks good on you.
Come on, hurry.
Come on, come on, come on.
Wait a minute.
- You guys never did it before?
- It's fine.
You know, we talked about it and it's just for the movie.
We're friends, you know, we're just friends.
And we will always just be just friends, so...
Listen, I have some extra lube from last night.
I understand it's kind of hard getting wet when everyone's watching.
At least it was for Barry.
- I don't know if I am gonna need it.
- Really?
Yeah, I think I'm just excited.
Uh-huh.
At the idea of people watching, not because of Zack.
Oh, God.
Zack could never have that effect on me in a million years.
- Hello, Miriam.
- Oh, hey.
Wow.
- Your face.
- Yeah.
Weird, huh?
I don't think I've seen your face since senior year.
I think I made a mistake.
I did it for you so you wouldn't get road rash during our scene, but I should have asked first, I look like a fucking beluga whale.
I think I'll be going now.
Okay.
All I keep thinking is we should've done a trial run at home last week or something.
- Oh, my God.
Right?
- I know.
- You're still cool to do it, though, right?
- Yeah, um.
Totally.
Are you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I'm, uh...
- Honestly, I'm a little nervous, I guess.
