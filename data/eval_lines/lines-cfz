- Scabbers, come back.
Wait!
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
That's not good.
Ron, run!
Harry, Hermione, run!
It's the Grim!
- Harry!
- Ron!
Ron, wait!
Harry!
- Help!
- Ron!
- Ron.
Ron.
- Ron!
Come on!
Move!
Duck!
Harry!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.
I just hope I'm wrong.
We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
Come on.
Ron.
- Ron.
You're okay.
- The dog.
Where is it?
It's a trap.
He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.
If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!
No.
Only one will die tonight.
Then it'll be you!
Are you going to kill me, Harry?
Expelliarmus!
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?
Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within.
Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you?
- I found him.
- I know.
- He's here.
- I understand.
- Let's kill him!
- No!
I trusted you!
And all this time, you've been his friend.
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.
How long have you known?
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.
You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!
Twelve years of it!
In Azkaban!
Very well.
Kill him.
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.
I know why.
You betrayed my parents.
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.
Somebody did betray your parents somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!
And he's in this room!
Right now!
Come out, come out, Peter!
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!
Vengeance is sweet.
How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
Severus...
I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle.
Here's the proof.
Brilliant, Snape.
You put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion.
If you'll excuse us, Remus and I have business...
- ... to attend to.
- Give me a reason.
I beg you!
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it.
It's habit.
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!
You two, quarrelling like an old married couple.
Run along and play with your chemistry set!
I could do it, you know.
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.
A Dementor's Kiss.
One can only imagine what that must be like.
It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.
Severus, please.
After you.
Expelliarmus!
- Harry!
What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.
We thought he was our friend!
- No.
Pettigrew's dead.
You killed him!
- No, he didn't.
I thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map!
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!
- Me?
!
He's mental!
- Not you!
Your rat!
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?
Curiously long life for a common garden rat!
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!
Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?
Scabbers!
Leave him alone!
Get off him!
What are you doing?
Remus?
Sirius.
My old friends!
Harry!
Look at you.
You look so much like your father.
- James.
We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!
How dare you talk about James in front of him!
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!
The Dark Lord.
You have no idea the weapons he possesses!
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!
James wouldn't have wanted me killed!
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!
Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would.
Together!
No!
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.
But we'll take him to the castle.
- Bless you, boy.
Bless you!
- Get off!
I said we'd take you to the castle.
After that, the dementors can have you.
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.
A bit?
A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!
I was going for the rat.
Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog.
More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent.
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.
Okay.
- You better go.
- No.
Don't worry, okay?
It's fine.
I'll stay.
You go, I'll stay.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
Go.
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.
They might chop it.
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
It's too late.
It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.
It'll be nice to do it again as a free man.
That was a noble thing you did back there.
He doesn't deserve it.
I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends to become killers.
Besides, dead, the truth dies with him.
Alive, you're free.
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!
Ron!
Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!
- Sweet, clever girl!
Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!
I don't know if you know, Harry but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather.
I know.
I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle but if you ever wanted a different home...
What?
Come and live with you?
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.
Harry!
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live!
Here!
This flesh is only flesh!
Expelliarmus!
Harry!
Remus!
Remus!
Run!
Run!
- Come on.
- Wait.
Wait.
Hermione!
Bad idea.
Bad idea.
Professor?
Professor Lupin?
Nice doggy.
Nice doggy!
There you are, Potter!
Sirius!
Come back here, Potter!
Sirius!
No.
Sirius!
Expecto Patronum!
Harry?
I saw my dad.
What?
He sent the dementors away.
I saw him across the lake.
Harry, they've captured Sirius.
Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.
- They're gonna kill him?
- No.
It's worse.
Much worse.
They're going to suck out his soul.
Headmaster, stop them.
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true.
Sirius is innocent.
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?
He's my rat, sir.
He's not really a rat.
He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.
But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.
A child's voice, however honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.
Mysterious thing, time.
Powerful and when meddled with, dangerous.
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen.
And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime.
If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss.
If you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared.
Three turns should do it, I think.
Oh, and by the way.
When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin.
Good luck.
What the bloody hell was that all about?
Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk...
What just happened?
- Where's Ron?
-7:30.
Where were we at 7:30?
I don't know.
Going to Hagrid's?
Come on.
And we can't be seen.
Hermione!
Hermione!
Hermione, wait.
Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
That's us.
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
This is not normal.
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first term.
This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.
Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.
Good punch.
Thanks.
Malfoy's coming.
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood!
Mark my words.
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Come on.
We should be at Hagrid's.
Look.
Buckbeak's still alive.
Of course.
Remember what Dumbledore said?
If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.
Let's go.
Here they come.
I'd better hurry.
Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.
Scabbers, you're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.
If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad.
Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time.
We can't be seen.
Fudge is coming.
And we aren't leaving?
Why aren't we leaving?
Are you mad?
That hurt.
Sorry.
We're coming out the back door.
Go!
Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
Hermione!
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go.
Okay, go, Harry.
Go!
Get away.
Get off.
Minister, I really think I should sign as well.
Yes, very well.
Perhaps it would be...
Okay, Buckbeak.
Come quickly.
Come with us now.
Come on.
Keep trying.
Come on.
Quickly.
Buckbeak.
Okay?
Quickly.
Hurry up.
Okay?
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.
Come and get the nice dead ferret.
- Come on.
It's here.
Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister.
Follow me.
- Now, look there.
- Where?
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?
Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
- Oh, yes.
Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.
- Come on, Buckbeak.
Come on.
- I see no strawberries.
- Over there.
- Where?
- Over there.
- This way.
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.
But where is it?
I saw the beast, just now.
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.
Buckbeak.
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.
I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.
- Right.
- Well, well...
We must search the grounds.
Well, search the skies, if you must, minister.
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy.
Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required.
Thank you.
You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor.
- Come on.
- This way.
This way, now.
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.
- How?
- No idea.
- Look.
It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!
And Snape's coming.
And now we wait.
And now we wait.
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.
- Hermione?
- Yeah?
Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius I did see someone.
That someone made the dementors go away.
With a Patronus.
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
According to him only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
It was my dad.
My dad conjured the Patronus.
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead.
I know.
I'm just telling you what I saw.
Here we come.
You see Sirius talking to me there?
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'.
It'll just be me and him.
We could live in the country someplace you can see the sky.
He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
Harry!
Run!
Let's go.
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.
Thanks.
- Great.
Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that.
Run!
That was so scary.
Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
Sirius.
Come on!
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.
Any minute now.
Right there.
You'll see.
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.
- Sirius.
- You're dying both of you.
Harry!
Expecto Patronum!
You were right, Hermione.
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!
I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.
I knew I could do it this time because well, I had already done it.
- Does that make sense?
- No.
But I don't like flying...!
Bombarda!
I'll be forever grateful for this to both of you.
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.
For some time, my life will be too unpredictable.
And besides...
- ... you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.
And you know it.
And for now, that will do.
I expect you're tired of hearing this but you look so like your father.
Except your eyes.
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.
It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little.
But know this:
The ones that love us never really leave us.
And you can always find them in here.
You really are the brightest witch of your age.
We have to go.
- Well?
- He's free.
We did it.
Did what?
Good night.
How did you get there?
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.
Honestly, Ron.
How can somebody be in two places at once?
Hello, Harry.
I saw you coming.
I've looked worse, believe me.
- You've been sacked.
- No.
No.
I resigned, actually.
Resigned?
Why?
Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition.
This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want well, someone like me teaching their children.
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already risked enough on my behalf.
Besides, people like me are...
Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now.
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
None of it made any difference.
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.
You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.
It made a great deal of difference.
If I am proud of anything it is of how much you have learned this year.
Now, since I am no longer your teacher I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you.
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
Until then mischief managed.
Stand back, I said!
Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle.
Harry.
Wherever did you get it?
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.
- Let the man through.
- I didn't mean to open it, Harry.
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.
Did not.
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.
For me?
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.
This came with it.
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.
How fast is it, Harry?
Lumos.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
Mischief managed.
Harry Potter 3
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima!
Harry.
Harry.
Harry, open the door.
Marge.
How lovely to see...
Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.
What is it?
Nothing.
School stuff.
Later perhaps, if you behave.
I will if she does.
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.
Don't say yes in that ungrateful way.
Damn good of my brother to keep you.
He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?
Give us a kiss.
Come on.
Up, up.
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
Okay.
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.
Excellent nosh, Petunia.
A bit more.
Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs.
Just a bit more.
That's a boy.
You wanna try a little drop of brandy?
A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?
What are you smirking at?
Where did you send the boy, Vernon?
St. Brutus'.
It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I've been beaten loads of times.
Excellent.
I won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it.
You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out.
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.
What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?
Nothing.
He didn't work.
He was unemployed.
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.
Don't worry.
Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.
I think it's time you went to bed.
Quiet, Vernon.
You, clean it up.
Actually, it's nothing to do with the father.
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.
If something's wrong with the bitch, then something's wrong with the pup.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Right.
Let me tell you...
Vernon!
Vernon!
Vernon, do something!
Stop!
I've got you, Marge.
I've got you.
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.
Oh, Vernon.
Oh, God.
Marge!
Please!
Marge!
Come back!
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.
- You put her right!
- No.
She deserved what she got.
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.
- Yeah?
Try me.
- They won't let you back now.
You've nowhere to go.
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.
"Welcome to the Knight Bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard.
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening."
What you doing down there?
- I fell over.
- What you fell over for?
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.
Well, come on, then.
In.
No, no, no.
I'll get this.
You get in.
Come on.
Come on.
Move on, move on.
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London.
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup make sure you eat it before it eats you.
- But the Muggles.
Can't they see us?
- Muggles?
They don't see nothing, do they?
No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel.
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!
Ten, nine, eight seven, six, five four, three, three and a half two, one and three quarters.
Yes!
Who is that?
That man.
Who is that?
Who is...?
That is Sirius Black, that is.
Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black.
He's a murderer.
Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?
He's the first one that done it.
He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.
I reckon you've heard of him.
Yeah.
Him I've heard of.
Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock.
They're getting closer, Ernie.
Ernie, they're right on top of us!
Mind your head.
Hey, guys?
Guys?
Why the long faces?
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there.
Nearly there.
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.
Mr. Potter, at last.
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!
Room 11.
Hedwig.
Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter.
He arrived here just five minutes before yourself.
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack.
The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately.
She has been properly punctured and her memory modified.
She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.
So that's that and no harm done.
Pea soup?
No, thank you.
- Minister?
- Yes?
- I don't understand.
- Understand?
I broke the law.
Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
Come now.
The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts.
On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things was very, very irresponsible.
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.
Sirius Black, you mean?
But what's he got to do with me?
Nothing, of course.
You're safe.
And that's what matters.
And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.
Hedwig.
Oh, by the way, Harry.
Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't wander.
Right!
You gonna move that bus or what?
Housekeeping.
I'll come back later.
I'm warning you, Hermione.
Keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?
- It's in his nature.
- A cat?
Is that what they told you?
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...
Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.
Harry.
Harry.
- Egypt.
What's it like?
- Brilliant.
Loads of old stuff like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.
- The day maid.
- Night maid.
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.
- Got everything?
- Yes.
- Yes?
All your books?
- It's all upstairs.
- Your clothes?
- Everything.
- Good boy.
- Thank you.
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah.
It should be great.
Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you.
But I think that you need to know the facts.
You are in danger.
Grave danger.
Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?
What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?
Thirteen years ago, when you stopped...
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.
Sorry.
When you stopped You-Know-Who Black lost everything.
But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant.
And in his mind you are the only thing that stands in the way of You-Know-Who returning to power.
And that is why he has escaped from Azkaban.
To find you.
And kill me.
Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear you won't go looking for Black.
Mr. Weasley why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
Quick.
Quick.
Ron, Ron!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Don't lose him!
I didn't mean to blow her up.
I just...
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
I was lucky not to be arrested.
I still think it was brilliant.
Come on.
Everywhere else is full.
Who do you think that is?
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?
How is it she knows everything?
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be.
Why?
I gotta tell you something.
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
- Yeah.
But they'll catch Black, won't they?
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.
Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.
Why are we stopping?
We can't be there yet.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.
Ouch, Ron.
That was my foot.
There's something moving out there.
I think someone's coming aboard.
Bloody hell!
What's happening?
Harry.
Harry, are you all right?
Thank you.
Here, eat this.
It'll help.
It's all right.
It's chocolate.
What was that thing that came?
It was a dementor.
One of the guards of Azkaban.
It's gone now.
It was searching the train for Sirius Black.
If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver.
Eat.
You'll feel better.
What happened to me?
Well, you sort of went rigid.
We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
And did either of you two you know pass out?
- No.
I felt weird, though.
Like I'd never be cheerful again.
But someone was screaming.
A woman.
No one was screaming, Harry.
Welcome!
Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.
Now, I'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast.
First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin who's kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
Good luck, professor.
Of course.
That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.
Potter.
Is it true you fainted?
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.
Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.
Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid.
Finally, on a more disquieting note at the request of the Ministry of Magic Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban until such a time as Sirius Black is captured.
The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
Now whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution.
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.
Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.
It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
But you know, happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light.
Fortuna Major.
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no.
Wait, wait.
Watch this.
- Amazing.
Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.
- Yes, all right.
Go in.
- Thank you.
Still doing that after three years.
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.
Green.
That's a monkey.
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?
Do not give him one again.
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
- Ron, catch.
- I will.
I think we have a winner.
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.
Look at him.
His face.
Welcome, my children.
In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination.
In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight.
Hello.
I am Professor Trelawney.
Together we shall cast ourselves into the future.
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves.
So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you.
What do you see?
The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read.
But first, you must broaden your minds.
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.
- Where did you come from?
- Me?
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...
Is your grandmother quite well?
I think so.
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.
Pity.
Broaden your minds.
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?
- I think you are.
- Sure.
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.
Yeah.
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.
And that there could be the sun and that's happiness.
So you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.
Give me the cup.
Oh, my dear boy.
My dear you have the Grim.
The Grin?
What's the Grin?
Not the Grin, you idiot.
The Grim.
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.
It's among the darkest omens in our world.
It's an omen of death."
You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Oh, honestly, Ron.
If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline.
Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.
Ancient Runes?
Exactly how many classes are you taking?
A fair few.
Hang on.
That's not possible.
Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.
You have to be in two classes at once.
Don't be silly.
How could anyone be in two classes at once?
"Broaden your minds.
Use your Inner Eye to see the future."
That's it.
Come on, now.
Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.
I got a real treat for you today.
A great lesson.
So follow me.
Right, you lot.
Less chattering.
Form a group over there.
And open your books to page 49.
Exactly how do we do that?
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay.
Okay.
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah.
Terribly funny.
Witty.
God, this place has gone to the dogs.
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.
Shut up, Malfoy.
Dementor!
Dementor!
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.
Yeah.
Isn't he beautiful?
Say hello to Buckbeak.
Hagrid, exactly what is that?
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.
First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
It may be the last thing you ever do.
Now, who'd like to come and say hello?
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Come on now.
Now you have to let him make the first move.
It's only polite.
So step up.
Give him a nice bow.
Then you wait and see if he bows back.
If he does, you can go and touch him.
If not...
Well, we'll get to that later.
Just make your bow.
Nice and low.
Back off, Harry.
Back off.
Keep still.
Keep still.
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.
Right.
I think you can go and pat him now.
Go on.
Don't be shy.
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow.
Slow.
Not so fast, Harry.
Slow down, Harry.
That's it...
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...
That's it...
Yes!
Well done!
Well done, Harry, well done!
Does he get to fly?
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Put you over here, just behind the wing joint.
Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that.
Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak.
That was wicked, Harry!
Oh, please.
Well done, well done.
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.
You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!
Malfoy, no...
No!
Buckbeak!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa!
Buckbeak!
Away, you silly creature...
- It's killed me!
- Calm down.
It's just a scratch!
Hagrid!
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher.
I'll do it.
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!
You and your bloody chicken!
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.
Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm.
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.
- He's been sighted!
- Who?
Sirius Black!
Dufftown?
That's not far from here.
You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?
That's right.
Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.
Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
Intriguing, isn't it?
Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what is inside?
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.
Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...
Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart.
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.
After me.
Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.
A little louder and very clear.
00:39:18,332... 00:39:20,437
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.
So much for the easy part.
You see, the incantation alone is not enough.
What really finishes a boggart is laughter.
You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.
Let me explain.
Neville, would you join me, please?
Come on, don't be shy.
Come on.
Come on.
Hello.
Neville, what frightens you most of all?
Professor Snape.
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.
Professor Snape.
Yes, frightens all.
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.
No it won't.
I want you to picture her clothes.
Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe here's what I want you to do.
Excuse me.
Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.
Can you do that?
Yes.
Wand at the ready.
One, two, three.
Think, Neville, think.
Riddikulus!
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible!
Okay to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...
Form a line!
I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most and turn it into something funny.
Next!
Ron!
Concentrate.
Face your fear.
Be brave!
Wand at the ready, Ron.
Riddikulus!
Yes!
You see?
Very good, very good!
Marvelous!
Absolutely, very, very enjoyable!
Parvati!
Next!
Show us what you see.
Keep your nerve.
Steady.
Riddikulus!
And next!
Step up, step up!
Wonderful, wonderful!
Here!
Riddikulus!
Right.
Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.
Collect your books from the back.
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you!
Sorry!
Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege.
Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school that privilege shall not be extended again.
No permission form signed, no visiting the village.
That's the rule, Potter.
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.
I thought if you signed it, then I could...
I can't.
Only a parent or a guardian can sign.
Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate.
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.
Forget about it, guys.
See you later.
Professor, can I ask you something?
You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?
I thought it'd be obvious.
I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.
I did think of Voldemort at first.
But then I remembered that night on the train and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.
That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.
This is very wise.
Before I fainted I heard something.
A woman screaming.
Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.
Our pain becomes their power.
I think it was my mother the night she was murdered.
The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.
Not by your scar, by your eyes.
They're your mother, Lily's.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
I knew her.
Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.
Not only was she a singularly gifted witch she was also an uncommonly kind woman.
She had a way of seeing the beauty in others even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves.
And your father, James, on the other hand he...
He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble.
A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.
You're more like them than you know, Harry.
In time, you'll come to see just how much.
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain.
I know.
What's going on?
Probably Neville forgot the password again.
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.
Let me through, please.
Excuse me!
I'm Head Boy!
Get back, all of you.
No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.
The Fat Lady!
She's gone!
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.
It's not funny, Ron.
Keep calm, everyone.
Break into fours.
Back to your common room.
- Be quiet.
- Make way.
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.
You heard.
Move!
Mr. Filch?
Round up the ghosts.
Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
There's no need for ghosts, professor.
The Fat Lady's there.
Mind where you're going!
Slow down!
You listen!
I'm Head Boy!
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!
Dear lady, who did this to you?
Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.
He's here, somewhere in the castle!
Sirius Black!
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery.
There's nothing there.
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.
I didn't really expect him to linger.
Remarkable feat, don't you think?
To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own...
Any theories on how he managed it?
Many.
Each as unlikely as the next.
You may recall prior to the start of term I expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor...
Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?
Perhaps.
But for now, let him sleep.
For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.
Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
Turn to page 394.
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?
That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?
Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time.
Turn to page 394.
"Werewolves"?
Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?
Now, which one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?
No one?
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.
An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
A werewolf has no choice.
With each full moon he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.
The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.
Are you incapable of restraining yourself or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.
As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.
Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter.
Loss of limb will not excuse you.
Page 394.
The term "werewolf" is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer" which means "man," and "wolf." Werewolf, man-wolf.
There are several ways to become a werewolf.
They include being given the power of shape-shifting being bitten by a werewolf...
Go, Harry!
Go, Harry!
Aresto momentum!
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.
Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.
Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.
You gave us a right good scare.
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.
Really?
I meant the match.
Who won?
No one blames you, Harry.
Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds.
Dumbledore's furious.
After he saved you, he sent them off.
There's something else you should know too.
When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and...
Well...
I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.
Is there no chance of fixing it?
No.
Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.
Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.
They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.
You are not weak, Harry.
Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.
Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.
You made the one on the train go away.
There was only one that night.
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.
But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.
For now, I need to rest.
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.
We'll get you there.
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- If you pipe down.
- Bless him.
- Let me go!
Come on, guys.
Don't...
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.
What are you doing?
!
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...
But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
George, if you will.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder's Map."
We owe them so much.
Hang on.
This is Hogwarts.
And that...
- No.
Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.
- In his study.
- Pacing.
Does that a lot.
- So this map shows...?
- Everyone.
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.
- Every minute.
- Every day.
- Brilliant!
Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.
Hurry.
Filch is heading this way.
And don't forget.
When you're done, 00:58:14,779... 00:58:18,936 "Mischief managed." Otherwise, anyone can read it.
Now, how much do you want?
Delicious.
It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain.
Did I mention that?
Twice.
Do you want to move a bit closer?
To the Shrieking Shack?
Actually, I'm fine here.
Well, well.
Look who's here.
You two shopping for your new dream home?
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.
Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!
You filthy little mudblood!
Who is that?
- Don't stand there!
Do something!
- What?
What's up, Malfoy?
Lost your skis?
Get out of the way!
Move!
Malfoy!
Wait!
Wait!
Harry!
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.
Those weasels!
Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
He won't keep it.
He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.
- Aren't you?
- Sure.
Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
Look who it is.
Madam Rosmerta.
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!
Allow me, minister.
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors...
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors into my pub every other night!
- We have...
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
And what would bring him here?
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?
Come.
Harry!
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!
- So rude.
- Thick heads.
- Thick heads?
!
- How dare they!
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!
Nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place.
Tell me what this is all about.
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death...
Remember?
They hid.
Few knew where they were.
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.
Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night he also killed Peter Pettigrew!
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.
Never let James and Sirius out of his sight.
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters and might have, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.
He destroyed him!
A finger.
That's all that was left.
A finger.
Nothing else.
Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.
- What could be worse?
- This:
Sirius Black was and remains to this day Harry Potter's godfather!
Ron, look!
- Sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.
Harry, what happened?
He was their friend and he betrayed them.
He was their friend!
I hope he finds me.
Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!
Harry.
There you are.
You came.
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level.
I'm sure.
Well, everything's prepared.
The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm.
Did you ever hear of it?
No?
Well...
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.
But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory.
Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.
Can you do this?
Yes.
Very well.
Close your eyes.
Concentrate.
Explore your past.
Do you have a memory?
Allow it to fill you up.
Lose yourself within it.
Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum.
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.
Shall we?
Wand at the ready.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto...
Expecto...
Expect...
Here we go.
Come on.
Sit up.
Deep breaths.
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to do it the first time.
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this.
You'll feel better.
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.
As a matter of interest, what were you thinking?
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.
Well, it is.
It's the happiest I've ever felt but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?
Then let's give it a try.
You feel ready?
Just do it.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto Patronum!
Yes!
Well done, Harry.
Well done!
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes.
Sit down.
Here.
Eat this, it helps.
It really helps.
And just so you know, Harry I think you'd have given your father a run for his money.
And that is saying something.
I was thinking of him.
And Mum.
Seeing their faces.
They were talking to me.
Just talking.
That's the memory I chose.
I don't even know if it's real.
But it's the best I have.
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.
Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.
- Did.
- Didn't.
How did it go, Hagrid?
The hearing?
Well, first off, the committee members took turns talking about why we were there.
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers.
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.
He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you.
And then?
And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
Spiders!
There's...
There's spiders.
Spiders.
They want me to tap-dance.
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- You tell those spiders.
Right, yeah.
Tell them.
I'll tell them...
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!
Mischief managed.
Nox.
Potter.
What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
I was sleepwalking.
How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter.
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.
My dad didn't strut.
And nor do I.
Now, if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.
Turn out your pockets.
Turn out your pockets!
What's this?
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really?
Open it.
Reveal your secrets.
Read it.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."
Go on.
"And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business."
- You insolent little...
- Professor!
Well, well.
Lupin.
Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?
Harry, are you all right?
That remains to be seen.
I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.
It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.
Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.
It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise.
Harry, would you come with me, please?
Professor, good night.
Are you deaf?
Put that light out!
Come in.
I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in.
Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black is a map to you?
- No.
- No, sir.
Your father never set much store by the rules either.
But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.
Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!
Now, I will not cover up for you again.
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.
I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.
Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works.
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.
Oh, really?
And who might that be?
Peter Pettigrew.
That's not possible.
It's just what I saw.
Good night, professor.
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.
The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.
Only then can you see.
Try again.
Now, what do we have here?
Do you mind me trying?
The Grim, possibly.
My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.
You may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave.
Have I said something?
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental but now it's in the open for everyone to see.
Hang on.
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.
- Fine.
See you later.
- See you.
Harry Potter...
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.
Sorry?
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder shall break free.
Innocent blood shall be spilt and servant and master shall be reunited once more.
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?
No.
Nothing.
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak.
It's just too horrible.
- It just got worse.
- What did I say?
Father said I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.
This is going to be rich.
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?
You!
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
Malfoy, are you okay?
- Let's go.
Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Look at him.
Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
Why don't we just set him free?
They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.
Says he wants to be with me when they...
When it happens.
Great man, Dumbledore.
A great man.
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!
Think I want you seeing something like that?
No.
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh.
Before you do, Ron...
Scabbers!
You're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.
Right.
Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.
I meant me!
Blimey.
What was that?
Hagrid!
Oh, crikey.
No, minister.
Over this way.
It's late.
It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.
Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble.
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!
Quick.
Quick!
Hagrid.
- It'll be fine.
It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.
- On the slope...
Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.
- Good evening.
- Minister.
Make your way through.
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.
Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we?
Very well.
It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak hereinafter called "the condemned," shall be executed this day at sundown.
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid.
Now, come on.
- All right.
It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go!
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Oh, no.
He bit me.
Scabbers.
Ron.
Ron!
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.
Wait!
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
That's not good.
Ron, run!
Harry, Hermione, run!
It's the Grim!
- Harry!
- Ron!
Ron, wait!
Harry!
- Help!
- Ron!
- Ron.
Ron.
- Ron!
Come on!
Move!
Duck!
Harry!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.
I just hope I'm wrong.
We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
Come on.
Ron.
- Ron.
You're okay.
- The dog.
Where is it?
It's a trap.
He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.
If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!
No.
Only one will die tonight.
Then it'll be you!
Are you going to kill me, Harry?
Expelliarmus!
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?
Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within.
Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you?
- I found him.
- I know.
- He's here.
- I understand.
- Let's kill him!
- No!
I trusted you!
And all this time, you've been his friend.
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.
How long have you known?
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.
You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!
Twelve years of it!
In Azkaban!
Very well.
Kill him.
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.
I know why.
You betrayed my parents.
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.
Somebody did betray your parents somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!
And he's in this room!
Right now!
Come out, come out, Peter!
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!
Vengeance is sweet.
How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
Severus...
I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle.
Here's the proof.
Brilliant, Snape.
You put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion.
If you'll excuse us, Remus and I have business to attend to.
- Give me a reason.
I beg you!
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it.
It's habit.
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!
You two, quarrelling like an old married couple.
Run along and play with your chemistry set!
I could do it, you know.
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.
A Dementor's Kiss.
One can only imagine what that must be like.
It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.
Severus, please.
After you.
Expelliarmus!
- Harry!
What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.
We thought he was our friend!
- No.
Pettigrew's dead.
You killed him!
- No, he didn't.
I thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map!
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!
- Me?
!
He's mental!
- Not you!
Your rat!
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?
Curiously long life for a common garden rat!
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!
Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?
Scabbers!
Leave him alone!
Get off him!
What are you doing?
Remus?
Sirius.
My old friends!
Harry!
Look at you.
You look so much like your father.
- James.
We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!
How dare you talk about James in front of him!
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!
The Dark Lord.
You have no idea the weapons he possesses!
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!
James wouldn't have wanted me killed!
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!
Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would.
Together!
No!
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.
But we'll take him to the castle.
- Bless you, boy.
Bless you!
- Get off!
I said we'd take you to the castle.
After that, the dementors can have you.
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.
A bit?
A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!
I was going for the rat.
Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog.
More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent.
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.
Okay.
- You better go.
- No.
Don't worry, okay?
It's fine.
I'll stay.
You go, I'll stay.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
Go.
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.
They might chop it.
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
It's too late.
It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.
It'll be nice to do it again as a free man.
That was a noble thing you did back there.
He doesn't deserve it.
I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends to become killers.
Besides, dead, the truth dies with him.
Alive, you're free.
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!
Ron!
Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!
- Sweet, clever girl!
Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!
I don't know if you know, Harry but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather.
I know.
I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle but if you ever wanted a different home...
What?
Come and live with you?
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.
Harry!
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live!
Here!
This flesh is only flesh!
Expelliarmus!
Harry!
Remus!
Remus!
Run!
Run!
- Come on.
- Wait.
Wait.
Hermione!
Bad idea.
Bad idea.
Professor?
Professor Lupin?
Nice doggy.
Nice doggy!
There you are, Potter!
Sirius!
Come back here, Potter!
Sirius!
No.
Sirius!
Expecto Patronum!
Harry?
I saw my dad.
What?
He sent the dementors away.
I saw him across the lake.
Harry, they've captured Sirius.
Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.
- They're gonna kill him?
- No.
It's worse.
Much worse.
They're going to suck out his soul.
Headmaster, stop them.
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true.
Sirius is innocent.
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?
He's my rat, sir.
He's not really a rat.
He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.
But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.
A child's voice, however honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.
Mysterious thing, time.
Powerful and when meddled with, dangerous.
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen.
And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime.
If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss.
If you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared.
Three turns should do it, I think.
Oh, and by the way.
When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin.
Good luck.
What the bloody hell was that all about?
Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk...
What just happened?
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.
Where were we at 7:30?
I don't know.
Going to Hagrid's?
Come on.
And we can't be seen.
Hermione!
Hermione!
Hermione, wait.
Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
That's us.
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
This is not normal.
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first term.
This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.
Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.
Good punch.
Thanks.
Malfoy's coming.
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood!
Mark my words.
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Come on.
We should be at Hagrid's.
Look.
Buckbeak's still alive.
Of course.
Remember what Dumbledore said?
If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.
Let's go.
Here they come.
I'd better hurry.
Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.
Scabbers, you're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.
If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad.
Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time.
We can't be seen.
Fudge is coming.
And we aren't leaving?
Why aren't we leaving?
Are you mad?
That hurt.
Sorry.
We're coming out the back door.
Go!
Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go.
Okay, go, Harry.
Go!
Get away.
Get off.
Minister, I really think I should sign as well.
Yes, very well.
Perhaps it would be...
Okay, Buckbeak.
Come quickly.
Come with us now.
Come on.
Keep trying.
Come on.
Quickly.
Buckbeak.
Okay?
Quickly.
Hurry up.
Okay?
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.
Come and get the nice dead ferret.
- Come on.
It's here.
Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister.
Follow me.
- Now, look there.
- Where?
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?
Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
- Oh, yes.
Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.
- Come on, Buckbeak.
Come on.
- I see no strawberries.
- Over there.
- Where?
- Over there.
- This way.
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.
But where is it?
I saw the beast, just now.
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.
Buckbeak.
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.
I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.
- Right.
- Well, well...
We must search the grounds.
Well, search the skies, if you must, minister.
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy.
Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required.
Thank you.
You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor.
- Come on.
- This way.
This way, now.
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.
- How?
- No idea.
- Look.
It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!
And Snape's coming.
And now we wait.
And now we wait.
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.
- Hermione?
- Yeah?
Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius I did see someone.
That someone made the dementors go away.
With a Patronus.
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
According to him only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
It was my dad.
My dad conjured the Patronus.
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead.
I know.
I'm just telling you what I saw.
Here we come.
You see Sirius talking to me there?
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'.
It'll just be me and him.
We could live in the country someplace you can see the sky.
He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
Harry!
Run!
Let's go.
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.
Thanks.
- Great.
Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that.
Run!
That was so scary.
Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
Sirius.
Come on!
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.
Any minute now.
Right there.
You'll see.
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.
- Sirius.
- You're dying both of you.
Harry!
Expecto Patronum!
You were right, Hermione.
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!
I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.
I knew I could do it this time because well, I had already done it.
- Does that make sense?
- No.
But I don't like flying!
Bombarda!
I'll be forever grateful for this to both of you.
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.
For some time, my life will be too unpredictable.
And besides you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.
And you know it.
And for now, that will do.
I expect you're tired of hearing this but you look so like your father.
Except your eyes.
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.
It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little.
But know this:
The ones that love us never really leave us.
And you can always find them in here.
You really are the brightest witch of your age.
We have to go.
- Well?
- He's free.
We did it.
Did what?
Good night.
How did you get there?
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.
Honestly, Ron.
How can somebody be in two places at once?
Hello, Harry.
I saw you coming.
I've looked worse, believe me.
- You've been sacked.
- No.
No.
I resigned, actually.
Resigned?
Why?
Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition.
This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want well, someone like me teaching their children.
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already risked enough on my behalf.
Besides, people like me are...
Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now.
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
None of it made any difference.
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.
You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.
It made a great deal of difference.
If I am proud of anything it is of how much you have learned this year.
Now, since I am no longer your teacher I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you.
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
Until then mischief managed.
Stand back, I said!
Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle.
Harry.
Wherever did you get it?
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.
Did not.
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.
For me?
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.
This came with it.
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.
How fast is it, Harry?
Lumos.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
Mischief managed.
anoXmous ;)
Lumos Maxima

Nothing.
He didn£¬t work.
He was unemployed

-That£¬s a lie
-What did you say?
-My dad wasn£¬t a drunk
Don£¬t worry.
Don£¬t fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip I think it£¬s time you went to bed
Quiet, vernon.

Yeah
Him I£¬ve heard of
Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o£¬clock
They£¬re getting closer, Ernie
Ernie, they£¬re right on top of us!
Mind your head
Hey, guys?
Guys?
Why the long faces?
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there.
Nearly there
-The Leaky Cauldron.
-Next stop, knockturn Alley
Mr. Potter, at last
-Take it away, Ern.
-Yeah, take it away, Ernie!
Room 1 1
Hedwig
Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter
He arrived here just five minutes before yourself
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter¡­
¡­earlier this evening your uncle£¬s sister was located¡­
¡­a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack
The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately
She has been properly punctured and her memory modified
She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever
So that£¬s that¡­
¡­and no harm done
Pea soup?
No, thank you
-Minister?
-Yes?
-l don£¬t understand.
-Understand?
I broke the law.
Underage wizards can£¬t use magic at home
Come now.
The Ministry doesn£¬t send people to Azkaban¡­
¡­for blowing up their aunts
on the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things¡­
¡­was very, very irresponsible
-"The state of things," sir?
-We have a killer on the loose
Sirius Black, you mean?
But what£¬s he got to do with me?
Nothing, of course.
You£¬re safe.
And that£¬s what matters
And tomorrow you£¬ll be on your way back to Hogwarts
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty¡­
¡­of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room
Hedwig oh, by the way, Harry.
Whilst you£¬re here, it would be best if you didn£¬t¡­
¡­wander
Right!
You gonna move that bus or what?
Housekeeping
I£¬ll come back later
I£¬m warning you, Hermione keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I£¬ll turn it into a tea cozy lt£¬s a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?
-lt£¬s in his nature.
-A cat?
is that what they told you?
-Looks like a pig with hair.
-That£¬s rich¡­
¡­coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush
Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy
Harry
Harry
-Egypt.
What£¬s it like?
-Brilliant.
Loads of old stuff¡­
¡­like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself
-Egyptians used to worship cats.
-Along with the dung beetle
-Not flashing that clipping again?
-l haven£¬t shown anyone
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom
-The day maid.
-Night maid
-Cook.
-The bloke who fixed the toilet
-Harry.
-Mrs.
Weasley
-Good to see you, dear.
-Good to see you
-Got everything?
-Yes
-Yes?
All your books?
-lt£¬s all upstairs
-Your clothes?
-Everything
-Good boy.
-Thank you
-Harry Potter.
-Mr.
Weasley
-Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
-Yeah, sure
-Hermione.
-Good morning, Mr. Weasley
-Looking forward to a new term?
-Yeah. lt should be great
Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me¡­
¡­from divulging what I£¬m about to reveal to you
But I think that you need to know the facts
You are in danger
Grave danger
Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?
What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?
-only that he£¬s escaped from Azkaban.
-Do you know why?
Thirteen years ago, when you stopped¡­
-voldemort.
-Don£¬t say his name
Sorry
When you stopped You-know-Who¡­
¡­Black lost everything
But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant
And in his mind¡­
¡­you are the only thing that stands in the way¡­
¡­of You-know-Who returning to power
And that is why¡­
¡­he has escaped from Azkaban
To find you
And kill me
Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear¡­
¡­you won£¬t go looking for Black
Mr. Weasley¡­
¡­why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
Quick.
Quick
Ron, Ron!
oh, for goodness£¬ sake!
Don£¬t lose him!
I didn£¬t mean to blow her up. I just- l lost control.
-Brilliant
Honestly, Ron, it£¬s not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled I was lucky not to be arrested I still think it was brilliant
Come on.
Everywhere else is full
Who do you think that is?
-Professor R.J. Lupin.
-Do you know everything?
How is it she knows everything?
-lt£¬s on his suitcase, Ronald.
-oh
-Do you think he£¬s really asleep?
-Seems to be.
Why?
I gotta tell you something
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban¡­
-¡­to come after you?
-Yeah
But they£¬ll catch Black, won£¬t they?
-l mean, everyone£¬s looking for him.
-Sure
Except no one£¬s ever broken out of Azkaban before¡­
-¡­and he£¬s a murderous, raving lunatic.
-Thanks, Ron
Why are we stopping?
We can£¬t be there yet
What£¬s going on?
I don£¬t know.
Maybe we£¬ve broken down ouch, Ron.
That was my foot
There£¬s something moving out there
I think someone£¬s coming aboard
Bloody hell!
What£¬s happening?
Harry
Harry, are you all right?
Thank you
Here, eat this. lt£¬ll help lt£¬s all right. lt£¬s chocolate
What was that thing that came?
It was a dementor. one of the guards of Azkaban. lt£¬s gone now lt was searching the train for Sirius Black lf you£¬ll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver
Eat.
You£¬ll feel better
What happened to me?
Well, you sort of went rigid
We thought maybe you were having a fit or something
And did either of you two¡­
¡­you know¡­
-¡­pass out?
-No I felt weird, though
Like I£¬d never be cheerful again
But someone was screaming
A woman
No one was screaming, Harry
Welcome!
Welcome to another year at Hogwarts
Now, I£¬d like to say a few words¡­
¡­before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast
First, I£¬m pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin¡­
¡­who£¬s kindly consented to fill the post¡­
¡­of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher
Good luck, professor
of course.
That£¬s why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry
Potter. ls it true you fainted?
-l mean, you actually fainted?
-Shove off, Malfoy
-How did he find out?
-Just forget it our Care of Magical Creatures teacher¡­
¡­has decided to retire¡­
¡­in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs
Fortunately, I£¬m delighted to announce¡­
¡­that his place will be taken by none other¡­
¡­than our own Rubeus Hagrid
Finally, on a more disquieting note¡­
¡­at the request of the Ministry of Magic¡­
¡­Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban¡­
¡­until such a time as Sirius Black is captured
The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds
Now whilst I£¬ve been assured¡­
¡­that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities¡­
¡­a word of caution
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They£¬ll not distinguish¡­
¡­between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way
Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you¡­
¡­to give them no reason to harm you lt is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving
But you know, happiness can be found¡­
¡­even in the darkest of times¡­
¡­if one only remembers to turn on the light
Fortuna Major
Here, listen.
She just won£¬t let me in
-Fortuna Major.
-No, no.
Wait, wait
Watch this
-Amazing.
Just with my voice.
-Fortuna Major
-Yes, all right.
Go in.
-Thank you
Still doing that after three years
-She can£¬t even sing.
-Exactly
-Hey, man.
-Hey, man
-oh, God.
-That£¬s awful
Green.
That£¬s a monkey
-What is that?
-You call that a monkey?
Do not give him one again
Hey, Neville, try an elephant
-Ron, catch.
-l will
I think we have a winner
-oh, don£¬t try one of them.
-oh, no
Look at him.
His face
Welcome, my children ln this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination ln this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight
Hello. I am Professor Trelawney
Together we shall cast ourselves into the future
This term, we£¬ll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves
So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you
What do you see?
The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read
But first, you must broaden your minds
-First, you must look beyond.
-What a load of rubbish
-Where did you come from?
-Me?
-l£¬ve been here all this time.
-You, boy¡­ ls your grandmother quite well?
I think so I wouldn£¬t be so sure of that.
Give me the cup
Pity
Broaden your minds
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?
-l think you are.
-Sure
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see
Yeah
Harry£¬s got sort of a wonky cross.
That£¬s trials and suffering
And that there could be the sun and that£¬s happiness
So¡­
¡­you£¬re gonna suffer, but you£¬re gonna be happy about it
Give me the cup oh, my dear boy
My dear¡­
¡­you have the Grim
The Grin?
What£¬s the Grin?
Not the Grin, you idiot.
The Grim
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog lt£¬s among the darkest omens in our world lt£¬s an omen¡­
¡­of death."
You don£¬t think that Grim thing£¬s got anything to do with Sirius Black?
oh, honestly, Ron. lf you ask me, Divination£¬s a woolly discipline
Now, Ancient Runes, that£¬s a fascinating subject
Ancient Runes?
Exactly how many classes are you taking?
A fair few
Hang on.
That£¬s not possible
Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination
You have to be in two classes at once
Don£¬t be silly.
How could anyone be in two classes at once?
"Broaden your minds.
Use your inner Eye to see the future."
That£¬s it.
Come on, now.
Come closer.
Less talking, if you don£¬t mind I got a real treat for you today
A great lesson.
So follow me
Right, you lot.
Less chattering.
Form a group over there
And open your books to page 49
Exactly how do we do that?
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me
-Don£¬t be such a wimp, Longbottom.
-l£¬m okay. okay
-l think they£¬re funny.
-oh, yeah.
Terribly funny
Witty.
God, this place has gone to the dogs
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore£¬s got this oaf teaching classes
Shut up, Malfoy
Dementor!
Dementor!
-Just ignore him.
-You£¬re supposed to stroke it
Yeah
Isn£¬t he beautiful?
Say hello to Buckbeak
Hagrid, exactly what is that?
That, Ron, is a hippogriff
First thing you wanna know is they£¬re very proud creatures very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff lt may be the last thing you ever do
Now, who£¬d like to come and say hello?
Well done, Harry.
Well done
Come on now
Now¡­
¡­you have to let him make the first move. lt£¬s only polite.
So¡­
¡­step up.
Give him a nice bow
Then you wait and see if he bows back lf he does, you can go and touch him lf not-
- Well, we£¬ll get to that later
Just make your bow
Nice and low
Back off, Harry.
Back off keep still keep still
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Here, you big brute, you
Right. I think you can go and pat him now
Go on.
Don£¬t be shy
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow.
Slow
Not so fast, Harry
Slow down, Harry.
That£¬s it¡­
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly¡­
That£¬s it¡­
Yes!
Well done!
Well done, Harry, well done!
Does he get to fly?
-l think he may let you ride him now.
-What?
-Come on.
-Hey, hey, hey!
Put you over here, just behind the wing joint
Don£¬t pull out any of his feathers, because he won£¬t thank you for that
Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak
That was wicked, Harry!
oh, please
Well done, well done
-How am I doing me first day?
-Brilliant, professor
You£¬re not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!
Malfoy, no¡­
No!
Buckbeak!
Whoa, whoa, whoa¡­
Whoa!
Buckbeak!
Away, you silly creature¡­
-lt£¬s killed me!
-Calm down. lt£¬s just a scratch!
Hagrid!
-He has to be taken to the hospital.
-l£¬m the teacher. I£¬ll do it
-You£¬re gonna regret this.
-Class dismissed!
You and your bloody chicken!
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky
Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could£¬ve lost my arm
-l can£¬t do homework for weeks.
-Listen to the idiot
-He£¬s really laying it on thick, isn£¬t he?
-At least Hagrid didn£¬t get fired I hear Draco£¬s father£¬s furious.
We haven£¬t heard the end of this
-He£¬s been sighted!
-Who?
Sirius Black!
Dufftown?
That£¬s not far from here
You don£¬t think he£¬d come to Hogwarts, do you?
-With dementors at every entrance?
-Dementors?
He slipped past them once.
Who£¬s to say he won£¬t do it again?
That£¬s right.
Black could be anywhere.
It£¬s like trying to catch smoke
Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands
lntriguing, isn£¬t it?
Would anyone like to venture a guess¡­
¡­as to what is inside?
-That£¬s a boggart, that is.
-very good, Mr. Thomas
Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
-No one knows.
-When did she get here?
Boggarts are shape-shifters
They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most
-That£¬s what makes them so--
-So terrifying, yes, yes, yes¡­
Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart
Let£¬s practice it now.
Without wands, please
After me.
Riddikulus!
-Riddikulus!
-very good
A little louder and very clear.
Listen£º
-Riddikulus!
-Riddikulus!
-This class is ridiculous.
-very good
So much for the easy part.
You see, the incantation alone is not enough
What really finishes a boggart is laughter
You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing
Let me explain.
Neville, would you join me, please?
Come on, don£¬t be shy.
Come on
Come on
Hello.
Neville, what frightens you most of all?
Professor Snape
-Sorry?
-Professor Snape
Professor Snape.
Yes, frightens all
-You live with your grandmother.
-l don£¬t want it to turn into her, either
No¡­
¡­it won£¬t. I want you to picture her clothes only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind
-She carries a red handbag--
-We don£¬t need to hear
As long as you see it, we£¬ll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe¡­
¡­here£¬s what I want you to do.
Excuse me imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother£¬s clothes
Can you do that?
Yes.
Wand at the ready one, two, three
Think, Neville, think
Riddikulus!
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible!
okay¡­
¡­to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line¡­
Form a line!
I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most¡­
¡­and turn it into something funny
Next!
Ron!
Concentrate.
Face your fear.
Be brave!
Wand at the ready, Ron
Riddikulus!
Yes!
You see?
very good, very good!
Marvelous!
Absolutely, very, very enjoyable!
Parvati!
Next!
Show us what you see
keep your nerve.
Steady
Riddikulus!
And next!
Step up, step up!
Wonderful, wonderful!
Here!
Riddikulus!
Right.
Sorry about that.
That£¬s enough for today
Collect your books from the back
That£¬s the end of the lesson.
Thank you!
Sorry!
Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege
Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school¡­
¡­that privilege shall not be extended again
No permission form signed, no visiting the village
That£¬s the rule, Potter
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put I thought if you signed it, then I could-- l can£¬t. only a parent or a guardian can sign
Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate I£¬m sorry, Potter.
That£¬s my final word
Forget about it, guys.
See you later
Professor, can I ask you something?
You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?
I thought it£¬d be obvious I assumed it would take the shape of Lord voldemort I did think of voldemort at first
But then I remembered that night on the train¡­
-¡­and the dementor.
-l£¬m very impressed
That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself
This is very wise
Before I fainted¡­
¡­l heard something
A woman¡­
¡­screaming
Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories our pain becomes their power I think it was my mother¡­
¡­the night she was murdered
The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately
Not by your scar, by your eyes
They£¬re your mother, Lily£¬s
Yes oh, yes. I knew her
Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was
Not only was she a singularly gifted witch¡­
¡­she was also an uncommonly kind woman
She had a way of seeing the beauty in others¡­
¡­even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves
And your father, James, on the other hand¡­
¡­he¡­
He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble
A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you
You£¬re more like them than you know, Harry ln time, you£¬ll come to see just how much
Honeyduke£¬s Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko£¬s Joke Shop
We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack
-You heard it£¬s the most--
-Haunted building in Britain. I know
What£¬s going on?
Probably Neville forgot the password again
-Hey.
-oh, you£¬re there
Let me through, please.
Excuse me!
I£¬m Head Boy!
Get back, all of you
No one is to enter this dormitory until it£¬s been searched
The Fat Lady!
She£¬s gone!
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer lt£¬s not funny, Ron keep calm, everyone.
Break into fours.
Back to your common room
-Be quiet.
-Make way
-The headmaster£¬s here.
-Come on, move
You heard.
Move!
Mr. Filch?
Round up the ghosts
Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady
There£¬s no need for ghosts, professor
The Fat Lady£¬s there
Mind where you£¬re going!
Slow down!
You listen!
I£¬m Head Boy!
-Come back here!
-keep moving!
Dear lady, who did this to you?
Eyes like the devil, he£¬s got, and a soul as dark as his name lt£¬s him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about
He£¬s here, somewhere in the castle!
Sirius Black!
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall
I£¬ve searched the Astronomy Tower and the owlery.
There£¬s nothing there
-Thank you.
-The third floor£¬s clear too, sir
-very good.
-l£¬ve done the dungeons
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle I didn£¬t really expect him to linger
Remarkable feat, don£¬t you think?
To enter Hogwarts Castle on one£¬s own¡­
-¡­completely undetected?
-Quite remarkable, yes
Any theories on how he managed it?
Many.
Each as unlikely as the next
You may recall¡­
¡­prior to the start of term I expressed concerns¡­
¡­about your appointment of Professor--
Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it I£¬m quite convinced the castle is safe¡­
¡­and I£¬m more than willing to send the students to their houses
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?
Perhaps.
But for now, let him sleep
For in dreams, we enter a world that£¬s entirely our own
Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud
Turn to page 394
Excuse me, sir.
Where£¬s Professor Lupin?
That£¬s not really your concern, is it, Potter?
Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching¡­
¡­at the present time.
Turn to page 394
"Werewolves"?
Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks
-We£¬re not meant to start that for weeks.
-Quiet
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?
Now, which one of you can tell me the difference¡­
¡­between an Animagus and a werewolf?
No one?
-How disappointing.
-Please, sir
An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal
A werewolf has no choice
With each full moon¡­
¡­he no longer remembers who he is.
He£¬d kill his best friend
The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That£¬s the second time¡­
¡­you£¬ve spoken out of turn, Miss Granger
Are you incapable of restraining yourself¡­
¡­or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
-He£¬s got a point, you know.
-Five points from Gryffindor
As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning¡­
¡­two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis¡­
-¡­on recognizing it.
-lt£¬s Quidditch tomorrow
Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter
Loss of limb will not excuse you
Page 394
The term "werewolf"¡­
¡­is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer"¡­
¡­which means "man," and "wolf." Werewolf, man-wolf
There are several ways to become a werewolf
They include being given the power of shape-shifting¡­
¡­being bitten by a werewolf¡­
Go, Harry!
Go, Harry!
Aresto momentum!
-He looks a bit peaky, doesn£¬t he?
-Peaky?
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet
Let£¬s walk you off a tower and see what you look like
Probably a right sight better than he normally does
-How are you feeling?
-oh, brilliant
You gave us a right good scare
-What happened?
-Well, you fell off your broom
Really?
I meant the match.
Who won?
No one blames you, Harry
Dementors aren£¬t supposed to be on the grounds.
Dumbledore£¬s furious
After he saved you, he sent them off
There£¬s something else you should know too
When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and¡­
Well¡­
I'm sorry to hear about yourbroomstick ls there no chance of fixing it?
No
Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?
-l mean, more than everyone else?
-Listen
Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth
They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory¡­
¡­until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences
You are not weak, Harry
Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past
Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine
You have nothing to be ashamed of
-l£¬m scared, professor.
-l£¬d consider you a fool if you weren£¬t l need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me
You made the one on the train go away
There was only one that night
-But you made it go away.
-l don£¬t pretend to be an expert, Harry
But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you¡­
¡­perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays
For now, I need to rest
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!
-Guys, let me go.
-Clever, Harry
-But not clever enough.
-We£¬ve got a better way
-l£¬m trying to get to Hogsmeade.
-We know
We£¬ll get you there
-We£¬ll show you a quicker way.
-lf you pipe down
-Bless him.
-Let me go!
Come on, guys.
Don£¬t--
-Now, Harry.
-Come and join the big boys
What are you doing?
!
-What£¬s this rubbish?
-"What£¬s this rubbish?" he says
-lt£¬s the secret to our success.
-lt£¬s a wrench giving it to you--
But we£¬ve decided your needs are greater than ours
George, if you will I solemnly swear that I am up to no good
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs¡­
¡­are proud to present the Marauder£¬s Map."
We owe them so much
Hang on.
This is Hogwarts.
And that--
-No. ls that really--?
-Dumbledore
-ln his study.
-Pacing
Does that a lot
-So this map shows--?
-Everyone
-Where they are.
-What they£¬re doing
-Every minute.
-Every day
-Brilliant!
Where did you get it?
-From Filch£¬s office
-First year.
-There are seven secret passageways¡­
-¡­out of the castle.
-We£¬d recommend this one
-The one-Eyed Witch passageway.
-Leads you to Honeyduke£¬s
Hurry.
Filch is heading this way
And don£¬t forget.
When you£¬re done, just give it a tap and say£º
"Mischief managed." otherwise, anyone can read it
Now, how much do you want?
Delicious
It£¬s meant to be the most haunted building in Britain.
Did I mention that?
Twice
Do you want to move a bit closer?
To the Shrieking Shack?
Actually, I£¬m fine here
Well, well.
Look who£¬s here
You two shopping for your new dream home?
Bit grand for you, isn£¬t it, Weasle-Bee?
Don£¬t your family sleep in one room?
-Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
-Not very friendly
Boys, I think it£¬s time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors
-Hope you don£¬t mean yourself.
-How dare you talk to me!
You filthy little mudblood!
Who is that?
-Don£¬t stand there!
Do something!
-What?
What£¬s up, Malfoy?
Lost your skis?
Get out of the way!
Move!
Malfoy!
Wait!
Wait!
Harry!
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny
Those weasels!
Never told me about any Marauder£¬s Map
He won£¬t keep it.
He£¬ll turn it over to Professor McGonagall
-Aren£¬t you?
-Sure.
Along with his invisibility Cloak
Look who it is.
Madam Rosmerta
-Ron fancies her.
-That£¬s not true!
-Professor McGonagall!
-Cornelius!
Allow me, minister
-oh, Hagrid¡­.
-Sorry about that
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good lt£¬d be a lot better if the Ministry wasn£¬t sending dementors¡­
-¡­into my pub every other night!
-We have¡­
-We have a killer on the loose.
-Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
And what would bring him here?
-Harry Potter.
-Harry Potter?
Come
Harry!
-No underage wizards allowed in today!
-Shut the damn door!
-So rude.
-Thick heads
-Thick heads?
!
-How dare they!
-Who are they calling thick heads?
-Young whippersnappers!
Nobody will come to a pub where they£¬ll get scared out of their wits
Professor Dumbledore doesn£¬t want dementors around the place
Tell me what this is all about
Years ago, when Harry Potter£¬s parents realized they were marked for death--
Remember?
They hid.
Few knew where they were one who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-know-Who
Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night¡­
¡­he also killed Peter Pettigrew!
-Peter Pettigrew?
-Little lump of a boy
-Always trailing after Black.
-l remember
Never let James and Sirius out of his sight
-What happened?
-Peter tried to warn the Potters¡­
¡­and might have, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black
Black was vicious.
He didn£¬t kill Pettigrew
He destroyed him!
A finger.
That£¬s all that was left.
A finger.
Nothing else
Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters¡­
-¡­but he£¬s the reason they£¬re dead.
-He wants to finish things
-l don£¬t believe it.
-That£¬s not the worst of it
-What could be worse?
-This£º Sirius Black was¡­
¡­and remains to this day¡­
¡­Harry Potter£¬s godfather!
Ron, look!
-Sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me.
-Merry Christmas
Harry, what happened?
He was their friend¡­
¡­and he betrayed them
He was their friend!
I hope he finds me
Because when he does, I£¬m gonna be ready!
When he does, I£¬m gonna kill him!
Harry
There you are.
You came
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic¡­
¡­well beyond the ordinary Wizarding Level I£¬m sure
Well, everything£¬s prepared
The spell I£¬m going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm
Did you ever hear of it?
No?
Well¡­
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one¡­
¡­it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him
But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory
Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory
Can you do this?
Yes. very well
Close your eyes
Concentrate
Explore your past
Do you have a memory?
Allow it to fill you up
Lose yourself within it
Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum
-Expecto Patronum.
-very good
Shall we?
Wand at the ready
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto¡­.
Expecto¡­
Expect¡­
Here we go.
Come on.
Sit up.
Deep breaths lt£¬s all right. I didn£¬t expect you to do it the first time
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this.
You£¬ll feel better
-That£¬s one nasty dementor.
-oh, no, no, no
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse
As a matter of interest, what were you thinking?
-Which memory did you choose?
-The first time I rode a broom
That£¬s not good enough.
Not nearly good enough
There£¬s another.
It£¬s not happy, exactly
Well, it is lt£¬s the happiest I£¬ve ever felt¡­
-¡­but it£¬s complicated.
-ls it strong?
Then let£¬s give it a try.
You feel ready?
Just do it
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto Patronum!
Yes!
Well done, Harry.
Well done!
-l think I£¬ve had enough for today.
-Yes.
Sit down.
Here
Eat this, it helps. lt really helps
And just so you know, Harry¡­
¡­l think you£¬d have given your father a run for his money.
And that¡­
¡­is saying something I was thinking of him
And Mum
Seeing their faces
They were talking to me
Just talking
That£¬s the memory I chose I don£¬t even know if it£¬s real
But it£¬s the best I have
-Beautiful day.
-Gorgeous
Unless you£¬ve been ripped to pieces!
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?
-Ronald has lost his rat.
-l haven£¬t lost anything!
-Your cat killed him!
-Rubbish
Harry, you£¬ve seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers¡­
¡­is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone
Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!
-Your cat killed him!
-Did not
-Did.
-Didn£¬t
How did it go, Hagrid?
The hearing?
Well, first off, the committee members took turns¡­
¡­talking about why we were there I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak¡­
¡­was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine
He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature¡­
¡­who would kill you as soon as look at you
And then?
And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius
-They£¬re not sacking you!
-No, I£¬m not sacked
Buckbeak£¬s been sentenced to death!
Spiders!
There£¬s-
- There£¬s spiders.
Spiders.
They want me to tap-dance
-l don£¬t wanna tap-dance!
-You tell those spiders
Right, yeah.
Tell them. I£¬ll tell them¡­
-PeterPettigrew?
-Little lump ofa boy
-Always trailing after sirius Black.
-Black was vicious
He didn't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!
-Put that light out!
-Sorry
-Watch it there, boy.
-We£¬re trying to sleep here!
Mischief managed.
Nox
Potter
What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
I was sleepwalking
How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle
My dad didn£¬t strut.
And nor do I
Now, if you don£¬t mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand
Turn out your pockets
What£¬s this?
-Spare bit of parchment.
-Really?
open it
Reveal your secrets
Read it
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs¡­
¡­offer their compliments to Professor Snape and¡­."
Go on
"And request he keep his large nose out of other people£¬s business."
-You insolent little--
-Professor!
Well, well.
Lupin out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?
Harry, are you all right?
That remains to be seen I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise
-Clearly, it£¬s full of dark magic.
-l seriously doubt it, Severus lt looks as though it£¬s a parchment designed to insult anyone¡­
¡­who tries to read it.
I suspect it£¬s a Zonko product
Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess lt is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise
Harry, would you come with me, please?
Professor, good night
Are you deaf?
Put that light out!
Come in I haven£¬t the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession¡­
¡­but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn£¬t hand it in
Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black¡­
¡­is a map to you?
-No.
-No, sir
Your father never set much store by the rules either
But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours
Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected¡­
¡­with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!
Now, I will not cover up for you again
-Do you hear me?
-Yes, sir i want you to return to your dormitory and stay there
And don£¬t take any detours.
If you do, I shall know
Professor, just so you know, I don£¬t think that map always works
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead oh, really?
And who might that be?
Peter Pettigrew
That£¬s not possible lt£¬s just what I saw
Good night, professor
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond
The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the inner Eye only then can you see.
Try again
Now, what do we have here?
Do you mind me trying?
The Grim, possibly
My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class¡­
¡­l sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit¡­
¡­for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there
You may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled¡­
¡­as an old maid£¬s, your soul as dry as the pages of the books¡­
¡­to which you so desperately cleave
Have I said something?
She£¬s gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn£¬t always mental¡­
¡­but now it£¬s in the open for everyone to see
Hang on
-We better take this back.
-l£¬m not going back
-Fine.
See you later.
-See you
Harry Potter¡­
-Professor Trelawney--
-He will return tonight
Sorry?
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder¡­
¡­shall break free innocent blood shall be spilt¡­
¡­and servant and master shall be reunited once more
I£¬m so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?
No
Nothing
I can£¬t believe they£¬re going to kill Buckbeak. lt£¬s just too horrible
-lt just got worse.
-What did I say?
Father said¡­
¡­l can keep the hippogriff£¬s head.
I£¬ll donate it to the Gryffindors£¬ room
This is going to be rich
-Look who£¬s here.
-Come to see the show?
You!
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
Hermione, no!
He£¬s not worth it
Malfoy, are you okay?
-Let£¬s go.
Quick.
-Not a word to anyone, understood?
-That felt good.
-Not good, brilliant
Look at him.
Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them
Why don£¬t we just set him free?
They£¬d know it was me, and then Dumbledore¡­
¡­would get into trouble.
He£¬s coming down, Dumbledore
Says he wants to be with me when they¡­
When it happens
Great man, Dumbledore
A great man
-We£¬ll stay with you too.
-You£¬ll do no such thing!
Think I want you seeing something like that?
No
You just drink your tea and be off.
oh.
Before you do, Ron¡­
Scabbers!
You£¬re alive!
-keep a closer eye on your pet.
-l think you owe someone an apology
Right.
Next time I see Crookshanks, I£¬ll let him know I meant me!
Blimey.
What was that?
Hagrid!
oh, crikey
No, minister. over this way lt£¬s late. lt£¬s nearly dark.
You shouldn£¬t be here
Someone sees you outside this time of night, you£¬ll be in trouble
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!
Quick.
Quick!
Hagrid
-lt£¬ll be fine. lt£¬ll be okay.
-Go on, go on!
-That£¬s ling you see over there-- -on the slope
-on the slope-
- Ah, Hagrid.
-Professor Dumbledore
-Good evening.
-Minister.
Make your way through
-Have a tea, if you like.
-No, Hagrid
-Gentlemen.
-l£¬d like a cup of tea
Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we?
very well. lt is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal¡­
¡­of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak¡­
¡­hereinafter called "the condemned," shall be executed this day at sundown
-Dear, dear¡­.
-Now, now, Hagrid.
Now, come on
-All right. lt£¬ll be all right.
-The execution shall dispatch--
What?
I thought I just saw--
-Never mind.
-Let£¬s go!
Buckbeak didn£¬t mean no harm
oh, no
He bit me.
Scabbers
Ron.
Ron!
-Ron!
-Scabbers, come back
Wait!
-Scabbers, you bit me!
-Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
That£¬s not good.
Ron, run!
Harry, Hermione, run!
It£¬s the Grim!
-Harry!
-Ron!
Ron, wait!
Harry!
-Help!
-Ron!
-Ron.
Ron.
-Ron!
Come on!
Move!
Duck!
Harry!
-oh, I£¬m sorry.
-Don£¬t worry
-Where do you suppose this goes?
-l have a hunch I just hope I£¬m wrong
We£¬re in the Shrieking Shack, aren£¬t we?
Come on
Ron
-Ron.
You£¬re okay.
-The dog.
Where is it?
It£¬s a trap.
He£¬s the dog.
He£¬s an Animagus
If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!
No. only one will die tonight
Then it£¬ll be you!
Are you going to kill me, Harry?
Expelliarmus!
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren£¬t we?
Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within
Well, you£¬d know all about the madness within, wouldn£¬t you?
-l found him.
-l know
-He£¬s here.
-l understand
-Let£¬s kill him!
-No!
I trusted you!
And all this time, you£¬ve been his friend
He£¬s a werewolf!
That£¬s why he£¬s been missing classes
How long have you known?
-Since Professor Snape set the essay.
-Well, Hermione
You are the brightest witch of your age I£¬ve ever met
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let£¬s kill him!
-Wait!
-l did my waiting!
Twelve years of it!
In Azkaban!
very well. kill him
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why I know why
You betrayed my parents
-You£¬re the reason they£¬re dead!
-No, it wasn£¬t him
Somebody did betray your parents¡­
¡­somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!
-Who was it, then?
-Peter Pettigrew!
And he£¬s in this room!
Right now!
Come out, come out, Peter!
-Come out, come out and play!
-Expelliarmus!
vengeance is sweet
How I hoped I£¬d be the one to catch you
Severus-- l told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle.
Here£¬s the proof
Brilliant, Snape
You put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion lf you£¬ll excuse us, Remus and I have business¡­
-¡­to attend to.
-Give me a reason. I beg you!
-Don£¬t be a fool.
-He can£¬t help it. lt£¬s habit
-Be quiet.
-Be quiet yourself!
You two, quarrelling like an old married couple
Run along and play with your chemistry set!
I could do it, you know
But why deny the dementors?
They£¬re so longing to see you
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
oh, yes
A Dementor£¬s kiss. one can only imagine what that must be like lt£¬s said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I£¬ll do my best
Severus, please
After you
Expelliarmus!
-Harry!
What did you just do?
-You attacked a teacher!
-Tell me about Peter.
-He was at school with us
We thought he was our friend!
-No.
Pettigrew£¬s dead.
You killed him!
-No, he didn£¬t l thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map!
-The map was lying, then.
-The map never lies!
Pettigrew£¬s alive!
And he£¬s right there!
-Me?
!
He£¬s mental!
-Not you!
Your rat!
-Scabbers has been in my family for--
-Twelve years?
Curiously long life for a common garden rat!
-He£¬s missing a toe, isn£¬t he?
-So what?
-All they could find of Pettigrew was his--
-Finger!
Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!
-And then he transformed into a rat!
-Show me
-Give it to him, Ron.
-What are you trying to do to him?
Scabbers!
Leave him alone!
Get off him!
What are you doing?
Remus?
Sirius
My old friends!
Harry!
Look at you.
You look so much like your father
-James.
We were the best of friends--
-How dare you speak to Harry!
How dare you talk about James in front of him!
-You sold James and Lily to voldemort!
-l didn£¬t mean to!
The Dark Lord.
You have no idea the weapons he possesses!
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?
-What would you have done?
-Died, rather than betray my friends!
James wouldn£¬t have wanted me killed!
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!
Should have realized if voldemort didn£¬t kill you, we would.
Together!
No!
-Harry, this man-- -l know what he is
But we£¬ll take him to the castle
-Bless you, boy.
Bless you!
-Get off!
I said we£¬d take you to the castle
After that, the dementors can have you
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit
A bit?
A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!
I was going for the rat
Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog
More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they£¬re murder
okay
-You better go.
-No.
Don£¬t worry, okay?
It£¬s fine. I£¬ll stay
You go, I£¬ll stay
-You okay?
-l£¬m fine.
Go
-That looks really painful.
-So painful
They might chop it I£¬m sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat lt£¬s too late. lt£¬s ruined.
It£¬ll have to be chopped off lt£¬s beautiful, isn£¬t it?
I£¬ll never forget the first time I walked through those doors lt£¬ll be nice to do it again as a free man
That was a noble thing you did back there
He doesn£¬t deserve it I didn£¬t think my dad would have wanted his best friends¡­
¡­to become killers
Besides, dead, the truth dies with him
Alive, you£¬re free
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!
Ron!
Haven£¬t l been a good pet?
You won£¬t let them give me¡­
¡­to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!
-Sweet, clever girl!
Surely you won£¬t--
-Get away from her!
I don£¬t know if you know, Harry¡­
¡­but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather I know
I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle¡­
¡­but if you ever wanted a different home¡­
What?
Come and live with you?
It£¬s just a thought.
I can understand if you don£¬t want to
Harry!
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live!
Here!
This flesh is only flesh!
Expelliarmus!
Harry!
Remus!
Remus!
Run!
Run!
-Come on.
-Wait.
Wait
Hermione!
Bad idea.
Bad idea
Professor?
Professor Lupin?
Nice doggy.
Nice doggy!
There you are, Potter!
Sirius!
Come back here, Potter!
Sirius!
No.
Sirius!
Expecto Patronum!
Harry?
I saw my dad
What?
He sent the dementors away I saw him across the lake
Harry, they£¬ve captured Sirius
Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the kiss
-They£¬re gonna kill him?
-No. lt£¬s worse
Much worse
They£¬re going to suck out his soul
Headmaster, stop them
-They£¬ve got the wrong man.
-lt£¬s true.
Sirius is innocent
-lt£¬s Scabbers who did it.
-Scabbers?
He£¬s my rat, sir
He£¬s not really a rat.
He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy£¬s rat
-But then they gave him an owl--
-The point is, we know the truth
-Please believe us.
-l do, Miss Granger
But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others
A child£¬s voice, however honest and true¡­
¡­is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen
Mysterious thing, time
Powerful¡­
¡­and when meddled with, dangerous
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower
You know the laws, Miss Granger
You must not be seen
And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime lf not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss lf you succeed tonight¡­
¡­more than one innocent life may be spared
Three turns should do it, I think
oh, and by the way
When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin
Good luck
What the bloody hell was that all about?
Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can£¬t walk¡­
What just happened?
-Where£¬s Ron?
-7£º30
Where were we at 7£º30?
I don£¬t know.
Going to Hagrid£¬s?
Come on.
And we can£¬t be seen
Hermione!
Hermione!
Hermione, wait
Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we£¬re doing?
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
That£¬s us
Hermione, no!
He£¬s not worth it
This is not normal
This is a Time-Turner, Harry
McGonagall gave it to me first term
This is how I£¬ve been getting to my lessons all year
-You mean we£¬ve gone back in time?
-Yes
Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment
Clearly, something happened he wants us to change
Good punch
Thanks
Malfoy£¬s coming
-Run.
-Not a word to anyone, understood?
I£¬m gonna get that jumped-up mudblood!
Mark my words
-That felt good.
-Not good, brilliant
Come on.
We should be at Hagrid£¬s
Look.
Buckbeak£¬s still alive of course
Remember what Dumbledore said?
If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared
Let£¬s go
Here they come. I£¬d better hurry
Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him otherwise, he£¬ll think Hagrid set him free
Scabbers, you£¬re alive!
-keep a closer eye on your pet.
-That£¬s Pettigrew
-Harry, you can£¬t.
-He betrayed my parents
-You don£¬t expect me to sit here.
-Yes, and you must!
Harry, you£¬re in Hagrid£¬s hut now lf you go bursting in, you£¬ll think you£¬ve gone mad
Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time
We can£¬t be seen
Fudge is coming
And we aren£¬t leaving?
Why aren£¬t we leaving?
Are you mad?
That hurt
Sorry
We£¬re coming out the back door.
Go!
is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
What?
I thought I just saw¡­
-Never mind.
-Let£¬s go
okay, go, Harry.
Go!
Get away.
Get off
Minister, I really think I should sign as well
Yes, very well.
Perhaps it would be¡­ okay, Buckbeak.
Come quickly.
Come with us now.
Come on
keep trying.
Come on.
Quickly
Buckbeak. okay?
Quickly.
Hurry up. okay?
-Your name only.
-lt£¬s such a very long name¡­
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak
Come and get the nice dead ferret
-Come on. lt£¬s here.
Come on, Beaky.
-Here we are, minister.
Follow me
-Now, look there.
-Where?
-Look beyond the rocks.
-What am I supposed to see?
Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster
-oh, yes. indeed, indeed.
-And all the strawberries
-Come on, Buckbeak.
Come on.
-l see no strawberries
-over there.
-Where?
-over there.
-This way
-Let£¬s get this over, please.
-All right
But where is it?
I saw the beast, just now
-Not a moment ago!
-How extraordinary
Buckbeak
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone£¬s obviously released him
-Hagrid?
-Buckbeak I don£¬t think the minister£¬s suggesting you had anything to do with this
How could you?
You£¬ve been with us all the time
-Right.
-Well, well¡­
We must search the grounds
Well, search the skies, if you must, minister
Meanwhile, I£¬d like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy oh, executioner, your services are no longer required
Thank you
You£¬ll find no small glasses in this house, professor
-Come on.
-This way
This way, now
-Now what?
-We save Sirius
-How?
-No idea
-Look. it£¬s Lupin.
-lmmobulus!
And Snape£¬s coming
And now we wait
And now we wait
-At least someone£¬s enjoying himself.
-Yeah
-Hermione?
-Yeah?
Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius¡­
¡­l did see someone
That someone made the dementors go away
With a Patronus I heard Snape telling Dumbledore
According to him¡­
¡­only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it lt was my dad
My dad conjured the Patronus
-Harry, but your dad£¬s--
-Dead. I know I£¬m just telling you what I saw
Here we come
You see Sirius talking to me there?
-He£¬s asking me to come live with him.
-That£¬s great
When we free him, I£¬ll never have to go back to the Dursleys lt£¬ll just be me and him
We could live in the country¡­
¡­someplace you can see the sky
He£¬ll like that after all those years in Azkaban
Harry!
Run!
Let£¬s go
-What are you doing?
-Saving your life
Thanks
-Great.
Now he£¬s coming for us.
-Yeah, I didn£¬t think about that.
Run!
That was so scary
Poor Professor Lupin£¬s having a really tough night
Sirius.
Come on!
-This is horrible.
-Don£¬t worry
My dad will come.
He£¬ll conjure the Patronus
Any minute now
Right there.
You£¬ll see
Harry, listen to me.
No one£¬s coming
Don£¬t worry, he will.
He will come
-Sirius.
-You£¬re dying¡­
¡­both of you
Harry!
Expecto Patronum!
You were right, Hermione lt wasn£¬t my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!
I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before I knew I could do it this time because¡­
¡­well, I had already done it
-Does that make sense?
-No
But I don£¬t like flying¡­!
Bombarda!
I£¬ll be forever grateful for this¡­
¡­to both of you
-l want to go with you.
-one day, perhaps
For some time, my life will be too unpredictable
And besides¡­
-¡­you£¬re meant to be here.
-But you£¬re innocent
And you know it
And for now, that will do I expect you£¬re tired of hearing this¡­
¡­but you look so like your father
Except your eyes
-You have--
-My mother£¬s eyes lt£¬s cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little
But know this£º
The ones that love us never really leave us
And you can always find them¡­
¡­in here
You really are the brightest witch of your age
We have to go
-Well?
-He£¬s free.
We did it
Did what?
Good night
How did you get there?
I was talking to you there.
And now you£¬re there
-What£¬s he talking about, Harry?
-l don£¬t know
Honestly, Ron.
How can somebody be in two places at once?
Hello, Harry
I saw you coming
I£¬ve looked worse, believe me
-You£¬ve been sacked.
-No
No. I resigned, actually
Resigned?
Why?
Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition
This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want¡­
¡­well, someone like me teaching their children
-But Dumbledore--
-He has already¡­
¡­risked enough on my behalf
Besides, people like me are¡­
Well, let£¬s just say that I£¬m used to it by now
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
None of it made any difference
-Pettigrew escaped.
-Didn£¬t make any difference?
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth
You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate lt made a great deal of difference
If I am proud of anything¡­
¡­it is of how much you have learned this year
Now, since I am no longer your teacher¡­
¡­l feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you
So now I£¬ll say goodbye, Harry I feel sure we£¬ll meet again sometime
Until then¡­
¡­mischief managed
Stand back, I said!
or I£¬ll take it upstairs if you don£¬t settle
Harry
Wherever did you get it?
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course
-What are you talking about?
-Quiet
Let the man through.
I didn£¬t mean to open it, Harry lt was badly wrapped.
They made me do it
Did not
-lt£¬s a Firebolt.
-lt£¬s the fastest broom in the world
For me?
-But who sent it?
-No one knows
This came with it
-Go on, Harry!
-Yeah, let£¬s see
How fast is it, Harry?

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
Harry.
Harry.
Harry, open the door.
Marge.
How lovely to see...
Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.
What is it?
Nothing.
School stuff.
Later perhaps, if you behave.
I will if she does.
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.
Don't say yes in that ungrateful way.
Damn good of my brother to keep you.
He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?
Give us a kiss.
Come on.
Up, up.
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
Okay.
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.
Excellent nosh, Petunia.
A bit more.
Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs.
Just a bit more.
That's a boy.
You wanna try a little drop of brandy?
A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?
What are you smirking at?
Where did you send the boy, Vernon?
St. Brutus'.
It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I've been beaten loads of times.
Excellent.
I won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it.
You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out.
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.
What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?
Nothing.
He didn't work.
He was unemployed.
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.
Don't worry.
Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.
I think it's time you went to bed.
Quiet, Vernon.
You, clean it up.
Actually, it's nothing to do with the father.
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.
If something's wrong with the bitch, then something's wrong with the pup.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Right.
Let me tell you...
Vernon!
Vernon!
Vernon, do something!
Stop!
I've got you, Marge.
I've got you.
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.
Oh, Vernon.
Oh, God.
Marge!
Please!
Marge!
Come back!
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.
- You put her right!
- No.
She deserved what she got.
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.
- Yeah?
Try me.
- They won't let you back now.
You've nowhere to go.
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.
"Welcome to the Knight Bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard.
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening. "
What you doing down there?
- I fell over.
- What you fall over for?
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.
Well, come on, then.
In.
No, no, no.
I'll get this.
You get in.
Come on.
Come on.
Move on, move on.
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London.
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London. "
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup make sure you eat it before it eats you.
- But the Muggles.
Can't they see us?
- Muggles?
They don't see nothing, do they?
No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel.
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!
Ten, nine, eight seven, six, five four, three, three and a half two, one and three quarters.
Yes!
Who is that?
That man.
Who is that?
Who is...?
That is Sirius Black, that is.
Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black.
He's a murderer.
Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?
He's the first one that done it.
He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.
I reckon you've heard of him.
Yeah.
Him I've heard of.
Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock.
They're getting closer, Ernie.
Ernie, they're right on top of us!
Mind your head.
Hey, guys?
Guys?
Why the long faces?
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there.
Nearly there.
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.
Mr. Potter, at last.
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!
Room 11.
Hedwig.
Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter.
He arrived here just five minutes before yourself.
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack.
The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately.
She has been properly punctured and her memory modified.
She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.
So that's that and no harm done.
Pea soup?
No, thank you.
- Minister?
- Yes?
- I don't understand.
- Understand?
I broke the law.
Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
Come now.
The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts.
On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things was very, very irresponsible.
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.
Sirius Black, you mean?
But what's he got to do with me?
Nothing, of course.
You're safe.
And that's what matters.
And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.
Hedwig.
Oh, by the way, Harry.
Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't wander.
Right!
You gonna move that bus or what?
Housekeeping.
I'll come back later.
I'm warning you, Hermione.
Keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?
- It's in his nature.
- A cat?
Is that what they told you?
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...
Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.
Harry.
Harry.
- Egypt.
What's it like?
- Brilliant.
Loads of old stuff like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.
- The day maid.
- Night maid.
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.
- Got everything?
- Yes.
- Yes?
All your books?
- It's all upstairs.
- Your clothes?
- Everything.
- Good boy.
- Thank you.
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah.
It should be great.
Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you.
But I think that you need to know the facts.
You are in danger.
Grave danger.
Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?
What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?
Thirteen years ago, when you stopped...
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.
Sorry.
When you stopped You-Know-Who Black lost everything.
But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant.
And in his mind you are the only thing that stands in the way of You-Know-Who returning to power.
And that is why he has escaped from Azkaban.
To find you.
And kill me.
Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear you won't go looking for Black.
Mr. Weasley why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
Quick.
Quick.
Ron, Ron!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Don't lose him!
I didn't mean to blow her up.
I just...
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
I was lucky not to be arrested.
I still think it was brilliant.
Come on.
Everywhere else is full.
Who do you think that is?
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?
How is it she knows everything?
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be.
Why?
I gotta tell you something.
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
- Yeah.
But they'll catch Black, won't they?
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.
Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.
Why are we stopping?
We can't be there yet.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.
Ouch, Ron.
That was my foot.
There's something moving out there.
I think someone's coming aboard.
Bloody hell!
What's happening?
Harry.
Harry, are you all right?
Thank you.
Here, eat this.
It'll help.
It's all right.
It's chocolate.
What was that thing that came?
It was a dementor.
One of the guards of Azkaban.
It's gone now.
It was searching the train for Sirius Black.
If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver.
Eat.
You'll feel better.
What happened to me?
Well, you sort of went rigid.
We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
And did either of you two you know pass out?
- No.
I felt weird, though.
Like I'd never be cheerful again.
But someone was screaming.
A woman.
No one was screaming, Harry.
Welcome!
Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.
Now, I'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast.
First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin who's kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
Good luck, professor.
Of course.
That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.
Potter.
Is it true you fainted?
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.
Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.
Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid.
Finally, on a more disquieting note at the request of the Ministry of Magic Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban until such a time as Sirius Black is captured.
The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
Now whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution.
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.
Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.
It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
But you know, happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light.
Fortuna Major.
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no.
Wait, wait.
Watch this.
- Amazing.
Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.
- Yes, all right.
Go in.
- Thank you.
Still doing that after three years.
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.
Green.
That's a monkey.
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?
Do not give him one again.
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
- Ron, catch.
- I will.
I think we have a winner.
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.
Look at him.
His face.
Welcome, my children.
In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination.
In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight.
Hello.
I am Professor Trelawney.
Together we shall cast ourselves into the future.
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves.
So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you.
What do you see?
The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read.
But first, you must broaden your minds.
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.
- Where did you come from?
- Me?
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...
Is your grandmother quite well?
I think so.
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.
Pity.
Broaden your minds.
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?
- I think you are.
- Sure.
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.
Yeah.
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.
And that there could be the sun and that's happiness.
So you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.
Give me the cup.
Oh, my dear boy.
My dear you have the Grim.
The Grin?
What's the Grin?
Not the Grin, you idiot.
The Grim.
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.
It's among the darkest omens in our world.
It's an omen of death. "
You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Oh, honestly, Ron.
If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline.
Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.
Ancient Runes?
Exactly how many classes are you taking?
A fair few.
Hang on.
That's not possible.
Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.
You have to be in two classes at once.
Don't be silly.
How could anyone be in two classes at once?
"Broaden your minds.
Use your Inner Eye to see the future. "
That's it.
Come on, now.
Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.
I got a real treat for you today.
A great lesson.
So follow me.
Right, you lot.
Less chattering.
Form a group over there.
And open your books to page 49.
Exactly how do we do that?
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay.
Okay.
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah.
Terribly funny.
Witty.
God, this place has gone to the dogs.
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.
Shut up, Malfoy.
Dementor!
Dementor!
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.
Yeah.
Isn't he beautiful?
Say hello to Buckbeak.
Hagrid, exactly what is that?
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.
First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
It may be the last thing you ever do.
Now, who'd like to come and say hello?
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Come on now.
Now you have to let him make the first move.
It's only polite.
So step up.
Give him a nice bow.
Then you wait and see if he bows back.
If he does, you can go and touch him.
If not...
Well, we'll get to that later.
Just make your bow.
Nice and low.
Back off, Harry.
Back off.
Keep still.
Keep still.
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.
Right.
I think you can go and pat him now.
Go on.
Don't be shy.
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow.
Slow.
Not so fast, Harry.
Slow down, Harry.
That's it...
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...
That's it...
Yes!
Well done!
Well done, Harry, well done!
Does he get to fly?
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Put you over here, just behind the wing joint.
Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that.
Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak.
That was wicked, Harry!
Oh, please.
Well done, well done.
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.
You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!
Malfoy, no...
No!
Buckbeak!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa!
Buckbeak!
Away, you silly creature...
- It's killed me!
- Calm down.
It's just a scratch!
Hagrid!
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher.
I'll do it.
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!
You and your bloody chicken!
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.
Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm.
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.
- He's been sighted!
- Who?
Sirius Black!
Dufftown?
That's not far from here.
You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?
That's right.
Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.
Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
Intriguing, isn't it?
Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what is inside?
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.
Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...
Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart.
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.
After me.
Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.
So much for the easy part.
You see, the incantation alone is not enough.
What really finishes a boggart is laughter.
You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.
Let me explain.
Neville, would you join me, please?
Come on, don't be shy.
Come on.
Come on.
Hello.
Neville, what frightens you most of all?
Professor Snape.
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.
Professor Snape.
Yes, frightens all.
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.
No it won't.
I want you to picture her clothes.
Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe here's what I want you to do.
Excuse me.
Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.
Can you do that?
Yes.
Wand at the ready.
One, two, three.
Think, Neville, think.
Riddikulus!
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible!
Okay to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...
Form a line!
I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most and turn it into something funny.
Next!
Ron!
Concentrate.
Face your fear.
Be brave!
Wand at the ready, Ron.
Riddikulus!
Yes!
You see?
Very good, very good!
Marvelous!
Absolutely, very, very enjoyable!
Parvati!
Next!
Show us what you see.
Keep your nerve.
Steady.
Riddikulus!
And next!
Step up, step up!
Wonderful, wonderful!
Here!
Riddikulus!
Right.
Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.
Collect your books from the back.
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you!
Sorry!
Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege.
Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school that privilege shall not be extended again.
No permission form signed, no visiting the village.
That's the rule, Potter.
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.
I thought if you signed it, then I could...
I can't.
Only a parent or a guardian can sign.
Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate.
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.
Forget about it, guys.
See you later.
Professor, can I ask you something?
You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?
I thought it'd be obvious.
I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.
I did think of Voldemort at first.
But then I remembered that night on the train and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.
That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.
This is very wise.
Before I fainted I heard something.
A woman screaming.
Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.
Our pain becomes their power.
I think it was my mother the night she was murdered.
The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.
Not by your scar, by your eyes.
They're your mother, Lily's.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
I knew her.
Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.
Not only was she a singularly gifted witch she was also an uncommonly kind woman.
She had a way of seeing the beauty in others even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves.
And your father, James, on the other hand he...
He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble.
A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.
You're more like them than you know, Harry.
In time, you'll come to see just how much.
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain.
I know.
What's going on?
Probably Neville forgot the password again.
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.
Let me through, please.
Excuse me!
I'm Head Boy!
Get back, all of you.
No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.
The Fat Lady!
She's gone!
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.
It's not funny, Ron.
Keep calm, everyone.
Break into fours.
Back to your common room.
- Be quiet.
- Make way.
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.
You heard.
Move!
Mr. Filch?
Round up the ghosts.
Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
There's no need for ghosts, professor.
The Fat Lady's there.
Mind where you're going!
Slow down!
You listen!
I'm Head Boy!
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!
Dear lady, who did this to you?
Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.
He's here, somewhere in the castle!
Sirius Black!
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery.
There's nothing there.
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.
I didn't really expect him to linger.
Remarkable feat, don't you think?
To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own...
Any theories on how he managed it?
Many.
Each as unlikely as the next.
You may recall prior to the start of term I expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor...
Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?
Perhaps.
But for now, let him sleep.
For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.
Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
Turn to page 394.
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?
That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?
Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time.
Turn to page 394.
"Werewolves"?
Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?
Now, which one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?
No one?
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.
An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
A werewolf has no choice.
With each full moon he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.
The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.
Are you incapable of restraining yourself or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.
As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.
Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter.
Loss of limb will not excuse you.
Page 394.
The term "werewolf" is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer" which means "man, " and "wolf. " Werewolf, man-wolf.
There are several ways to become a werewolf.
They include being given the power of shape-shifting being bitten by a werewolf...
Go, Harry!
Go, Harry!
Aresto momentum!
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.
Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.
Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.
You gave us a right good scare.
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.
Really?
I meant the match.
Who won?
No one blames you, Harry.
Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds.
Dumbledore's furious.
After he saved you, he sent them off.
There's something else you should know too.
When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and...
Well...
I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.
Is there no chance of fixing it?
No.
Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.
Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.
They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.
You are not weak, Harry.
Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.
Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.
You made the one on the train go away.
There was only one that night.
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.
But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.
For now, I need to rest.
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.
We'll get you there.
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- Lf you pipe down.
- Bless him.
- Let me go!
Come on, guys.
Don't...
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.
What are you doing?
!
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...
But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
George, if you will.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder's Map. "
We owe them so much.
Hang on.
This is Hogwarts.
And that...
- No.
Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.
- In his study.
- Pacing.
Does that a lot.
- So this map shows...
- Everyone.
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.
- Every minute.
- Every day.
- Brilliant!
Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.
Hurry.
Filch is heading this way.
And don't forget.
When you're done, just give it a tap and say:
"Mischief managed. " Otherwise, anyone can read it.
Now, how much do you want?
Delicious.
It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain.
Did I mention that?
Twice.
Do you want to move a bit closer?
To the Shrieking Shack?
Actually, I'm fine here.
Well, well.
Look who's here.
You two shopping for your new dream home?
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.
Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!
You filthy little mudblood!
Who is that?
- Don't stand there!
Do something!
- What?
What's up, Malfoy?
Lost your skis?
Get out of the way!
Move!
Malfoy!
Wait!
Wait!
Harry!
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.
Those weasels!
Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
He won't keep it.
He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.
- Aren't you?
- Sure.
Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
Look who it is.
Madam Rosmerta.
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!
Allow me, minister.
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors into my pub every other night!
- We have...
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
And what would bring him here?
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?
Come.
Harry!
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!
- So rude.
- Thick heads.
- Thick heads?
!
- How dare they!
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!
Nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place.
Tell me what this is all about.
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death...
Remember?
They hid.
Few knew where they were.
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.
Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night he also killed Peter Pettigrew!
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.
Never let James and Sirius out of his sight.
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters and might have, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.
He destroyed him!
A finger.
That's all that was left.
A finger.
Nothing else.
Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.
- What could be worse?
- This:
Sirius Black was and remains to this day Harry Potter's godfather!
Ron, look!
- Sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.
Harry, what happened?
He was their friend and he betrayed them.
He was their friend!
I hope he finds me.
Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!
Harry.
There you are.
You came.
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level.
I'm sure.
Well, everything's prepared.
The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm.
Did you ever hear of it?
No?
Well...
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.
But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory.
Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.
Can you do this?
Yes.
Very well.
Close your eyes.
Concentrate.
Explore your past.
Do you have a memory?
Allow it to fill you up.
Lose yourself within it.
Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum.
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.
Shall we?
Wand at the ready.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto...
Expecto...
Expect...
Here we go.
Come on.
Sit up.
Deep breaths.
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to do it the first time.
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this.
You'll feel better.
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.
As a matter of interest, what were you thinking?
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.
Well, it is.
It's the happiest I've ever felt but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?
Then let's give it a try.
You feel ready?
Just do it.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto Patronum!
Yes!
Well done, Harry.
Well done!
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes.
Sit down.
Here.
Eat this, it helps.
It really helps.
And just so you know, Harry I think you'd have given your father a run for his money.
And that is saying something.
I was thinking of him.
And Mum.
Seeing their faces.
They were talking to me.
Just talking.
That's the memory I chose.
I don't even know if it's real.
But it's the best I have.
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.
Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.
- Did.
- Didn't.
How did it go, Hagrid?
The hearing?
Well, first off, the committee members took turns talking about why we were there.
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers.
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.
He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you.
And then?
And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
Spiders!
There's...
There's spiders.
Spiders.
They want me to tap-dance.
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- Tell those spiders.
Right, yeah.
Tell them.
I'll tell them...
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!
Mischief managed.
Nox.
Potter.
What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
I was sleepwalking.
How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter.
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.
My dad didn't strut.
And nor do I.
If you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.
Turn out your pockets.
Turn out your pockets!
What's this?
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really?
Open it.
Reveal your secrets.
Read it.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and... "
Go on.
"And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business. "
- You insolent little...
- Professor!
Well, well.
Lupin.
Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?
Harry, are you all right?
That remains to be seen.
I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.
It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.
Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.
It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise.
Harry, would you come with me, please?
Professor, good night.
Are you deaf?
Put that light out!
Come in.
I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in.
Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black is a map to you?
- No.
- No, sir.
Your father never set much store by the rules either.
But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.
Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!
Now, I will not cover up for you again.
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.
I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.
Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works.
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.
Oh, really?
And who might that be?
Peter Pettigrew.
That's not possible.
It's just what I saw.
Good night, professor.
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.
The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.
Only then can you see.
Try again.
Now, what do we have here?
Do you mind me trying?
The Grim, possibly.
My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.
You may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave.
Have I said something?
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental but now it's in the open for everyone to see.
Hang on.
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.
- Fine.
See you later.
- See you.
Harry Potter...
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.
Sorry?
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder shall break free.
Innocent blood shall be spilt and servant and master shall be reunited once more.
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?
No.
Nothing.
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak.
It's just too horrible.
- It just got worse.
- What did I say?
Father said I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.
This is going to be rich.
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?
You!
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
Malfoy, are you okay?
- Let's go.
Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Look at him.
Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
Why don't we just set him free?
They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.
Says he wants to be with me when they...
When it happens.
Great man, Dumbledore.
A great man.
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!
Think I want you seeing something like that?
No.
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh.
Before you do, Ron...
Scabbers!
You're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.
Right.
Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.
I meant me!
Blimey.
What was that?
Hagrid!
Oh, crikey.
No, minister.
Over this way.
It's late.
It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.
Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble.
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!
Quick.
Quick!
Hagrid.
- It'll be fine.
It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.
- On the slope...
Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.
- Good evening.
- Minister.
Make your way through.
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.
Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we?
Very well.
It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak hereinafter called "the condemned," shall be executed this day at sundown.
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid.
Now, come on.
- All right.
It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go!
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Oh, no.
He bit me.
Scabbers.
Ron.
Ron!
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.
Wait!
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
That's not good.
Ron, run!
Harry, Hermione, run!
It's the Grim!
- Harry!
- Ron!
Ron, wait!
Harry!
- Help!
- Ron!
- Ron.
Ron.
- Ron!
Come on!
Move!
Duck!
Harry!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.
I just hope I'm wrong.
We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
Come on.
Ron.
- Ron.
You're okay.
- The dog.
Where is it?
It's a trap.
He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.
If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!
No.
Only one will die tonight.
Then it'll be you!
Are you going to kill me, Harry?
Expelliarmus!
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?
Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within.
Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you?
- I found him.
- I know.
- It's him.
- I understand.
- Let's kill him!
- No!
I trusted you!
And all this time, you've been his friend.
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.
How long have you known?
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.
You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!
Twelve years of it!
In Azkaban!
Very well.
Kill him.
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.
I know why.
You betrayed my parents.
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.
Somebody did betray your parents somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!
And he's in this room!
Right now!
Come out, come out, Peter!
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!
Vengeance is sweet.
How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
Severus...
I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle.
Here's the proof.
Brilliant, Snape.
You've put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion.
If you'll excuse us, Remus and I have business to attend to.
- Give me a reason.
I beg you!
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it.
It's habit.
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!
You two, quarrelling like an old married couple.
Run along and play with your chemistry set!
I could do it, you know.
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.
A Dementor's Kiss.
One can only imagine what that must be like.
It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.
Severus, please.
After you.
Expelliarmus!
- Harry!
What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.
We thought he was our friend!
- No.
Pettigrew's dead.
You killed him!
- No, he didn't.
I thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map!
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!
- Me?
!
He's mental!
- Not you!
Your rat!
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?
Curiously long life for a common garden rat!
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!
Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?
Scabbers!
Leave him alone!
Get off him!
What are you doing?
Remus?
Sirius.
My old friends!
Harry!
Look at you.
You look so much like your father.
- James.
We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!
How dare you talk about James in front of him!
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!
The Dark Lord.
You have no idea the weapons he possesses!
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!
James wouldn't have wanted me killed!
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!
Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would.
Together!
No!
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.
But we'll take him to the castle.
- Bless you, boy.
Bless you!
- Get off!
I said we'd take you to the castle.
After that, the dementors can have you.
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.
A bit?
A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!
I was going for the rat.
Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog.
More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent.
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.
Okay.
- You better go.
- No.
Don't worry, okay?
It's fine.
I'll stay.
You go, I'll stay.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
Go.
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.
They might chop it.
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
It's too late.
It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.
It'll be nice to do it again as a free man.
That was a noble thing you did back there.
He doesn't deserve it.
I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends to become killers.
Besides, dead, the truth dies with him.
Alive, you're free.
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!
Ron!
Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!
- Sweet, clever girl!
Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!
I don't know if you know, Harry but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather.
I know.
I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle but if you ever wanted a different home...
What?
Come and live with you?
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.
Harry!
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live!
Here!
This flesh is only flesh!
Expelliarmus!
Harry!
Remus!
Remus!
Run!
Run!
- Come on.
- Wait.
Wait.
Hermione!
Bad idea.
Bad idea.
Professor?
Professor Lupin?
Nice doggy.
Nice doggy!
There you are, Potter!
Sirius!
Come back here, Potter!
Sirius!
No.
Sirius!
Expecto Patronum!
Harry?
I saw my dad.
What?
He sent the dementors away.
I saw him across the lake.
Harry, they've captured Sirius.
Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.
- They're gonna kill him?
- No.
It's worse.
Much worse.
They're going to suck out his soul.
Headmaster, stop them.
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true.
Sirius is innocent.
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?
He's my rat, sir.
He's not really a rat.
He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.
But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.
A child's voice, however honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.
Mysterious thing, time.
Powerful and when meddled with, dangerous.
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen.
And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime.
If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss.
If you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared.
Three turns should do it, I think.
Oh, and by the way.
When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin.
Good luck.
What the bloody hell was that all about?
Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk...
What just happened?
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.
Where were we at 7:30?
I don't know.
Going to Hagrid's?
Come on.
And we can't be seen.
Hermione!
Hermione!
Hermione, wait.
Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
That's us.
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
This is not normal.
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first term.
This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.
Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.
Good punch.
Thanks.
Malfoy's coming.
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood!
Mark my words.
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Come on.
We should be at Hagrid's.
Look.
Buckbeak's still alive.
Of course.
Remember what Dumbledore said?
If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.
Let's go.
Here they come.
I'd better hurry.
Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.
Scabbers, you're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.
If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad.
Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time.
We can't be seen.
Fudge is coming.
And we aren't leaving?
Why aren't we leaving?
Are you mad?
That hurt.
Sorry.
We're coming out the back door.
Go!
Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go.
Okay, go, Harry.
Go!
Get away.
Get off.
Minister, I really think I should sign as well.
Yes, very well.
Perhaps it would be...
Okay, Buckbeak.
Come quickly.
Come with us now.
Come on.
Keep trying.
Come on.
Quickly.
Buckbeak.
Okay?
Quickly.
Hurry up.
Okay?
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.
Come and get the nice dead ferret.
- Come on.
It's here.
Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister.
Follow me.
- Now, look there.
- Where?
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?
Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
- Oh, yes.
Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.
- Come on, Buckbeak.
Come on.
- I see no strawberries.
- Over there.
- Where?
- Over there.
- This way.
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.
But where is it?
I saw the beast, just now.
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.
Buckbeak.
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.
I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.
- Right.
- Well, well.
We must search the grounds.
Well, search the skies, if you must, minister.
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy.
Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required.
Thank you.
You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor.
- Come on.
- This way.
This way, now.
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.
- How?
- No idea.
- Look.
It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!
And Snape's coming.
And now we wait.
And now we wait.
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.
- Hermione?
- Yeah?
Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius I did see someone.
That someone made the dementors go away.
With a Patronus.
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
According to him only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
It was my dad.
My dad conjured the Patronus.
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead.
I know.
I'm just telling you what I saw.
Here we come.
You see Sirius talking to me there?
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'.
It'll just be me and him.
We could live in the country someplace you can see the sky.
He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
Harry!
Run!
Let's go.
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.
Thanks.
- Great.
Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that.
Run!
That was so scary.
Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
Sirius.
Come on!
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.
Any minute now.
Right there.
You'll see.
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.
- Sirius.
- You're dying both of you.
Harry!
Expecto Patronum!
You were right, Hermione.
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!
I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.
I knew I could do it this time because well, I had already done it.
- Does that make sense?
- No.
But I don't like flying...!
Bombarda!
I'll be forever grateful for this to both of you.
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.
For some time, my life will be too unpredictable.
And besides you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.
And you know it.
And for now, that will do.
I expect you're tired of hearing this but you look so like your father.
Except your eyes.
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.
It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little.
But know this:
The ones that love us never really leave us.
And you can always find them in here.
You really are the brightest witch of your age.
We have to go.
- Well?
- He's free.
We did it.
Did what?
Good night.
How did you get there?
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.
Honestly, Ron.
How can somebody be in two places at once?
Hello, Harry.
I saw you coming.
I've looked worse, believe me.
- You've been sacked.
- No.
No.
I resigned, actually.
Resigned?
Why?
Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition.
This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want well, someone like me teaching their children.
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already risked enough on my behalf.
Besides, people like me are...
Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now.
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
None of it made any difference.
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.
You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.
It made a great deal of difference.
If I am proud of anything it is of how much you have learned this year.
Now, since I am no longer your teacher I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you.
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
Until then mischief managed.
Stand back, I said!
Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle.
Harry.
Wherever did you get it?
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.
Did not.
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.
For me?
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.
This came with it.
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.
How fast is it, Harry?
Lumos.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
Mischief managed.
Nox.

Harry.
Harry.
Harry, open the door.
Marge.
How lovely to see...
Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.
What is it?
Nothing.
School stuff.
Later perhaps, if you behave.
I will if she does.
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.
Don't say yes in that ungrateful way.
Damn good of my brother to keep you.
He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?
Give us a kiss.
Come on.
Up, up.
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
Okay.
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.
Excellent nosh, Petunia.
A bit more.
Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs.
Just a bit more.
That's a boy.
You wanna try a little drop of brandy?
A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?
What are you smirking at?
Where did you send the boy, Vernon?
St. Brutus'.
It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I've been beaten loads of times.
Excellent.
I won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it.
You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out.
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.
What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?
Nothing.
He didn't work.
He was unemployed.
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.
Don't worry.
Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.
I think it's time you went to bed.
Quiet, Vernon.
You, clean it up.
Actually, it's nothing to do with the father.
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.
If something's wrong with the bitch, then something's wrong with the pup.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Right.
Let me tell you...
Vernon!
Vernon!
Vernon, do something!
Stop!
I've got you, Marge.
I've got you.
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.
Oh, Vernon.
Oh, God.
Marge!
Please!
Marge!
Come back!
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.
- You put her right!
- No.
She deserved what she got.
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.
- Yeah?
Try me.
- They won't let you back now.
You've nowhere to go.
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.
"Welcome to the Knight Bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard.
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening."
What you doing down there?
- I fell over.
- What you fell over for?
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.
Well, come on, then.
In.
No, no, no.
I'll get this.
You get in.
Come on.
Come on.
Move on, move on.
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London.
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup make sure you eat it before it eats you.
- But the Muggles.
Can't they see us?
- Muggles?
They don't see nothing, do they?
No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel.
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!
Ten, nine, eight seven, six, five four, three, three and a half two, one and three quarters.
Yes!
Who is that?
That man.
Who is that?
Who is...?
That is Sirius Black, that is.
Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black.
He's a murderer.
Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?
He's the first one that done it.
He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.
I reckon you've heard of him.
Yeah.
Him I've heard of.
Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock.
They're getting closer, Ernie.
Ernie, they're right on top of us!
Mind your head.
Hey, guys?
Guys?
Why the long faces?
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there.
Nearly there.
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.
Mr. Potter, at last.
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!
Room 11.
Hedwig.
Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter.
He arrived here just five minutes before yourself.
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack.
The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately.
She has been properly punctured and her memory modified.
She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.
So that's that and no harm done.
Pea soup?
No, thank you.
- Minister?
- Yes?
- I don't understand.
- Understand?
I broke the law.
Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
Come now.
The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts.
On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things was very, very irresponsible.
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.
Sirius Black, you mean?
But what's he got to do with me?
Nothing, of course.
You're safe.
And that's what matters.
And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.
Hedwig.
Oh, by the way, Harry.
Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't wander.
Right!
You gonna move that bus or what?
Housekeeping.
I'll come back later.
I'm warning you, Hermione.
Keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?
- It's in his nature.
- A cat?
Is that what they told you?
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...
Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.
Harry.
Harry.
- Egypt.
What's it like?
- Brilliant.
Loads of old stuff like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.
- The day maid.
- Night maid.
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.
- Got everything?
- Yes.
- Yes?
All your books?
- It's all upstairs.
- Your clothes?
- Everything.
- Good boy.
- Thank you.
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah.
It should be great.
Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you.
But I think that you need to know the facts.
You are in danger.
Grave danger.
Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?
What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?
Thirteen years ago, when you stopped...
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.
Sorry.
When you stopped You-Know-Who Black lost everything.
But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant.
And in his mind you are the only thing that stands in the way of You-Know-Who returning to power.
And that is why he has escaped from Azkaban.
To find you.
And kill me.
Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear you won't go looking for Black.
Mr. Weasley why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
Quick.
Quick.
Ron, Ron!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Don't lose him!
I didn't mean to blow her up.
I just...
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
I was lucky not to be arrested.
I still think it was brilliant.
Come on.
Everywhere else is full.
Who do you think that is?
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?
How is it she knows everything?
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be.
Why?
I gotta tell you something.
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
- Yeah.
But they'll catch Black, won't they?
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.
Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.
Why are we stopping?
We can't be there yet.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.
Ouch, Ron.
That was my foot.
There's something moving out there.
I think someone's coming aboard.
Bloody hell!
What's happening?
Harry.
Harry, are you all right?
Thank you.
Here, eat this.
It'll help.
It's all right.
It's chocolate.
What was that thing that came?
It was a dementor.
One of the guards of Azkaban.
It's gone now.
It was searching the train for Sirius Black.
If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver.
Eat.
You'll feel better.
What happened to me?
Well, you sort of went rigid.
We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
And did either of you two you know pass out?
- No.
I felt weird, though.
Like I'd never be cheerful again.
But someone was screaming.
A woman.
No one was screaming, Harry.
Welcome!
Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.
Now, I'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast.
First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin who's kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
Good luck, professor.
Of course.
That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.
Potter.
Is it true you fainted?
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.
Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.
Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid.
Finally, on a more disquieting note at the request of the Ministry of Magic Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban until such a time as Sirius Black is captured.
The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
Now whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution.
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.
Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.
It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
But you know, happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light.
Fortuna Major.
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no.
Wait, wait.
Watch this.
- Amazing.
Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.
- Yes, all right.
Go in.
- Thank you.
Still doing that after three years.
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.
Green.
That's a monkey.
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?
Do not give him one again.
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
- Ron, catch.
- I will.
I think we have a winner.
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.
Look at him.
His face.
Welcome, my children.
In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination.
In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight.
Hello.
I am Professor Trelawney.
Together we shall cast ourselves into the future.
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves.
So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you.
What do you see?
The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read.
But first, you must broaden your minds.
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.
- Where did you come from?
- Me?
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...
Is your grandmother quite well?
I think so.
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.
Pity.
Broaden your minds.
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?
- I think you are.
- Sure.
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.
Yeah.
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.
And that there could be the sun and that's happiness.
So you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.
Give me the cup.
Oh, my dear boy.
My dear you have the Grim.
The Grin?
What's the Grin?
Not the Grin, you idiot.
The Grim.
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.
It's among the darkest omens in our world.
It's an omen of death."
You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Oh, honestly, Ron.
If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline.
Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.
Ancient Runes?
Exactly how many classes are you taking?
A fair few.
Hang on.
That's not possible.
Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.
You have to be in two classes at once.
Don't be silly.
How could anyone be in two classes at once?
"Broaden your minds.
Use your Inner Eye to see the future."
That's it.
Come on, now.
Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.
I got a real treat for you today.
A great lesson.
So follow me.
Right, you lot.
Less chattering.
Form a group over there.
And open your books to page 49.
Exactly how do we do that?
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay.
Okay.
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah.
Terribly funny.
Witty.
God, this place has gone to the dogs.
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.
Shut up, Malfoy.
Dementor!
Dementor!
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.
Yeah.
Isn't he beautiful?
Say hello to Buckbeak.
Hagrid, exactly what is that?
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.
First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
It may be the last thing you ever do.
Now, who'd like to come and say hello?
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Come on now.
Now you have to let him make the first move.
It's only polite.
So step up.
Give him a nice bow.
Then you wait and see if he bows back.
If he does, you can go and touch him.
If not...
Well, we'll get to that later.
Just make your bow.
Nice and low.
Back off, Harry.
Back off.
Keep still.
Keep still.
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.
Right.
I think you can go and pat him now.
Go on.
Don't be shy.
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow.
Slow.
Not so fast, Harry.
Slow down, Harry.
That's it...
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...
That's it...
Yes!
Well done!
Well done, Harry, well done!
Does he get to fly?
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Put you over here, just behind the wing joint.
Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that.
Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak.
That was wicked, Harry!
Oh, please.
Well done, well done.
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.
You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!
Malfoy, no...
No!
Buckbeak!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa!
Buckbeak!
Away, you silly creature...
- It's killed me!
- Calm down.
It's just a scratch!
Hagrid!
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher.
I'll do it.
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!
You and your bloody chicken!
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.
Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm.
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.
- He's been sighted!
- Who?
Sirius Black!
Dufftown?
That's not far from here.
You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?
That's right.
Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.
Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
Intriguing, isn't it?
Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what is inside?
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.
Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...
Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart.
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.
After me.
Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.
A little louder and very clear.
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.
So much for the easy part.
You see, the incantation alone is not enough.
What really finishes a boggart is laughter.
You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.
Let me explain.
Neville, would you join me, please?
Come on, don't be shy.
Come on.
Come on.
Hello.
Neville, what frightens you most of all?
Professor Snape.
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.
Professor Snape.
Yes, frightens all.
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.
No it won't.
I want you to picture her clothes.
Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe here's what I want you to do.
Excuse me.
Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.
Can you do that?
Yes.
Wand at the ready.
One, two, three.
Think, Neville, think.
Riddikulus!
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible!
Okay to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...
Form a line!
I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most and turn it into something funny.
Next!
Ron!
Concentrate.
Face your fear.
Be brave!
Wand at the ready, Ron.
Riddikulus!
Yes!
You see?
Very good, very good!
Marvelous!
Absolutely, very, very enjoyable!
Parvati!
Next!
Show us what you see.
Keep your nerve.
Steady.
Riddikulus!
And next!
Step up, step up!
Wonderful, wonderful!
Here!
Riddikulus!
Right.
Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.
Collect your books from the back.
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you!
Sorry!
Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege.
Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school that privilege shall not be extended again.
No permission form signed, no visiting the village.
That's the rule, Potter.
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.
I thought if you signed it, then I could...
I can't.
Only a parent or a guardian can sign.
Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate.
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.
Forget about it, guys.
See you later.
Professor, can I ask you something?
You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?
I thought it'd be obvious.
I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.
I did think of Voldemort at first.
But then I remembered that night on the train and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.
That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.
This is very wise.
Before I fainted I heard something.
A woman screaming.
Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.
Our pain becomes their power.
I think it was my mother the night she was murdered.
The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.
Not by your scar, by your eyes.
They're your mother, Lily's.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
I knew her.
Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.
Not only was she a singularly gifted witch she was also an uncommonly kind woman.
She had a way of seeing the beauty in others even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves.
And your father, James, on the other hand he...
He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble.
A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.
You're more like them than you know, Harry.
In time, you'll come to see just how much.
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain.
I know.
What's going on?
Probably Neville forgot the password again.
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.
Let me through, please.
Excuse me!
I'm Head Boy!
Get back, all of you.
No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.
The Fat Lady!
She's gone!
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.
It's not funny, Ron.
Keep calm, everyone.
Break into fours.
Back to your common room.
- Be quiet.
- Make way.
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.
You heard.
Move!
Mr. Filch?
Round up the ghosts.
Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
There's no need for ghosts, professor.
The Fat Lady's there.
Mind where you're going!
Slow down!
You listen!
I'm Head Boy!
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!
Dear lady, who did this to you?
Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.
He's here, somewhere in the castle!
Sirius Black!
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery.
There's nothing there.
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.
I didn't really expect him to linger.
Remarkable feat, don't you think?
To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own...
Any theories on how he managed it?
Many.
Each as unlikely as the next.
You may recall prior to the start of term I expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor...
Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?
Perhaps.
But for now, let him sleep.
For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.
Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
Turn to page 394.
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?
That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?
Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time.
Turn to page 394.
"Werewolves"?
Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?
Now, which one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?
No one?
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.
An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
A werewolf has no choice.
With each full moon he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.
The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.
Are you incapable of restraining yourself or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.
As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.
Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter.
Loss of limb will not excuse you.
Page 394.
The term "werewolf" is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer" which means "man," and "wolf." Werewolf, man-wolf.
There are several ways to become a werewolf.
They include being given the power of shape-shifting being bitten by a werewolf...
Go, Harry!
Go, Harry!
Aresto momentum!
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.
Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.
Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.
You gave us a right good scare.
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.
Really?
I meant the match.
Who won?
No one blames you, Harry.
Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds.
Dumbledore's furious.
After he saved you, he sent them off.
There's something else you should know too.
When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and...
Well...
I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.
Is there no chance of fixing it?
No.
Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.
Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.
They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.
You are not weak, Harry.
Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.
Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.
You made the one on the train go away.
There was only one that night.
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.
But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.
For now, I need to rest.
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.
We'll get you there.
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- lf you pipe down.
- Bless him.
- Let me go!
Come on, guys.
Don't...
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.
What are you doing?
!
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...
But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
George, if you will.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder's Map."
We owe them so much.
Hang on.
This is Hogwarts.
And that...
- No.
Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.
- In his study.
- Pacing.
Does that a lot.
- So this map shows...?
- Everyone.
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.
- Every minute.
- Every day.
- Brilliant!
Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.
Hurry.
Filch is heading this way.
And don't forget.
When you're done,
"Mischief managed." Otherwise, anyone can read it.
Now, how much do you want?
Delicious.
It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain.
Did I mention that?
Twice.
Do you want to move a bit closer?
To the Shrieking Shack?
Actually, I'm fine here.
Well, well.
Look who's here.
You two shopping for your new dream home?
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.
Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!
You filthy little mudblood!
Who is that?
- Don't stand there!
Do something!
- What?
What's up, Malfoy?
Lost your skis?
Get out of the way!
Move!
Malfoy!
Wait!
Wait!
Harry!
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.
Those weasels!
Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
He won't keep it.
He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.
- Aren't you?
- Sure.
Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
Look who it is.
Madam Rosmerta.
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!
Allow me, minister.
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors into my pub every other night!
- We have...
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
And what would bring him here?
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?
Come.
Harry!
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!
- So rude.
- Thick heads.
- Thick heads?
!
- How dare they!
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!
Nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place.
Tell me what this is all about.
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death...
Remember?
They hid.
Few knew where they were.
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.
Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night he also killed Peter Pettigrew!
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.
Never let James and Sirius out of his sight.
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters and might have, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.
He destroyed him!
A finger.
That's all that was left.
A finger.
Nothing else.
Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.
- What could be worse?
- This:
Sirius Black was and remains to this day Harry Potter's godfather!
Ron, look!
- Sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.
Harry, what happened?
He was their friend and he betrayed them.
He was their friend!
I hope he finds me.
Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!
Harry.
There you are.
You came.
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level.
I'm sure.
Well, everything's prepared.
The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm.
Did you ever hear of it?
No?
Well...
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.
But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory.
Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.
Can you do this?
Yes.
Very well.
Close your eyes.
Concentrate.
Explore your past.
Do you have a memory?
Allow it to fill you up.
Lose yourself within it.
Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum.
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.
Shall we?
Wand at the ready.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto...
Expecto...
Expect...
Here we go.
Come on.
Sit up.
Deep breaths.
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to do it the first time.
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this.
You'll feel better.
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.
As a matter of interest, what were you thinking?
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.
Well, it is.
It's the happiest I've ever felt but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?
Then let's give it a try.
You feel ready?
Just do it.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto Patronum!
Yes!
Well done, Harry.
Well done!
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes.
Sit down.
Here.
Eat this, it helps.
It really helps.
And just so you know, Harry I think you'd have given your father a run for his money.
And that is saying something.
I was thinking of him.
And Mum.
Seeing their faces.
They were talking to me.
Just talking.
That's the memory I chose.
I don't even know if it's real.
But it's the best I have.
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.
Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.
- Did.
- Didn't.
How did it go, Hagrid?
The hearing?
Well, first off, the committee members took turns talking about why we were there.
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers.
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.
He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you.
And then?
And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
Spiders!
There's...
There's spiders.
Spiders.
They want me to tap-dance.
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- You tell those spiders.
Right, yeah.
Tell them.
I'll tell them...
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!
Mischief managed.
Nox.
Potter.
What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
I was sleepwalking.
How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter.
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.
My dad didn't strut.
And nor do I.
Now, if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.
Turn out your pockets.
Turn out your pockets!
What's this?
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really?
Open it.
Reveal your secrets.
Read it.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."
Go on.
"And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business."
- You insolent little...
- Professor!
Well, well.
Lupin.
Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?
Harry, are you all right?
That remains to be seen.
I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.
It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.
Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.
It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise.
Harry, would you come with me, please?
Professor, good night.
Are you deaf?
Put that light out!
Come in.
I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in.
Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black is a map to you?
- No.
- No, sir.
Your father never set much store by the rules either.
But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.
Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!
Now, I will not cover up for you again.
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.
I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.
Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works.
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.
Oh, really?
And who might that be?
Peter Pettigrew.
That's not possible.
It's just what I saw.
Good night, professor.
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.
The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.
Only then can you see.
Try again.
Now, what do we have here?
Do you mind me trying?
The Grim, possibly.
My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.
You may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave.
Have I said something?
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental but now it's in the open for everyone to see.
Hang on.
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.
- Fine.
See you later.
- See you.
Harry Potter...
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.
Sorry?
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder shall break free.
Innocent blood shall be spilt and servant and master shall be reunited once more.
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?
No.
Nothing.
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak.
It's just too horrible.
- It just got worse.
- What did I say?
Father said I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.
This is going to be rich.
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?
You!
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
Malfoy, are you okay?
- Let's go.
Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Look at him.
Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
Why don't we just set him free?
They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.
Says he wants to be with me when they...
When it happens.
Great man, Dumbledore.
A great man.
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!
Think I want you seeing something like that?
No.
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh.
Before you do, Ron...
Scabbers!
You're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.
Right.
Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.
I meant me!
Blimey.
What was that?
Hagrid!
Oh, crikey.
No, minister.
Over this way.
It's late.
It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.
Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble.
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!
Quick.
Quick!
Hagrid.
- It'll be fine.
It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.
- On the slope...
Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.
- Good evening.
- Minister.
Make your way through.
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.
Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we?
Very well.
It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak hereinafter called "the condemned," shall be executed this day at sundown.
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid.
Now, come on.
- All right.
It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go!
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Oh, no.
He bit me.
Scabbers.
Ron.
Ron!
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.
Wait!
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
That's not good.
Ron, run!
Harry, Hermione, run!
It's the Grim!
- Harry!
- Ron!
Ron, wait!
Harry!
- Help!
- Ron!
- Ron.
Ron.
- Ron!
Come on!
Move!
Duck!
Harry!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.
I just hope I'm wrong.
We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
Come on.
Ron.
- Ron.
You're okay.
- The dog.
Where is it?
It's a trap.
He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.
If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!
No.
Only one will die tonight.
Then it'll be you!
Are you going to kill me, Harry?
Expelliarmus!
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?
Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within.
Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you?
- I found him.
- I know.
- He's here.
- I understand.
- Let's kill him!
- No!
I trusted you!
And all this time, you've been his friend.
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.
How long have you known?
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.
You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!
Twelve years of it!
In Azkaban!
Very well.
Kill him.
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.
I know why.
You betrayed my parents.
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.
Somebody did betray your parents somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!
And he's in this room!
Right now!
Come out, come out, Peter!
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!
Vengeance is sweet.
How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
Severus...
I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle.
Here's the proof.
Brilliant, Snape.
You put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion.
If you'll excuse us, Remus and I have business to attend to.
- Give me a reason.
I beg you!
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it.
It's habit.
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!
You two, quarrelling like an old married couple.
Run along and play with your chemistry set!
I could do it, you know.
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.
A Dementor's Kiss.
One can only imagine what that must be like.
It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.
Severus, please.
After you.
Expelliarmus!
- Harry!
What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.
We thought he was our friend!
- No.
Pettigrew's dead.
You killed him!
- No, he didn't.
I thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map!
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!
- Me?
!
He's mental!
- Not you!
Your rat!
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?
Curiously long life for a common garden rat!
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!
Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?
Scabbers!
Leave him alone!
Get off him!
What are you doing?
Remus?
Sirius.
My old friends!
Harry!
Look at you.
You look so much like your father.
- James.
We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!
How dare you talk about James in front of him!
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!
The Dark Lord.
You have no idea the weapons he possesses!
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!
James wouldn't have wanted me killed!
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!
Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would.
Together!
No!
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.
But we'll take him to the castle.
- Bless you, boy.
Bless you!
- Get off!
I said we'd take you to the castle.
After that, the dementors can have you.
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.
A bit?
A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!
I was going for the rat.
Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog.
More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent.
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.
Okay.
- You better go.
- No.
Don't worry, okay?
It's fine.
I'll stay.
You go, I'll stay.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
Go.
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.
They might chop it.
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
It's too late.
It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.
It'll be nice to do it again as a free man.
That was a noble thing you did back there.
He doesn't deserve it.
I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends to become killers.
Besides, dead, the truth dies with him.
Alive, you're free.
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!
Ron!
Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!
- Sweet, clever girl!
Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!
I don't know if you know, Harry but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather.
I know.
I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle but if you ever wanted a different home...
What?
Come and live with you?
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.
Harry!
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live!
Here!
This flesh is only flesh!
Expelliarmus!
Harry!
Remus!
Remus!
Run!
Run!
- Come on.
- Wait.
Wait.
Hermione!
Bad idea.
Bad idea.
Professor?
Professor Lupin?
Nice doggy.
Nice doggy!
There you are, Potter!
Sirius!
Come back here, Potter!
Sirius!
No.
Sirius!
Expecto Patronum!
Harry?
I saw my dad.
What?
He sent the dementors away.
I saw him across the lake.
Harry, they've captured Sirius.
Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.
- They're gonna kill him?
- No.
It's worse.
Much worse.
They're going to suck out his soul.
Headmaster, stop them.
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true.
Sirius is innocent.
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?
He's my rat, sir.
He's not really a rat.
He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.
But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.
A child's voice, however honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.
Mysterious thing, time.
Powerful and when meddled with, dangerous.
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen.
And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime.
If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss.
If you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared.
Three turns should do it, I think.
Oh, and by the way.
When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin.
Good luck.
What the bloody hell was that all about?
Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk...
What just happened?
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.
Where were we at 7:30?
I don't know.
Going to Hagrid's?
Come on.
And we can't be seen.
Hermione!
Hermione!
Hermione, wait.
Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
That's us.
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
This is not normal.
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first term.
This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.
Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.
Good punch.
Thanks.
Malfoy's coming.
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood!
Mark my words.
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Come on.
We should be at Hagrid's.
Look.
Buckbeak's still alive.
Of course.
Remember what Dumbledore said?
If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.
Let's go.
Here they come.
I'd better hurry.
Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.
Scabbers, you're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.
If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad.
Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time.
We can't be seen.
Fudge is coming.
And we aren't leaving?
Why aren't we leaving?
Are you mad?
That hurt.
Sorry.
We're coming out the back door.
Go!
Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go.
Okay, go, Harry.
Go!
Get away.
Get off.
Minister, I really think I should sign as well.
Yes, very well.
Perhaps it would be...
Okay, Buckbeak.
Come quickly.
Come with us now.
Come on.
Keep trying.
Come on.
Quickly.
Buckbeak.
Okay?
Quickly.
Hurry up.
Okay?
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.
Come and get the nice dead ferret.
- Come on.
It's here.
Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister.
Follow me.
- Now, look there.
- Where?
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?
Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
- Oh, yes.
Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.
- Come on, Buckbeak.
Come on.
- I see no strawberries.
- Over there.
- Where?
- Over there.
- This way.
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.
But where is it?
I saw the beast, just now.
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.
Buckbeak.
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.
I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.
- Right.
- Well, well...
We must search the grounds.
Well, search the skies, if you must, minister.
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy.
Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required.
Thank you.
You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor.
- Come on.
- This way.
This way, now.
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.
- How?
- No idea.
- Look.
It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!
And Snape's coming.
And now we wait.
And now we wait.
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.
- Hermione?
- Yeah?
Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius I did see someone.
That someone made the dementors go away.
With a Patronus.
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
According to him only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
It was my dad.
My dad conjured the Patronus.
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead.
I know.
I'm just telling you what I saw.
Here we come.
You see Sirius talking to me there?
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'.
It'll just be me and him.
We could live in the country someplace you can see the sky.
He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
Harry!
Run!
Let's go.
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.
Thanks.
- Great.
Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that.
Run!
That was so scary.
Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
Sirius.
Come on!
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.
Any minute now.
Right there.
You'll see.
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.
- Sirius.
- You're dying both of you.
Harry!
Expecto Patronum!
You were right, Hermione.
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!
I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.
I knew I could do it this time because well, I had already done it.
- Does that make sense?
- No.
But I don't like flying...!
Bombarda!
I'll be forever grateful for this to both of you.
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.
For some time, my life will be too unpredictable.
And besides you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.
And you know it.
And for now, that will do.
I expect you're tired of hearing this but you look so like your father.
Except your eyes.
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.
It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little.
But know this:
The ones that love us never really leave us.
And you can always find them in here.
You really are the brightest witch of your age.
We have to go.
- Well?
- He's free.
We did it.
Did what?
Good night.
How did you get there?
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.
Honestly, Ron.
How can somebody be in two places at once?
Hello, Harry.
I saw you coming.
I've looked worse, believe me.
- You've been sacked.
- No.
No.
I resigned, actually.
Resigned?
Why?
Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition.
This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want well, someone like me teaching their children.
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already risked enough on my behalf.
Besides, people like me are...
Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now.
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
None of it made any difference.
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.
You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.
It made a great deal of difference.
If I am proud of anything it is of how much you have learned this year.
Now, since I am no longer your teacher I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you.
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
Until then mischief managed.
Stand back, I said!
Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle.
Harry.
Wherever did you get it?
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.
Did not.
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.
For me?
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.
This came with it.
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.
How fast is it, Harry?
Lumos.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
Mischief managed.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima!
Harry.
Harry.
Harry, open the door.
Marge.
How lovely to see...
Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.
What is it?
Nothing.
School stuff.
Later perhaps, if you behave.
I will if she does.
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.
Don't say yes in that ungrateful way.
Damn good of my brother to keep you.
He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?
Give us a kiss.
Come on.
Up, up.
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
Okay.
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.
Excellent nosh, Petunia.
A bit more.
Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs.
Just a bit more.
That's a boy.
You wanna try a little drop of brandy?
A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?
What are you smirking at?
Where did you send the boy, Vernon?
St. Brutus'.
It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I've been beaten loads of times.
Excellent.
I won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it.
You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out.
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.
What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?
Nothing.
He didn't work.
He was unemployed.
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.
Don't worry.
Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.
I think it's time you went to bed.
Quiet, Vernon.
You, clean it up.
Actually, it's nothing to do with the father.
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.
If something's wrong with the bitch, then something's wrong with the pup.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Right.
Let me tell you...
Vernon!
Vernon!
Vernon, do something!
Stop!
I've got you, Marge.
I've got you.
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.
Oh, Vernon.
Oh, God.
Marge!
Please!
Marge!
Come back!
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.
- You put her right!
- No.
She deserved what she got.
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.
- Yeah?
Try me.
- They won't let you back now.
You've nowhere to go.
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.
"Welcome to the Knight Bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard.
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening."
What you doing down there?
- I fell over.
- What you fall over for?
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.
Well, come on, then.
In.
No, no, no.
I'll get this.
You get in.
Come on.
Come on.
Move on, move on.
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London.
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup make sure you eat it before it eats you.
- But the Muggles.
Can't they see us?
- Muggles?
They don't see nothing, do they?
No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel.
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!
Ten, nine, eight seven, six, five four, three, three and a half two, one and three quarters.
Yes!
Who is that?
That man.
Who is that?
Who is...?
That is Sirius Black, that is.
Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black.
He's a murderer.
Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?
He's the first one that done it.
He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.
I reckon you've heard of him.
Yeah.
Him I've heard of.
Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock.
They're getting closer, Ernie.
Ernie, they're right on top of us!
Mind your head.
Hey, guys?
Guys?
Why the long faces?
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there.
Nearly there.
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.
Mr. Potter, at last.
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!
Room 11.
Hedwig.
Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter.
He arrived here just five minutes before yourself.
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack.
The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately.
She has been properly punctured and her memory modified.
She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.
So that's that and no harm done.
Pea soup?
No, thank you.
- Minister?
- Yes?
- I don't understand.
- Understand?
I broke the law.
Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
Come now.
The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts.
On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things was very, very irresponsible.
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.
Sirius Black, you mean?
But what's he got to do with me?
Nothing, of course.
You're safe.
And that's what matters.
And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.
Hedwig.
Oh, by the way, Harry.
Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't wander.
Right!
You gonna move that bus or what?
Housekeeping.
I'll come back later.
I'm warning you, Hermione.
Keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?
- It's in his nature.
- A cat?
Is that what they told you?
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...
Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.
Harry.
Harry.
- Egypt.
What's it like?
- Brilliant.
Loads of old stuff like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.
- The day maid.
- Night maid.
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.
- Got everything?
- Yes.
- Yes?
All your books?
- It's all upstairs.
- Your clothes?
- Everything.
- Good boy.
- Thank you.
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah.
It should be great.
Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you.
But I think that you need to know the facts.
You are in danger.
Grave danger.
Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?
What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?
Thirteen years ago, when you stopped...
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.
Sorry.
When you stopped You-Know-Who Black lost everything.
But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant.
And in his mind you are the only thing that stands in the way of You-Know-Who returning to power.
And that is why he has escaped from Azkaban.
To find you.
And kill me.
Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear you won't go looking for Black.
Mr. Weasley why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
Quick.
Quick.
Ron, Ron!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Don't lose him!
I didn't mean to blow her up.
I just...
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
I was lucky not to be arrested.
I still think it was brilliant.
Come on.
Everywhere else is full.
Who do you think that is?
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?
How is it she knows everything?
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be.
Why?
I gotta tell you something.
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
- Yeah.
But they'll catch Black, won't they?
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.
Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.
Why are we stopping?
We can't be there yet.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.
Ouch, Ron.
That was my foot.
There's something moving out there.
I think someone's coming aboard.
Bloody hell!
What's happening?
Harry.
Harry, are you all right?
Thank you.
Here, eat this.
It'll help.
It's all right.
It's chocolate.
What was that thing that came?
It was a dementor.
One of the guards of Azkaban.
It's gone now.
It was searching the train for Sirius Black.
If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver.
Eat.
You'll feel better.
What happened to me?
Well, you sort of went rigid.
We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
And did either of you two you know pass out?
- No.
I felt weird, though.
Like I'd never be cheerful again.
But someone was screaming.
A woman.
No one was screaming, Harry.
Welcome!
Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.
Now, I'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast.
First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin who's kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
Good luck, professor.
Of course.
That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.
Potter.
Is it true you fainted?
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.
Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.
Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid.
Finally, on a more disquieting note at the request of the Ministry of Magic Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban until such a time as Sirius Black is captured.
The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
Now whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution.
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.
Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.
It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
But you know, happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light.
Fortuna Major.
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no.
Wait, wait.
Watch this.
- Amazing.
Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.
- Yes, all right.
Go in.
- Thank you.
Still doing that after three years.
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.
Green.
That's a monkey.
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?
Do not give him one again.
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
- Ron, catch.
- I will.
I think we have a winner.
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.
Look at him.
His face.
Welcome, my children.
In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination.
In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight.
Hello.
I am Professor Trelawney.
Together we shall cast ourselves into the future.
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves.
So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you.
What do you see?
The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read.
But first, you must broaden your minds.
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.
- Where did you come from?
- Me?
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...
Is your grandmother quite well?
I think so.
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.
Pity.
Broaden your minds.
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?
- I think you are.
- Sure.
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.
Yeah.
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.
And that there could be the sun and that's happiness.
So you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.
Give me the cup.
Oh, my dear boy.
My dear you have the Grim.
The Grin?
What's the Grin?
Not the Grin, you idiot.
The Grim.
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.
It's among the darkest omens in our world.
It's an omen of death."
You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Oh, honestly, Ron.
If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline.
Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.
Ancient Runes?
Exactly how many classes are you taking?
A fair few.
Hang on.
That's not possible.
Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.
You have to be in two classes at once.
Don't be silly.
How could anyone be in two classes at once?
"Broaden your minds.
Use your Inner Eye to see the future."
That's it.
Come on, now.
Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.
I got a real treat for you today.
A great lesson.
So follow me.
Right, you lot.
Less chattering.
Form a group over there.
And open your books to page 49.
Exactly how do we do that?
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay.
Okay.
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah.
Terribly funny.
Witty.
God, this place has gone to the dogs.
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.
Shut up, Malfoy.
Dementor!
Dementor!
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.
Yeah.
Isn't he beautiful?
Say hello to Buckbeak.
Hagrid, exactly what is that?
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.
First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
It may be the last thing you ever do.
Now, who'd like to come and say hello?
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Come on now.
Now you have to let him make the first move.
It's only polite.
So step up.
Give him a nice bow.
Then you wait and see if he bows back.
If he does, you can go and touch him.
If not...
Well, we'll get to that later.
Just make your bow.
Nice and low.
Back off, Harry.
Back off.
Keep still.
Keep still.
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.
Right.
I think you can go and pat him now.
Go on.
Don't be shy.
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow.
Slow.
Not so fast, Harry.
Slow down, Harry.
That's it...
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...
That's it...
Yes!
Well done!
Well done, Harry, well done!
Does he get to fly?
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Put you over here, just behind the wing joint.
Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that.
Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak.
That was wicked, Harry!
Oh, please.
Well done, well done.
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.
You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!
Malfoy, no...
No!
Buckbeak!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa!
Buckbeak!
Away, you silly creature...
- It's killed me!
- Calm down.
It's just a scratch!
Hagrid!
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher.
I'll do it.
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!
You and your bloody chicken!
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.
Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm.
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.
- He's been sighted!
- Who?
Sirius Black!
Dufftown?
That's not far from here.
You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?
That's right.
Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.
Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
Intriguing, isn't it?
Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what is inside?
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.
Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...
Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart.
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.
After me.
Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.
So much for the easy part.
You see, the incantation alone is not enough.
What really finishes a boggart is laughter.
You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.
Let me explain.
Neville, would you join me, please?
Come on, don't be shy.
Come on.
Come on.
Hello.
Neville, what frightens you most of all?
Professor Snape.
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.
Professor Snape.
Yes, frightens all.
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.
No it won't.
I want you to picture her clothes.
Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe here's what I want you to do.
Excuse me.
Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.
Can you do that?
Yes.
Wand at the ready.
One, two, three.
Think, Neville, think.
Riddikulus!
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible!
Okay to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...
Form a line!
I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most and turn it into something funny.
Next!
Ron!
Concentrate.
Face your fear.
Be brave!
Wand at the ready, Ron.
Riddikulus!
Yes!
You see?
Very good, very good!
Marvelous!
Absolutely, very, very enjoyable!
Parvati!
Next!
Show us what you see.
Keep your nerve.
Steady.
Riddikulus!
And next!
Step up, step up!
Wonderful, wonderful!
Here!
Riddikulus!
Right.
Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.
Collect your books from the back.
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you!
Sorry!
Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege.
Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school that privilege shall not be extended again.
No permission form signed, no visiting the village.
That's the rule, Potter.
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.
I thought if you signed it, then I could...
I can't.
Only a parent or a guardian can sign.
Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate.
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.
Forget about it, guys.
See you later.
Professor, can I ask you something?
You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?
I thought it'd be obvious.
I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.
I did think of Voldemort at first.
But then I remembered that night on the train and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.
That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.
This is very wise.
Before I fainted I heard something.
A woman screaming.
Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.
Our pain becomes their power.
I think it was my mother the night she was murdered.
The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.
Not by your scar, by your eyes.
They're your mother, Lily's.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
I knew her.
Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.
Not only was she a singularly gifted witch she was also an uncommonly kind woman.
She had a way of seeing the beauty in others even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves.
And your father, James, on the other hand he...
He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble.
A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.
You're more like them than you know, Harry.
In time, you'll come to see just how much.
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain.
I know.
What's going on?
Probably Neville forgot the password again.
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.
Let me through, please.
Excuse me!
I'm Head Boy!
Get back, all of you.
No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.
The Fat Lady!
She's gone!
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.
It's not funny, Ron.
Keep calm, everyone.
Break into fours.
Back to your common room.
- Be quiet.
- Make way.
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.
You heard.
Move!
Mr. Filch?
Round up the ghosts.
Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
There's no need for ghosts, professor.
The Fat Lady's there.
Mind where you're going!
Slow down!
You listen!
I'm Head Boy!
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!
Dear lady, who did this to you?
Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.
He's here, somewhere in the castle!
Sirius Black!
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery.
There's nothing there.
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.
I didn't really expect him to linger.
Remarkable feat, don't you think?
To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own...
Any theories on how he managed it?
Many.
Each as unlikely as the next.
You may recall prior to the start of term I expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor...
Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?
Perhaps.
But for now, let him sleep.
For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.
Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
Turn to page 394.
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?
That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?
Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time.
Turn to page 394.
"Werewolves"?
Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?
Now, which one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?
No one?
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.
An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
A werewolf has no choice.
With each full moon he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.
The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.
Are you incapable of restraining yourself or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.
As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.
Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter.
Loss of limb will not excuse you.
Page 394.
The term "werewolf" is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer" which means "man," and "wolf." Werewolf, man-wolf.
There are several ways to become a werewolf.
They include being given the power of shape-shifting being bitten by a werewolf...
Go, Harry!
Go, Harry!
Aresto momentum!
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.
Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.
Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.
You gave us a right good scare.
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.
Really?
I meant the match.
Who won?
No one blames you, Harry.
Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds.
Dumbledore's furious.
After he saved you, he sent them off.
There's something else you should know too.
When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and...
Well...
I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.
Is there no chance of fixing it?
No.
Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.
Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.
They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.
You are not weak, Harry.
Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.
Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.
You made the one on the train go away.
There was only one that night.
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.
But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.
For now, I need to rest.
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.
We'll get you there.
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- If you pipe down.
- Bless him.
- Let me go!
Come on, guys.
Don't...
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.
What are you doing?
!
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...
But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
George, if you will.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder's Map."
We owe them so much.
Hang on.
This is Hogwarts.
And that...
- No.
Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.
- In his study.
- Pacing.
Does that a lot.
- So this map shows...
- Everyone.
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.
- Every minute.
- Every day.
- Brilliant!
Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.
Hurry.
Filch is heading this way.
And don't forget.
When you're done, just give it a tap and say:
"Mischief managed." Otherwise, anyone can read it.
Now, how much do you want?
Delicious.
It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain.
Did I mention that?
Twice.
Do you want to move a bit closer?
To the Shrieking Shack?
Actually, I'm fine here.
Well, well.
Look who's here.
You two shopping for your new dream home?
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.
Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!
You filthy little mudblood!
Who is that?
- Don't stand there!
Do something!
- What?
What's up, Malfoy?
Lost your skis?
Get out of the way!
Move!
Malfoy!
Wait!
Wait!
Harry!
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.
Those weasels!
Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
He won't keep it.
He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.
- Aren't you?
- Sure.
Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
Look who it is.
Madam Rosmerta.
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!
Allow me, minister.
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors into my pub every other night!
- We have...
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
And what would bring him here?
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?
Come.
Harry!
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!
- So rude.
- Thick heads.
- Thick heads?
!
- How dare they!
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!
Nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place.
Tell me what this is all about.
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death...
Remember?
They hid.
Few knew where they were.
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.
Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night he also killed Peter Pettigrew!
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.
Never let James and Sirius out of his sight.
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters and might have, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.
He destroyed him!
A finger.
That's all that was left.
A finger.
Nothing else.
Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.
- What could be worse?
- This:
Sirius Black was and remains to this day Harry Potter's godfather!
Ron, look!
- Sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.
Harry, what happened?
He was their friend and he betrayed them.
He was their friend!
I hope he finds me.
Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!
Harry.
There you are.
You came.
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level.
I'm sure.
Well, everything's prepared.
The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm.
Did you ever hear of it?
No?
Well...
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.
But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory.
Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.
Can you do this?
Yes.
Very well.
Close your eyes.
Concentrate.
Explore your past.
Do you have a memory?
Allow it to fill you up.
Lose yourself within it.
Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum.
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.
Shall we?
Wand at the ready.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto...
Expecto...
Expect...
Here we go.
Come on.
Sit up.
Deep breaths.
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to do it the first time.
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this.
You'll feel better.
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.
As a matter of interest, what were you thinking?
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.
Well, it is.
It's the happiest I've ever felt but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?
Then let's give it a try.
You feel ready?
Just do it.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto Patronum!
Yes!
Well done, Harry.
Well done!
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes.
Sit down.
Here.
Eat this, it helps.
It really helps.
And just so you know, Harry I think you'd have given your father a run for his money.
And that is saying something.
I was thinking of him.
And Mum.
Seeing their faces.
They were talking to me.
Just talking.
That's the memory I chose.
I don't even know if it's real.
But it's the best I have.
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.
Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.
- Did.
- Didn't.
How did it go, Hagrid?
The hearing?
Well, first off, the committee members took turns talking about why we were there.
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers.
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.
He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you.
And then?
And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
Spiders!
There's...
There's spiders.
Spiders.
They want me to tap-dance.
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- Tell those spiders.
Right, yeah.
Tell them.
I'll tell them...
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.
He didn 't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!
Mischief managed.
Nox.
Potter.
What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
I was sleepwalking.
How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter.
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.
My dad didn't strut.
And nor do I.
If you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.
Turn out your pockets.
Turn out your pockets!
What's this?
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really?
Open it.
Reveal your secrets.
Read it.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."
Go on.
"And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business."
- You insolent little...
- Professor!
Well, well.
Lupin.
Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?
Harry, are you all right?
That remains to be seen.
I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.
It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.
Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.
It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise.
Harry, would you come with me, please?
Professor, good night.
Are you deaf?
Put that light out!
Come in.
I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in.
Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black is a map to you?
- No.
- No, sir.
Your father never set much store by the rules either.
But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.
Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!
Now, I will not cover up for you again.
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.
I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.
Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works.
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.
Oh, really?
And who might that be?
Peter Pettigrew.
That's not possible.
It's just what I saw.
Good night, professor.
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.
The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.
Only then can you see.
Try again.
Now, what do we have here?
Do you mind me trying?
The Grim, possibly.
My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.
You may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave.
Have I said something?
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental but now it's in the open for everyone to see.
Hang on.
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.
- Fine.
See you later.
- See you.
Harry Potter...
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.
Sorry?
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder shall break free.
Innocent blood shall be spilt and servant and master shall be reunited once more.
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?
No.
Nothing.
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak.
It's just too horrible.
- It just got worse.
- What did I say?
Father said I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.
This is going to be rich.
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?
You!
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
Malfoy, are you okay?
- Let's go.
Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Look at him.
Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
Why don't we just set him free?
They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.
Says he wants to be with me when they...
When it happens.
Great man, Dumbledore.
A great man.
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!
Think I want you seeing something like that?
No.
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh.
Before you do, Ron...
Scabbers!
You're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.
Right.
Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.
I meant me!
Blimey.
What was that?
Hagrid!
Oh, crikey.
No, minister.
Over this way.
It's late.
It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.
Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble.
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!
Quick.
Quick!
Hagrid.
- It'll be fine.
It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.
- On the slope...
Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.
- Good evening.
- Minister.
Make your way through.
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.
Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we?
Very well.
It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak hereinafter called "the condemned," shall be executed this day at sundown.
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid.
Now, come on.
- All right.
It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go!
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Oh, no.
He bit me.
Scabbers.
Ron.
Ron!
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.
Wait!
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
That's not good.
Ron, run!
Harry, Hermione, run!
It's the Grim!
- Harry!
- Ron!
Ron, wait!
Harry!
- Help!
- Ron!
- Ron.
Ron.
- Ron!
Come on!
Move!
Duck!
Harry!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.
I just hope I'm wrong.
We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
Come on.
Ron.
- Ron.
You're okay.
- The dog.
Where is it?
It's a trap.
He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.
If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!
No.
Only one will die tonight.
Then it'll be you!
Are you going to kill me, Harry?
Expelliarmus!
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?
Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within.
Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you?
- I found him.
- I know.
- It's him.
- I understand.
- Let's kill him!
- No!
I trusted you!
And all this time, you've been his friend.
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.
How long have you known?
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.
You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!
Twelve years of it!
In Azkaban!
Very well.
Kill him.
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.
I know why.
You betrayed my parents.
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.
Somebody did betray your parents somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!
And he's in this room!
Right now!
Come out, come out, Peter!
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!
Vengeance is sweet.
How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
Severus...
I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle.
Here's the proof.
Brilliant, Snape.
You've put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion.
If you'll excuse us, Remus and I have business to attend to.
- Give me a reason.
I beg you!
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it.
It's habit.
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!
You two, quarrelling like an old married couple.
Run along and play with your chemistry set!
I could do it, you know.
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.
A Dementor's Kiss.
One can only imagine what that must be like.
It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.
Severus, please.
After you.
Expelliarmus!
- Harry!
What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.
We thought he was our friend!
- No.
Pettigrew's dead.
You killed him!
- No, he didn't.
I thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map!
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!
- Me?
!
He's mental!
- Not you!
Your rat!
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?
Curiously long life for a common garden rat!
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!
Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?
Scabbers!
Leave him alone!
Get off him!
What are you doing?
Remus?
Sirius.
My old friends!
Harry!
Look at you.
You look so much like your father.
- James.
We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!
How dare you talk about James in front of him!
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!
The Dark Lord.
You have no idea the weapons he possesses!
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!
James wouldn't have wanted me killed!
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!
Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would.
Together!
No!
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.
But we'll take him to the castle.
- Bless you, boy.
Bless you!
- Get off!
I said we'd take you to the castle.
After that, the dementors can have you.
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.
A bit?
A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!
I was going for the rat.
Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog.
More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent.
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.
Okay.
- You better go.
- No.
Don't worry, okay?
It's fine.
I'll stay.
You go, I'll stay.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
Go.
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.
They might chop it.
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
It's too late.
It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.
It'll be nice to do it again as a free man.
That was a noble thing you did back there.
He doesn't deserve it.
I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends to become killers.
Besides, dead, the truth dies with him.
Alive, you're free.
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!
Ron!
Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!
- Sweet, clever girl!
Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!
I don't know if you know, Harry but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather.
I know.
I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle but if you ever wanted a different home...
What?
Come and live with you?
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.
Harry!
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live!
Here!
This flesh is only flesh!
Expelliarmus!
Harry!
Remus!
Remus!
Run!
Run!
- Come on.
- Wait.
Wait.
Hermione!
Bad idea.
Bad idea.
Professor?
Professor Lupin?
Nice doggy.
Nice doggy!
There you are, Potter!
Sirius!
Come back here, Potter!
Sirius!
No.
Sirius!
Expecto Patronum!
Harry?
I saw my dad.
What?
He sent the dementors away.
I saw him across the lake.
Harry, they've captured Sirius.
Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.
- They're gonna kill him?
- No.
It's worse.
Much worse.
They're going to suck out his soul.
Headmaster, stop them.
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true.
Sirius is innocent.
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?
He's my rat, sir.
He's not really a rat.
He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.
But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.
A child's voice, however honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.
Mysterious thing, time.
Powerful and when meddled with, dangerous.
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen.
And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime.
If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss.
If you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared.
Three turns should do it, I think.
Oh, and by the way.
When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin.
Good luck.
What the bloody hell was that all about?
Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk...
What just happened?
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.
Where were we at 7:30?
I don't know.
Going to Hagrid's?
Come on.
And we can't be seen.
Hermione!
Hermione!
Hermione, wait.
Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
That's us.
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
This is not normal.
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first term.
This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.
Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.
Good punch.
Thanks.
Malfoy's coming.
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood!
Mark my words.
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Come on.
We should be at Hagrid's.
Look.
Buckbeak's still alive.
Of course.
Remember what Dumbledore said?
If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.
Let's go.
Here they come.
I'd better hurry.
Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.
Scabbers, you're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.
If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad.
Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time.
We can't be seen.
Fudge is coming.
And we aren't leaving?
Why aren't we leaving?
Are you mad?
That hurt.
Sorry.
We're coming out the back door.
Go!
Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go.
Okay, go, Harry.
Go!
Get away.
Get off.
Minister, I really think I should sign as well.
Yes, very well.
Perhaps it would be...
Okay, Buckbeak.
Come quickly.
Come with us now.
Come on.
Keep trying.
Come on.
Quickly.
Buckbeak.
Okay?
Quickly.
Hurry up.
Okay?
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.
Come and get the nice dead ferret.
- Come on.
It's here.
Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister.
Follow me.
- Now, look there.
- Where?
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?
Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
- Oh, yes.
Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.
- Come on, Buckbeak.
Come on.
- I see no strawberries.
- Over there.
- Where?
- Over there.
- This way.
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.
But where is it?
I saw the beast, just now.
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.
Buckbeak.
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.
I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.
- Right.
- Well, well.
We must search the grounds.
Well, search the skies, if you must, minister.
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy.
Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required.
Thank you.
You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor.
- Come on.
- This way.
This way, now.
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.
- How?
- No idea.
- Look.
It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!
And Snape's coming.
And now we wait.
And now we wait.
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.
- Hermione?
- Yeah?
Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius I did see someone.
That someone made the dementors go away.
With a Patronus.
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
According to him only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
It was my dad.
My dad conjured the Patronus.
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead.
I know.
I'm just telling you what I saw.
Here we come.
You see Sirius talking to me there?
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'.
It'll just be me and him.
We could live in the country someplace you can see the sky.
He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
Harry!
Run!
Let's go.
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.
Thanks.
- Great.
Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that.
Run!
That was so scary.
Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
Sirius.
Come on!
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.
Any minute now.
Right there.
You'll see.
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.
- Sirius.
- You're dying both of you.
Harry!
Expecto Patronum!
You were right, Hermione.
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!
I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.
I knew I could do it this time because well, I had already done it.
- Does that make sense?
- No.
But I don't like flying...!
Bombarda!
I'll be forever grateful for this to both of you.
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.
For some time, my life will be too unpredictable.
And besides you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.
And you know it.
And for now, that will do.
I expect you're tired of hearing this but you look so like your father.
Except your eyes.
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.
It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little.
But know this:
The ones that love us never really leave us.
And you can always find them in here.
You really are the brightest witch of your age.
We have to go.
- Well?
- He's free.
We did it.
Did what?
Good night.
How did you get there?
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.
Honestly, Ron.
How can somebody be in two places at once?
Hello, Harry.
I saw you coming.
I've looked worse, believe me.
- You've been sacked.
- No.
No.
I resigned, actually.
Resigned?
Why?
Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition.
This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want well, someone like me teaching their children.
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already risked enough on my behalf.
Besides, people like me are...
Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now.
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
None of it made any difference.
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.
You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.
It made a great deal of difference.
If I am proud of anything it is of how much you have learned this year.
Now, since I am no longer your teacher I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you.
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
Until then mischief managed.
Stand back, I said!
Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle.
Harry.
Wherever did you get it?
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.
Did not.
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.
For me?
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.
This came with it.
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.
How fast is it, Harry?
Lumos.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
Mischief managed.
Nox.

Harry.
Harry.
Harry, open the door.
Marge.
How lovely to see...
Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.
What is it?
Nothing.
School stuff.
Later perhaps, if you behave.
I will if she does.
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.
Don't say yes in that ungrateful way.
Damn good of my brother to keep you.
He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?
Give us a kiss.
Come on.
Up, up.
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
Okay.
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.
Excellent nosh, Petunia.
A bit more.
Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs.
Just a bit more.
That's a boy.
You wanna try a little drop of brandy?
A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?
What are you smirking at?
Where did you send the boy, Vernon?
St. Brutus'.
It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I've been beaten loads of times.
Excellent.
I won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it.
You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out.
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.
What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?
Nothing.
He didn't work.
He was unemployed.
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.
Don't worry.
Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.
I think it's time you went to bed.
Quiet, Vernon.
You, clean it up.
Actually, it's nothing to do with the father.
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.
If something's wrong with the bitch, then something's wrong with the pup.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Right.
Let me tell you...
Vernon!
Vernon!
Vernon, do something!
Stop!
I've got you, Marge.
I've got you.
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.
Oh, Vernon.
Oh, God.
Marge!
Please!
Marge!
Come back!
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.
- You put her right!
- No.
She deserved what she got.
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.
- Yeah?
Try me.
- They won't let you back now.
You've nowhere to go.
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.
"Welcome to the Knight Bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard.
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening."
What you doing down there?
- I fell over.
- What you fall over for?
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.
Well, come on, then.
In.
No, no, no.
I'll get this.
You get in.
Come on.
Come on.
Move on, move on.
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London.
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup make sure you eat it before it eats you.
- But the Muggles.
Can't they see us?
- Muggles?
They don't see nothing, do they?
No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel.
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!
Ten, nine, eight seven, six, five four, three, three and a half two, one and three quarters.
Yes!
Who is that?
That man.
Who is that?
Who is...?
That is Sirius Black, that is.
Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black.
He's a murderer.
Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?
He's the first one that done it.
He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.
I reckon you've heard of him.
Yeah.
Him I've heard of.
Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock.
They're getting closer, Ernie.
Ernie, they're right on top of us!
Mind your head.
Hey, guys?
Guys?
Why the long faces?
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there.
Nearly there.
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.
Mr. Potter, at last.
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!
Room 11.
Hedwig.
Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter.
He arrived here just five minutes before yourself.
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack.
The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately.
She has been properly punctured and her memory modified.
She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.
So that's that and no harm done.
Pea soup?
No, thank you.
- Minister?
- Yes?
- I don't understand.
- Understand?
I broke the law.
Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
Come now.
The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts.
On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things was very, very irresponsible.
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.
Sirius Black, you mean?
But what's he got to do with me?
Nothing, of course.
You're safe.
And that's what matters.
And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.
Hedwig.
Oh, by the way, Harry.
Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't wander.
Right!
You gonna move that bus or what?
Housekeeping.
I'll come back later.
I'm warning you, Hermione.
Keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?
- It's in his nature.
- A cat?
Is that what they told you?
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...
Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.
Harry.
Harry.
- Egypt.
What's it like?
- Brilliant.
Loads of old stuff like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.
- The day maid.
- Night maid.
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.
- Got everything?
- Yes.
- Yes?
All your books?
- It's all upstairs.
- Your clothes?
- Everything.
- Good boy.
- Thank you.
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah.
It should be great.
Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you.
But I think that you need to know the facts.
You are in danger.
Grave danger.
Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?
What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?
Thirteen years ago, when you stopped...
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.
Sorry.
When you stopped You-Know-Who Black lost everything.
But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant.
And in his mind you are the only thing that stands in the way of You-Know-Who returning to power.
And that is why he has escaped from Azkaban.
To find you.
And kill me.
Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear you won't go looking for Black.
Mr. Weasley why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
Quick.
Quick.
Ron, Ron!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Don't lose him!
I didn't mean to blow her up.
I just...
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
I was lucky not to be arrested.
I still think it was brilliant.
Come on.
Everywhere else is full.
Who do you think that is?
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?
How is it she knows everything?
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be.
Why?
I gotta tell you something.
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
- Yeah.
But they'll catch Black, won't they?
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.
Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.
Why are we stopping?
We can't be there yet.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.
Ouch, Ron.
That was my foot.
There's something moving out there.
I think someone's coming aboard.
Bloody hell!
What's happening?
Harry.
Harry, are you all right?
Thank you.
Here, eat this.
It'll help.
It's all right.
It's chocolate.
What was that thing that came?
It was a dementor.
One of the guards of Azkaban.
It's gone now.
It was searching the train for Sirius Black.
If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver.
Eat.
You'll feel better.
What happened to me?
Well, you sort of went rigid.
We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
And did either of you two you know pass out?
- No.
I felt weird, though.
Like I'd never be cheerful again.
But someone was screaming.
A woman.
No one was screaming, Harry.
Welcome!
Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.
Now, I'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast.
First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin who's kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
Good luck, professor.
Of course.
That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.
Potter.
Is it true you fainted?
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.
Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.
Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid.
Finally, on a more disquieting note at the request of the Ministry of Magic Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban until such a time as Sirius Black is captured.
The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
Now whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution.
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.
Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.
It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
But you know, happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light.
Fortuna Major.
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no.
Wait, wait.
Watch this.
- Amazing.
Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.
- Yes, all right.
Go in.
- Thank you.
Still doing that after three years.
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.
Green.
That's a monkey.
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?
Do not give him one again.
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
- Ron, catch.
- I will.
I think we have a winner.
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.
Look at him.
His face.
Welcome, my children.
In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination.
In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight.
Hello.
I am Professor Trelawney.
Together we shall cast ourselves into the future.
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves.
So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you.
What do you see?
The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read.
But first, you must broaden your minds.
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.
- Where did you come from?
- Me?
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...
Is your grandmother quite well?
I think so.
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.
Pity.
Broaden your minds.
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?
- I think you are.
- Sure.
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.
Yeah.
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.
And that there could be the sun and that's happiness.
So you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.
Give me the cup.
Oh, my dear boy.
My dear you have the Grim.
The Grin?
What's the Grin?
Not the Grin, you idiot.
The Grim.
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.
It's among the darkest omens in our world.
It's an omen of death."
You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Oh, honestly, Ron.
If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline.
Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.
Ancient Runes?
Exactly how many classes are you taking?
A fair few.
Hang on.
That's not possible.
Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.
You have to be in two classes at once.
Don't be silly.
How could anyone be in two classes at once?
"Broaden your minds.
Use your Inner Eye to see the future."
That's it.
Come on, now.
Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.
I got a real treat for you today.
A great lesson.
So follow me.
Right, you lot.
Less chattering.
Form a group over there.
And open your books to page 49.
Exactly how do we do that?
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay.
Okay.
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah.
Terribly funny.
Witty.
God, this place has gone to the dogs.
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.
Shut up, Malfoy.
Dementor!
Dementor!
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.
Yeah.
Isn't he beautiful?
Say hello to Buckbeak.
Hagrid, exactly what is that?
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.
First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
It may be the last thing you ever do.
Now, who'd like to come and say hello?
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Come on now.
Now you have to let him make the first move.
It's only polite.
So step up.
Give him a nice bow.
Then you wait and see if he bows back.
If he does, you can go and touch him.
If not...
Well, we'll get to that later.
Just make your bow.
Nice and low.
Back off, Harry.
Back off.
Keep still.
Keep still.
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.
Right.
I think you can go and pat him now.
Go on.
Don't be shy.
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow.
Slow.
Not so fast, Harry.
Slow down, Harry.
That's it...
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...
That's it...
Yes!
Well done!
Well done, Harry, well done!
Does he get to fly?
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Put you over here, just behind the wing joint.
Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that.
Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak.
That was wicked, Harry!
Oh, please.
Well done, well done.
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.
You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!
Malfoy, no...
No!
Buckbeak!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa!
Buckbeak!
Away, you silly creature...
- It's killed me!
- Calm down.
It's just a scratch!
Hagrid!
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher.
I'll do it.
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!
You and your bloody chicken!
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.
Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm.
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.
- He's been sighted!
- Who?
Sirius Black!
Dufftown?
That's not far from here.
You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?
That's right.
Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.
Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
Intriguing, isn't it?
Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what is inside?
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.
Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...
Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart.
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.
After me.
Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.
So much for the easy part.
You see, the incantation alone is not enough.
What really finishes a boggart is laughter.
You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.
Let me explain.
Neville, would you join me, please?
Come on, don't be shy.
Come on.
Come on.
Hello.
Neville, what frightens you most of all?
Professor Snape.
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.
Professor Snape.
Yes, frightens all.
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.
No it won't.
I want you to picture her clothes.
Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe here's what I want you to do.
Excuse me.
Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.
Can you do that?
Yes.
Wand at the ready.
One, two, three.
Think, Neville, think.
Riddikulus!
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible!
Okay to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...
Form a line!
I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most and turn it into something funny.
Next!
Ron!
Concentrate.
Face your fear.
Be brave!
Wand at the ready, Ron.
Riddikulus!
Yes!
You see?
Very good, very good!
Marvelous!
Absolutely, very, very enjoyable!
Parvati!
Next!
Show us what you see.
Keep your nerve.
Steady.
Riddikulus!
And next!
Step up, step up!
Wonderful, wonderful!
Here!
Riddikulus!
Right.
Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.
Collect your books from the back.
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you!
Sorry!
Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege.
Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school that privilege shall not be extended again.
No permission form signed, no visiting the village.
That's the rule, Potter.
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.
I thought if you signed it, then I could...
I can't.
Only a parent or a guardian can sign.
Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate.
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.
Forget about it, guys.
See you later.
Professor, can I ask you something?
You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?
I thought it'd be obvious.
I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.
I did think of Voldemort at first.
But then I remembered that night on the train and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.
That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.
This is very wise.
Before I fainted I heard something.
A woman screaming.
Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.
Our pain becomes their power.
I think it was my mother the night she was murdered.
The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.
Not by your scar, by your eyes.
They're your mother, Lily's.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
I knew her.
Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.
Not only was she a singularly gifted witch she was also an uncommonly kind woman.
She had a way of seeing the beauty in others even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves.
And your father, James, on the other hand he...
He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble.
A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.
You're more like them than you know, Harry.
In time, you'll come to see just how much.
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain.
I know.
What's going on?
Probably Neville forgot the password again.
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.
Let me through, please.
Excuse me!
I'm Head Boy!
Get back, all of you.
No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.
The Fat Lady!
She's gone!
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.
It's not funny, Ron.
Keep calm, everyone.
Break into fours.
Back to your common room.
- Be quiet.
- Make way.
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.
You heard.
Move!
Mr. Filch?
Round up the ghosts.
Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
There's no need for ghosts, professor.
The Fat Lady's there.
Mind where you're going!
Slow down!
You listen!
I'm Head Boy!
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!
Dear lady, who did this to you?
Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.
He's here, somewhere in the castle!
Sirius Black!
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery.
There's nothing there.
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.
I didn't really expect him to linger.
Remarkable feat, don't you think?
To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own...
Any theories on how he managed it?
Many.
Each as unlikely as the next.
You may recall prior to the start of term I expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor...
Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?
Perhaps.
But for now, let him sleep.
For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.
Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
Turn to page 394.
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?
That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?
Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time.
Turn to page 394.
"Werewolves"?
Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?
Now, which one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?
No one?
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.
An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
A werewolf has no choice.
With each full moon he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.
The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.
Are you incapable of restraining yourself or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.
As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.
Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter.
Loss of limb will not excuse you.
Page 394.
The term "werewolf" is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer" which means "man," and "wolf." Werewolf, man-wolf.
There are several ways to become a werewolf.
They include being given the power of shape-shifting being bitten by a werewolf...
Go, Harry!
Go, Harry!
Aresto momentum!
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.
Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.
Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.
You gave us a right good scare.
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.
Really?
I meant the match.
Who won?
No one blames you, Harry.
Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds.
Dumbledore's furious.
After he saved you, he sent them off.
There's something else you should know too.
When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and...
Well...
I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.
Is there no chance of fixing it?
No.
Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.
Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.
They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.
You are not weak, Harry.
Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.
Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.
You made the one on the train go away.
There was only one that night.
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.
But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.
For now, I need to rest.
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.
We'll get you there.
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- If you pipe down.
- Bless him.
- Let me go!
Come on, guys.
Don't...
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.
What are you doing?
!
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...
But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
George, if you will.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder's Map."
We owe them so much.
Hang on.
This is Hogwarts.
And that...
- No.
Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.
- In his study.
- Pacing.
Does that a lot.
- So this map shows...
- Everyone.
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.
- Every minute.
- Every day.
- Brilliant!
Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.
Hurry.
Filch is heading this way.
And don't forget.
When you're done, just give it a tap and say:
"Mischief managed." Otherwise, anyone can read it.
Now, how much do you want?
Delicious.
It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain.
Did I mention that?
Twice.
Do you want to move a bit closer?
To the Shrieking Shack?
Actually, I'm fine here.
Well, well.
Look who's here.
You two shopping for your new dream home?
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.
Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!
You filthy little mudblood!
Who is that?
- Don't stand there!
Do something!
- What?
What's up, Malfoy?
Lost your skis?
Get out of the way!
Move!
Malfoy!
Wait!
Wait!
Harry!
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.
Those weasels!
Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
He won't keep it.
He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.
- Aren't you?
- Sure.
Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
Look who it is.
Madam Rosmerta.
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!
Allow me, minister.
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors into my pub every other night!
- We have...
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
And what would bring him here?
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?
Come.
Harry!
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!
- So rude.
- Thick heads.
- Thick heads?
!
- How dare they!
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!
Nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place.
Tell me what this is all about.
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death...
Remember?
They hid.
Few knew where they were.
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.
Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night he also killed Peter Pettigrew!
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.
Never let James and Sirius out of his sight.
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters and might have, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.
He destroyed him!
A finger.
That's all that was left.
A finger.
Nothing else.
Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.
- What could be worse?
- This:
Sirius Black was and remains to this day Harry Potter's godfather!
Ron, look!
- Sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.
Harry, what happened?
He was their friend and he betrayed them.
He was their friend!
I hope he finds me.
Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!
Harry.
There you are.
You came.
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level.
I'm sure.
Well, everything's prepared.
The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm.
Did you ever hear of it?
No?
Well...
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.
But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory.
Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.
Can you do this?
Yes.
Very well.
Close your eyes.
Concentrate.
Explore your past.
Do you have a memory?
Allow it to fill you up.
Lose yourself within it.
Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum.
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.
Shall we?
Wand at the ready.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto...
Expecto...
Expect...
Here we go.
Come on.
Sit up.
Deep breaths.
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to do it the first time.
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this.
You'll feel better.
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.
As a matter of interest, what were you thinking?
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.
Well, it is.
It's the happiest I've ever felt but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?
Then let's give it a try.
You feel ready?
Just do it.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto Patronum!
Yes!
Well done, Harry.
Well done!
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes.
Sit down.
Here.
Eat this, it helps.
It really helps.
And just so you know, Harry I think you'd have given your father a run for his money.
And that is saying something.
I was thinking of him.
And Mum.
Seeing their faces.
They were talking to me.
Just talking.
That's the memory I chose.
I don't even know if it's real.
But it's the best I have.
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.
Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.
- Did.
- Didn't.
How did it go, Hagrid?
The hearing?
Well, first off, the committee members took turns talking about why we were there.
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers.
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.
He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you.
And then?
And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
Spiders!
There's...
There's spiders.
Spiders.
They want me to tap-dance.
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- Tell those spiders.
Right, yeah.
Tell them.
I'll tell them...
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.
He didn 't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!
Mischief managed.
Nox.
Potter.
What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
I was sleepwalking.
How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter.
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.
My dad didn't strut.
And nor do I.
If you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.
Turn out your pockets.
Turn out your pockets!
What's this?
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really?
Open it.
Reveal your secrets.
Read it.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."
Go on.
"And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business."
- You insolent little...
- Professor!
Well, well.
Lupin.
Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?
Harry, are you all right?
That remains to be seen.
I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.
It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.
Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.
It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise.
Harry, would you come with me, please?
Professor, good night.
Are you deaf?
Put that light out!
Come in.
I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in.
Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black is a map to you?
- No.
- No, sir.
Your father never set much store by the rules either.
But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.
Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!
Now, I will not cover up for you again.
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.
I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.
Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works.
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.
Oh, really?
And who might that be?
Peter Pettigrew.
That's not possible.
It's just what I saw.
Good night, professor.
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.
The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.
Only then can you see.
Try again.
Now, what do we have here?
Do you mind me trying?
The Grim, possibly.
My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.
You may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave.
Have I said something?
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental but now it's in the open for everyone to see.
Hang on.
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.
- Fine.
See you later.
- See you.
Harry Potter...
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.
Sorry?
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder shall break free.
Innocent blood shall be spilt and servant and master shall be reunited once more.
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?
No.
Nothing.
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak.
It's just too horrible.
- It just got worse.
- What did I say?
Father said I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.
This is going to be rich.
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?
You!
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
Malfoy, are you okay?
- Let's go.
Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Look at him.
Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
Why don't we just set him free?
They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.
Says he wants to be with me when they...
When it happens.
Great man, Dumbledore.
A great man.
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!
Think I want you seeing something like that?
No.
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh.
Before you do, Ron...
Scabbers!
You're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.
Right.
Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.
I meant me!
Blimey.
What was that?
Hagrid!
Oh, crikey.
No, minister.
Over this way.
It's late.
It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.
Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble.
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!
Quick.
Quick!
Hagrid.
- It'll be fine.
It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.
- On the slope...
Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.
- Good evening.
- Minister.
Make your way through.
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.
Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we?
Very well.
It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak hereinafter called "the condemned," shall be executed this day at sundown.
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid.
Now, come on.
- All right.
It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go!
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Oh, no.
He bit me.
Scabbers.
Ron.
Ron!
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.
Wait!
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
That's not good.
Ron, run!
Harry, Hermione, run!
It's the Grim!
- Harry!
- Ron!
Ron, wait!
Harry!
- Help!
- Ron!
- Ron.
Ron.
- Ron!
Come on!
Move!
Duck!
Harry!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.
I just hope I'm wrong.
We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
Come on.
Ron.
- Ron.
You're okay.
- The dog.
Where is it?
It's a trap.
He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.
If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!
No.
Only one will die tonight.
Then it'll be you!
Are you going to kill me, Harry?
Expelliarmus!
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?
Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within.
Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you?
- I found him.
- I know.
- It's him.
- I understand.
- Let's kill him!
- No!
I trusted you!
And all this time, you've been his friend.
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.
How long have you known?
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.
You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!
Twelve years of it!
In Azkaban!
Very well.
Kill him.
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.
I know why.
You betrayed my parents.
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.
Somebody did betray your parents somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!
And he's in this room!
Right now!
Come out, come out, Peter!
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!
Vengeance is sweet.
How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
Severus...
I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle.
Here's the proof.
Brilliant, Snape.
You've put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion.
If you'll excuse us, Remus and I have business to attend to.
- Give me a reason.
I beg you!
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it.
It's habit.
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!
You two, quarrelling like an old married couple.
Run along and play with your chemistry set!
I could do it, you know.
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.
A Dementor's Kiss.
One can only imagine what that must be like.
It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.
Severus, please.
After you.
Expelliarmus!
- Harry!
What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.
We thought he was our friend!
- No.
Pettigrew's dead.
You killed him!
- No, he didn't.
I thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map!
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!
- Me?
!
He's mental!
- Not you!
Your rat!
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?
Curiously long life for a common garden rat!
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!
Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?
Scabbers!
Leave him alone!
Get off him!
What are you doing?
Remus?
Sirius.
My old friends!
Harry!
Look at you.
You look so much like your father.
- James.
We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!
How dare you talk about James in front of him!
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!
The Dark Lord.
You have no idea the weapons he possesses!
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!
James wouldn't have wanted me killed!
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!
Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would.
Together!
No!
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.
But we'll take him to the castle.
- Bless you, boy.
Bless you!
- Get off!
I said we'd take you to the castle.
After that, the dementors can have you.
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.
A bit?
A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!
I was going for the rat.
Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog.
More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent.
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.
Okay.
- You better go.
- No.
Don't worry, okay?
It's fine.
I'll stay.
You go, I'll stay.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
Go.
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.
They might chop it.
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
It's too late.
It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.
It'll be nice to do it again as a free man.
That was a noble thing you did back there.
He doesn't deserve it.
I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends to become killers.
Besides, dead, the truth dies with him.
Alive, you're free.
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!
Ron!
Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!
- Sweet, clever girl!
Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!
I don't know if you know, Harry but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather.
I know.
I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle but if you ever wanted a different home...
What?
Come and live with you?
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.
Harry!
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live!
Here!
This flesh is only flesh!
Expelliarmus!
Harry!
Remus!
Remus!
Run!
Run!
- Come on.
- Wait.
Wait.
Hermione!
Bad idea.
Bad idea.
Professor?
Professor Lupin?
Nice doggy.
Nice doggy!
There you are, Potter!
Sirius!
Come back here, Potter!
Sirius!
No.
Sirius!
Expecto Patronum!
Harry?
I saw my dad.
What?
He sent the dementors away.
I saw him across the lake.
Harry, they've captured Sirius.
Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.
- They're gonna kill him?
- No.
It's worse.
Much worse.
They're going to suck out his soul.
Headmaster, stop them.
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true.
Sirius is innocent.
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?
He's my rat, sir.
He's not really a rat.
He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.
But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.
A child's voice, however honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.
Mysterious thing, time.
Powerful and when meddled with, dangerous.
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen.
And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime.
If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss.
If you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared.
Three turns should do it, I think.
Oh, and by the way.
When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin.
Good luck.
What the bloody hell was that all about?
Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk...
What just happened?
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.
Where were we at 7:30?
I don't know.
Going to Hagrid's?
Come on.
And we can't be seen.
Hermione!
Hermione!
Hermione, wait.
Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
That's us.
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
This is not normal.
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first term.
This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.
Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.
Good punch.
Thanks.
Malfoy's coming.
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood!
Mark my words.
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Come on.
We should be at Hagrid's.
Look.
Buckbeak's still alive.
Of course.
Remember what Dumbledore said?
If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.
Let's go.
Here they come.
I'd better hurry.
Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.
Scabbers, you're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.
If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad.
Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time.
We can't be seen.
Fudge is coming.
And we aren't leaving?
Why aren't we leaving?
Are you mad?
That hurt.
Sorry.
We're coming out the back door.
Go!
Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go.
Okay, go, Harry.
Go!
Get away.
Get off.
Minister, I really think I should sign as well.
Yes, very well.
Perhaps it would be...
Okay, Buckbeak.
Come quickly.
Come with us now.
Come on.
Keep trying.
Come on.
Quickly.
Buckbeak.
Okay?
Quickly.
Hurry up.
Okay?
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.
Come and get the nice dead ferret.
- Come on.
It's here.
Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister.
Follow me.
- Now, look there.
- Where?
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?
Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
- Oh, yes.
Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.
- Come on, Buckbeak.
Come on.
- I see no strawberries.
- Over there.
- Where?
- Over there.
- This way.
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.
But where is it?
I saw the beast, just now.
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.
Buckbeak.
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.
I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.
- Right.
- Well, well.
We must search the grounds.
Well, search the skies, if you must, minister.
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy.
Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required.
Thank you.
You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor.
- Come on.
- This way.
This way, now.
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.
- How?
- No idea.
- Look.
It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!
And Snape's coming.
And now we wait.
And now we wait.
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.
- Hermione?
- Yeah?
Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius I did see someone.
That someone made the dementors go away.
With a Patronus.
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
According to him only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
It was my dad.
My dad conjured the Patronus.
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead.
I know.
I'm just telling you what I saw.
Here we come.
You see Sirius talking to me there?
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'.
It'll just be me and him.
We could live in the country someplace you can see the sky.
He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
Harry!
Run!
Let's go.
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.
Thanks.
- Great.
Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that.
Run!
That was so scary.
Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
Sirius.
Come on!
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.
Any minute now.
Right there.
You'll see.
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.
- Sirius.
- You're dying both of you.
Harry!
Expecto Patronum!
You were right, Hermione.
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!
I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.
I knew I could do it this time because well, I had already done it.
- Does that make sense?
- No.
But I don't like flying...!
Bombarda!
I'll be forever grateful for this to both of you.
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.
For some time, my life will be too unpredictable.
And besides you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.
And you know it.
And for now, that will do.
I expect you're tired of hearing this but you look so like your father.
Except your eyes.
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.
It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little.
But know this:
The ones that love us never really leave us.
And you can always find them in here.
You really are the brightest witch of your age.
We have to go.
- Well?
- He's free.
We did it.
Did what?
Good night.
How did you get there?
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.
Honestly, Ron.
How can somebody be in two places at once?
Hello, Harry.
I saw you coming.
I've looked worse, believe me.
- You've been sacked.
- No.
No.
I resigned, actually.
Resigned?
Why?
Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition.
This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want well, someone like me teaching their children.
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already risked enough on my behalf.
Besides, people like me are...
Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now.
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
None of it made any difference.
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.
You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.
It made a great deal of difference.
If I am proud of anything it is of how much you have learned this year.
Now, since I am no longer your teacher I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you.
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
Until then mischief managed.
Stand back, I said!
Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle.
Harry.
Wherever did you get it?
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.
Did not.
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.
For me?
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.
This came with it.
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.
How fast is it, Harry?
Lumos.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
Mischief managed.
Nox.

Harry.
Harry.
Harry, open the door.
Marge.
How lovely to see...
Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.
What is it?
Nothing.
School stuff.
Later perhaps, if you behave.
I will if she does.
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.
Don't say yes in that ungrateful way.
Damn good of my brother to keep you.
He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?
Give us a kiss.
Come on.
Up, up.
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
Okay.
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.
Excellent nosh, Petunia.
A bit more.
Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs.
Just a bit more.
That's a boy.
You wanna try a little drop of brandy?
A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?
What are you smirking at?
Where did you send the boy, Vernon?
St. Brutus'.
It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I've been beaten loads of times.
Excellent.
I won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it.
You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out.
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.
What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?
Nothing.
He didn't work.
He was unemployed.
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.
Don't worry.
Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.
I think it's time you went to bed.
Quiet, Vernon.
You, clean it up.
Actually, it's nothing to do with the father.
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.
If something's wrong with the bitch, then something's wrong with the pup.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Right.
Let me tell you...
Vernon!
Vernon!
Vernon, do something!
Stop!
I've got you, Marge.
I've got you.
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.
Oh, Vernon.
Oh, God.
Marge!
Please!
Marge!
Come back!
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.
- You put her right!
- No.
She deserved what she got.
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.
- Yeah?
Try me.
- They won't let you back now.
You've nowhere to go.
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.
"Welcome to the Knight Bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard.
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening. "
What you doing down there?
- I fell over.
- What you fall over for?
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.
Well, come on, then.
In.
No, no, no.
I'll get this.
You get in.
Come on.
Come on.
Move on, move on.
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London.
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London. "
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup make sure you eat it before it eats you.
- But the Muggles.
Can't they see us?
- Muggles?
They don't see nothing, do they?
No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel.
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!
Ten, nine, eight seven, six, five four, three, three and a half two, one and three quarters.
Yes!
Who is that?
That man.
Who is that?
Who is...?
That is Sirius Black, that is.
Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black.
He's a murderer.
Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?
He's the first one that done it.
He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.
I reckon you've heard of him.
Yeah.
Him I've heard of.
Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock.
They're getting closer, Ernie.
Ernie, they're right on top of us!
Mind your head.
Hey, guys?
Guys?
Why the long faces?
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there.
Nearly there.
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.
Mr. Potter, at last.
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!
Room 11.
Hedwig.
Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter.
He arrived here just five minutes before yourself.
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack.
The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately.
She has been properly punctured and her memory modified.
She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.
So that's that and no harm done.
Pea soup?
No, thank you.
- Minister?
- Yes?
- I don't understand.
- Understand?
I broke the law.
Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
Come now.
The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts.
On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things was very, very irresponsible.
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.
Sirius Black, you mean?
But what's he got to do with me?
Nothing, of course.
You're safe.
And that's what matters.
And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.
Hedwig.
Oh, by the way, Harry.
Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't wander.
Right!
You gonna move that bus or what?
Housekeeping.
I'll come back later.
I'm warning you, Hermione.
Keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?
- It's in his nature.
- A cat?
Is that what they told you?
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...
Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.
Harry.
Harry.
- Egypt.
What's it like?
- Brilliant.
Loads of old stuff like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.
- The day maid.
- Night maid.
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.
- Got everything?
- Yes.
- Yes?
All your books?
- It's all upstairs.
- Your clothes?
- Everything.
- Good boy.
- Thank you.
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah.
It should be great.
Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you.
But I think that you need to know the facts.
You are in danger.
Grave danger.
Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?
What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?
Thirteen years ago, when you stopped...
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.
Sorry.
When you stopped You-Know-Who Black lost everything.
But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant.
And in his mind you are the only thing that stands in the way of You-Know-Who returning to power.
And that is why he has escaped from Azkaban.
To find you.
And kill me.
Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear you won't go looking for Black.
Mr. Weasley why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
Quick.
Quick.
Ron, Ron!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Don't lose him!
I didn't mean to blow her up.
I just...
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
I was lucky not to be arrested.
I still think it was brilliant.
Come on.
Everywhere else is full.
Who do you think that is?
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?
How is it she knows everything?
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be.
Why?
I gotta tell you something.
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
- Yeah.
But they'll catch Black, won't they?
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.
Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.
Why are we stopping?
We can't be there yet.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.
Ouch, Ron.
That was my foot.
There's something moving out there.
I think someone's coming aboard.
Bloody hell!
What's happening?
Harry.
Harry, are you all right?
Thank you.
Here, eat this.
It'll help.
It's all right.
It's chocolate.
What was that thing that came?
It was a dementor.
One of the guards of Azkaban.
It's gone now.
It was searching the train for Sirius Black.
If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver.
Eat.
You'll feel better.
What happened to me?
Well, you sort of went rigid.
We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
And did either of you two you know pass out?
- No.
I felt weird, though.
Like I'd never be cheerful again.
But someone was screaming.
A woman.
No one was screaming, Harry.
Welcome!
Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.
Now, I'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast.
First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin who's kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
Good luck, professor.
Of course.
That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.
Potter.
Is it true you fainted?
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.
Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.
Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid.
Finally, on a more disquieting note at the request of the Ministry of Magic Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban until such a time as Sirius Black is captured.
The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
Now whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution.
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.
Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.
It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
But you know, happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light.
Fortuna Major.
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no.
Wait, wait.
Watch this.
- Amazing.
Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.
- Yes, all right.
Go in.
- Thank you.
Still doing that after three years.
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.
Green.
That's a monkey.
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?
Do not give him one again.
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
- Ron, catch.
- I will.
I think we have a winner.
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.
Look at him.
His face.
Welcome, my children.
In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination.
In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight.
Hello.
I am Professor Trelawney.
Together we shall cast ourselves into the future.
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves.
So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you.
What do you see?
The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read.
But first, you must broaden your minds.
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.
- Where did you come from?
- Me?
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...
Is your grandmother quite well?
I think so.
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.
Pity.
Broaden your minds.
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?
- I think you are.
- Sure.
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.
Yeah.
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.
And that there could be the sun and that's happiness.
So you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.
Give me the cup.
Oh, my dear boy.
My dear you have the Grim.
The Grin?
What's the Grin?
Not the Grin, you idiot.
The Grim.
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.
It's among the darkest omens in our world.
It's an omen of death. "
You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Oh, honestly, Ron.
If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline.
Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.
Ancient Runes?
Exactly how many classes are you taking?
A fair few.
Hang on.
That's not possible.
Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.
You have to be in two classes at once.
Don't be silly.
How could anyone be in two classes at once?
"Broaden your minds.
Use your Inner Eye to see the future. "
That's it.
Come on, now.
Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.
I got a real treat for you today.
A great lesson.
So follow me.
Right, you lot.
Less chattering.
Form a group over there.
And open your books to page 49.
Exactly how do we do that?
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay.
Okay.
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah.
Terribly funny.
Witty.
God, this place has gone to the dogs.
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.
Shut up, Malfoy.
Dementor!
Dementor!
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.
Yeah.
Isn't he beautiful?
Say hello to Buckbeak.
Hagrid, exactly what is that?
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.
First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
It may be the last thing you ever do.
Now, who'd like to come and say hello?
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Come on now.
Now you have to let him make the first move.
It's only polite.
So step up.
Give him a nice bow.
Then you wait and see if he bows back.
If he does, you can go and touch him.
If not...
Well, we'll get to that later.
Just make your bow.
Nice and low.
Back off, Harry.
Back off.
Keep still.
Keep still.
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.
Right.
I think you can go and pat him now.
Go on.
Don't be shy.
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow.
Slow.
Not so fast, Harry.
Slow down, Harry.
That's it...
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...
That's it...
Yes!
Well done!
Well done, Harry, well done!
Does he get to fly?
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Put you over here, just behind the wing joint.
Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that.
Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak.
That was wicked, Harry!
Oh, please.
Well done, well done.
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.
You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!
Malfoy, no...
No!
Buckbeak!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa!
Buckbeak!
Away, you silly creature...
- It's killed me!
- Calm down.
It's just a scratch!
Hagrid!
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher.
I'll do it.
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!
You and your bloody chicken!
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.
Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm.
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.
- He's been sighted!
- Who?
Sirius Black!
Dufftown?
That's not far from here.
You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?
That's right.
Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.
Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
Intriguing, isn't it?
Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what is inside?
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.
Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...
Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart.
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.
After me.
Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.
So much for the easy part.
You see, the incantation alone is not enough.
What really finishes a boggart is laughter.
You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.
Let me explain.
Neville, would you join me, please?
Come on, don't be shy.
Come on.
Come on.
Hello.
Neville, what frightens you most of all?
Professor Snape.
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.
Professor Snape.
Yes, frightens all.
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.
No it won't.
I want you to picture her clothes.
Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe here's what I want you to do.
Excuse me.
Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.
Can you do that?
Yes.
Wand at the ready.
One, two, three.
Think, Neville, think.
Riddikulus!
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible!
Okay to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...
Form a line!
I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most and turn it into something funny.
Next!
Ron!
Concentrate.
Face your fear.
Be brave!
Wand at the ready, Ron.
Riddikulus!
Yes!
You see?
Very good, very good!
Marvelous!
Absolutely, very, very enjoyable!
Parvati!
Next!
Show us what you see.
Keep your nerve.
Steady.
Riddikulus!
And next!
Step up, step up!
Wonderful, wonderful!
Here!
Riddikulus!
Right.
Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.
Collect your books from the back.
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you!
Sorry!
Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege.
Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school that privilege shall not be extended again.
No permission form signed, no visiting the village.
That's the rule, Potter.
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.
I thought if you signed it, then I could...
I can't.
Only a parent or a guardian can sign.
Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate.
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.
Forget about it, guys.
See you later.
Professor, can I ask you something?
You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?
I thought it'd be obvious.
I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.
I did think of Voldemort at first.
But then I remembered that night on the train and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.
That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.
This is very wise.
Before I fainted I heard something.
A woman screaming.
Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.
Our pain becomes their power.
I think it was my mother the night she was murdered.
The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.
Not by your scar, by your eyes.
They're your mother, Lily's.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
I knew her.
Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.
Not only was she a singularly gifted witch she was also an uncommonly kind woman.
She had a way of seeing the beauty in others even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves.
And your father, James, on the other hand he...
He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble.
A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.
You're more like them than you know, Harry.
In time, you'll come to see just how much.
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain.
I know.
What's going on?
Probably Neville forgot the password again.
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.
Let me through, please.
Excuse me!
I'm Head Boy!
Get back, all of you.
No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.
The Fat Lady!
She's gone!
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.
It's not funny, Ron.
Keep calm, everyone.
Break into fours.
Back to your common room.
- Be quiet.
- Make way.
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.
You heard.
Move!
Mr. Filch?
Round up the ghosts.
Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
There's no need for ghosts, professor.
The Fat Lady's there.
Mind where you're going!
Slow down!
You listen!
I'm Head Boy!
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!
Dear lady, who did this to you?
Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.
He's here, somewhere in the castle!
Sirius Black!
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery.
There's nothing there.
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.
I didn't really expect him to linger.
Remarkable feat, don't you think?
To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own...
Any theories on how he managed it?
Many.
Each as unlikely as the next.
You may recall prior to the start of term I expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor...
Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?
Perhaps.
But for now, let him sleep.
For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.
Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
Turn to page 394.
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?
That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?
Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time.
Turn to page 394.
"Werewolves"?
Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?
Now, which one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?
No one?
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.
An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
A werewolf has no choice.
With each full moon he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.
The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.
Are you incapable of restraining yourself or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.
As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.
Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter.
Loss of limb will not excuse you.
Page 394.
The term "werewolf" is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer" which means "man, " and "wolf. " Werewolf, man-wolf.
There are several ways to become a werewolf.
They include being given the power of shape-shifting being bitten by a werewolf...
Go, Harry!
Go, Harry!
Aresto momentum!
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.
Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.
Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.
You gave us a right good scare.
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.
Really?
I meant the match.
Who won?
No one blames you, Harry.
Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds.
Dumbledore's furious.
After he saved you, he sent them off.
There's something else you should know too.
When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and...
Well...
I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.
Is there no chance of fixing it?
No.
Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.
Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.
They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.
You are not weak, Harry.
Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.
Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.
You made the one on the train go away.
There was only one that night.
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.
But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.
For now, I need to rest.
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.
We'll get you there.
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- Lf you pipe down.
- Bless him.
- Let me go!
Come on, guys.
Don't...
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.
What are you doing?
!
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...
But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
George, if you will.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder's Map. "
We owe them so much.
Hang on.
This is Hogwarts.
And that...
- No.
Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.
- In his study.
- Pacing.
Does that a lot.
- So this map shows...
- Everyone.
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.
- Every minute.
- Every day.
- Brilliant!
Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.
Hurry.
Filch is heading this way.
And don't forget.
When you're done, just give it a tap and say:
"Mischief managed. " Otherwise, anyone can read it.
Now, how much do you want?
Delicious.
It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain.
Did I mention that?
Twice.
Do you want to move a bit closer?
To the Shrieking Shack?
Actually, I'm fine here.
Well, well.
Look who's here.
You two shopping for your new dream home?
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.
Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!
You filthy little mudblood!
Who is that?
- Don't stand there!
Do something!
- What?
What's up, Malfoy?
Lost your skis?
Get out of the way!
Move!
Malfoy!
Wait!
Wait!
Harry!
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.
Those weasels!
Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
He won't keep it.
He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.
- Aren't you?
- Sure.
Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
Look who it is.
Madam Rosmerta.
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!
Allow me, minister.
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors into my pub every other night!
- We have...
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
And what would bring him here?
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?
Come.
Harry!
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!
- So rude.
- Thick heads.
- Thick heads?
!
- How dare they!
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!
Nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place.
Tell me what this is all about.
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death...
Remember?
They hid.
Few knew where they were.
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.
Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night he also killed Peter Pettigrew!
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.
Never let James and Sirius out of his sight.
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters and might have, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.
He destroyed him!
A finger.
That's all that was left.
A finger.
Nothing else.
Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.
- What could be worse?
- This:
Sirius Black was and remains to this day Harry Potter's godfather!
Ron, look!
- Sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.
Harry, what happened?
He was their friend and he betrayed them.
He was their friend!
I hope he finds me.
Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!
Harry.
There you are.
You came.
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level.
I'm sure.
Well, everything's prepared.
The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm.
Did you ever hear of it?
No?
Well...
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.
But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory.
Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.
Can you do this?
Yes.
Very well.
Close your eyes.
Concentrate.
Explore your past.
Do you have a memory?
Allow it to fill you up.
Lose yourself within it.
Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum.
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.
Shall we?
Wand at the ready.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto...
Expecto...
Expect...
Here we go.
Come on.
Sit up.
Deep breaths.
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to do it the first time.
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this.
You'll feel better.
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.
As a matter of interest, what were you thinking?
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.
Well, it is.
It's the happiest I've ever felt but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?
Then let's give it a try.
You feel ready?
Just do it.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto Patronum!
Yes!
Well done, Harry.
Well done!
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes.
Sit down.
Here.
Eat this, it helps.
It really helps.
And just so you know, Harry I think you'd have given your father a run for his money.
And that is saying something.
I was thinking of him.
And Mum.
Seeing their faces.
They were talking to me.
Just talking.
That's the memory I chose.
I don't even know if it's real.
But it's the best I have.
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.
Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.
- Did.
- Didn't.
How did it go, Hagrid?
The hearing?
Well, first off, the committee members took turns talking about why we were there.
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers.
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.
He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you.
And then?
And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
Spiders!
There's...
There's spiders.
Spiders.
They want me to tap-dance.
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- Tell those spiders.
Right, yeah.
Tell them.
I'll tell them...
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!
Mischief managed.
Nox.
Potter.
What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
I was sleepwalking.
How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter.
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.
My dad didn't strut.
And nor do I.
If you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.
Turn out your pockets.
Turn out your pockets!
What's this?
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really?
Open it.
Reveal your secrets.
Read it.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and... "
Go on.
"And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business. "
- You insolent little...
- Professor!
Well, well.
Lupin.
Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?
Harry, are you all right?
That remains to be seen.
I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.
It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.
Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.
It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise.
Harry, would you come with me, please?
Professor, good night.
Are you deaf?
Put that light out!
Come in.
I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in.
Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black is a map to you?
- No.
- No, sir.
Your father never set much store by the rules either.
But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.
Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!
Now, I will not cover up for you again.
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.
I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.
Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works.
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.
Oh, really?
And who might that be?
Peter Pettigrew.
That's not possible.
It's just what I saw.
Good night, professor.
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.
The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.
Only then can you see.
Try again.
Now, what do we have here?
Do you mind me trying?
The Grim, possibly.
My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.
You may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave.
Have I said something?
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental but now it's in the open for everyone to see.
Hang on.
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.
- Fine.
See you later.
- See you.
Harry Potter...
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.
Sorry?
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder shall break free.
Innocent blood shall be spilt and servant and master shall be reunited once more.
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?
No.
Nothing.
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak.
It's just too horrible.
- It just got worse.
- What did I say?
Father said I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.
This is going to be rich.
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?
You!
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
Malfoy, are you okay?
- Let's go.
Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Look at him.
Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
Why don't we just set him free?
They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.
Says he wants to be with me when they...
When it happens.
Great man, Dumbledore.
A great man.
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!
Think I want you seeing something like that?
No.
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh.
Before you do, Ron...
Scabbers!
You're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.
Right.
Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.
I meant me!
Blimey.
What was that?
Hagrid!
Oh, crikey.
No, minister.
Over this way.
It's late.
It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.
Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble.
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!
Quick.
Quick!
Hagrid.
- It'll be fine.
It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.
- On the slope...
Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.
- Good evening.
- Minister.
Make your way through.
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.
Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we?
Very well.
It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak hereinafter called "the condemned," shall be executed this day at sundown.
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid.
Now, come on.
- All right.
It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go!
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Oh, no.
He bit me.
Scabbers.
Ron.
Ron!
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.
Wait!
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
That's not good.
Ron, run!
Harry, Hermione, run!
It's the Grim!
- Harry!
- Ron!
Ron, wait!
Harry!
- Help!
- Ron!
- Ron.
Ron.
- Ron!
Come on!
Move!
Duck!
Harry!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.
I just hope I'm wrong.
We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
Come on.
Ron.
- Ron.
You're okay.
- The dog.
Where is it?
It's a trap.
He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.
If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!
No.
Only one will die tonight.
Then it'll be you!
Are you going to kill me, Harry?
Expelliarmus!
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?
Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within.
Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you?
- I found him.
- I know.
- It's him.
- I understand.
- Let's kill him!
- No!
I trusted you!
And all this time, you've been his friend.
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.
How long have you known?
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.
You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!
Twelve years of it!
In Azkaban!
Very well.
Kill him.
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.
I know why.
You betrayed my parents.
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.
Somebody did betray your parents somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!
And he's in this room!
Right now!
Come out, come out, Peter!
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!
Vengeance is sweet.
How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
Severus...
I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle.
Here's the proof.
Brilliant, Snape.
You've put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion.
If you'll excuse us, Remus and I have business to attend to.
- Give me a reason.
I beg you!
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it.
It's habit.
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!
You two, quarrelling like an old married couple.
Run along and play with your chemistry set!
I could do it, you know.
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.
A Dementor's Kiss.
One can only imagine what that must be like.
It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.
Severus, please.
After you.
Expelliarmus!
- Harry!
What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.
We thought he was our friend!
- No.
Pettigrew's dead.
You killed him!
- No, he didn't.
I thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map!
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!
- Me?
!
He's mental!
- Not you!
Your rat!
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?
Curiously long life for a common garden rat!
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!
Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?
Scabbers!
Leave him alone!
Get off him!
What are you doing?
Remus?
Sirius.
My old friends!
Harry!
Look at you.
You look so much like your father.
- James.
We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!
How dare you talk about James in front of him!
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!
The Dark Lord.
You have no idea the weapons he possesses!
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!
James wouldn't have wanted me killed!
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!
Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would.
Together!
No!
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.
But we'll take him to the castle.
- Bless you, boy.
Bless you!
- Get off!
I said we'd take you to the castle.
After that, the dementors can have you.
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.
A bit?
A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!
I was going for the rat.
Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog.
More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent.
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.
Okay.
- You better go.
- No.
Don't worry, okay?
It's fine.
I'll stay.
You go, I'll stay.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
Go.
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.
They might chop it.
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
It's too late.
It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.
It'll be nice to do it again as a free man.
That was a noble thing you did back there.
He doesn't deserve it.
I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends to become killers.
Besides, dead, the truth dies with him.
Alive, you're free.
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!
Ron!
Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!
- Sweet, clever girl!
Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!
I don't know if you know, Harry but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather.
I know.
I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle but if you ever wanted a different home...
What?
Come and live with you?
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.
Harry!
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live!
Here!
This flesh is only flesh!
Expelliarmus!
Harry!
Remus!
Remus!
Run!
Run!
- Come on.
- Wait.
Wait.
Hermione!
Bad idea.
Bad idea.
Professor?
Professor Lupin?
Nice doggy.
Nice doggy!
There you are, Potter!
Sirius!
Come back here, Potter!
Sirius!
No.
Sirius!
Expecto Patronum!
Harry?
I saw my dad.
What?
He sent the dementors away.
I saw him across the lake.
Harry, they've captured Sirius.
Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.
- They're gonna kill him?
- No.
It's worse.
Much worse.
They're going to suck out his soul.
Headmaster, stop them.
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true.
Sirius is innocent.
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?
He's my rat, sir.
He's not really a rat.
He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.
But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.
A child's voice, however honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.
Mysterious thing, time.
Powerful and when meddled with, dangerous.
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen.
And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime.
If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss.
If you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared.
Three turns should do it, I think.
Oh, and by the way.
When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin.
Good luck.
What the bloody hell was that all about?
Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk...
What just happened?
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.
Where were we at 7:30?
I don't know.
Going to Hagrid's?
Come on.
And we can't be seen.
Hermione!
Hermione!
Hermione, wait.
Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
That's us.
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
This is not normal.
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first term.
This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.
Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.
Good punch.
Thanks.
Malfoy's coming.
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood!
Mark my words.
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Come on.
We should be at Hagrid's.
Look.
Buckbeak's still alive.
Of course.
Remember what Dumbledore said?
If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.
Let's go.
Here they come.
I'd better hurry.
Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.
Scabbers, you're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.
If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad.
Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time.
We can't be seen.
Fudge is coming.
And we aren't leaving?
Why aren't we leaving?
Are you mad?
That hurt.
Sorry.
We're coming out the back door.
Go!
Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go.
Okay, go, Harry.
Go!
Get away.
Get off.
Minister, I really think I should sign as well.
Yes, very well.
Perhaps it would be...
Okay, Buckbeak.
Come quickly.
Come with us now.
Come on.
Keep trying.
Come on.
Quickly.
Buckbeak.
Okay?
Quickly.
Hurry up.
Okay?
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.
Come and get the nice dead ferret.
- Come on.
It's here.
Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister.
Follow me.
- Now, look there.
- Where?
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?
Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
- Oh, yes.
Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.
- Come on, Buckbeak.
Come on.
- I see no strawberries.
- Over there.
- Where?
- Over there.
- This way.
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.
But where is it?
I saw the beast, just now.
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.
Buckbeak.
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.
I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.
- Right.
- Well, well.
We must search the grounds.
Well, search the skies, if you must, minister.
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy.
Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required.
Thank you.
You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor.
- Come on.
- This way.
This way, now.
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.
- How?
- No idea.
- Look.
It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!
And Snape's coming.
And now we wait.
And now we wait.
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.
- Hermione?
- Yeah?
Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius I did see someone.
That someone made the dementors go away.
With a Patronus.
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
According to him only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
It was my dad.
My dad conjured the Patronus.
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead.
I know.
I'm just telling you what I saw.
Here we come.
You see Sirius talking to me there?
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'.
It'll just be me and him.
We could live in the country someplace you can see the sky.
He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
Harry!
Run!
Let's go.
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.
Thanks.
- Great.
Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that.
Run!
That was so scary.
Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
Sirius.
Come on!
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.
Any minute now.
Right there.
You'll see.
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.
- Sirius.
- You're dying both of you.
Harry!
Expecto Patronum!
You were right, Hermione.
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!
I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.
I knew I could do it this time because well, I had already done it.
- Does that make sense?
- No.
But I don't like flying...!
Bombarda!
I'll be forever grateful for this to both of you.
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.
For some time, my life will be too unpredictable.
And besides you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.
And you know it.
And for now, that will do.
I expect you're tired of hearing this but you look so like your father.
Except your eyes.
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.
It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little.
But know this:
The ones that love us never really leave us.
And you can always find them in here.
You really are the brightest witch of your age.
We have to go.
- Well?
- He's free.
We did it.
Did what?
Good night.
How did you get there?
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.
Honestly, Ron.
How can somebody be in two places at once?
Hello, Harry.
I saw you coming.
I've looked worse, believe me.
- You've been sacked.
- No.
No.
I resigned, actually.
Resigned?
Why?
Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition.
This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want well, someone like me teaching their children.
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already risked enough on my behalf.
Besides, people like me are...
Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now.
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
None of it made any difference.
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.
You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.
It made a great deal of difference.
If I am proud of anything it is of how much you have learned this year.
Now, since I am no longer your teacher I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you.
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
Until then mischief managed.
Stand back, I said!
Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle.
Harry.
Wherever did you get it?
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.
Did not.
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.
For me?
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.
This came with it.
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.
How fast is it, Harry?
Lumos.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
Mischief managed.
Nox.
Maximum Lumus

Room 11
Hedwig!
Smart bird you got there, Mr Potter.
It came here 5 minutes before you.
As the Minister of Magic is my duty to inform you Mr. Potter,
That earlier this evening, your uncles sister was located a little south of Sheffield and deflated
The department entrusted to undo accidental magic has reported that was deflated properly and her memory modified
She has no memory of the incident, what so ever
That's that And no harm done!
Do you want Tea?
Not thank you
-Minister
- Yes?
-I do not understand
- Understand?
I broke the law!
The minor sorcerers of age not they are authorized to use magic in house
Come now, Harry!
The department does not enclose in Azkaban the people for inflating his aunts
On the other hand Running away like that
Given the state of things...
It was very, very irresponsible
The state of things, Sir...?
We have a killer on the loose
Sirius Black, you mean?
And what has he got to do with me?
Nothing, of course
You are safe and this is what matters
Tomorrow you will be on your way back to Hogwarts
Ah, and these are your new school books
I took the freedom of bringing them to you.
Now you must go to your quarter
Hedwig!
By the way Harry, while you are here, it would be best if you did no...
Wander!
" THE MONSTER BOOK OF MONSTERS "
House keeping
Ok, I will come back later
I AM WARNING YOU HERMIONE!
Keep that Bloody Beast away from Scrabers
Or I will turn it into a tea cup
It is a cat what do you expect?
It is in his nature
A cat, is that what they told you?
It looks more like a pig with hair, if you ask me
It smells better than your toth brush
Violent, perhaps but it is normal for them.
Harry!
Harry
Egypt!
What is it like?
Brilliant, Lot of old stuff, like mummies, graves
Even Scrabers enjoyed himself.
You know, the Egyptians used to vership cats
Yeah?
, They would be a few idiots also.
They were not monitoring the meat.
Ron leaves it...
- I have not shown it to anyone
-No, not a soul
He allows the language to rest
It leaves fact, the made thing.
Go and you fix up in the bath...
- Harry!
- Mrs. Wesley!
-Good to see you dear
-Good to see you too
-Do you have everything what you need?
- Yes.
- Yes, All your Books?
- Yes, all of them
- Yes, All your clothes - in his place
Good boy.
- Harry Potter
- Mr., Wesley
- Harry, might we to cross a few words?
- Yeah, sure
- Hermine!
.
Good morning Mr. Wesley.
- Looking forward to a new term?
Yes, it will be great
Harry, there is something that the Minister asked me strongly not to discuss with you since you will return to the school.
But, I think you need to know the facts
You are in danger ... in Great Danger.
Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, Sir?
What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?
Only that he escaped from Azkaban.
Do you know why?
13 Years ago when you stopped
- Voldemort
- Do not say his name
Sorry
When you stopped You Know Who
Black lost everything but this day...
He still remains a faitfull servant
In his mind you are the only thing that stands in the way...
Who You Know come back to the power
And that one is because I escape of Azkaban
To find you
And kill Me.
Harry, do go looking for Black
Mr. Wesley Why would I go looking for somebody who wants to kill me?
Ron, RON!
Do not lose it
I did not mean to blow her up, I lost the control
Brilliant
Honestly Ron, it is not funny, Harry could have had problems.
And I was lucky that they were not arresting me
Come on, every where else is full.
The one who is this one?
Professor R. Lupin
You know everything.
-How is it she knows everything?
- It is written in his suitcase.
-Do you think he is really asleep?
- It seems to be
Ok, I must tell you something
Let me get this straight...
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after You?
Yes.
But they will catch Black, wont they?
I mean, everyone is looking for him
Sure
Except, nobody has ever broken out from Azkaban before
He is a lunatic killer
Thank you Ron!
Why are we stopping?
We cannot be there yet
What is going on?
I do not know, Maybe we have broken down
Auch Ron, that was my fod
There is someone moving out there!
Someone is coming closer!
Boody hell?
!
What is happening?
!
HARRY!
Harry, are you allright?
Thank you
Here, eat this It will help
I hope that you should like the chocolate
That What was this thing?
It was a Dementor, a guard of Azkaban and it has gone away
They were searching the train for Sirius Black
If you excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver.
Eat!
You will feel better.
What happened to me?
Good, we think that it had given you an attack
Before you will faint away or something like that
And did either of you too... .. you know... .. pass out
No, I felt as if it could not be happy nevermore
But someone was screaming
A woman
Nobody was screaming, Harry.
Welcome, welcome to another year at Hogwarts!
Now I would like to say a few words before it stuns them our excellent banquet
First, I want to give him the Welcome to Teacher R. J Lupin
The one who nicely took the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts teachder
Good luck Professor!
What good, was he he who you it gave the chocolate, Harry
Potter, Potter!
Is it true that you fainted away?
Indeed did you faint away?
- Shut up Malfoy
- What we were lacking
Just forget it
Our teacher of Care of Magic Creatures of so many years he has decided to retire to be able to spend more time with the alive members that he still has
Fortunately, I am delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other that our own...
Rubeus Hagrid
Finally a note of warning
Since it was requested for the Minister of Magic
Hogwarts will be protected for Dementores of Azkaban
Up to the moment that Sirius Black is captured
The dementores will stationed at every entrance to the ground
Though they have assured us...
That his presence will not disturb our daily activities
A few words of warning
The Dementores are vicious creatures
They do not distinguish between the ones they hunt and the ones who get in their way
Consequently, I must warn him to each of you
Give them no reason to harm you
It is not in the nature of a Dementor ... to be forgiving
But, You know...
Happiness can be found
Even in the darkest of time
Only they must remember
To turn on the light
Fortuna major
Here, listen
It does not allow me to enter
Fortuna major
No, no, he does not wait, hopes!
He listens to this
Incredible!
The stamp of my voice, it is incredible
Fortuna major
It is allright
Go on
Thank you
It was not so difficult
Oh great, that is a monkey!
What is that?
You will not do it again again
Prove it you
-Do you want to try?
-Oh yeah
Do not try one of them
Look at it
Welcome my children
In this room you shall explore the noble art of the divination
In this room, you shall discover if you posesses the Sight!
I am the professor Trelawney
Together we will be able to look at the future
During this course we will study the basic methods of divination which base on the reading of tea leaves, so they take the cups and sit down abreast
As he was saying to them
The light of the truth is there as if it was written in a book waiting for being read
But first you must broaden your minds...
First you must look beyond
- This is a rubbish
- Where did you come from?
- Me?
I have been here all the time
You Longbotton...
is your grandmother well?
I think so
You need to be sure of it
Give me the cup
Darling...
Open his minds!
Are you ready, dear?
Are you in the beyond I believe that you are...
Sure
The cup, Tell me what you see
Oh if... good
Good, there is a species of crooked cross I am going to spend hardships and sufferings and there is something that might be the Sun it means happiness
So I am going to suffer..
... but I am going to be very happy
Give me the cup
My darling,
You have the Grim
The Grim?
- What is the Grim?
- What is the Grim?
He looks for the Grim in the book
It takes the form of an enormous spectral dog this one between worse of the auguries of our world...
The augury of death
You do not think that Grim thing, has got anytihng to do with Sirius Black, do you?
No, Honestly, Ron
If you ask me about the divination it is a rare discipline
Now...
Ancient Runes, that is a facinating subject
Ancient Runes?
Exactly how many classes are you taking this term?
A fair few.
Hang on, that is not possible
Ancient Runes is the same time as Divination
You have to be at two classes at once!
Do not be silly
How can anybody be at two classes at once
Broaden your minds...
Use your inner eye to see the future...
Come on now
Come closer
Let's begin if it does not matter for them
I got a real treat for you today
A great lesson
Follow me!
You hear, leave the chat
Form a group there
And open your books on the page 49
Exactly how do we do that?
Just stroke the spine first, of course
You are such an idiot Longbotton.
Ok.
I am okay
I think that it is funny
Oh if, terribly funny
Really witty
These books look like dogs
If it was for my father this Dumbledore it was not giving classes
Shut up, Malfoy
Dementor, Dementor!
You are suppose to stroke it
It is not, H E R M Or S O?
Say hallo to Buckbeak
Hagrid!
What it exactly?
That Ron, it is a hippogriff
The first thing that they must know about hippogriffs
The fact is that they are very proud creatures
Very easy to take offence
You do not want to insult a hippogriff
Because probably it is the last thing that they do
Now, who wants to come to greet it
Done well Harry!
Made good!
We go
Now,
You will have to allow him to do the first movement
It is alone a courteousness
You stop him ahead and you do to him a light reverence...
Waiting of that time to see if you reverence to you
If it does it, you can touch it
If not...
Good...
I will say to them later
Is your reverence
Very slow
Behind Harry, Behind
Remain still
Keep still
Done well Harry, Well done!
Here, take this
You can go ad pat him now
Go on
Do not be shy
Easy and slowly
Easy and slowly
Not so fast Harry
Slow down Harry
Very slow
Now let him come to you
That's it
Slowly... slowly
Yes!
Well done!
Well done Harry!
Well done!
I think he will let you ride him now
-What?
-Come on
- Hagrid!
- This part you will enjoy?
Don't pull out any of his feathers since he will not excuse it to you
Well done Harry!
Well done Buckbeak
Oh please!
Well done, well done
How am I doing the first day?
Brilliant, professor
Yeah, you are not dangerous at all, are you?
Your disgusting beast?
Malfoy... no
Buckbeak!
Oh yes, Silly creature!
It has killed me, killed me!
Calm down, it is just a scrap
Hagrid!
He has to be taken to the hospital
I am the teacher I will do it
Oh you are gonna regret this!
Class dismissed
Bloody chicken!
Does it hurt terribly Draco...
It comes and it goes...
I consider myself lucky.
According to Ms. Ponfrey...
I could have lost my arm
Coulden't possibly do...
Listen to the idiot
Really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- Yeah, but at least Hagrid did not get fired?
- yes, but I head that Draco's father is furious
We haven't had the end of this
He has been sighted!
He has been sighted!
-Who?
-Sirius Black!
Dufftown?
It is not far from here
You don't think he will come to Hogwarts?
Do you?
There is Dementores at every entance
The Dementores...
He has already slipped past them once, hasen't he?
Who want to say, he won't do it again?
That's right
Black could be anywhere!
Like trying to catch smoke...
Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands!
Intricking, isn't it?
Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what is inside?
- That's a Bogart, professor?
-Very good mister Tuner
Now can anybody tell me what a boggert...
looks like?
-No one knows
-When did she get here?
Boggerts are shape shifters, they take the shape whatever particular person fears the most
-That's what make them so...
-So terrifying, yes, yes
Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repell them
Let's practise it now
Without wands, please
After me
-Ridikulous
-Ridikulous
Very good, a bit louder
Very clear, listen
-Ridikulous
-Ridikulous
-This class is ridiculous
-Very good
Well, so much for the easy part
You see, the enchantment alone is not enough
What really finishes a boggert...
is laughter
You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing
I can explain, Neville.. would you join me please?
Come on, do not be shy
Come on
Neville, what frightens you most of all?
Professor Snape...
Sorry?
Professor Snape.
Professor Snape...
Frightens all
And I believe that you live with your grandmother
Yes, but I do not want that the Bogart do not turn into her either
No
It won't
I want you to picture her clothes, only her clothes...
Very clearly in your mind
She carries a red handbag...
We do not need to hear, as long as you see it, we will see it
When I open that wardrope
Here is what I want that you do...
Try to imagine professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes
Can you do that?
Yes...
When you are ready!
1, 2, 3
Think Neville, Think
Ridikulous
Wonderful Neville, wonderful Incredible
Okay, now all form a line
Form a line
I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most
And turn it into something... funny
Next...
Ron
Concentrate
Be ready
Wand when you are ready.
Wand when you are ready.
Ridikulous
YES!
You see...
Very good, very good
Wonderful, you have turned it
Snappy
Show us what you see
Prepare... steady
Ridikulous
And next...
Step up, step up
Wonderful, wonderful
Noooo!
Ridikulous
Well, sorry about that
It is enough for today.
Do not forget his books...
It is the end of the lesson.
Thank you
Sorry,..
Sorry, to much of a good thing...
Now remember these visits to Hogsmeade are a privilege
Yes they break the rules of some form this privilege they will not be spread again
No permission forms signed No visiting the village
This is the rule Potter.
All those who permissions follow me, those without, stay put.
But professor I thought that you would sign it to me and might go
I can't..
only a parrent or a guardian can sign
Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate
I am sorry Potter
This is my final word
Forget about it guys, See you later
Professor, can I ask you something?
You want to know why I stopped you facing that Bogart, yes?
I thought that it would be obvious that it would take the form of Lord Voldemort
I did think of Voldemort, at first...
But the I remembered that night on the train...
With the Dementor
I am very impressed...
It suggest that what you fear the most...
Is fear itself
This is very wise
Before I fainted...
I heard something
A woman...
Screaming
The dementors force is to relive our very worst memories
Our pain become their power
I think it was my mother the night that was murdered
It knows, the first time that I saw you Harry...
I recognized you immeately
Not by your scar, by your eyes
They are your mother, Lily's
Yes... oh yes, I knew her
Your mother was there for me at a time, when no one else was
No only was she a singlelary gifted witch...
She was also an uncommenly kind woman ... and a way of seeing the beauty in others
Even and perhaps...
Most especially when that person could not see it himself
And your father James, on the other hand
He ehh...
He had a certain talent for trouble.
Talent...
Talent... the rumor has it, he passed on to you
That you would like to know more
But with the time you will see much more
She is brilliant
But not compared at all with John Sean
I do not believe that it has opportunity of going to the holiday
I have heard that it is the building more big of Great Britain
Yes
What's going on?
Probably Neville has forgotten the password again
-Hey...
-Au...
Let me through, please, Excuse me, I am headboy
They all step back, nobody will enter to this door until it is checked
The fat lady, she is gone
That good, it was one the awful singer
Not funny, Ron
Keep calm all, already it will be solved
Be quite, the Head Master is here
-We go move
-They heard already move
Mister Filch, notices to the bogeys
That search in every painting of castle and find the fat lady
There are no need for ghosts professor
The fat lady is there
Leave me, that I am going to raise
Listen to me, I Am a Prefect
Walk
Dear lady, Who did this to you?
I saw the devil himself
And I cannot say his name
It is...
The one they all talk about
He is here in some where in the castle
Sirius Black
Mister Fudge assures the castle
The rest of you, to the great hall
I searched in the stormy tower and in the south wing
But there was nothing there
-Thank you -3rd floor clear too, Sir
-Very good
I have done celler if there is some sign of Black...
Nor anywhere else in the castle
I hope that they should find it
Remarkeble feet, don't you think?
Enter Hogwarts castle, on ones own, completely undetected
-Quite remarkebly, yes.
-And a theory on how he managed it?
Too many, Each is as unlikely as the next
We might call experts and to interrogate the teachers
Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black to enter it
I am convinced the castle is safe
And I am more than willing to send the students back to their houses
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?
Perhaps, but now let him sleep
In his sleep, we are in one world full of marvels
That might be swimming in the deepest ocean...
Or glide over the highest cloud
Turn to the page 394
Excuse me, Sir
Where is professor Lupin?
That is not really your concern, Is it Potter?
I have to say to them that the teacher Lupin is incapacitated to teach..
At the present time
Go on to the page 394
Werewolves?
But Sir, we have not seen the chapter of Hinky Punks
We have been waiting for it per weeks
-Silence
-When did she come in?
Did you see her?
Now
Which about you can say to me the difference between an Animago and a Werewolf
No one?
How disappointing
Please Sir, an Animago he is a magician who has...
The power to turn into animal
A Werewolf, has no choice
In the full moon when transforms there does not remember the one who is
Not to his best friend if one crosses him
Further more, the warewolf only responds to calls of it own kind
Thank you, mister Malfoy
This is the second time that miss Granger comes late
He is you capably of being kept quiet or is it proud to be the unbearable smart one?
He's got a point, you know... 5 points from Griffendor
As antidote to his ignorance and on my desk Monday morning
I want 12 pages on the werewolves
Principally emphasizing on recognizing it
But Sir, it's Quiddich tomorrow
Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter
Loss of lem will not excuse...
Page 394
Term Werewolf
Is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word...
Were, which mean man and Wolf
- Warewolf
There are several ways to become a warewolf.
Go Harry!
Go Harry!
HARRY!
ARRESTO MOMENTO
He looks a bit peaky
Peaky!
What did you expect?
He fell over 100 feet!
Come on Ron, let's walk you up to the astronomi tower and... .. see what you would look like?
-Probably abetter than he normally does
How are you feeling?
-I feel brilliant
-You gave us right good scare there, mate
What happened?
Oh, you fell of your broom
Really?
I ment the match, who won?
No one blames you, Harry
The Dementores are supposed to come inside the grounds
Dumbledore was furious...
As soon as he saved you, he send them straight off...
There is something else..
you should know too, Harry
When you fell...
Your broom.. it sort of blew into the wamping willow
Well, It's eh...
I am sorry to hear about your broom stick
Is there any chance of fixing it?
No..
Professor, why do the Dementores affect me so..
I mean, more than everyone else..
The Dementores are among the faulest creatures to walk this earth
They feed of every good feeling, every happy memory
Until the person is left with absolutely nothing...
But his worst experiences
You...
are not weak, Harry
The Dementores affect you most of all because
There are true horrors in your past.
Horrors your classmates can scarsly imagine.
You have nothing to be ashamed of
I am scared professor
Well, I would consider you a fool if you weren't
I need to know how to fight them
You could teach me
You made that demotor on the train go away
There was only one that night
But you made it go away
I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry
But as the demontors seems to have developed a particular interrest in you
Perhaps I should teach you
But after the holidays
For now, I need to rest
Last call for Hogsmeade
Come on out
Allright
-Guys, let me go
-Cleaver Harry
But not cleaver enough
Besides, we got a better way
Guys, I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade We know
Don't worry, we'll get you there.
We will show you a quicker way!
If you pipe down
-Let's see
-Let me g... come on guys!
Now Harry, come and join the big boys
What are they doing?
Shhh!
-What is this rubbish?
-What is this rubbish he says!
That there is the secret to our success
It is a wrench giving it to you, believe me!
But we have decided, your needs are greater that ours
George, if you will..
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good
Masters Mooney, Wormtail, Patfoot and Pronce
Are proud to present
The Marauder's maå
We used it so much
Hang on...
This is Hogwarts!
And... no
-Is that really...?
-Dumbledore
-in his study
-Walking
Then they want to say that this map says to me...
To all
-To all
Where they are, what they are doing every minute of every day!
Brilliant, Where did you get?
-Nicked it of Filch's office of course
-First year
Now listening, there are 7 secrets passage ways out of the castle
We recommend...
-This one
-The One-eyed Witch passageway
-It will lead you straight to Honeydudeks celler
-We best hurry, Filch is heading this way
And do not forget you are done
.. Just give it a tap and say:
Misthief Managed
Otherwise anyone can read it
-The hammer
-It is disgusting
It seems delightful
The house of the Screams Looks alike to what I have always written
Did I mention that?
Twice
Do you want to move a bit closer?
-Huh?
-To the screaking shack?
Oh... actually, I am fine here
Well, well, Look who is here?
You two shopping for you grand home
A bit grand for you, is it not, Weaselbie?
Don't you family sleep in..
one room.
-Shut your mouth, Malfoy
-Uhh, not very friendly
Boy, I think it is time teach Wesley how to respect his superiors
As respecting the Superiors
I hope you don't mean yourself?
How dare you talk to me?
Filthy mudbold
Who is there?
-Don't stand there, do something
-What?
!
Help me
What's up Malfoy?
Lost your skies?
Go out of the way
Move
Malfoy, wait!
Wait!
Harry!
Bloody hell, Harry, That was not funny!
These weasels, Never told me about any Marauders map
Harry isn't going to keep it.
He is going to turn over to professor McGonagall
Aren't you...
Am sure...
Along with his invisibility cloak
Oh, Look who is, Madame Rosmerta Ron fancies her
It is not true
- Professor McGonagall
Allow me Minister
-Aah Hagrid
-Sweat like that
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hear business is good.
It would a lot be better, if the Ministery wasen't sending Dementores into my pub every other night
We have...
We have a killer on the loose!
Sirius Black in Hogsmeade,..
And what would bring him here?
Harry Potter
Come
Harry!
-No underaged wizards allow in today
-Shut the damned door
-So rude
-Thickheads
-That said
-Veto the ca...
Nobody comes to an inn and it scares everybody
Now, tell me what this is all about
Now, years ago When Harry Potter parents realized they were
They realized works of search of you They know who,
They went into hiding
And one who did was Sirius Black
-And there said to him who you know
-And Potter said Black to him that thing about, and...
But he also killed one of their friends, Peter Pattigrom
It was not to Peter Pattigrom
It was after the boy Longbotton, always trying to find Sirius Black
I never thought that Sirius was like that
But that was what it spent when Peter found Black
And he had to flee of his old friend
-This Sirius Black
-Black was vicious, I do not kill it
I destroy it!
... a finger...
Everything what stayed was a finger
Nothing more
Sirius Black did not put his hands in Potter, but he is the reason they are dead!
And now he finish what he started
-I don't believe it
-That not the worst of it
What could be worse?
Sirius Black was and remains to this day Harry Potter's godfather
Look
Sorry, excuse me
Harry, what happened?
He was their friend and he betrayed them
HE WAS THEIR FRIEND!
I hope he finds me...
And when he does I'm gonna be ready...
When he does, I'm gonna kill him...
Harry
Are you sure of this Harry?
You know that it is very advanced magic, well beyond the ordinary wizard level?
I am sure
When everything is prepared...
And the spell I am going to try to teach you it is called a Patronum charm
Have you heard it ever?
No
Well, the Patronum is a kind of positive force
And for the wizard that can create one, it works something like a shield
With the Dementor feeding on it instead of the wizard
And in order that it works, you need to think about a memory
It has to be a memory happy and powerful
Can you do it?
There we go
Close your eyes
Concentrate
Explore your past...
Do you have a memory?
Allow it to fill you up
Loose yourself in it
The speak the enchantment..
Expecto Patronum
Expecto Patronum
Very well...
Shall we?
One simultaneously
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto...!
Expecto...
Expect...
HARRY..!
There we go
Come on, sit up
I did not expect you to do it the first time
It would have been remarkebly
Here, eats this
You will feel better
This was a very disgusting Dementor
Oh...
No, no, no
That was a Bogart Harry, a Bogart
The real one is worse, very much, much worse
About what were you thinking?
What memory did you choose?
The first time I rode a broom
That's not good enough Not nearly good enough
There is aother...
It is not... happy ... exactly
But it is the happiest thing that I have never felt ... it is very complicated
Is it strong?
Then let's give it a try
Do you feel ready?
Just do it..
Expecto Patronum!
EXPECTO PATRONUM!
Well done, Harry
Well done!
I think I had enough
For today Yes, sit down here
Eat this, it helps...
It really helps
And just so you know Harry
I think you would have given your father a run for this money...
And that, is saying something
I was thinking about him
And Mom
Seeing their faces
They were talking me...
Just talking
That's the memory I chose ... so I do not even know if it was real...
But it is the best I have
It is a beautiful day
Magnificent!
Unless of course, you have been ripped to pieces
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?
Ron lost his rat
I have not lost anything!
Your cat killed it
Rubbish!
Harry, you have seen the way that bloodthirstig beat of her is allways lurking about
Scabbers is gone
Maybe you should learn to take better care of your pets
You cat killed it!
It did not do it!
-It did it
-It did not do it
How did it go Hagrid?
The hearing?
Well... first of...
The comitty members took turns talking about why we were there
And then I got up, did my piece
I said that Buckbeak was a good hippogriff
Always cleaning his feathers
And then...
Lucius Malfoy spoke they can imagine what he said...
Buckbeak was the most fearsome and dangerous creature which would kill you as soon as it saw you
And then?
And then he asked for the worst thing, you know Lucius
- Did they sack you it?
- Not, they did not sack me
Buckbeack has been sentenced to death!
Peter Pettigrew?
Let's leave the boy
Always after Sirius Black
Vicious this is a killer
It destroyed it!
Read it
Misters lunatics Tail of Worm, Document tube, and Horn they offer his compliment to the Teacher Snape
And...
Go on
He request that he leaves his abnormally large nose out of other people's business
Why, you insolently, little...
Professor!
Good, good...
Lupin
Out to go for a walk in the moon light
Are we?
Harry,
Are you alrightl?
That remains to be seen...
I have confiscated one curious artifact of Mr. Potter
Take a look Lupin
It is supposed that it is your area of experience
It is full of dark magic
I Seriously doubt that it is something serious unless it is designed to insult to anyone who tries to read it
I suspect that it is a prank of bad taste
Nevertheless I must investigate any hidden qualities it may possess
As you said that it is my area of experience
Harry, would you come with me?
Professor, good night
Are you deaf?
Put that light out!
Come in!
I do not have the faintest idea Harry how this map came to be in your possesion
Frankly I am astaund that you did not hand it in
It never occured to you that this map in the hands of Sirirus Black it is a map to come to you
No
Your father never set much store by the rules either
But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours
To play with this sacrifice, marauding the castle unprotected with a killer on the lose seems to be a very poor way to repay them
I will not cover up for you again, Harry
Yes, sir
I want that you return to your bedroom, and stay there
Do not take any detours... if you do
I shall know...
Professor...?
Just so you know, I don't think that map always works...
Earlyer on it showed someone in the castle...
Someone I know to be dead...
Realy, who might that be?
Peter Pettigrew
It is not possible
That what I saw
Good night, Professor
Broaden his minds they must look at the sphere...
It is seen there clearly but if they even cannot see it try again
What do we have here?
Do you mind me trying?
The Grim
Possibly
My dear from the first moment that you put a foot in my classroom I felt that you do not possess the appropriate spirit for the noble art of the divination
During all my years I do not remember to have had such an insufficient pupil
But I assume that you will have better luck looking on the pages of the librosde for your election
Did I say anything bad?
Hermione, she has gone mental
Not that she was not always mental
But know it is certainly for everyone to see
Hang on
We better take this back
I am not going back
Fine
-See you later
-See you
Harry Potter!
Professor Trelawney
HE WILL RETURN TONIGHT!
Sorry?
THIS NIGHT, IT WILL ASSEMBLE WITH HIS KILLER FRIENDS AND THE OBSCURE GENTLEMAN SHALL BREAK FREE
INNOCENT BLOOD WILL SHALL BE SPILLED AND SERVANT AND MASTER SHALL BE RE-UNITED ONCE MORE!
I am so sorry, dear boy
Did you say anything?
No!
Nothing
I cannot believe that they going to kill Buckbeack.
It is just too horrible!
It just got worse
As I say to them, they are going to start the head...
Look who is here
Ahh, come and see the show
You false, wicked and small coward!
Hermione, no!
He is not worth it
Malfoy Are you okayl?
Let us go
Run!
That felt good
Not good...
Brilliant!
Now look at it
It knows the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them
Why dont we just set it free?
They will know that I was me...
And Dumbledore again in trouble
Comming down you know, Dumbledore Says he wants to be with me when they when it happens
Great man Dumbledore!
Great man!
We will stay with you too, Hagrid
You will do no such thing
And why would you say something like that
No, you just drink off
Before you do, Ron
Scabbers!
You are alive!
Keep a close eye on your pets, Ron
I believe that someone here owes me an appology
Next time I see Crookshanks I will let him know
I meant me
What was that?
Hagrid
Cranky
It is Late, and it is nearly dark...
You should not be here
If someone sees you outside of the castle this time of night you are going to be in problems
Big troubles, particularly you Harry
I will be with you in a moment!
Quick, quick
Hagrid, It will be fine, it will be okay
Go on...
Go on
-Good night
-The minister
It is supposed that this creature
The hippogriff called Buckbeack here and after called the condemned...
Shall be executed this day at sundown
What?
I thought that I just saw... .. someone
Let us go
Oh no!
It bit me!
Scabbers!
Ron
RON!
Ron...
Scabbers, come back
Wait!
-Scabbers
-Harry
Do you realize what tree that is?
That is not good
Ron, Ron!
Harry behind you, run!
It is the Grim!
-Harry
-Ron!
Ron!
Help me!
Ron, Ron!
Ron!
Come on
Jump!
Harry!
I am sorry
Do not worry
To where do you suppose this goes?
I have a hunch..
I just hope I am wrong
I believe that we are in the House of the Screams
Are we not?
Come on
Ron?
Are you okay?
- The dog where it is?
- Harry, it is a trap
It is not a dog!
It is an animagus!
If you want to kill Harry, you will have to kill us too
No, only one will die this night
Then it will be you!
Are you going to kill me Harry?
Expelliarmus!
Well, well Sirius.
Looking rather raggit!
Aren't we?
Finally the flesh reflects the madness
But you know all about the madness within.
Woulden't you, Remus?
-I found him
-I know
-I understand...
-Let's kill him
No!
I trusted you!
And all this time you have been his friend
He is a werewolf That's why he has been missing classes
How long have you known?
Since professorr Snape set the essay
Well, well, well!
Hermione You really are the brightest witch...
Of your age I have ever met
Enough talk Remus!
Come on, let us kill him!
-Wait!
- I did my waiting!
TWELVE YEARS OF IT!
IN AZKABAN!
Very well
Kill him..
But wait one more minute
Harry has the right of knowing why
I know why!
You betrayed my parents
You are the reason they are dead!
No, Harry was not like that Someone betrayed your parents
But it was somebody who until quite recently I believed to be dead
Who was it then?
Peter Pettigrew!
And he is in this room...
Right now!
Come on, come on Peter!
Come on, come out and play!
Expelliarmus!
Revenge is sweet
I hoped to be the one to catch you
Severus...
I told Dumbledore you were helping and old friend into the castle and now...
-Here is the proof
-Brilliant Snape
Once again you put your keen and penetrating mind to the task and as usual comes to the wrong conclusion!
Now if you will excuse us, Remus and I have some unfinished business to attend to
Give me an reason...
-...
I beg you...
-Do not be a fool
-He cannot help it be happy now
-Sirius you be quite
Be quite yourself Remus!
Listen to you two...
Quorolling like an old married couple?
Why don't you run allong and play with your chemistry set?
I could do it, you know
But why deny the Dementores they are so longing to see you
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
The dementors kiss...
One can only imagine what that would be like to endure ... It's is said to nearly unbearable to witness but I will do my best
Severus please...
After you!
Expelliarmus!
Harry!
What did you just do?
- You attacked a Teacher!
- Tell me about Peter Pettigrew
He was at school with us we thought he was our friend
No, Pettigrew is dead
You killed him
No he did not, I though so too until you mentioned seing Pettigew on the map
The Map was lying
The map... never lies!
Pettigrew is alive
And he is right there
-Me?
He is mental
- Not you...
Your rat!
- Scabbers has belonged to the family for...
-Twelve years!
Curriously long life for a common rat
He is missing a toe, is he not?
So what?
- All they could find of Pettigrew was...
-His finger!
Much coward has hidden this way in order that they were thinking that he was dead
And then transfromed into a rat
Show me
Me her give Ron!
Give it to me!
What will you do to him?
Scabbers!
Leave him alone!
What are you doing?
Remus...
Sirirus...
my old friends!
Harry, look!
You look alike so much to your father
As James, we were the best of friends
How do you dare to speak to Harry?
How do you dare to speak of James in front of him?
Did you sell James and Lily to Voldemort?
I did not mean to...
You do not have idea of the weapon that it possesses
I said it to Sirirus
What would you have done?
What would you have done?
I would have died...
I would have died rather than betray my friends
Harry, James would not wanted me killed!
Your dad would spare me
He would show compassion!
You should have known it Peter of that if Voldemort was not killing you we would do it.
-Together
-No!
-Harry, this man...
-I know what is
We will take it to the castle
Blessed you, Blessed you.
Get up!
I said that we will take you to the castle
After that the dementores can have you
Sorry about the bite
I recond that twinges a bit
A bit?
A bit?
You almost tore my lef off
I was after the rat
Normally, I have a very sweet attitude as a dog
James suggested that I made the change permanent
The tail I could live with
But the flees... they murder
Okay
Okay
You better go
Not, do not worry There is well that I still have
I go, I will stay
Are you okay?
I am fine, go
That looks very painful
Sort of painful
Probably it is necessary to cut her
They will able to fix it
It is too late
It will have to be cut off
It is beautiful, is it not?
I will never forget the first time I walked through those doors
It would be nice do it again as a free man
That was a noble thing you did back there
He does not deserve it
Well, I just did not think would have wanted his two best friends to become killers
Besides,
The death and the truth went away with him
Now you are free
I would like that we are friends
Do not deliver to me the Dementors I will always be your rat pet
I will always be faithful Listen
We go
I don't know if you know it, Harry
When you were born
James and Lily made me your godfather
I know
I can understand if you choose to stay with your ant and uncle
But if you ever wanted a different home
Come and live with you?
I would understand you if you do not want
Harry!
He was my old friend
Have you taken your portion tonight
You know the man you truely are Remus
This heart is where you truely live
This heart Here
The rest is only a flesh
Expelliamus!
Harry!
Run!
Run!
Wait
Wait, wait
-Come on
Professor?
Professor Lupin
Please, stop it
There you are Potter
Sirius!
Come back here, Potter
Sirius!
No
Sirirus!
Expecto Patronum!
Harry
I saw my dad
What?
He sent the dementores away
I saw it across the lake
Listen Harry, they caught Sirius
We have to do something before the Dementores carry out the kiss
Do you believe that they kill him?
No, it is worse
Much worse
But are going to suck out this soul
You got to stop them
They have the wrong man
It is true Sir.
Sirirus is innocent
Scabbers did it
Scabbers?
It is my rat Sir
It is not really a rat
It was a rat The rat of my brother
We know the truth
Please, believe us
I do Miss Granger...
But I am sorry to say that the word of 3 13-year-old wizards will convience few others
A childs voice however honest and truth
Is meaningless to those, who ought to listen
It is a mysterious thing, time
Powerful...
And at the same time dangerous
Sirius Black is in the highest of the tower
Does Miss Granger know the law?
You must not be seen
And if it does those that I feel, it will return a beam of the Sun to his place...
If not, the consequences so serious to discuss
If you have success this night
More than one innocent life can be saved
Three times will do it
Oh, by the way,
When in doubt I find retrace in my steps to be a wise place to begin
Good luck
What the bloody hell was that all about
Sorry Ron, but the thing is, you cannot walk
What just happened?
Where is Ron?
7:30
Where were we at 7:30?
I do not know.
Going to Hagrid
Come on, and we cannot be seen
Hermione!
Hermione!
Hermione wait!
Hermione please, explain to me what you are doing
That is us
This is not normal
This is a time turner, Harry
We are 3 hours earlier
This is how I have be getting to my lessons all year
You mean... we have gone back in time?
Yes!
Dumbledore obvoiusly wanted us to return to this moment
Clearly something happened, he want us to change
Good punch
Thank you
Malfoy is comming
Run
-Wait for me
It was not so good
What was not good?
It was brilliant!
Come on, let's see Hagrid
Look...
Buckbeak still is alive
Of course!
Remember what Dumbledore said
If we have success, more of one innocent life can be spared
Come on
Here they come
We better hurry
But he has to seen Buckbeak before we steal him
Otherwise he will think Hagrid set him free
Scabbers You are alive!
That is Pettigrew
Harry you cant...
Hermione, that is the man who betrayed my parents
- You do not expect me to just sit here
- Yes, you must
Harry, you are in Hagrid hut now
If just go bursting in, he will think you are gone mad
Awfull things happen with wizards who mingles with time, Harry
We cannot be seen
Fudge is comming
We are not leaving...
Why are we not leaving?
Have you gone mad?
It hurt
Sorry
We are comming out the back door.
Go.
It that really what my halix look like from the back?
Hide
What?
I just saw...
Never mind
Go
Harry go, go
Get off!
Minister, I really think I should sing this will
Yes, very well
We will do it
Okayk, come quickly, come with us now.
Come on
Keep trying, come on
Buckbeak okay, quickly, hurry up..
Ok?
Our name only...
Hurry up Buckbeak, Okay
Come on Buckbeak
Come and get the ferret...
Come on, it is here
Here we are, follow me
-Look there
-Where
Look in the mountains
It will see the teacher was very good
-Oh yes, indeed indeed
-And all the strawberries you see
I do not see the strawberries
Over there!
Where?
Alright
Where is it?
I saw the beast just now
-Not a moment ago
-How extraordinary
We go someone has that to have stolen it
I do not believe that the Minister was suggesting that we have stolen it
After all, how could you?
You have been with us all the time
We must check the ground
Search the sky if you must, minister
Meanwhile, I would like a nice cup of tea or a large Brandy
Excuse me, your services are no longer required
This way
This way
-Now what
-We will look for Sirius
-How?
-I have no idea
Look, it is Lupin
He it slept
And now we wait?
And now we wait.
At leat someone is enjoying himself
Yeah
-Hermione
-Year
Before, down by the lake when I was with Sirius
I saw someone...
That someone made the Dementores go away
With the Patronus, I listened to Dumbledore
According to him, only a really powerful wizard can invoke it
It was my dad!
My dad invoked the Patronus
-But your dad this one...
-Dead, I know
I am just telling you what I saw
Here we come
You know that Serius said to me
-He asked me to come a live with him
-It is great
When we free him, I will never have to go back to the Durleys
It will just be me and him
We can live on the country
Some place you can see the sky
I think he would like that after all those years in Azkaban
Harry!
Oh, God!
Let's go
-What are you doing?
-Saving your life
Thanks!
Well, now it comes for us
I did not think about that...
run!
That was so scary
I hope professor Lupin is having a really tough night
Sirius... come on
This one is Horrible
Do not worry, my dad will come
He will invoke the Patronum
Any moment!
There, you see it
Harry listen to me
-noone is comming!
-Do not worry, he will
He will
Your are dying...
Both of you
Harry!
EXPECTRO PATRONUM!
You were right!
I was not my dad I saw earlier!
I was me!
I saw my self doing the Paronum!
I knew I could do it this time because...
I has already done it!
-Does that make sense
-No
But it...
I will be forever grateful for this
To both of you
-I want to go with you
-One day perhaps
For some time my life will be too unpredictable
Besides, you belong here
But you are innocent
And you know it.
It is sufficient, that will do
I expect you are tired of hearing this...
You look so much like your father
Except your eyes
You have... my mothers eyes
It is cruel that I have spent so much time with Sean and Lili and you so little
But know this
Love never really leaves
And you can always find it
In here
You really are the brightest witch of your age
We have to go
-Well
-He is free, we did it
Did what, good night
How did get there, I was talking to you there?
And now you are there
What is he talking about harry I do not know
Honestly Ron, how can somebody be at two places at once?
Hello Harry
I saw you comming
I have looked worse, believe me
You have been sacked!
?
No, no, I resigned
Resigned, Why?
It seems that someone, let slip the nature of my condition
At this time tomorrow the ouwles will start arriving...
And parents will not want a...
Well, someone like me
-But Dumbledore
-Dumbledore has already done enough
Besides, people like me...
Well, let's just say I am history by now
Why do you look so miserable Harry?
None of it made any difference.
Pettigrew escaped!
Diden't make any difference?
Harry, it made all the difference in the world
You help uncover the truth
You saved an innocent man from a terrible faith
You made a great deal difference
If I am proud of anything...
It is of how much you have learned this year
And since I am no longer your teacher, I do not feel any guilt
For giving this back
So now I say goodbye, I feel sure we will meat again
Untill then...
Misthief managed
Stand back I said
I will take it upstairs if you do not set..
Harry, where ever did you get it
Worry Harry, after you certainly
-What are you talking about
-Quiet
Let the man trough
I did not want to open it Harry, It was badly wrapped
-and they made me do it
-Did nott
-It is a Firebolt!
-The fastest broom in the world
-Who sent it?
-Nobone knows
This came with it
Go on Harry, let's see
How fast is it Harry?
I wanna see this too
Lumos I sollumly swear that I am up to no good
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima!
Harry.
Harry.
Harry, open the door.
Marge.
How lovely to see...
Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.
What is it?
Nothing.
School stuff.
Later perhaps, if you behave.
I will if she does.
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.
Don't say yes in that ungrateful way.
Damn good of my brother to keep you.
He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?
Give us a kiss.
Come on.
Up, up.
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
Okay.
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.
Excellent nosh, Petunia.
A bit more.
Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs.
Just a bit more.
That's a boy.
You wanna try a little drop of brandy?
A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?
What are you smirking at?
Where did you send the boy, Vernon?
St. Brutus'.
It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I've been beaten loads of times.
Excellent.
I won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it.
You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out.
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.
What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?
Nothing.
He didn't work.
He was unemployed.
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.
Don't worry.
Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.
I think it's time you went to bed.
Quiet, Vernon.
You, clean it up.
Actually, it's nothing to do with the father.
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.
If something's wrong with the bitch, then something's wrong with the pup.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Right.
Let me tell you...
Vernon!
Vernon!
Vernon, do something!
Stop!
I've got you, Marge.
I've got you.
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.
Oh, Vernon.
Oh, God.
Marge!
Please!
Marge!
Come back!
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.
- You put her right!
- No.
She deserved what she got.
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.
- Yeah?
Try me.
- They won't let you back now.
You've nowhere to go.
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.
"Welcome to the Knight Bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard.
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening."
What you doing down there?
- I fell over.
- What you fall over for?
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.
Well, come on, then.
In.
No, no, no.
I'll get this.
You get in.
Come on.
Come on.
Move on, move on.
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London.
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup make sure you eat it before it eats you.
- But the Muggles.
Can't they see us?
- Muggles?
They don't see nothing, do they?
No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel.
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!
Ten, nine, eight seven, six, five four, three, three and a half two, one and three quarters.
Yes!
Who is that?
That man.
Who is that?
Who is...?
That is Sirius Black, that is.
Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black.
He's a murderer.
Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?
He's the first one that done it.
He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.
I reckon you've heard of him.
Yeah.
Him I've heard of.
Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock.
They're getting closer, Ernie.
Ernie, they're right on top of us!
Mind your head.
Hey, guys?
Guys?
Why the long faces?
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there.
Nearly there.
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.
Mr. Potter, at last.
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!
Room 11.
Hedwig.
Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter.
He arrived here just five minutes before yourself.
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack.
The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately.
She has been properly punctured and her memory modified.
She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.
So that's that and no harm done.
Pea soup?
No, thank you.
- Minister?
- Yes?
- I don't understand.
- Understand?
I broke the law.
Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
Come now.
The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts.
On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things was very, very irresponsible.
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.
Sirius Black, you mean?
But what's he got to do with me?
Nothing, of course.
You're safe.
And that's what matters.
And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.
Hedwig.
Oh, by the way, Harry.
Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't wander.
Right!
You gonna move that bus or what?
Housekeeping.
I'll come back later.
I'm warning you, Hermione.
Keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?
- It's in his nature.
- A cat?
Is that what they told you?
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...
Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.
Harry.
Harry.
- Egypt.
What's it like?
- Brilliant.
Loads of old stuff like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.
- The day maid.
- Night maid.
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.
- Got everything?
- Yes.
- Yes?
All your books?
- It's all upstairs.
- Your clothes?
- Everything.
- Good boy.
- Thank you.
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah.
It should be great.
Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you.
But I think that you need to know the facts.
You are in danger.
Grave danger.
Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?
What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?
Thirteen years ago, when you stopped...
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.
Sorry.
When you stopped You-Know-Who Black lost everything.
But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant.
And in his mind you are the only thing that stands in the way of You-Know-Who returning to power.
And that is why he has escaped from Azkaban.
To find you.
And kill me.
Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear you won't go looking for Black.
Mr. Weasley why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
Quick.
Quick.
Ron, Ron!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Don't lose him!
I didn't mean to blow her up.
I just...
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
I was lucky not to be arrested.
I still think it was brilliant.
Come on.
Everywhere else is full.
Who do you think that is?
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?
How is it she knows everything?
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be.
Why?
I gotta tell you something.
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
- Yeah.
But they'll catch Black, won't they?
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.
Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.
Why are we stopping?
We can't be there yet.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.
Ouch, Ron.
That was my foot.
There's something moving out there.
I think someone's coming aboard.
Bloody hell!
What's happening?
Harry.
Harry, are you all right?
Thank you.
Here, eat this.
It'll help.
It's all right.
It's chocolate.
What was that thing that came?
It was a dementor.
One of the guards of Azkaban.
It's gone now.
It was searching the train for Sirius Black.
If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver.
Eat.
You'll feel better.
What happened to me?
Well, you sort of went rigid.
We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
And did either of you two you know pass out?
- No.
I felt weird, though.
Like I'd never be cheerful again.
But someone was screaming.
A woman.
No one was screaming, Harry.
Welcome!
Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.
Now, I'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast.
First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin who's kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
Good luck, professor.
Of course.
That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.
Potter.
Is it true you fainted?
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.
Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.
Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid.
Finally, on a more disquieting note at the request of the Ministry of Magic Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban until such a time as Sirius Black is captured.
The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
Now whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution.
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.
Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.
It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
But you know, happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light.
Fortuna Major.
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no.
Wait, wait.
Watch this.
- Amazing.
Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.
- Yes, all right.
Go in.
- Thank you.
Still doing that after three years.
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.
Green.
That's a monkey.
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?
Do not give him one again.
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
- Ron, catch.
- I will.
I think we have a winner.
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.
Look at him.
His face.
Welcome, my children.
In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination.
In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight.
Hello.
I am Professor Trelawney.
Together we shall cast ourselves into the future.
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves.
So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you.
What do you see?
The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read.
But first, you must broaden your minds.
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.
- Where did you come from?
- Me?
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...
Is your grandmother quite well?
I think so.
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.
Pity.
Broaden your minds.
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?
- I think you are.
- Sure.
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.
Yeah.
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.
And that there could be the sun and that's happiness.
So you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.
Give me the cup.
Oh, my dear boy.
My dear you have the Grim.
The Grin?
What's the Grin?
Not the Grin, you idiot.
The Grim.
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.
It's among the darkest omens in our world.
It's an omen of death."
You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Oh, honestly, Ron.
If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline.
Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.
Ancient Runes?
Exactly how many classes are you taking?
A fair few.
Hang on.
That's not possible.
Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.
You have to be in two classes at once.
Don't be silly.
How could anyone be in two classes at once?
"Broaden your minds.
Use your Inner Eye to see the future."
That's it.
Come on, now.
Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.
I got a real treat for you today.
A great lesson.
So follow me.
Right, you lot.
Less chattering.
Form a group over there.
And open your books to page 49.
Exactly how do we do that?
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay.
Okay.
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah.
Terribly funny.
Witty.
God, this place has gone to the dogs.
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.
Shut up, Malfoy.
Dementor!
Dementor!
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.
Yeah.
Isn't he beautiful?
Say hello to Buckbeak.
Hagrid, exactly what is that?
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.
First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
It may be the last thing you ever do.
Now, who'd like to come and say hello?
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Come on now.
Now you have to let him make the first move.
It's only polite.
So step up.
Give him a nice bow.
Then you wait and see if he bows back.
If he does, you can go and touch him.
If not...
Well, we'll get to that later.
Just make your bow.
Nice and low.
Back off, Harry.
Back off.
Keep still.
Keep still.
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.
Right.
I think you can go and pat him now.
Go on.
Don't be shy.
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow.
Slow.
Not so fast, Harry.
Slow down, Harry.
That's it...
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...
That's it...
Yes!
Well done!
Well done, Harry, well done!
Does he get to fly?
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Put you over here, just behind the wing joint.
Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that.
Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak.
That was wicked, Harry!
Oh, please.
Well done, well done.
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.
You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!
Malfoy, no...
No!
Buckbeak!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa!
Buckbeak!
Away, you silly creature...
- It's killed me!
- Calm down.
It's just a scratch!
Hagrid!
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher.
I'll do it.
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!
You and your bloody chicken!
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.
Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm.
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.
- He's been sighted!
- Who?
Sirius Black!
Dufftown?
That's not far from here.
You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?
That's right.
Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.
Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
Intriguing, isn't it?
Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what is inside?
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.
Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...
Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart.
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.
After me.
Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.
So much for the easy part.
You see, the incantation alone is not enough.
What really finishes a boggart is laughter.
You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.
Let me explain.
Neville, would you join me, please?
Come on, don't be shy.
Come on.
Come on.
Hello.
Neville, what frightens you most of all?
Professor Snape.
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.
Professor Snape.
Yes, frightens all.
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.
No it won't.
I want you to picture her clothes.
Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe here's what I want you to do.
Excuse me.
Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.
Can you do that?
Yes.
Wand at the ready.
One, two, three.
Think, Neville, think.
Riddikulus!
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible!
Okay to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...
Form a line!
I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most and turn it into something funny.
Next!
Ron!
Concentrate.
Face your fear.
Be brave!
Wand at the ready, Ron.
Riddikulus!
Yes!
You see?
Very good, very good!
Marvelous!
Absolutely, very, very enjoyable!
Parvati!
Next!
Show us what you see.
Keep your nerve.
Steady.
Riddikulus!
And next!
Step up, step up!
Wonderful, wonderful!
Here!
Riddikulus!
Right.
Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.
Collect your books from the back.
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you!
Sorry!
Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege.
Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school that privilege shall not be extended again.
No permission form signed, no visiting the village.
That's the rule, Potter.
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.
I thought if you signed it, then I could...
I can't.
Only a parent or a guardian can sign.
Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate.
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.
Forget about it, guys.
See you later.
Professor, can I ask you something?
You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?
I thought it'd be obvious.
I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.
I did think of Voldemort at first.
But then I remembered that night on the train and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.
That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.
This is very wise.
Before I fainted I heard something.
A woman screaming.
Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.
Our pain becomes their power.
I think it was my mother the night she was murdered.
The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.
Not by your scar, by your eyes.
They're your mother, Lily's.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
I knew her.
Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.
Not only was she a singularly gifted witch she was also an uncommonly kind woman.
She had a way of seeing the beauty in others even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves.
And your father, James, on the other hand he...
He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble.
A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.
You're more like them than you know, Harry.
In time, you'll come to see just how much.
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain.
I know.
What's going on?
Probably Neville forgot the password again.
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.
Let me through, please.
Excuse me!
I'm Head Boy!
Get back, all of you.
No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.
The Fat Lady!
She's gone!
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.
It's not funny, Ron.
Keep calm, everyone.
Break into fours.
Back to your common room.
- Be quiet.
- Make way.
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.
You heard.
Move!
Mr. Filch?
Round up the ghosts.
Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
There's no need for ghosts, professor.
The Fat Lady's there.
Mind where you're going!
Slow down!
You listen!
I'm Head Boy!
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!
Dear lady, who did this to you?
Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.
He's here, somewhere in the castle!
Sirius Black!
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery.
There's nothing there.
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.
I didn't really expect him to linger.
Remarkable feat, don't you think?
To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own...
Any theories on how he managed it?
Many.
Each as unlikely as the next.
You may recall prior to the start of term I expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor...
Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?
Perhaps.
But for now, let him sleep.
For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.
Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
Turn to page 394.
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?
That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?
Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time.
Turn to page 394.
"Werewolves"?
Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?
Now, which one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?
No one?
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.
An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
A werewolf has no choice.
With each full moon he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.
The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.
Are you incapable of restraining yourself or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.
As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.
Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter.
Loss of limb will not excuse you.
Page 394.
The term "werewolf" is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer" which means "man," and "wolf." Werewolf, man-wolf.
There are several ways to become a werewolf.
They include being given the power of shape-shifting being bitten by a werewolf...
Go, Harry!
Go, Harry!
Aresto momentum!
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.
Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.
Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.
You gave us a right good scare.
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.
Really?
I meant the match.
Who won?
No one blames you, Harry.
Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds.
Dumbledore's furious.
After he saved you, he sent them off.
There's something else you should know too.
When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and...
Well...
I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.
Is there no chance of fixing it?
No.
Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.
Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.
They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.
You are not weak, Harry.
Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.
Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.
You made the one on the train go away.
There was only one that night.
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.
But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.
For now, I need to rest.
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.
We'll get you there.
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- Lf you pipe down.
- Bless him.
- Let me go!
Come on, guys.
Don't...
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.
What are you doing?
!
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...
But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
George, if you will.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder's Map."
We owe them so much.
Hang on.
This is Hogwarts.
And that...
- No.
Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.
- In his study.
- Pacing.
Does that a lot.
- So this map shows...
- Everyone.
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.
- Every minute.
- Every day.
- Brilliant!
Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.
Hurry.
Filch is heading this way.
And don't forget.
When you're done, just give it a tap and say:
"Mischief managed." Otherwise, anyone can read it.
Now, how much do you want?
Delicious.
It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain.
Did I mention that?
Twice.
Do you want to move a bit closer?
To the Shrieking Shack?
Actually, I'm fine here.
Well, well.
Look who's here.
You two shopping for your new dream home?
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.
Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!
You filthy little mudblood!
Who is that?
- Don't stand there!
Do something!
- What?
What's up, Malfoy?
Lost your skis?
Get out of the way!
Move!
Malfoy!
Wait!
Wait!
Harry!
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.
Those weasels!
Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
He won't keep it.
He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.
- Aren't you?
- Sure.
Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
Look who it is.
Madam Rosmerta.
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!
Allow me, minister.
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors into my pub every other night!
- We have...
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
And what would bring him here?
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?
Come.
Harry!
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!
- So rude.
- Thick heads.
- Thick heads?
!
- How dare they!
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!
Nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place.
Tell me what this is all about.
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death...
Remember?
They hid.
Few knew where they were.
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.
Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night he also killed Peter Pettigrew!
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.
Never let James and Sirius out of his sight.
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters and might have, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.
He destroyed him!
A finger.
That's all that was left.
A finger.
Nothing else.
Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.
- What could be worse?
- This:
Sirius Black was and remains to this day Harry Potter's godfather!
Ron, look!
- Sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.
Harry, what happened?
He was their friend and he betrayed them.
He was their friend!
I hope he finds me.
Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!
Harry.
There you are.
You came.
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level.
I'm sure.
Well, everything's prepared.
The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm.
Did you ever hear of it?
No?
Well...
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.
But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory.
Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.
Can you do this?
Yes.
Very well.
Close your eyes.
Concentrate.
Explore your past.
Do you have a memory?
Allow it to fill you up.
Lose yourself within it.
Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum.
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.
Shall we?
Wand at the ready.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto...
Expecto...
Expect...
Here we go.
Come on.
Sit up.
Deep breaths.
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to do it the first time.
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this.
You'll feel better.
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.
As a matter of interest, what were you thinking?
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.
Well, it is.
It's the happiest I've ever felt but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?
Then let's give it a try.
You feel ready?
Just do it.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto Patronum!
Yes!
Well done, Harry.
Well done!
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes.
Sit down.
Here.
Eat this, it helps.
It really helps.
And just so you know, Harry I think you'd have given your father a run for his money.
And that is saying something.
I was thinking of him.
And Mum.
Seeing their faces.
They were talking to me.
Just talking.
That's the memory I chose.
I don't even know if it's real.
But it's the best I have.
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.
Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.
- Did.
- Didn't.
How did it go, Hagrid?
The hearing?
Well, first off, the committee members took turns talking about why we were there.
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers.
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.
He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you.
And then?
And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
Spiders!
There's...
There's spiders.
Spiders.
They want me to tap-dance.
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- Tell those spiders.
Right, yeah.
Tell them.
I'll tell them...
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.
He didn 't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!
Mischief managed.
Nox.
Potter.
What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
I was sleepwalking.
How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter.
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.
My dad didn't strut.
And nor do I.
If you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.
Turn out your pockets.
Turn out your pockets!
What's this?
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really?
Open it.
Reveal your secrets.
Read it.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."
Go on.
"And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business."
- You insolent little...
- Professor!
Well, well.
Lupin.
Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?
Harry, are you all right?
That remains to be seen.
I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.
It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.
Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.
It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise.
Harry, would you come with me, please?
Professor, good night.
Are you deaf?
Put that light out!
Come in.
I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in.
Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black is a map to you?
- No.
- No, sir.
Your father never set much store by the rules either.
But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.
Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!
Now, I will not cover up for you again.
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.
I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.
Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works.
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.
Oh, really?
And who might that be?
Peter Pettigrew.
That's not possible.
It's just what I saw.
Good night, professor.
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.
The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.
Only then can you see.
Try again.
Now, what do we have here?
Do you mind me trying?
The Grim, possibly.
My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.
You may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave.
Have I said something?
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental but now it's in the open for everyone to see.
Hang on.
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.
- Fine.
See you later.
- See you.
Harry Potter...
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.
Sorry?
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder shall break free.
Innocent blood shall be spilt and servant and master shall be reunited once more.
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?
No.
Nothing.
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak.
It's just too horrible.
- It just got worse.
- What did I say?
Father said I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.
This is going to be rich.
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?
You!
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
Malfoy, are you okay?
- Let's go.
Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Look at him.
Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
Why don't we just set him free?
They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.
Says he wants to be with me when they...
When it happens.
Great man, Dumbledore.
A great man.
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!
Think I want you seeing something like that?
No.
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh.
Before you do, Ron...
Scabbers!
You're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.
Right.
Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.
I meant me!
Blimey.
What was that?
Hagrid!
Oh, crikey.
No, minister.
Over this way.
It's late.
It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.
Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble.
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!
Quick.
Quick!
Hagrid.
- It'll be fine.
It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.
- On the slope...
Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.
- Good evening.
- Minister.
Make your way through.
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.
Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we?
Very well.
It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak hereinafter called "the condemned," shall be executed this day at sundown.
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid.
Now, come on.
- All right.
It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go!
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Oh, no.
He bit me.
Scabbers.
Ron.
Ron!
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.
Wait!
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
That's not good.
Ron, run!
Harry, Hermione, run!
It's the Grim!
- Harry!
- Ron!
Ron, wait!
Harry!
- Help!
- Ron!
- Ron.
Ron.
- Ron!
Come on!
Move!
Duck!
Harry!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.
I just hope I'm wrong.
We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
Come on.
Ron.
- Ron.
You're okay.
- The dog.
Where is it?
It's a trap.
He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.
If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!
No.
Only one will die tonight.
Then it'll be you!
Are you going to kill me, Harry?
Expelliarmus!
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?
Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within.
Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you?
- I found him.
- I know.
- It's him.
- I understand.
- Let's kill him!
- No!
I trusted you!
And all this time, you've been his friend.
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.
How long have you known?
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.
You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!
Twelve years of it!
In Azkaban!
Very well.
Kill him.
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.
I know why.
You betrayed my parents.
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.
Somebody did betray your parents somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!
And he's in this room!
Right now!
Come out, come out, Peter!
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!
Vengeance is sweet.
How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
Severus...
I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle.
Here's the proof.
Brilliant, Snape.
You've put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion.
If you'll excuse us, Remus and I have business to attend to.
- Give me a reason.
I beg you!
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it.
It's habit.
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!
You two, quarrelling like an old married couple.
Run along and play with your chemistry set!
I could do it, you know.
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.
A Dementor's Kiss.
One can only imagine what that must be like.
It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.
Severus, please.
After you.
Expelliarmus!
- Harry!
What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.
We thought he was our friend!
- No.
Pettigrew's dead.
You killed him!
- No, he didn't.
I thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map!
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!
- Me?
!
He's mental!
- Not you!
Your rat!
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?
Curiously long life for a common garden rat!
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!
Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?
Scabbers!
Leave him alone!
Get off him!
What are you doing?
Remus?
Sirius.
My old friends!
Harry!
Look at you.
You look so much like your father.
- James.
We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!
How dare you talk about James in front of him!
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!
The Dark Lord.
You have no idea the weapons he possesses!
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!
James wouldn't have wanted me killed!
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!
Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would.
Together!
No!
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.
But we'll take him to the castle.
- Bless you, boy.
Bless you!
- Get off!
I said we'd take you to the castle.
After that, the dementors can have you.
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.
A bit?
A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!
I was going for the rat.
Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog.
More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent.
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.
Okay.
- You better go.
- No.
Don't worry, okay?
It's fine.
I'll stay.
You go, I'll stay.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
Go.
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.
They might chop it.
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
It's too late.
It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.
It'll be nice to do it again as a free man.
That was a noble thing you did back there.
He doesn't deserve it.
I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends to become killers.
Besides, dead, the truth dies with him.
Alive, you're free.
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!
Ron!
Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!
- Sweet, clever girl!
Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!
I don't know if you know, Harry but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather.
I know.
I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle but if you ever wanted a different home...
What?
Come and live with you?
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.
Harry!
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live!
Here!
This flesh is only flesh!
Expelliarmus!
Harry!
Remus!
Remus!
Run!
Run!
- Come on.
- Wait.
Wait.
Hermione!
Bad idea.
Bad idea.
Professor?
Professor Lupin?
Nice doggy.
Nice doggy!
There you are, Potter!
Sirius!
Come back here, Potter!
Sirius!
No.
Sirius!
Expecto Patronum!
Harry?
I saw my dad.
What?
He sent the dementors away.
I saw him across the lake.
Harry, they've captured Sirius.
Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.
- They're gonna kill him?
- No.
It's worse.
Much worse.
They're going to suck out his soul.
Headmaster, stop them.
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true.
Sirius is innocent.
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?
He's my rat, sir.
He's not really a rat.
He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.
But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.
A child's voice, however honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.
Mysterious thing, time.
Powerful and when meddled with, dangerous.
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen.
And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime.
If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss.
If you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared.
Three turns should do it, I think.
Oh, and by the way.
When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin.
Good luck.
What the bloody hell was that all about?
Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk...
What just happened?
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.
Where were we at 7:30?
I don't know.
Going to Hagrid's?
Come on.
And we can't be seen.
Hermione!
Hermione!
Hermione, wait.
Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
That's us.
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
This is not normal.
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first term.
This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.
Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.
Good punch.
Thanks.
Malfoy's coming.
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood!
Mark my words.
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Come on.
We should be at Hagrid's.
Look.
Buckbeak's still alive.
Of course.
Remember what Dumbledore said?
If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.
Let's go.
Here they come.
I'd better hurry.
Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.
Scabbers, you're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.
If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad.
Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time.
We can't be seen.
Fudge is coming.
And we aren't leaving?
Why aren't we leaving?
Are you mad?
That hurt.
Sorry.
We're coming out the back door.
Go!
Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go.
Okay, go, Harry.
Go!
Get away.
Get off.
Minister, I really think I should sign as well.
Yes, very well.
Perhaps it would be...
Okay, Buckbeak.
Come quickly.
Come with us now.
Come on.
Keep trying.
Come on.
Quickly.
Buckbeak.
Okay?
Quickly.
Hurry up.
Okay?
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.
Come and get the nice dead ferret.
- Come on.
It's here.
Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister.
Follow me.
- Now, look there.
- Where?
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?
Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
- Oh, yes.
Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.
- Come on, Buckbeak.
Come on.
- I see no strawberries.
- Over there.
- Where?
- Over there.
- This way.
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.
But where is it?
I saw the beast, just now.
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.
Buckbeak.
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.
I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.
- Right.
- Well, well.
We must search the grounds.
Well, search the skies, if you must, minister.
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy.
Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required.
Thank you.
You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor.
- Come on.
- This way.
This way, now.
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.
- How?
- No idea.
- Look.
It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!
And Snape's coming.
And now we wait.
And now we wait.
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.
- Hermione?
- Yeah?
Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius I did see someone.
That someone made the dementors go away.
With a Patronus.
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
According to him only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
It was my dad.
My dad conjured the Patronus.
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead.
I know.
I'm just telling you what I saw.
Here we come.
You see Sirius talking to me there?
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'.
It'll just be me and him.
We could live in the country someplace you can see the sky.
He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
Harry!
Run!
Let's go.
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.
Thanks.
- Great.
Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that.
Run!
That was so scary.
Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
Sirius.
Come on!
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.
Any minute now.
Right there.
You'll see.
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.
- Sirius.
- You're dying both of you.
Harry!
Expecto Patronum!
You were right, Hermione.
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!
I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.
I knew I could do it this time because well, I had already done it.
- Does that make sense?
- No.
But I don't like flying...!
Bombarda!
I'll be forever grateful for this to both of you.
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.
For some time, my life will be too unpredictable.
And besides you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.
And you know it.
And for now, that will do.
I expect you're tired of hearing this but you look so like your father.
Except your eyes.
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.
It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little.
But know this:
The ones that love us never really leave us.
And you can always find them in here.
You really are the brightest witch of your age.
We have to go.
- Well?
- He's free.
We did it.
Did what?
Good night.
How did you get there?
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.
Honestly, Ron.
How can somebody be in two places at once?
Hello, Harry.
I saw you coming.
I've looked worse, believe me.
- You've been sacked.
- No.
No.
I resigned, actually.
Resigned?
Why?
Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition.
This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want well, someone like me teaching their children.
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already risked enough on my behalf.
Besides, people like me are...
Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now.
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
None of it made any difference.
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.
You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.
It made a great deal of difference.
If I am proud of anything it is of how much you have learned this year.
Now, since I am no longer your teacher I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you.
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
Until then mischief managed.
Stand back, I said!
Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle.
Harry.
Wherever did you get it?
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.
Did not.
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.
For me?
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.
This came with it.
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.
How fast is it, Harry?
Lumos.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
Mischief managed.
Nox.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
Harry.
Harry.
Harry, open the door.
Marge.
How lovely to see...
Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.
What is it?
Nothing.
School stuff.
Later perhaps, if you behave.
I will if she does.
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.
Don't say yes in that ungrateful way.
Damn good of my brother to keep you.
He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?
Give us a kiss.
Come on.
Up, up.
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
Okay.
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.
Excellent nosh, Petunia.
A bit more.
Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs.
Just a bit more.
That's a boy.
You wanna try a little drop of brandy?
A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?
What are you smirking at?
Where did you send the boy, Vernon?
St. Brutus'.
It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I've been beaten loads of times.
Excellent.
I won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it.
You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out.
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.
What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?
Nothing.
He didn't work.
He was unemployed.
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.
Don't worry.
Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.
I think it's time you went to bed.
Quiet, Vernon.
You, clean it up.
Actually, it's nothing to do with the father.
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.
If something's wrong with the bitch, then something's wrong with the pup.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Right.
Let me tell you...
Vernon!
Vernon!
Vernon, do something!
Stop!
I've got you, Marge.
I've got you.
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.
Oh, Vernon.
Oh, God.
Marge!
Please!
Marge!
Come back!
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.
- You put her right!
- No.
She deserved what she got.
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.
- Yeah?
Try me.
- They won't let you back now.
You've nowhere to go.
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.
"Welcome to the Knight Bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard.
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening. "
What you doing down there?
- I fell over.
- What you fall over for?
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.
Well, come on, then.
In.
No, no, no.
I'll get this.
You get in.
Come on.
Come on.
Move on, move on.
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London.
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London. "
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup make sure you eat it before it eats you.
- But the Muggles.
Can't they see us?
- Muggles?
They don't see nothing, do they?
No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel.
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!
Ten, nine, eight seven, six, five four, three, three and a half two, one and three quarters.
Yes!
Who is that?
That man.
Who is that?
Who is...?
That is Sirius Black, that is.
Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black.
He's a murderer.
Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?
He's the first one that done it.
He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.
I reckon you've heard of him.
Yeah.
Him I've heard of.
Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock.
They're getting closer, Ernie.
Ernie, they're right on top of us!
Mind your head.
Hey, guys?
Guys?
Why the long faces?
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there.
Nearly there.
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.
Mr. Potter, at last.
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!
Room 11.
Hedwig.
Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter.
He arrived here just five minutes before yourself.
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack.
The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately.
She has been properly punctured and her memory modified.
She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.
So that's that and no harm done.
Pea soup?
No, thank you.
- Minister?
- Yes?
- I don't understand.
- Understand?
I broke the law.
Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
Come now.
The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts.
On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things was very, very irresponsible.
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.
Sirius Black, you mean?
But what's he got to do with me?
Nothing, of course.
You're safe.
And that's what matters.
And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.
Hedwig.
Oh, by the way, Harry.
Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't wander.
Right!
You gonna move that bus or what?
Housekeeping.
I'll come back later.
I'm warning you, Hermione.
Keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?
- It's in his nature.
- A cat?
Is that what they told you?
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...
Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.
Harry.
Harry.
- Egypt.
What's it like?
- Brilliant.
Loads of old stuff like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.
- The day maid.
- Night maid.
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.
- Got everything?
- Yes.
- Yes?
All your books?
- It's all upstairs.
- Your clothes?
- Everything.
- Good boy.
- Thank you.
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah.
It should be great.
Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you.
But I think that you need to know the facts.
You are in danger.
Grave danger.
Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?
What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?
Thirteen years ago, when you stopped...
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.
Sorry.
When you stopped You-Know-Who Black lost everything.
But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant.
And in his mind you are the only thing that stands in the way of You-Know-Who returning to power.
And that is why he has escaped from Azkaban.
To find you.
And kill me.
Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear you won't go looking for Black.
Mr. Weasley why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
Quick.
Quick.
Ron, Ron!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Don't lose him!
I didn't mean to blow her up.
I just...
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
I was lucky not to be arrested.
I still think it was brilliant.
Come on.
Everywhere else is full.
Who do you think that is?
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?
How is it she knows everything?
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be.
Why?
I gotta tell you something.
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
- Yeah.
But they'll catch Black, won't they?
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.
Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.
Why are we stopping?
We can't be there yet.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.
Ouch, Ron.
That was my foot.
There's something moving out there.
I think someone's coming aboard.
Bloody hell!
What's happening?
Harry.
Harry, are you all right?
Thank you.
Here, eat this.
It'll help.
It's all right.
It's chocolate.
What was that thing that came?
It was a dementor.
One of the guards of Azkaban.
It's gone now.
It was searching the train for Sirius Black.
If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver.
Eat.
You'll feel better.
What happened to me?
Well, you sort of went rigid.
We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
And did either of you two you know pass out?
- No.
I felt weird, though.
Like I'd never be cheerful again.
But someone was screaming.
A woman.
No one was screaming, Harry.
Welcome!
Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.
Now, I'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast.
First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin who's kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
Good luck, professor.
Of course.
That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.
Potter.
Is it true you fainted?
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.
Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.
Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid.
Finally, on a more disquieting note at the request of the Ministry of Magic Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban until such a time as Sirius Black is captured.
The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
Now whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution.
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.
Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.
It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
But you know, happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light.
Fortuna Major.
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no.
Wait, wait.
Watch this.
- Amazing.
Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.
- Yes, all right.
Go in.
- Thank you.
Still doing that after three years.
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.
Green.
That's a monkey.
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?
Do not give him one again.
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
- Ron, catch.
- I will.
I think we have a winner.
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.
Look at him.
His face.
Welcome, my children.
In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination.
In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight.
Hello.
I am Professor Trelawney.
Together we shall cast ourselves into the future.
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves.
So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you.
What do you see?
The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read.
But first, you must broaden your minds.
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.
- Where did you come from?
- Me?
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...
Is your grandmother quite well?
I think so.
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.
Pity.
Broaden your minds.
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?
- I think you are.
- Sure.
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.
Yeah.
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.
And that there could be the sun and that's happiness.
So you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.
Give me the cup.
Oh, my dear boy.
My dear you have the Grim.
The Grin?
What's the Grin?
Not the Grin, you idiot.
The Grim.
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.
It's among the darkest omens in our world.
It's an omen of death. "
You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Oh, honestly, Ron.
If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline.
Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.
Ancient Runes?
Exactly how many classes are you taking?
A fair few.
Hang on.
That's not possible.
Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.
You have to be in two classes at once.
Don't be silly.
How could anyone be in two classes at once?
"Broaden your minds.
Use your Inner Eye to see the future. "
That's it.
Come on, now.
Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.
I got a real treat for you today.
A great lesson.
So follow me.
Right, you lot.
Less chattering.
Form a group over there.
And open your books to page 49.
Exactly how do we do that?
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay.
Okay.
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah.
Terribly funny.
Witty.
God, this place has gone to the dogs.
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.
Shut up, Malfoy.
Dementor!
Dementor!
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.
Yeah.
Isn't he beautiful?
Say hello to Buckbeak.
Hagrid, exactly what is that?
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.
First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
It may be the last thing you ever do.
Now, who'd like to come and say hello?
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Come on now.
Now you have to let him make the first move.
It's only polite.
So step up.
Give him a nice bow.
Then you wait and see if he bows back.
If he does, you can go and touch him.
If not...
Well, we'll get to that later.
Just make your bow.
Nice and low.
Back off, Harry.
Back off.
Keep still.
Keep still.
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.
Right.
I think you can go and pat him now.
Go on.
Don't be shy.
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow.
Slow.
Not so fast, Harry.
Slow down, Harry.
That's it...
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...
That's it...
Yes!
Well done!
Well done, Harry, well done!
Does he get to fly?
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Put you over here, just behind the wing joint.
Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that.
Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak.
That was wicked, Harry!
Oh, please.
Well done, well done.
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.
You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!
Malfoy, no...
No!
Buckbeak!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa!
Buckbeak!
Away, you silly creature...
- It's killed me!
- Calm down.
It's just a scratch!
Hagrid!
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher.
I'll do it.
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!
You and your bloody chicken!
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.
Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm.
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.
- He's been sighted!
- Who?
Sirius Black!
Dufftown?
That's not far from here.
You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?
That's right.
Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.
Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
Intriguing, isn't it?
Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what is inside?
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.
Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...
Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart.
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.
After me.
Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.
So much for the easy part.
You see, the incantation alone is not enough.
What really finishes a boggart is laughter.
You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.
Let me explain.
Neville, would you join me, please?
Come on, don't be shy.
Come on.
Come on.
Hello.
Neville, what frightens you most of all?
Professor Snape.
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.
Professor Snape.
Yes, frightens all.
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.
No it won't.
I want you to picture her clothes.
Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe here's what I want you to do.
Excuse me.
Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.
Can you do that?
Yes.
Wand at the ready.
One, two, three.
Think, Neville, think.
Riddikulus!
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible!
Okay to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...
Form a line!
I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most and turn it into something funny.
Next!
Ron!
Concentrate.
Face your fear.
Be brave!
Wand at the ready, Ron.
Riddikulus!
Yes!
You see?
Very good, very good!
Marvelous!
Absolutely, very, very enjoyable!
Parvati!
Next!
Show us what you see.
Keep your nerve.
Steady.
Riddikulus!
And next!
Step up, step up!
Wonderful, wonderful!
Here!
Riddikulus!
Right.
Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.
Collect your books from the back.
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you!
Sorry!
Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege.
Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school that privilege shall not be extended again.
No permission form signed, no visiting the village.
That's the rule, Potter.
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.
I thought if you signed it, then I could...
I can't.
Only a parent or a guardian can sign.
Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate.
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.
Forget about it, guys.
See you later.
Professor, can I ask you something?
You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?
I thought it'd be obvious.
I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.
I did think of Voldemort at first.
But then I remembered that night on the train and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.
That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.
This is very wise.
Before I fainted I heard something.
A woman screaming.
Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.
Our pain becomes their power.
I think it was my mother the night she was murdered.
The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.
Not by your scar, by your eyes.
They're your mother, Lily's.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
I knew her.
Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.
Not only was she a singularly gifted witch she was also an uncommonly kind woman.
She had a way of seeing the beauty in others even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves.
And your father, James, on the other hand he...
He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble.
A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.
You're more like them than you know, Harry.
In time, you'll come to see just how much.
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain.
I know.
What's going on?
Probably Neville forgot the password again.
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.
Let me through, please.
Excuse me!
I'm Head Boy!
Get back, all of you.
No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.
The Fat Lady!
She's gone!
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.
It's not funny, Ron.
Keep calm, everyone.
Break into fours.
Back to your common room.
- Be quiet.
- Make way.
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.
You heard.
Move!
Mr. Filch?
Round up the ghosts.
Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
There's no need for ghosts, professor.
The Fat Lady's there.
Mind where you're going!
Slow down!
You listen!
I'm Head Boy!
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!
Dear lady, who did this to you?
Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.
He's here, somewhere in the castle!
Sirius Black!
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery.
There's nothing there.
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.
I didn't really expect him to linger.
Remarkable feat, don't you think?
To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own...
Any theories on how he managed it?
Many.
Each as unlikely as the next.
You may recall prior to the start of term I expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor...
Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?
Perhaps.
But for now, let him sleep.
For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.
Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
Turn to page 394.
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?
That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?
Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time.
Turn to page 394.
"Werewolves"?
Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?
Now, which one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?
No one?
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.
An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
A werewolf has no choice.
With each full moon he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.
The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.
Are you incapable of restraining yourself or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.
As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.
Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter.
Loss of limb will not excuse you.
Page 394.
The term "werewolf" is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer" which means "man, " and "wolf. " Werewolf, man-wolf.
There are several ways to become a werewolf.
They include being given the power of shape-shifting being bitten by a werewolf...
Go, Harry!
Go, Harry!
Aresto momentum!
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.
Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.
Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.
You gave us a right good scare.
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.
Really?
I meant the match.
Who won?
No one blames you, Harry.
Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds.
Dumbledore's furious.
After he saved you, he sent them off.
There's something else you should know too.
When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and...
Well...
I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.
Is there no chance of fixing it?
No.
Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.
Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.
They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.
You are not weak, Harry.
Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.
Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.
You made the one on the train go away.
There was only one that night.
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.
But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.
For now, I need to rest.
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.
We'll get you there.
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- Lf you pipe down.
- Bless him.
- Let me go!
Come on, guys.
Don't...
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.
What are you doing?
!
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...
But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
George, if you will.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder's Map. "
We owe them so much.
Hang on.
This is Hogwarts.
And that...
- No.
Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.
- In his study.
- Pacing.
Does that a lot.
- So this map shows...
- Everyone.
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.
- Every minute.
- Every day.
- Brilliant!
Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.
Hurry.
Filch is heading this way.
And don't forget.
When you're done, just give it a tap and say:
"Mischief managed. " Otherwise, anyone can read it.
Now, how much do you want?
Delicious.
It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain.
Did I mention that?
Twice.
Do you want to move a bit closer?
To the Shrieking Shack?
Actually, I'm fine here.
Well, well.
Look who's here.
You two shopping for your new dream home?
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.
Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!
You filthy little mudblood!
Who is that?
- Don't stand there!
Do something!
- What?
What's up, Malfoy?
Lost your skis?
Get out of the way!
Move!
Malfoy!
Wait!
Wait!
Harry!
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.
Those weasels!
Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
He won't keep it.
He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.
- Aren't you?
- Sure.
Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
Look who it is.
Madam Rosmerta.
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!
Allow me, minister.
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors into my pub every other night!
- We have...
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
And what would bring him here?
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?
Come.
Harry!
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!
- So rude.
- Thick heads.
- Thick heads?
!
- How dare they!
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!
Nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place.
Tell me what this is all about.
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death...
Remember?
They hid.
Few knew where they were.
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.
Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night he also killed Peter Pettigrew!
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.
Never let James and Sirius out of his sight.
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters and might have, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.
He destroyed him!
A finger.
That's all that was left.
A finger.
Nothing else.
Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.
- What could be worse?
- This:
Sirius Black was and remains to this day Harry Potter's godfather!
Ron, look!
- Sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.
Harry, what happened?
He was their friend and he betrayed them.
He was their friend!
I hope he finds me.
Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!
Harry.
There you are.
You came.
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level.
I'm sure.
Well, everything's prepared.
The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm.
Did you ever hear of it?
No?
Well...
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.
But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory.
Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.
Can you do this?
Yes.
Very well.
Close your eyes.
Concentrate.
Explore your past.
Do you have a memory?
Allow it to fill you up.
Lose yourself within it.
Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum.
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.
Shall we?
Wand at the ready.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto...
Expecto...
Expect...
Here we go.
Come on.
Sit up.
Deep breaths.
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to do it the first time.
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this.
You'll feel better.
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.
As a matter of interest, what were you thinking?
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.
Well, it is.
It's the happiest I've ever felt but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?
Then let's give it a try.
You feel ready?
Just do it.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto Patronum!
Yes!
Well done, Harry.
Well done!
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes.
Sit down.
Here.
Eat this, it helps.
It really helps.
And just so you know, Harry I think you'd have given your father a run for his money.
And that is saying something.
I was thinking of him.
And Mum.
Seeing their faces.
They were talking to me.
Just talking.
That's the memory I chose.
I don't even know if it's real.
But it's the best I have.
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.
Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.
- Did.
- Didn't.
How did it go, Hagrid?
The hearing?
Well, first off, the committee members took turns talking about why we were there.
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers.
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.
He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you.
And then?
And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
Spiders!
There's...
There's spiders.
Spiders.
They want me to tap-dance.
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- Tell those spiders.
Right, yeah.
Tell them.
I'll tell them...
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!
Mischief managed.
Nox.
Potter.
What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
I was sleepwalking.
How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter.
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.
My dad didn't strut.
And nor do I.
If you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.
Turn out your pockets.
Turn out your pockets!
What's this?
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really?
Open it.
Reveal your secrets.
Read it.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and... "
Go on.
"And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business. "
- You insolent little...
- Professor!
Well, well.
Lupin.
Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?
Harry, are you all right?
That remains to be seen.
I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.
It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.
Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.
It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise.
Harry, would you come with me, please?
Professor, good night.
Are you deaf?
Put that light out!
Come in.
I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in.
Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black is a map to you?
- No.
- No, sir.
Your father never set much store by the rules either.
But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.
Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!
Now, I will not cover up for you again.
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.
I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.
Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works.
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.
Oh, really?
And who might that be?
Peter Pettigrew.
That's not possible.
It's just what I saw.
Good night, professor.
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.
The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.
Only then can you see.
Try again.
Now, what do we have here?
Do you mind me trying?
The Grim, possibly.
My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.
You may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave.
Have I said something?
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental but now it's in the open for everyone to see.
Hang on.
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.
- Fine.
See you later.
- See you.
Harry Potter...
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.
Sorry?
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder shall break free.
Innocent blood shall be spilt and servant and master shall be reunited once more.
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?
No.
Nothing.
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak.
It's just too horrible.
- It just got worse.
- What did I say?
Father said I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.
This is going to be rich.
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?
You!
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
Malfoy, are you okay?
- Let's go.
Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Look at him.
Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
Why don't we just set him free?
They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.
Says he wants to be with me when they...
When it happens.
Great man, Dumbledore.
A great man.
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!
Think I want you seeing something like that?
No.
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh.
Before you do, Ron...
Scabbers!
You're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.
Right.
Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.
I meant me!
Blimey.
What was that?
Hagrid!
Oh, crikey.
No, minister.
Over this way.
It's late.
It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.
Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble.
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!
Quick.
Quick!
Hagrid.
- It'll be fine.
It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.
- On the slope...
Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.
- Good evening.
- Minister.
Make your way through.
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.
Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we?
Very well.
It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak hereinafter called "the condemned," shall be executed this day at sundown.
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid.
Now, come on.
- All right.
It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go!
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Oh, no.
He bit me.
Scabbers.
Ron.
Ron!
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.
Wait!
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
That's not good.
Ron, run!
Harry, Hermione, run!
It's the Grim!
- Harry!
- Ron!
Ron, wait!
Harry!
- Help!
- Ron!
- Ron.
Ron.
- Ron!
Come on!
Move!
Duck!
Harry!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.
I just hope I'm wrong.
We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
Come on.
Ron.
- Ron.
You're okay.
- The dog.
Where is it?
It's a trap.
He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.
If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!
No.
Only one will die tonight.
Then it'll be you!
Are you going to kill me, Harry?
Expelliarmus!
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?
Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within.
Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you?
- I found him.
- I know.
- It's him.
- I understand.
- Let's kill him!
- No!
I trusted you!
And all this time, you've been his friend.
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.
How long have you known?
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.
You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!
Twelve years of it!
In Azkaban!
Very well.
Kill him.
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.
I know why.
You betrayed my parents.
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.
Somebody did betray your parents somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!
And he's in this room!
Right now!
Come out, come out, Peter!
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!
Vengeance is sweet.
How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
Severus...
I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle.
Here's the proof.
Brilliant, Snape.
You've put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion.
If you'll excuse us, Remus and I have business to attend to.
- Give me a reason.
I beg you!
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it.
It's habit.
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!
You two, quarrelling like an old married couple.
Run along and play with your chemistry set!
I could do it, you know.
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.
A Dementor's Kiss.
One can only imagine what that must be like.
It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.
Severus, please.
After you.
Expelliarmus!
- Harry!
What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.
We thought he was our friend!
- No.
Pettigrew's dead.
You killed him!
- No, he didn't.
I thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map!
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!
- Me?
!
He's mental!
- Not you!
Your rat!
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?
Curiously long life for a common garden rat!
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!
Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?
Scabbers!
Leave him alone!
Get off him!
What are you doing?
Remus?
Sirius.
My old friends!
Harry!
Look at you.
You look so much like your father.
- James.
We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!
How dare you talk about James in front of him!
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!
The Dark Lord.
You have no idea the weapons he possesses!
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!
James wouldn't have wanted me killed!
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!
Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would.
Together!
No!
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.
But we'll take him to the castle.
- Bless you, boy.
Bless you!
- Get off!
I said we'd take you to the castle.
After that, the dementors can have you.
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.
A bit?
A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!
I was going for the rat.
Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog.
More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent.
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.
Okay.
- You better go.
- No.
Don't worry, okay?
It's fine.
I'll stay.
You go, I'll stay.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
Go.
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.
They might chop it.
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
It's too late.
It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.
It'll be nice to do it again as a free man.
That was a noble thing you did back there.
He doesn't deserve it.
I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends to become killers.
Besides, dead, the truth dies with him.
Alive, you're free.
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!
Ron!
Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!
- Sweet, clever girl!
Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!
I don't know if you know, Harry but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather.
I know.
I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle but if you ever wanted a different home...
What?
Come and live with you?
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.
Harry!
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live!
Here!
This flesh is only flesh!
Expelliarmus!
Harry!
Remus!
Remus!
Run!
Run!
- Come on.
- Wait.
Wait.
Hermione!
Bad idea.
Bad idea.
Professor?
Professor Lupin?
Nice doggy.
Nice doggy!
There you are, Potter!
Sirius!
Come back here, Potter!
Sirius!
No.
Sirius!
Expecto Patronum!
Harry?
I saw my dad.
What?
He sent the dementors away.
I saw him across the lake.
Harry, they've captured Sirius.
Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.
- They're gonna kill him?
- No.
It's worse.
Much worse.
They're going to suck out his soul.
Headmaster, stop them.
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true.
Sirius is innocent.
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?
He's my rat, sir.
He's not really a rat.
He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.
But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.
A child's voice, however honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.
Mysterious thing, time.
Powerful and when meddled with, dangerous.
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen.
And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime.
If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss.
If you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared.
Three turns should do it, I think.
Oh, and by the way.
When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin.
Good luck.
What the bloody hell was that all about?
Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk...
What just happened?
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.
Where were we at 7:30?
I don't know.
Going to Hagrid's?
Come on.
And we can't be seen.
Hermione!
Hermione!
Hermione, wait.
Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
That's us.
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
This is not normal.
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first term.
This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.
Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.
Good punch.
Thanks.
Malfoy's coming.
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood!
Mark my words.
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Come on.
We should be at Hagrid's.
Look.
Buckbeak's still alive.
Of course.
Remember what Dumbledore said?
If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.
Let's go.
Here they come.
I'd better hurry.
Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.
Scabbers, you're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.
If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad.
Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time.
We can't be seen.
Fudge is coming.
And we aren't leaving?
Why aren't we leaving?
Are you mad?
That hurt.
Sorry.
We're coming out the back door.
Go!
Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go.
Okay, go, Harry.
Go!
Get away.
Get off.
Minister, I really think I should sign as well.
Yes, very well.
Perhaps it would be...
Okay, Buckbeak.
Come quickly.
Come with us now.
Come on.
Keep trying.
Come on.
Quickly.
Buckbeak.
Okay?
Quickly.
Hurry up.
Okay?
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.
Come and get the nice dead ferret.
- Come on.
It's here.
Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister.
Follow me.
- Now, look there.
- Where?
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?
Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
- Oh, yes.
Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.
- Come on, Buckbeak.
Come on.
- I see no strawberries.
- Over there.
- Where?
- Over there.
- This way.
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.
But where is it?
I saw the beast, just now.
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.
Buckbeak.
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.
I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.
- Right.
- Well, well.
We must search the grounds.
Well, search the skies, if you must, minister.
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy.
Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required.
Thank you.
You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor.
- Come on.
- This way.
This way, now.
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.
- How?
- No idea.
- Look.
It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!
And Snape's coming.
And now we wait.
And now we wait.
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.
- Hermione?
- Yeah?
Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius I did see someone.
That someone made the dementors go away.
With a Patronus.
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
According to him only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
It was my dad.
My dad conjured the Patronus.
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead.
I know.
I'm just telling you what I saw.
Here we come.
You see Sirius talking to me there?
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'.
It'll just be me and him.
We could live in the country someplace you can see the sky.
He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
Harry!
Run!
Let's go.
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.
Thanks.
- Great.
Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that.
Run!
That was so scary.
Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
Sirius.
Come on!
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.
Any minute now.
Right there.
You'll see.
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.
- Sirius.
- You're dying both of you.
Harry!
Expecto Patronum!
You were right, Hermione.
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!
I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.
I knew I could do it this time because well, I had already done it.
- Does that make sense?
- No.
But I don't like flying...!
Bombarda!
I'll be forever grateful for this to both of you.
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.
For some time, my life will be too unpredictable.
And besides you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.
And you know it.
And for now, that will do.
I expect you're tired of hearing this but you look so like your father.
Except your eyes.
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.
It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little.
But know this:
The ones that love us never really leave us.
And you can always find them in here.
You really are the brightest witch of your age.
We have to go.
- Well?
- He's free.
We did it.
Did what?
Good night.
How did you get there?
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.
Honestly, Ron.
How can somebody be in two places at once?
Hello, Harry.
I saw you coming.
I've looked worse, believe me.
- You've been sacked.
- No.
No.
I resigned, actually.
Resigned?
Why?
Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition.
This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want well, someone like me teaching their children.
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already risked enough on my behalf.
Besides, people like me are...
Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now.
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
None of it made any difference.
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.
You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.
It made a great deal of difference.
If I am proud of anything it is of how much you have learned this year.
Now, since I am no longer your teacher I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you.
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
Until then mischief managed.
Stand back, I said!
Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle.
Harry.
Wherever did you get it?
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.
Did not.
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.
For me?
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.
This came with it.
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.
How fast is it, Harry?
Lumos.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
Mischief managed.
Nox.
Harry Potter 3
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima!
Harry.
Harry.
Harry, open the door.
Marge.
How lovely to see...
Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.
What is it?
Nothing.
School stuff.
Later perhaps, if you behave.
I will if she does.
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.
Don't say yes in that ungrateful way.
Damn good of my brother to keep you.
He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?
Give us a kiss.
Come on.
Up, up.
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
Okay.
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.
Excellent nosh, Petunia.
A bit more.
Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs.
Just a bit more.
That's a boy.
You wanna try a little drop of brandy?
A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?
What are you smirking at?
Where did you send the boy, Vernon?
St. Brutus'.
It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I've been beaten loads of times.
Excellent.
I won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it.
You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out.
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.
What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?
Nothing.
He didn't work.
He was unemployed.
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.
Don't worry.
Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.
I think it's time you went to bed.
Quiet, Vernon.
You, clean it up.
Actually, it's nothing to do with the father.
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.
If something's wrong with the bitch, then something's wrong with the pup.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Right.
Let me tell you...
Vernon!
Vernon!
Vernon, do something!
Stop!
I've got you, Marge.
I've got you.
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.
Oh, Vernon.
Oh, God.
Marge!
Please!
Marge!
Come back!
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.
- You put her right!
- No.
She deserved what she got.
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.
- Yeah?
Try me.
- They won't let you back now.
You've nowhere to go.
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.
"Welcome to the Knight Bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard.
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening."
What you doing down there?
- I fell over.
- What you fell over for?
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.
Well, come on, then.
In.
No, no, no.
I'll get this.
You get in.
Come on.
Come on.
Move on, move on.
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London.
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup make sure you eat it before it eats you.
- But the Muggles.
Can't they see us?
- Muggles?
They don't see nothing, do they?
No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel.
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!
Ten, nine, eight seven, six, five four, three, three and a half two, one and three quarters.
Yes!
Who is that?
That man.
Who is that?
Who is...?
That is Sirius Black, that is.
Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black.
He's a murderer.
Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?
He's the first one that done it.
He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.
I reckon you've heard of him.
Yeah.
Him I've heard of.
Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock.
They're getting closer, Ernie.
Ernie, they're right on top of us!
Mind your head.
Hey, guys?
Guys?
Why the long faces?
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there.
Nearly there.
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.
Mr. Potter, at last.
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!
Room 11.
Hedwig.
Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter.
He arrived here just five minutes before yourself.
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack.
The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately.
She has been properly punctured and her memory modified.
She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.
So that's that and no harm done.
Pea soup?
No, thank you.
- Minister?
- Yes?
- I don't understand.
- Understand?
I broke the law.
Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
Come now.
The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts.
On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things was very, very irresponsible.
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.
Sirius Black, you mean?
But what's he got to do with me?
Nothing, of course.
You're safe.
And that's what matters.
And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.
Hedwig.
Oh, by the way, Harry.
Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't wander.
Right!
You gonna move that bus or what?
Housekeeping.
I'll come back later.
I'm warning you, Hermione.
Keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?
- It's in his nature.
- A cat?
Is that what they told you?
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...
Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.
Harry.
Harry.
- Egypt.
What's it like?
- Brilliant.
Loads of old stuff like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.
- The day maid.
- Night maid.
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.
- Got everything?
- Yes.
- Yes?
All your books?
- It's all upstairs.
- Your clothes?
- Everything.
- Good boy.
- Thank you.
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah.
It should be great.
Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you.
But I think that you need to know the facts.
You are in danger.
Grave danger.
Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?
What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?
Thirteen years ago, when you stopped...
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.
Sorry.
When you stopped You-Know-Who Black lost everything.
But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant.
And in his mind you are the only thing that stands in the way of You-Know-Who returning to power.
And that is why he has escaped from Azkaban.
To find you.
And kill me.
Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear you won't go looking for Black.
Mr. Weasley why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
Quick.
Quick.
Ron, Ron!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Don't lose him!
I didn't mean to blow her up.
I just...
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
I was lucky not to be arrested.
I still think it was brilliant.
Come on.
Everywhere else is full.
Who do you think that is?
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?
How is it she knows everything?
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be.
Why?
- I gotta tell you something.
- Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
- Yeah.
- But they'll catch Black, won't they?
I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.
Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.
- Why are we stopping?
- We can't be there yet.
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.
Ouch, Ron.
That was my foot.
There's something moving out there.
I think someone's coming aboard.
Bloody hell!
What's happening?
Harry.
Harry, are you all right?
Thank you.
Here, eat this.
It'll help.
It's all right.
It's chocolate.
What was that thing that came?
It was a dementor.
One of the guards of Azkaban.
It's gone now.
It was searching the train for Sirius Black.
If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver.
Eat.
You'll feel better.
What happened to me?
Well, you sort of went rigid.
We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
And did either of you two you know pass out?
- No.
I felt weird, though.
Like I'd never be cheerful again.
But someone was screaming.
A woman.
No one was screaming, Harry.
Welcome!
Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.
Now, I'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast.
First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin who's kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
Good luck, professor.
Of course.
That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.
Potter.
Is it true you fainted?
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.
Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.
Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid.
Finally, on a more disquieting note at the request of the Ministry of Magic Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban until such a time as Sirius Black is captured.
The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
Now whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution.
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.
Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.
It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
But you know, happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light.
Fortuna Major.
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no.
Wait, wait.
Watch this.
- Amazing.
Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.
- Yes, all right.
Go in.
- Thank you.
Still doing that after three years.
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.
Green.
That's a monkey.
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?
Do not give him one again.
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
- Ron, catch.
- I will.
I think we have a winner.
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.
Look at him.
His face.
Welcome, my children.
In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination.
In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight.
Hello.
I am Professor Trelawney.
Together we shall cast ourselves into the future.
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves.
So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you.
What do you see?
The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read.
But first, you must broaden your minds.
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.
- Where did you come from?
- Me?
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...
Is your grandmother quite well?
I think so.
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.
Pity.
Broaden your minds.
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?
- I think you are.
- Sure.
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.
Yeah.
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.
And that there could be the sun and that's happiness.
So you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.
Give me the cup.
Oh, my dear boy.
My dear you have the Grim.
The Grin?
What's the Grin?
Not the Grin, you idiot.
The Grim.
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.
It's among the darkest omens in our world.
It's an omen of death."
You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Oh, honestly, Ron.
If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline.
Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.
Ancient Runes?
Exactly how many classes are you taking?
A fair few.
Hang on.
That's not possible.
Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.
You have to be in two classes at once.
Don't be silly.
How could anyone be in two classes at once?
"Broaden your minds.
Use your Inner Eye to see the future."
That's it.
Come on, now.
Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.
I got a real treat for you today.
A great lesson.
So follow me.
Right, you lot.
Less chattering.
Form a group over there.
And open your books to page 49.
Exactly how do we do that?
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay.
Okay.
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah.
Terribly funny.
Witty.
God, this place has gone to the dogs.
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.
Shut up, Malfoy.
Dementor!
Dementor!
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.
Yeah.
Isn't he beautiful?
Say hello to Buckbeak.
Hagrid, exactly what is that?
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.
First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
It may be the last thing you ever do.
Now, who'd like to come and say hello?
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Come on now.
Now you have to let him make the first move.
It's only polite.
So step up.
Give him a nice bow.
Then you wait and see if he bows back.
If he does, you can go and touch him.
If not...
Well, we'll get to that later.
Just make your bow.
Nice and low.
Back off, Harry.
Back off.
Keep still.
Keep still.
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.
Right.
I think you can go and pat him now.
Go on.
Don't be shy.
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow.
Slow.
Not so fast, Harry.
Slow down, Harry.
That's it...
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...
That's it...
Yes!
Well done!
Well done, Harry, well done!
Does he get to fly?
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Put you over here, just behind the wing joint.
Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that.
Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak.
That was wicked, Harry!
Oh, please.
Well done, well done.
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.
You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!
Malfoy, no...
No!
Buckbeak!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa!
Buckbeak!
Away, you silly creature...
- It's killed me!
- Calm down.
It's just a scratch!
Hagrid!
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher.
I'll do it.
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!
You and your bloody chicken!
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.
Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm.
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.
- He's been sighted!
- Who?
Sirius Black!
Dufftown?
That's not far from here.
You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?
That's right.
Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.
Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
Intriguing, isn't it?
Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what is inside?
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.
Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...
Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart.
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.
After me.
Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.
A little louder and very clear.
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.
So much for the easy part.
You see, the incantation alone is not enough.
What really finishes a boggart is laughter.
You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.
Let me explain.
Neville, would you join me, please?
Come on, don't be shy.
Come on.
Come on.
Hello.
Neville, what frightens you most of all?
Professor Snape.
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.
Professor Snape.
Yes, frightens all.
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.
No it won't.
I want you to picture her clothes.
Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe here's what I want you to do.
Excuse me.
Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.
Can you do that?
Yes.
Wand at the ready.
One, two, three.
Think, Neville, think.
Riddikulus!
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible!
Okay to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...
Form a line!
I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most and turn it into something funny.
Next!
Ron!
Concentrate.
Face your fear.
Be brave!
Wand at the ready, Ron.
Riddikulus!
Yes!
You see?
Very good, very good!
Marvelous!
Absolutely, very, very enjoyable!
Parvati!
Next!
Show us what you see.
Keep your nerve.
Steady.
Riddikulus!
And next!
Step up, step up!
Wonderful, wonderful!
Here!
Riddikulus!
Right.
Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.
Collect your books from the back.
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you!
Sorry!
Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege.
Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school that privilege shall not be extended again.
No permission form signed, no visiting the village.
That's the rule, Potter.
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.
I thought if you signed it, then I could...
I can't.
Only a parent or a guardian can sign.
Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate.
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.
Forget about it, guys.
See you later.
Professor, can I ask you something?
You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?
I thought it'd be obvious.
I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.
I did think of Voldemort at first.
But then I remembered that night on the train and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.
That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.
This is very wise.
Before I fainted I heard something.
A woman screaming.
Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.
Our pain becomes their power.
I think it was my mother the night she was murdered.
The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.
Not by your scar, by your eyes.
They're your mother, Lily's.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
I knew her.
Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.
Not only was she a singularly gifted witch she was also an uncommonly kind woman.
She had a way of seeing the beauty in others even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves.
And your father, James, on the other hand he...
He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble.
A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.
You're more like them than you know, Harry.
In time, you'll come to see just how much.
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain.
I know.
What's going on?
Probably Neville forgot the password again.
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.
Let me through, please.
Excuse me!
I'm Head Boy!
Get back, all of you.
No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.
The Fat Lady!
She's gone!
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.
It's not funny, Ron.
Keep calm, everyone.
Break into fours.
Back to your common room.
- Be quiet.
- Make way.
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.
You heard.
Move!
Mr. Filch?
Round up the ghosts.
Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
There's no need for ghosts, professor.
The Fat Lady's there.
Mind where you're going!
Slow down!
You listen!
I'm Head Boy!
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!
Dear lady, who did this to you?
Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.
He's here, somewhere in the castle!
Sirius Black!
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery.
There's nothing there.
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.
I didn't really expect him to linger.
Remarkable feat, don't you think?
To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own...
Any theories on how he managed it?
Many.
Each as unlikely as the next.
You may recall prior to the start of term I expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor...
Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?
Perhaps.
But for now, let him sleep.
For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.
Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
Turn to page 394.
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?
That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?
Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time.
Turn to page 394.
"Werewolves"?
Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?
Now, which one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?
No one?
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.
An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
A werewolf has no choice.
With each full moon he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.
The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.
Are you incapable of restraining yourself or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.
As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.
Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter.
Loss of limb will not excuse you.
Page 394.
The term "werewolf" is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer" which means "man," and "wolf." Werewolf, man-wolf.
There are several ways to become a werewolf.
They include being given the power of shape-shifting being bitten by a werewolf...
Go, Harry!
Go, Harry!
Aresto momentum!
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.
Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.
Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.
You gave us a right good scare.
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.
Really?
I meant the match.
Who won?
No one blames you, Harry.
Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds.
Dumbledore's furious.
After he saved you, he sent them off.
There's something else you should know too.
When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and...
Well...
I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.
Is there no chance of fixing it?
No.
Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.
Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.
They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.
You are not weak, Harry.
Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.
Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.
You made the one on the train go away.
There was only one that night.
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.
But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.
For now, I need to rest.
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.
We'll get you there.
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- lf you pipe down.
- Bless him.
- Let me go!
Come on, guys.
Don't...
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.
What are you doing?
!
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...
But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
George, if you will.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder's Map."
We owe them so much.
Hang on.
This is Hogwarts.
And that...
- No.
Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.
- In his study.
- Pacing.
Does that a lot.
- So this map shows...?
- Everyone.
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.
- Every minute.
- Every day.
- Brilliant!
Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.
Hurry.
Filch is heading this way.
And don't forget.
When you're done,
"Mischief managed." Otherwise, anyone can read it.
Now, how much do you want?
Delicious.
It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain.
Did I mention that?
Twice.
Do you want to move a bit closer?
To the Shrieking Shack?
Actually, I'm fine here.
Well, well.
Look who's here.
You two shopping for your new dream home?
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.
Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!
You filthy little mudblood!
Who is that?
- Don't stand there!
Do something!
- What?
What's up, Malfoy?
Lost your skis?
Get out of the way!
Move!
Malfoy!
Wait!
Wait!
Harry!
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.
Those weasels!
Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
He won't keep it.
He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.
- Aren't you?
- Sure.
Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
Look who it is.
Madam Rosmerta.
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!
Allow me, minister.
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors into my pub every other night!
- We have...
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
And what would bring him here?
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?
Come.
Harry!
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!
- So rude.
- Thick heads.
- Thick heads?
!
- How dare they!
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!
Nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place.
Now..
Tell me what this is all about.
Well.
Now, years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death...
Do you remember?
They went into hiding.
Few knew where they were.
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.
Not only did Black lead You-Know-Who to the Potters that night but he also killed one of their friends.
Peter Pettigrew!
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Yes, little lump of a boy..
..always trailing after Sirius Black.
- I remember him.
Never let James and Sirius out of his sight.
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters and might have managed to, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.
He destroyed him!
A finger.
That's all that was left.
A finger.
Nothing else.
Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters but he's the reason they're dead.
- And now he wants to finish what he started.
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.
- What could be worse?
- This:
Sirius Black was and remains to this day Harry Potter's godfather!
Ron, look!
- Sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.
Harry, what happened?
He was their friend and he betrayed them.
He was their friend!
I hope he finds me.
Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!
Harry.
There you are.
You came.
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level.
I'm sure.
Well, everything's prepared.
The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm.
Did you ever hear of it?
No?
Well...
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.
But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory.
Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.
Can you do this?
Yes.
Very well.
Close your eyes.
Concentrate.
Explore your past.
Do you have a memory?
Allow it to fill you up.
Lose yourself within it.
Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum.
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.
Shall we?
Wand at the ready.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto...
Expecto...
Expect...
Here we go.
Come on.
Sit up.
Deep breaths.
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to do it the first time.
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this.
You'll feel better.
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.
As a matter of interest, what were you thinking?
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.
Well, it is.
It's the happiest I've ever felt but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?
Then let's give it a try.
You feel ready?
Just do it.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto Patronum!
Yes!
Well done, Harry.
Well done!
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes.
Sit down.
Here.
Eat this, it helps.
It really helps.
And just so you know, Harry I think you'd have given your father a run for his money.
And that is saying something.
I was thinking of him.
And Mum.
Seeing their faces.
They were talking to me.
Just talking.
That's the memory I chose.
I don't even know if it's real.
But it's the best I have.
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.
Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.
- Did.
- Didn't.
How did it go, Hagrid?
The hearing?
Well, first off, the committee members took turns talking about why we were there.
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers.
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.
He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you.
And then?
And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
Spiders!
There's...
There's spiders.
Spiders.
They want me to tap-dance.
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- You tell those spiders.
Right, yeah.
Tell them.
I'll tell them...
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!
Mischief managed.
Nox.
Potter.
What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
I was sleepwalking.
How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter.
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.
My dad didn't strut.
And nor do I.
Now, if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.
Turn out your pockets.
Turn out your pockets!
What's this?
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really?
Open it.
Reveal your secrets.
Read it.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."
Go on.
"And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business."
- You insolent little...
- Professor!
Well, well.
Lupin.
Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?
Harry, are you all right?
That remains to be seen.
I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.
It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.
Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.
It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise.
Harry, would you come with me, please?
Professor, good night.
Are you deaf?
Put that light out!
Come in.
I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in.
Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black is a map to you?
- No.
- No, sir.
Your father never set much store by the rules either.
But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.
Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!
Now, I will not cover up for you again.
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.
I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.
Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works.
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.
Oh, really?
And who might that be?
Peter Pettigrew.
That's not possible.
It's just what I saw.
Good night, professor.
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.
The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.
Only then can you see.
Try again.
Now, what do we have here?
Do you mind me trying?
The Grim, possibly.
My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.
You may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave.
Have I said something?
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental but now it's in the open for everyone to see.
Hang on.
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.
- Fine.
See you later.
- See you.
Harry Potter...
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.
Sorry?
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder shall break free.
Innocent blood shall be spilt and servant and master shall be reunited once more.
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?
No.
Nothing.
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak.
It's just too horrible.
- It just got worse.
- What did I say?
Father said I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.
This is going to be rich.
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?
You!
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
Malfoy, are you okay?
- Let's go.
Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Look at him.
Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
Why don't we just set him free?
They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.
Says he wants to be with me when they...
When it happens.
Great man, Dumbledore.
A great man.
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!
Think I want you seeing something like that?
No.
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh.
Before you do, Ron...
Scabbers!
You're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.
Right.
Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.
I meant me!
Blimey.
What was that?
Hagrid!
Oh, crikey.
No, minister.
Over this way.
It's late.
It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.
Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble.
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!
Quick.
Quick!
Hagrid.
- It'll be fine.
It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.
- On the slope...
Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.
- Good evening.
- Minister.
Make your way through.
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.
Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we?
Very well.
It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak hereinafter called "the condemned," shall be executed this day at sundown.
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid.
Now, come on.
- All right.
It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go!
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Oh, no.
He bit me.
Scabbers.
Ron.
Ron!
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.
Wait!
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
That's not good.
Ron, run!
Harry, Hermione, run!
It's the Grim!
- Harry!
- Ron!
Ron, wait!
Harry!
- Help!
- Ron!
- Ron.
Ron.
- Ron!
Come on!
Move!
Duck!
Harry!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.
I just hope I'm wrong.
We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
Come on.
Ron.
- Ron.
You're okay.
- The dog.
Where is it?
It's a trap.
He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.
If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!
No.
Only one will die tonight.
Then it'll be you!
Are you going to kill me, Harry?
Expelliarmus!
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?
Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within.
Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you?
- I found him.
- I know.
- He's here.
- I understand.
- Let's kill him!
- No!
I trusted you!
And all this time, you've been his friend.
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.
How long have you known?
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.
You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!
Twelve years of it!
In Azkaban!
Very well.
Kill him.
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.
I know why.
You betrayed my parents.
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.
Somebody did betray your parents somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!
And he's in this room!
Right now!
Come out, come out, Peter!
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!
Vengeance is sweet.
How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
Severus...
I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle.
Here's the proof.
Brilliant, Snape.
You put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion.
If you'll excuse us, Remus and I have business to attend to.
- Give me a reason.
I beg you!
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it.
It's habit.
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!
You two, quarrelling like an old married couple.
Run along and play with your chemistry set!
I could do it, you know.
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.
A Dementor's Kiss.
One can only imagine what that must be like.
It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.
Severus, please.
After you.
Expelliarmus!
- Harry!
What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.
We thought he was our friend!
- No.
Pettigrew's dead.
You killed him!
- No, he didn't.
I thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map!
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!
- Me?
!
He's mental!
- Not you!
Your rat!
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?
Curiously long life for a common garden rat!
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!
Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?
Scabbers!
Leave him alone!
Get off him!
What are you doing?
Remus?
Sirius.
My old friends!
Harry!
Look at you.
You look so much like your father.
- James.
We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!
How dare you talk about James in front of him!
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!
The Dark Lord.
You have no idea the weapons he possesses!
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!
James wouldn't have wanted me killed!
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!
Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would.
Together!
No!
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.
But we'll take him to the castle.
- Bless you, boy.
Bless you!
- Get off!
I said we'd take you to the castle.
After that, the dementors can have you.
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.
A bit?
A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!
I was going for the rat.
Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog.
More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent.
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.
Okay.
- You better go.
- No.
Don't worry, okay?
It's fine.
I'll stay.
You go, I'll stay.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
Go.
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.
They might chop it.
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
It's too late.
It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.
It'll be nice to do it again as a free man.
That was a noble thing you did back there.
He doesn't deserve it.
I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends to become killers.
Besides, dead, the truth dies with him.
Alive, you're free.
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!
Ron!
Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!
- Sweet, clever girl!
Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!
I don't know if you know, Harry but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather.
I know.
I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle but if you ever wanted a different home...
What?
Come and live with you?
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.
Harry!
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live!
Here!
This flesh is only flesh!
Expelliarmus!
Harry!
Remus!
Remus!
Run!
Run!
- Come on.
- Wait.
Wait.
Hermione!
Bad idea.
Bad idea.
Professor?
Professor Lupin?
Nice doggy.
Nice doggy!
There you are, Potter!
Sirius!
Come back here, Potter!
Sirius!
No.
Sirius!
Expecto Patronum!
Harry?
I saw my dad.
What?
He sent the dementors away.
I saw him across the lake.
Harry, they've captured Sirius.
Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.
- They're gonna kill him?
- No.
It's worse.
Much worse.
They're going to suck out his soul.
Headmaster, stop them.
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true.
Sirius is innocent.
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?
He's my rat, sir.
He's not really a rat.
He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.
But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.
A child's voice, however honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.
Mysterious thing, time.
Powerful and when meddled with, dangerous.
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen.
And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime.
If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss.
If you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared.
Three turns should do it, I think.
Oh, and by the way.
When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin.
Good luck.
What the bloody hell was that all about?
Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk...
What just happened?
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.
Where were we at 7:30?
I don't know.
Going to Hagrid's?
Come on.
And we can't be seen.
Hermione!
Hermione!
Hermione, wait.
Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
That's us.
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
This is not normal.
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first term.
This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.
Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.
Good punch.
Thanks.
Malfoy's coming.
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood!
Mark my words.
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Come on.
We should be at Hagrid's.
Look.
Buckbeak's still alive.
Of course.
Remember what Dumbledore said?
If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.
Let's go.
Here they come.
I'd better hurry.
Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.
Scabbers, you're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.
If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad.
Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time.
We can't be seen.
Fudge is coming.
And we aren't leaving?
Why aren't we leaving?
Are you mad?
That hurt.
Sorry.
We're coming out the back door.
Go!
Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go.
Okay, go, Harry.
Go!
Get away.
Get off.
Minister, I really think I should sign as well.
Yes, very well.
Perhaps it would be...
Okay, Buckbeak.
Come quickly.
Come with us now.
Come on.
Keep trying.
Come on.
Quickly.
Buckbeak.
Okay?
Quickly.
Hurry up.
Okay?
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.
Come and get the nice dead ferret.
- Come on.
It's here.
Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister.
Follow me.
- Now, look there.
- Where?
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?
Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
- Oh, yes.
Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.
- Come on, Buckbeak.
Come on.
- I see no strawberries.
- Over there.
- Where?
- Over there.
- This way.
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.
But where is it?
I saw the beast, just now.
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.
Buckbeak.
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.
I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.
- Right.
- Well, well...
We must search the grounds.
Well, search the skies, if you must, minister.
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy.
Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required.
Thank you.
You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor.
- Come on.
- This way.
This way, now.
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.
- How?
- No idea.
- Look.
It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!
And Snape's coming.
And now we wait.
And now we wait.
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.
- Hermione?
- Yeah?
Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius I did see someone.
That someone made the dementors go away.
With a Patronus.
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
According to him only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
It was my dad.
My dad conjured the Patronus.
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead.
I know.
I'm just telling you what I saw.
Here we come.
You see Sirius talking to me there?
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'.
It'll just be me and him.
We could live in the country someplace you can see the sky.
He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
Harry!
Run!
Let's go.
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.
Thanks.
- Great.
Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that.
Run!
That was so scary.
Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
Sirius.
Come on!
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.
Any minute now.
Right there.
You'll see.
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.
- Sirius.
- You're dying both of you.
Harry!
Expecto Patronum!
You were right, Hermione.
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!
I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.
I knew I could do it this time because well, I had already done it.
- Does that make sense?
- No.
But I don't like flying...!
Bombarda!
I'll be forever grateful for this to both of you.
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.
For some time, my life will be too unpredictable.
And besides you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.
And you know it.
And for now, that will do.
I expect you're tired of hearing this but you look so like your father.
Except your eyes.
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.
It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little.
But know this:
The ones that love us never really leave us.
And you can always find them in here.
You really are the brightest witch of your age.
We have to go.
- Well?
- He's free.
We did it.
Did what?
Good night.
How did you get there?
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.
Honestly, Ron.
How can somebody be in two places at once?
Hello, Harry.
I saw you coming.
I've looked worse, believe me.
- You've been sacked.
- No.
No.
I resigned, actually.
Resigned?
Why?
Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition.
This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want well, someone like me teaching their children.
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already risked enough on my behalf.
Besides, people like me are...
Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now.
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
None of it made any difference.
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.
You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.
It made a great deal of difference.
If I am proud of anything it is of how much you have learned this year.
Now, since I am no longer your teacher I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you.
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
Until then mischief managed.
Stand back, I said!
Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle.
Harry.
Wherever did you get it?
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.
Did not.
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.
For me?
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.
This came with it.
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.
How fast is it, Harry?
Lumos.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
Mischief managed.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima!
Harry.
Harry.
Harry, open the door.
Marge.
How lovely to see...
Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.
What is it?
Nothing.
School stuff.
Later perhaps, if you behave.
I will if she does.
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.
Don't say yes in that ungrateful way.
Damn good of my brother to keep you.
He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?
Give us a kiss.
Come on.
Up, up.
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
Okay.
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.
Excellent nosh, Petunia.
A bit more.
Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs.
Just a bit more.
That's a boy.
You wanna try a little drop of brandy?
A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?
What are you smirking at?
Where did you send the boy, Vernon?
St. Brutus'.
It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I've been beaten loads of times.
Excellent.
I won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it.
You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out.
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.
What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?
Nothing.
He didn't work.
He was unemployed.
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.
Don't worry.
Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.
I think it's time you went to bed.
Quiet, Vernon.
You, clean it up.
Actually, it's nothing to do with the father.
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.
If something's wrong with the bitch, then something's wrong with the pup.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Right.
Let me tell you...
Vernon!
Vernon!
Vernon, do something!
Stop!
I've got you, Marge.
I've got you.
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.
Oh, Vernon.
Oh, God.
Marge!
Please!
Marge!
Come back!
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.
- You put her right!
- No.
She deserved what she got.
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.
- Yeah?
Try me.
- They won't let you back now.
You've nowhere to go.
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.
"Welcome to the Knight Bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard.
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening. "
What you doing down there?
- I fell over.
- What you fall over for?
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.
Well, come on, then.
In.
No, no, no.
I'll get this.
You get in.
Come on.
Come on.
Move on, move on.
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London.
You hear that? " The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London. "
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup make sure you eat it before it eats you.
- But the Muggles.
Can't they see us?
- Muggles?
They don't see nothing, do they?
No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel.
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!
Ten, nine, eight seven, six, five four, three, three and a half two, one and three quarters.
Yes!
Who is that?
That man.
Who is that?
Who is...?
That is Sirius Black, that is.
Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black.
He's a murderer.
Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?
He's the first one that done it.
He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.
I reckon you've heard of him.
Yeah.
Him I've heard of.
Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock.
They're getting closer, Ernie.
Ernie, they're right on top of us!
Mind your head.
Hey, guys?
Guys?
Why the long faces?
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there.
Nearly there.
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.
Mr. Potter, at last.
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!
Room 11.
Hedwig.
Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter.
He arrived here just five minutes before yourself.
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack.
The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately.
She has been properly punctured and her memory modified.
She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.
So that's that and no harm done.
Pea soup?
No, thank you.
- Minister?
- Yes?
- I don't understand.
- Understand?
I broke the law.
Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
Come now.
The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts.
On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things was very, very irresponsible.
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.
Sirius Black, you mean?
But what's he got to do with me?
Nothing, of course.
You're safe.
And that's what matters.
And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.
Hedwig.
Oh, by the way, Harry.
Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't wander.
Right!
You gonna move that bus or what?
Housekeeping.
I'll come back later.
I'm warning you, Hermione.
Keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?
- It's in his nature.
- A cat?
Is that what they told you?
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...
Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.
Harry.
Harry.
- Egypt.
What's it like?
- Brilliant.
Loads of old stuff like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.
- The day maid.
- Night maid.
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.
- Got everything?
- Yes.
- Yes?
All your books?
- It's all upstairs.
- Your clothes?
- Everything.
- Good boy.
- Thank you.
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah.
It should be great.
Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you.
But I think that you need to know the facts.
You are in danger.
Grave danger.
Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?
What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?
Thirteen years ago, when you stopped...
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.
Sorry.
When you stopped You-Know-Who Black lost everything.
But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant.
And in his mind you are the only thing that stands in the way of You-Know-Who returning to power.
And that is why he has escaped from Azkaban.
To find you.
And kill me.
Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear you won't go looking for Black.
Mr. Weasley why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
Quick.
Quick.
Ron, Ron!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Don't lose him!
I didn't mean to blow her up.
I just...
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
I was lucky not to be arrested.
I still think it was brilliant.
Come on.
Everywhere else is full.
Who do you think that is?
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?
How is it she knows everything?
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be.
Why?
I gotta tell you something.
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
- Yeah.
But they'll catch Black, won't they?
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.
Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.
Why are we stopping?
We can't be there yet.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.
Ouch, Ron.
That was my foot.
There's something moving out there.
I think someone's coming aboard.
Bloody hell!
What's happening?
Harry.
Harry, are you all right?
Thank you.
Here, eat this.
It'll help.
It's all right.
It's chocolate.
What was that thing that came?
It was a dementor.
One of the guards of Azkaban.
It's gone now.
It was searching the train for Sirius Black.
If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver.
Eat.
You'll feel better.
What happened to me?
Well, you sort of went rigid.
We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
And did either of you two you know pass out?
- No.
I felt weird, though.
Like I'd never be cheerful again.
But someone was screaming.
A woman.
No one was screaming, Harry.
Welcome!
Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.
Now, I'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast.
First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin who's kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
Good luck, professor.
Of course.
That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.
Potter.
Is it true you fainted?
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.
Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.
Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid.
Finally, on a more disquieting note at the request of the Ministry of Magic Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban until such a time as Sirius Black is captured.
The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
Now whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution.
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.
Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.
It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
But you know, happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light.
Fortuna Major.
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no.
Wait, wait.
Watch this.
- Amazing.
Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.
- Yes, all right.
Go in.
- Thank you.
Still doing that after three years.
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.
Green.
That's a monkey.
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?
Do not give him one again.
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
- Ron, catch.
- I will.
I think we have a winner.
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.
Look at him.
His face.
Welcome, my children.
In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination.
In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight.
Hello.
I am Professor Trelawney.
Together we shall cast ourselves into the future.
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves.
So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you.
What do you see?
The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read.
But first, you must broaden your minds.
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.
- Where did you come from?
- Me?
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...
Is your grandmother quite well?
I think so.
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.
Pity.
Broaden your minds.
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?
- I think you are.
- Sure.
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.
Yeah.
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.
And that there could be the sun and that's happiness.
So you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.
Give me the cup.
Oh, my dear boy.
My dear you have the Grim.
The Grin?
What's the Grin?
Not the Grin, you idiot.
The Grim.
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.
It's among the darkest omens in our world.
It's an omen of death. "
You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Oh, honestly, Ron.
If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline.
Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.
Ancient Runes?
Exactly how many classes are you taking?
A fair few.
Hang on.
That's not possible.
Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.
You have to be in two classes at once.
Don't be silly.
How could anyone be in two classes at once?
"Broaden your minds.
Use your Inner Eye to see the future. "
That's it.
Come on, now.
Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.
I got a real treat for you today.
A great lesson.
So follow me.
Right, you lot.
Less chattering.
Form a group over there.
And open your books to page 49.
Exactly how do we do that?
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay.
Okay.
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah.
Terribly funny.
Witty.
God, this place has gone to the dogs.
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.
Shut up, Malfoy.
Dementor!
Dementor!
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.
Yeah.
Isn't he beautiful?
Say hello to Buckbeak.
Hagrid, exactly what is that?
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.
First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
It may be the last thing you ever do.
Now, who'd like to come and say hello?
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Come on now.
Now you have to let him make the first move.
It's only polite.
So step up.
Give him a nice bow.
Then you wait and see if he bows back.
If he does, you can go and touch him.
If not...
Well, we'll get to that later.
Just make your bow.
Nice and low.
Back off, Harry.
Back off.
Keep still.
Keep still.
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.
Right.
I think you can go and pat him now.
Go on.
Don't be shy.
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow.
Slow.
Not so fast, Harry.
Slow down, Harry.
That's it...
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...
That's it...
Yes!
Well done!
Well done, Harry, well done!
Does he get to fly?
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Put you over here, just behind the wing joint.
Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that.
Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak.
That was wicked, Harry!
Oh, please.
Well done, well done.
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.
You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!
Malfoy, no...
No!
Buckbeak!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa!
Buckbeak!
Away, you silly creature...
- It's killed me!
- Calm down.
It's just a scratch!
Hagrid!
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher.
I'll do it.
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!
You and your bloody chicken!
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.
Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm.
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.
- He's been sighted!
- Who?
Sirius Black!
Dufftown?
That's not far from here.
You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?
That's right.
Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.
Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
Intriguing, isn't it?
Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what is inside?
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.
Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...
Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart.
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.
After me.
Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.
So much for the easy part.
You see, the incantation alone is not enough.
What really finishes a boggart is laughter.
You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.
Let me explain.
Neville, would you join me, please?
Come on, don't be shy.
Come on.
Come on.
Hello.
Neville, what frightens you most of all?
Professor Snape.
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.
Professor Snape.
Yes, frightens all.
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.
No it won't.
I want you to picture her clothes.
Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe here's what I want you to do.
Excuse me.
Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.
Can you do that?
Yes.
Wand at the ready.
One, two, three.
Think, Neville, think.
Riddikulus!
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible!
Okay to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...
Form a line!
I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most and turn it into something funny.
Next!
Ron!
Concentrate.
Face your fear.
Be brave!
Wand at the ready, Ron.
Riddikulus!
Yes!
You see?
Very good, very good!
Marvelous!
Absolutely, very, very enjoyable!
Parvati!
Next!
Show us what you see.
Keep your nerve.
Steady.
Riddikulus!
And next!
Step up, step up!
Wonderful, wonderful!
Here!
Riddikulus!
Right.
Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.
Collect your books from the back.
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you!
Sorry!
Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege.
Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school that privilege shall not be extended again.
No permission form signed, no visiting the village.
That's the rule, Potter.
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.
I thought if you signed it, then I could...
I can't.
Only a parent or a guardian can sign.
Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate.
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.
Forget about it, guys.
See you later.
Professor, can I ask you something?
You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?
I thought it'd be obvious.
I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.
I did think of Voldemort at first.
But then I remembered that night on the train and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.
That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.
This is very wise.
Before I fainted I heard something.
A woman screaming.
Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.
Our pain becomes their power.
I think it was my mother the night she was murdered.
The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.
Not by your scar, by your eyes.
They're your mother, Lily's.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
I knew her.
Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.
Not only was she a singularly gifted witch she was also an uncommonly kind woman.
She had a way of seeing the beauty in others even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves.
And your father, James, on the other hand he...
He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble.
A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.
You're more like them than you know, Harry.
In time, you'll come to see just how much.
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain.
I know.
What's going on?
Probably Neville forgot the password again.
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.
Let me through, please.
Excuse me!
I'm Head Boy!
Get back, all of you.
No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.
The Fat Lady!
She's gone!
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.
It's not funny, Ron.
Keep calm, everyone.
Break into fours.
Back to your common room.
- Be quiet.
- Make way.
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.
You heard.
Move!
Mr. Filch?
Round up the ghosts.
Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
There's no need for ghosts, professor.
The Fat Lady's there.
Mind where you're going!
Slow down!
You listen!
I'm Head Boy!
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!
Dear lady, who did this to you?
Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.
He's here, somewhere in the castle!
Sirius Black!
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery.
There's nothing there.
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.
I didn't really expect him to linger.
Remarkable feat, don't you think?
To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own...
Any theories on how he managed it?
Many.
Each as unlikely as the next.
You may recall prior to the start of term I expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor...
Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?
Perhaps.
But for now, let him sleep.
For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.
Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
Turn to page 394.
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?
That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?
Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time.
Turn to page 394.
"Werewolves"?
Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?
Now, which one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?
No one?
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.
An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
A werewolf has no choice.
With each full moon he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.
The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.
Are you incapable of restraining yourself or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.
As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.
Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter.
Loss of limb will not excuse you.
Page 394.
The term "werewolf" is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer" which means "man," and "wolf. " Werewolf, man-wolf.
There are several ways to become a werewolf.
They include being given the power of shape-shifting being bitten by a werewolf...
Go, Harry!
Go, Harry!
Aresto momentum!
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.
Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.
Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.
You gave us a right good scare.
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.
Really?
I meant the match.
Who won?
No one blames you, Harry.
Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds.
Dumbledore's furious.
After he saved you, he sent them off.
There's something else you should know too.
When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and...
Well...
I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.
Is there no chance of fixing it?
No.
Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.
Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.
They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.
You are not weak, Harry.
Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.
Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.
You made the one on the train go away.
There was only one that night.
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.
But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.
For now, I need to rest.
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.
We'll get you there.
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- Lf you pipe down.
- Bless him.
- Let me go!
Come on, guys.
Don't...
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.
What are you doing?
!
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...
But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
George, if you will.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder's Map. "
We owe them so much.
Hang on.
This is Hogwarts.
And that...
- No.
Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.
- In his study.
- Pacing.
Does that a lot.
- So this map shows...
- Everyone.
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.
- Every minute.
- Every day.
- Brilliant!
Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.
Hurry.
Filch is heading this way.
And don't forget.
When you're done, just give it a tap and say:
"Mischief managed. " Otherwise, anyone can read it.
Now, how much do you want?
Delicious.
It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain.
Did I mention that?
Twice.
Do you want to move a bit closer?
To the Shrieking Shack?
Actually, I'm fine here.
Well, well.
Look who's here.
You two shopping for your new dream home?
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.
Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!
You filthy little mudblood!
Who is that?
- Don't stand there!
Do something!
- What?
What's up, Malfoy?
Lost your skis?
Get out of the way!
Move!
Malfoy!
Wait!
Wait!
Harry!
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.
Those weasels!
Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
He won't keep it.
He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.
- Aren't you?
- Sure.
Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
Look who it is.
Madam Rosmerta.
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!
Allow me, minister.
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors into my pub every other night!
- We have...
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
And what would bring him here?
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?
Come.
Harry!
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!
- So rude.
- Thick heads.
- Thick heads?
!
- How dare they!
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!
Nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place.
Tell me what this is all about.
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death...
Remember?
They hid.
Few knew where they were.
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.
Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night he also killed Peter Pettigrew!
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.
Never let James and Sirius out of his sight.
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters and might have, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.
He destroyed him!
A finger.
That's all that was left.
A finger.
Nothing else.
Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.
- What could be worse?
- This:
Sirius Black was and remains to this day Harry Potter's godfather!
Ron, look!
- Sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.
Harry, what happened?
He was their friend and he betrayed them.
He was their friend!
I hope he finds me.
Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!
Harry.
There you are.
You came.
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level.
I'm sure.
Well, everything's prepared.
The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm.
Did you ever hear of it?
No?
Well...
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.
But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory.
Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.
Can you do this?
Yes.
Very well.
Close your eyes.
Concentrate.
Explore your past.
Do you have a memory?
Allow it to fill you up.
Lose yourself within it.
Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum.
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.
Shall we?
Wand at the ready.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto...
Expecto...
Expect...
Here we go.
Come on.
Sit up.
Deep breaths.
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to do it the first time.
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this.
You'll feel better.
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.
As a matter of interest, what were you thinking?
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.
Well, it is.
It's the happiest I've ever felt but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?
Then let's give it a try.
You feel ready?
Just do it.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto Patronum!
Yes!
Well done, Harry.
Well done!
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes.
Sit down.
Here.
Eat this, it helps.
It really helps.
And just so you know, Harry I think you'd have given your father a run for his money.
And that is saying something.
I was thinking of him.
And Mum.
Seeing their faces.
They were talking to me.
Just talking.
That's the memory I chose.
I don't even know if it's real.
But it's the best I have.
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.
Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.
- Did.
- Didn't.
How did it go, Hagrid?
The hearing?
Well, first off, the committee members took turns talking about why we were there.
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers.
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.
He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you.
And then?
And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
Spiders!
There's...
There's spiders.
Spiders.
They want me to tap-dance.
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- Tell those spiders.
Right, yeah.
Tell them.
I'll tell them...
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!
Mischief managed.
Nox.
Potter.
What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
I was sleepwalking.
How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter.
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.
My dad didn't strut.
And nor do I.
If you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.
Turn out your pockets.
Turn out your pockets!
What's this?
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really?
Open it.
Reveal your secrets.
Read it.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and... "
Go on.
"And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business. "
- You insolent little...
- Professor!
Well, well.
Lupin.
Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?
Harry, are you all right?
That remains to be seen.
I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.
It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.
Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.
It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise.
Harry, would you come with me, please?
Professor, good night.
Are you deaf?
Put that light out!
Come in.
I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in.
Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black is a map to you?
- No.
- No, sir.
Your father never set much store by the rules either.
But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.
Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!
Now, I will not cover up for you again.
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.
I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.
Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works.
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.
Oh, really?
And who might that be?
Peter Pettigrew.
That's not possible.
It's just what I saw.
Good night, professor.
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.
The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.
Only then can you see.
Try again.
Now, what do we have here?
Do you mind me trying?
The Grim, possibly.
My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.
You may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave.
Have I said something?
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental but now it's in the open for everyone to see.
Hang on.
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.
- Fine.
See you later.
- See you.
Harry Potter...
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.
Sorry?
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder shall break free.
Innocent blood shall be spilt and servant and master shall be reunited once more.
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?
No.
Nothing.
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak.
It's just too horrible.
- It just got worse.
- What did I say?
Father said I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.
This is going to be rich.
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?
You!
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
Malfoy, are you okay?
- Let's go.
Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Look at him.
Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
Why don't we just set him free?
They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.
Says he wants to be with me when they...
When it happens.
Great man, Dumbledore.
A great man.
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!
Think I want you seeing something like that?
No.
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh.
Before you do, Ron...
Scabbers!
You're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.
Right.
Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.
I meant me!
Blimey.
What was that?
Hagrid!
Oh, crikey.
No, minister.
Over this way.
It's late.
It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.
Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble.
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!
Quick.
Quick!
Hagrid.
- It'll be fine.
It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.
- On the slope...
Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.
- Good evening.
- Minister.
Make your way through.
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.
Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we?
Very well.
It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak hereinafter called "the condemned," shall be executed this day at sundown.
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid.
Now, come on.
- All right.
It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go!
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Oh, no.
He bit me.
Scabbers.
Ron.
Ron!
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.
Wait!
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
That's not good.
Ron, run!
Harry, Hermione, run!
It's the Grim!
- Harry!
- Ron!
Ron, wait!
Harry!
- Help!
- Ron!
- Ron.
Ron.
- Ron!
Come on!
Move!
Duck!
Harry!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.
I just hope I'm wrong.
We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
Come on.
Ron.
- Ron.
You're okay.
- The dog.
Where is it?
It's a trap.
He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.
If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!
No.
Only one will die tonight.
Then it'll be you!
Are you going to kill me, Harry?
Expelliarmus!
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?
Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within.
Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you?
- I found him.
- I know.
- It's him.
- I understand.
- Let's kill him!
- No!
I trusted you!
And all this time, you've been his friend.
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.
How long have you known?
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.
You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!
Twelve years of it!
In Azkaban!
Very well.
Kill him.
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.
I know why.
You betrayed my parents.
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.
Somebody did betray your parents somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!
And he's in this room!
Right now!
Come out, come out, Peter!
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!
Vengeance is sweet.
How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
Severus...
I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle.
Here's the proof.
Brilliant, Snape.
You've put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion.
If you'll excuse us, Remus and I have business to attend to.
- Give me a reason.
I beg you!
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it.
It's habit.
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!
You two, quarrelling like an old married couple.
Run along and play with your chemistry set!
I could do it, you know.
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.
A Dementor's Kiss.
One can only imagine what that must be like.
It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.
Severus, please.
After you.
Expelliarmus!
- Harry!
What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.
We thought he was our friend!
- No.
Pettigrew's dead.
You killed him!
- No, he didn't.
I thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map!
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!
- Me?
!
He's mental!
- Not you!
Your rat!
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?
Curiously long life for a common garden rat!
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!
Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?
Scabbers!
Leave him alone!
Get off him!
What are you doing?
Remus?
Sirius.
My old friends!
Harry!
Look at you.
You look so much like your father.
- James.
We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!
How dare you talk about James in front of him!
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!
The Dark Lord.
You have no idea the weapons he possesses!
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!
James wouldn't have wanted me killed!
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!
Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would.
Together!
No!
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.
But we'll take him to the castle.
- Bless you, boy.
Bless you!
- Get off!
I said we'd take you to the castle.
After that, the dementors can have you.
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.
A bit?
A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!
I was going for the rat.
Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog.
More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent.
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.
Okay.
- You better go.
- No.
Don't worry, okay?
It's fine.
I'll stay.
You go, I'll stay.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
Go.
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.
They might chop it.
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
It's too late.
It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.
It'll be nice to do it again as a free man.
That was a noble thing you did back there.
He doesn't deserve it.
I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends to become killers.
Besides, dead, the truth dies with him.
Alive, you're free.
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!
Ron!
Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!
- Sweet, clever girl!
Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!
I don't know if you know, Harry but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather.
I know.
I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle but if you ever wanted a different home...
What?
Come and live with you?
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.
Harry!
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live!
Here!
This flesh is only flesh!
Expelliarmus!
Harry!
Remus!
Remus!
Run!
Run!
- Come on.
- Wait.
Wait.
Hermione!
Bad idea.
Bad idea.
Professor?
Professor Lupin?
Nice doggy.
Nice doggy!
There you are, Potter!
Sirius!
Come back here, Potter!
Sirius!
No.
Sirius!
Expecto Patronum!
Harry?
I saw my dad.
What?
He sent the dementors away.
I saw him across the lake.
Harry, they've captured Sirius.
Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.
- They're gonna kill him?
- No.
It's worse.
Much worse.
They're going to suck out his soul.
Headmaster, stop them.
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true.
Sirius is innocent.
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?
He's my rat, sir.
He's not really a rat.
He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.
But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.
A child's voice, however honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.
Mysterious thing, time.
Powerful and when meddled with, dangerous.
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen.
And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime.
If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss.
If you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared.
Three turns should do it, I think.
Oh, and by the way.
When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin.
Good luck.
What the bloody hell was that all about?
Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk...
What just happened?
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.
Where were we at 7:30?
I don't know.
Going to Hagrid's?
Come on.
And we can't be seen.
Hermione!
Hermione!
Hermione, wait.
Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
That's us.
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
This is not normal.
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first term.
This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.
Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.
Good punch.
Thanks.
Malfoy's coming.
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood!
Mark my words.
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Come on.
We should be at Hagrid's.
Look.
Buckbeak's still alive.
Of course.
Remember what Dumbledore said?
If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.
Let's go.
Here they come.
I'd better hurry.
Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.
Scabbers, you're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.
If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad.
Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time.
We can't be seen.
Fudge is coming.
And we aren't leaving?
Why aren't we leaving?
Are you mad?
That hurt.
Sorry.
We're coming out the back door.
Go!
Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go.
Okay, go, Harry.
Go!
Get away.
Get off.
Minister, I really think I should sign as well.
Yes, very well.
Perhaps it would be...
Okay, Buckbeak.
Come quickly.
Come with us now.
Come on.
Keep trying.
Come on.
Quickly.
Buckbeak.
Okay?
Quickly.
Hurry up.
Okay?
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.
Come and get the nice dead ferret.
- Come on.
It's here.
Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister.
Follow me.
- Now, look there.
- Where?
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?
Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
- Oh, yes.
Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.
- Come on, Buckbeak.
Come on.
- I see no strawberries.
- Over there.
- Where?
- Over there.
- This way.
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.
But where is it?
I saw the beast, just now.
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.
Buckbeak.
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.
I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.
- Right.
- Well, well.
We must search the grounds.
Well, search the skies, if you must, minister.
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy.
Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required.
Thank you.
You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor.
- Come on.
- This way.
This way, now.
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.
- How?
- No idea.
- Look.
It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!
And Snape's coming.
And now we wait.
And now we wait.
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.
- Hermione?
- Yeah?
Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius I did see someone.
That someone made the dementors go away.
With a Patronus.
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
According to him only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
It was my dad.
My dad conjured the Patronus.
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead.
I know.
I'm just telling you what I saw.
Here we come.
You see Sirius talking to me there?
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'.
It'll just be me and him.
We could live in the country someplace you can see the sky.
He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
Harry!
Run!
Let's go.
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.
Thanks.
- Great.
Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that.
Run!
That was so scary.
Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
Sirius.
Come on!
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.
Any minute now.
Right there.
You'll see.
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.
- Sirius.
- You're dying both of you.
Harry!
Expecto Patronum!
You were right, Hermione.
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!
I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.
I knew I could do it this time because well, I had already done it.
- Does that make sense?
- No.
But I don't like flying...!
Bombarda!
I'll be forever grateful for this to both of you.
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.
For some time, my life will be too unpredictable.
And besides you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.
And you know it.
And for now, that will do.
I expect you're tired of hearing this but you look so like your father.
Except your eyes.
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.
It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little.
But know this:
The ones that love us never really leave us.
And you can always find them in here.
You really are the brightest witch of your age.
We have to go.
- Well?
- He's free.
We did it.
Did what?
Good night.
How did you get there?
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.
Honestly, Ron.
How can somebody be in two places at once?
Hello, Harry.
I saw you coming.
I've looked worse, believe me.
- You've been sacked.
- No.
No.
I resigned, actually.
Resigned?
Why?
Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition.
This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want well, someone like me teaching their children.
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already risked enough on my behalf.
Besides, people like me are...
Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now.
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
None of it made any difference.
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.
You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.
It made a great deal of difference.
If I am proud of anything it is of how much you have learned this year.
Now, since I am no longer your teacher I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you.
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
Until then mischief managed.
Stand back, I said!
Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle.
Harry.
Wherever did you get it?
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.
Did not.
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.
For me?
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.
This came with it.
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.
How fast is it, Harry?
Lumos.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
Mischief managed.
Nox.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima!
Harry.
Harry.
Harry, open the door.
Marge.
How lovely to see--
Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.
What is it?
Nothing.
School stuff.
Later perhaps, if you behave.
I will if she does.
-Oh, you're still here, are you?
-Yes.
Don't say yes in that ungrateful way.
Damn good of my brother to keep you.
He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.
is that my Dudders?
is that my little neffy-pooh?
Give us a kiss.
Come on.
Up, up.
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
Okay.
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.
-Can I tempt you, Marge?
-Just a small one.
Excellent nosh, Petunia.
A bit more.
Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 1 2 dogs.
Just a bit more.
That's a boy.
You wanna try a little drop of brandy?
A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?
What are you smirking at?
Where did you send the boy, Vernon?
St. Brutus' .
It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.
Excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby...
... wishy-washynonsenseabout not beating people who deserve it.
You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out.
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.
What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?
Nothing.
He didn't work.
He was unemployed.
-And a drunk too, no doubt?
-That's a lie.
-What did you say?
-My dad wasn't a drunk.
Don't worry.
Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.
I think it's time you went to bed.
Quiet, Vernon.
You, clean it up.
Actually, it's nothing to do with the father.
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.
If something's wrong with the bitch, then something's wrong with the pup.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Right.
Let me tell you... .
Vernon!
Vernon!
Vernon, do something!
Stop!
I've got you, Marge. I've got you.
-Hold on, hold on.
-Get off.
-Don't you dare!
-Sorry.
Oh, Vernon.
Oh, God.
Marge!
Please!
Marge!
Come back!
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.
-You put her right!
-No.
She deserved what she got.
-Keep away from me.
-You can't do magic outside school.
-Yeah?
Try me.
-They won't let you back now.
You've nowhere to go.
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.
"Welcome to the Knight Bus...
... emergencytransport for the stranded witch or wizard.
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening. "
What you doing down there?
-l fell over.
-What you fall over for?
-l didn't do it on purpose.
-Well, come on, then.
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.
-What you looking at?
-Nothing.
Well, come on, then. ln.
No, no, no. I'll get this.
You get in.
Come on.
Come on.
Move on, move on.
-Take her away, Ern.
-Yeah, take it away, Ernie.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.
-What did you say your name was?
-l didn't.
-Whereabouts are you headed?
-The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London.
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London. "
The Leaky Cauldron.

No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel.

Yes!
Who is that?
That man.
Who is that?
Who is--?
That is Sirius Black, that is.
Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black.
He's a murderer.
Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.
-How did he escape?
-Well, that's the question, isn't it?
He's the first one that done it.
He was a big supporter of...
... You-Know-Who.
I reckon you've heard of him.
Yeah.
Him I've heard of.
Ernie, two double-deckers at 1 2 o'clock.
They're getting closer, Ernie.
Ernie, they're right on top of us!
Mind your head.
Hey, guys?
Guys?
Why the long faces?
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there.
Nearly there.
-The Leaky Cauldron.
-Next stop, Knockturn Alley.
Mr. Potter, at last.
-Take it away, Ern.
-Yeah, take it away, Ernie!
Room 1 1 .
Hedwig.
Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter.
He arrived here just five minutes before yourself.
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter...
... earlierthisevening your uncle's sister was located...
... alittlesouthofSheffield, circling a chimney stack.
The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately.
She has been properly punctured and her memory modified.
She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.
So that's that...
... andnoharmdone.
Pea soup?
No, thank you.
-Minister?
-Yes?
-l don't understand.
-Understand?
I broke the law.
Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
Come now.
The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban...
... forblowingup theiraunts.
On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things...
... wasvery,veryirresponsible.
-"The state of things," sir?
-We have a killer on the loose.
Sirius Black, you mean?
But what's he got to do with me?
Nothing, of course.
You're safe.
And that's what matters.
And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty...
... ofhavingthembroughthere .
Now Tom will show you to your room.
Hedwig.
Oh, by the way, Harry.
Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't...
... wander.
Right!
You gonna move that bus or what?
Housekeeping.
I'll come back later.
I'm warning you, Hermione.
Keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?
-lt's in his nature.
-A cat?
is that what they told you?
-Looks like a pig with hair.
-That's rich...
Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.
Harry.
Harry.
-Egypt.
What's it like?
-Brilliant.
Loads of old stuff...
... likemummies,tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
-Egyptians used to worship cats.
-Along with the dung beetle.
-Not flashing that clipping again?
-l haven't shown anyone.
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.
-The day maid.
-Night maid.
-Cook.
-The bloke who fixed the toilet.
-Harry.
-Mrs.
Weasley.
-Good to see you, dear.
-Good to see you.
-Got everything?
-Yes.
-Yes?
All your books?
-lt's all upstairs.
-Your clothes?
-Everything.
-Good boy.
-Thank you.
-Harry Potter.
-Mr.
Weasley.
-Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
-Yeah, sure.
-Hermione.
-Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
-Looking forward to a new term?
-Yeah. lt should be great.
Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me...
... fromdivulgingwhatI'm about to reveal to you.
But I think that you need to know the facts.
You are in danger.
Grave danger.
Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?
What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?
-Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
-Do you know why?
Thirteen years ago, when you stopped... .
-Voldemort.
-Don't say his name.
Sorry.
When you stopped You-Know-Who...
... Blacklosteverything.
But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant.
And in his mind...
... youaretheonlything that stands in the way...
... ofYou-Know-Who returning to power.
And that is why...
... hehasescapedfromAzkaban.
To find you.
And kill me.
Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear...
... youwon'tgo lookingfor Black.
Mr. Weasley...
... whywouldIgolooking for someone who wants to kill me?
Quick.
Quick.
Ron, Ron!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Don't lose him!
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just- l lost control.
-Brilliant.
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
I was lucky not to be arrested.
I still think it was brilliant.
Come on.
Everywhere else is full.
Who do you think that is?
-Professor R.J. Lupin.
-Do you know everything?
How is it she knows everything?
-lt's on his suitcase, Ronald.
-Oh.
-Do you think he's really asleep?
-Seems to be.
Why?
I gotta tell you something.
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...
-... tocomeafteryou ?
-Yeah.
But they'll catch Black, won't they?
-l mean, everyone's looking for him.
-Sure.
Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before...
-... andhe'samurderous,ravinglunatic.
-Thanks, Ron.
Why are we stopping?
We can't be there yet.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.
Ouch, Ron.
That was my foot.
There's something moving out there.
I think someone's coming aboard.
Bloody hell!
What's happening?
Harry.
Harry, are you all right?
Thank you.
Here, eat this. lt'll help.
It's all right. lt's chocolate.
What was that thing that came?
It was a dementor.
One of the guards of Azkaban. lt's gone now.
It was searching the train for Sirius Black.
If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver.
Eat.
You'll feel better.
What happened to me?
Well, you sort of went rigid.
We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
And did either of you two...
... youknow...
-... passout?
-No.
I felt weird, though.
Like I'd never be cheerful again.
But someone was screaming.
A woman.
No one was screaming, Harry.
Welcome!
Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.
Now, I'd like to say a few words...
... beforeweallbecometoobefuddled by our excellent feast.
First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin...
... who'skindlyconsented to fill the post...
... ofDefenseAgainst the Dark Arts teacher.
Good luck, professor.
Of course.
That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.
Potter. ls it true you fainted?
-l mean, you actually fainted?
-Shove off, Malfoy.
-How did he find out?
-Just forget it.
Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher...
... hasdecidedto retire...
... inorderto spendmoretime with his remaining limbs.
Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce...
... thathisplacewillbetaken by none other...
... thanourownRubeusHagrid.
Finally, on a more disquieting note...
... attherequest of the Ministry of Magic...
... Hogwartswill,untilfurthernotice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban...
... untilsuchatime as Sirius Black is captured.
The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
Now whilst I've been assured...
... thattheirpresencewillnotdisrupt our day-to-day activities...
... awordof caution.
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish...
... betweentheonetheyhunt and the one who gets in their way.
Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you...
... togivethemnoreason to harm you.
It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
But you know, happiness can be found...
... eveninthedarkestoftimes ...
... ifoneonlyremembers to turn on the light.
Fortuna Major.
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.
-Fortuna Major.
-No, no.
Wait, wait.
Watch this.
-Amazing.
Just with my voice.
-Fortuna Major.
-Yes, all right.
Go in.
-Thank you.
Still doing that after three years.
-She can't even sing.
-Exactly.
-Hey, man.
-Hey, man.
-Oh, God.
-That's awful.
Green.
That's a monkey.
-What is that?
-You call that a monkey?
Do not give him one again.
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
-Ron, catch.
-l will.
I think we have a winner.
-Oh, don't try one of them.
-Oh, no.
Look at him.
His face.
Welcome, my children.
In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination.
In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight.
Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.
Together we shall cast ourselves into the future.
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves.
So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you.
What do you see?
The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read.
But first, you must broaden your minds.
-First, you must look beyond.
-What a load of rubbish.
-Where did you come from?
-Me?
-l've been here all this time.
-You, boy... .
is your grandmother quite well?
I think so.
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.
Pity.
Broaden your minds.
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?
-l think you are.
-Sure.
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.
Yeah.
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.
And that there could be the sun and that's happiness.
So...
... you'regonnasuffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.
Give me the cup.
Oh, my dear boy.
My dear...
... youhavetheGrim.
The Grin?
What's the Grin?
Not the Grin, you idiot.
The Grim.
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.
It's among the darkest omens in our world.
It's an omen...
... ofdeath."
You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Oh, honestly, Ron. lf you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline.
Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.
Ancient Runes?
Exactly how many classes are you taking?
A fair few.
Hang on.
That's not possible.
Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.
You have to be in two classes at once.
Don't be silly.
How could anyone be in two classes at once?
"Broaden your minds.
Use your inner Eye to see the future. "
That's it.
Come on, now.
Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.
I got a real treat for you today.
A great lesson.
So follow me.
Right, you lot.
Less chattering.
Form a group over there.
And open your books to page 49.
Exactly how do we do that?
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.
-Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
-l'm okay.
Okay.
-l think they're funny.
-Oh, yeah.
Terribly funny.
Witty.
God, this place has gone to the dogs.
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.
Shut up, Malfoy.
Dementor!
Dementor!
-Just ignore him.
-You're supposed to stroke it.
Yeah.
Isn't he beautiful?
Say hello to Buckbeak.
Hagrid, exactly what is that?
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.
First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
It may be the last thing you ever do.
Now, who'd like to come and say hello?
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Come on now.
Now...
... youhaveto lethim makethefirst move. lt's only polite.
So...
... stepup.
Givehim anice bow.
Then you wait and see if he bows back.
If he does, you can go and touch him.
If not-
- Well, we'll get to that later.
Just make your bow.
Nice and low.
Back off, Harry.
Back off.
Keep still.
Keep still.
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.
Right. I think you can go and pat him now.
Go on.
Don't be shy.
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow.
Slow.
Not so fast, Harry.
Slow down, Harry.
That's it... .
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly... .
That's it... .
Yes!
Well done!
Well done, Harry, well done!
Does he get to fly?
-l think he may let you ride him now.
-What?
-Come on.
-Hey, hey, hey!
Put you over here, just behind the wing joint.
Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that.
Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak.
That was wicked, Harry!
Oh, please.
Well done, well done.
-How am I doing me first day?
-Brilliant, professor.
You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!
Malfoy, no... .
No!
Buckbeak!
Whoa, whoa, whoa... .
Whoa!
Buckbeak!
Away, you silly creature... .
-lt's killed me!
-Calm down. lt's just a scratch!
Hagrid!
-He has to be taken to the hospital.
-l'm the teacher. I'll do it.
-You're gonna regret this.
-Class dismissed!
You and your bloody chicken!
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.
Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm.
-l can't do homework for weeks.
-Listen to the idiot.
-He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
-At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.
-He's been sighted!
-Who?
Sirius Black!
Dufftown?
That's not far from here.
You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?
-With dementors at every entrance?
-Dementors?
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?
That's right.
Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.
Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
lntriguing, isn't it?
Would anyone like to venture a guess...
... astowhatisinside?
-That's a boggart, that is.
-Very good, Mr. Thomas.
Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
-No one knows.
-When did she get here?
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.
-That's what makes them so--
-So terrifying, yes, yes, yes... .
Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart.
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.
After me.
Riddikulus!
-Riddikulus!
-Very good.
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:
-Riddikulus!
-Riddikulus!
-This class is ridiculous.
-Very good.
So much for the easy part.
You see, the incantation alone is not enough.
What really finishes a boggart is laughter.
You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.
Let me explain.
Neville, would you join me, please?
Come on, don't be shy.
Come on.
Come on.
Hello.
Neville, what frightens you most of all?
Professor Snape.
-Sorry?
-Professor Snape.
Professor Snape.
Yes, frightens all.
-You live with your grandmother.
-l don't want it to turn into her, either.
No...
... itwon't.Iwantyou to picture her clothes.
Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.
-She carries a red handbag--
-We don't need to hear.
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe...
... here'swhatIwant you to do.
Excuse me.
Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.
Can you do that?
Yes.
Wand at the ready.
One, two, three.
Think, Neville, think.
Riddikulus!
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible!
Okay...
... totheback,Neville.
Everyone, form a line... .
Form a line!
I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most...
... andturnit intosomethingfunny.
Next!
Ron!
Concentrate.
Face your fear.
Be brave!
Wand at the ready, Ron.
Riddikulus!
Yes!
You see?
Very good, very good!
Marvelous!
Absolutely, very, very enjoyable!
Parvati!
Next!
Show us what you see.
Keep your nerve.
Steady.
Riddikulus!
And next!
Step up, step up!
Wonderful, wonderful!
Here!
Riddikulus!
Right.
Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.
Collect your books from the back.
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you!
Sorry!
Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege.
Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school...
... thatprivilegeshallnot be extended again.
No permission form signed, no visiting the village.
That's the rule, Potter.
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.
I thought if you signed it, then I could-- l can't.
Only a parent or a guardian can sign.
Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate.
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.
Forget about it, guys.
See you later.
Professor, can I ask you something?
You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?
I thought it'd be obvious.
I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.
I did think of Voldemort at first.
But then I remembered that night on the train...
-... andthedementor.
-l'm very impressed.
That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.
This is very wise.
Before I fainted...
... Iheardsomething.
A woman...
... screaming.
Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.
Our pain becomes their power.
I think it was my mother...
... thenightshewas murdered.
The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.
Not by your scar, by your eyes.
They're your mother, Lily's.
Yes.
Oh, yes. I knew her.
Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.
Not only was she a singularly gifted witch...
... shewasalso an uncommonly kind woman.
She had a way of seeing the beauty in others...
... even,andmostespecially,when that person could not see it in themselves.
And your father, James, on the other hand...
... he....
He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble.
A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.
You're more like them than you know, Harry.
In time, you'll come to see just how much.
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.
-You heard it's the most--
-Haunted building in Britain. I know.
What's going on?
Probably Neville forgot the password again.
-Hey.
-Oh, you're there.
Let me through, please.
Excuse me!
I'm Head Boy!
Get back, all of you.
No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.
The Fat Lady!
She's gone!
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.
It's not funny, Ron.
Keep calm, everyone.
Break into fours.
Back to your common room.
-Be quiet.
-Make way.
-The headmaster's here.
-Come on, move.
You heard.
Move!
Mr. Filch?
Round up the ghosts.
Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
There's no need for ghosts, professor.
The Fat Lady's there.
Mind where you're going!
Slow down!
You listen!
I'm Head Boy!
-Come back here!
-Keep moving!
Dear lady, who did this to you?
Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.
He's here, somewhere in the castle!
Sirius Black!
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery.
There's nothing there.
-Thank you.
-The third floor's clear too, sir.
-Very good.
-l've done the dungeons.
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.
I didn't really expect him to linger.
Remarkable feat, don't you think?
To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own...
Any theories on how he managed it?
Many.
Each as unlikely as the next.
You may recall...
... priortothestartofterm I expressed concerns...
... aboutyourappointment of Professor--
Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe...
... andI 'mmorethanwillingtosend the students to their houses.
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?
Perhaps.
But for now, let him sleep.
For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.
Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
Turn to page 394.
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?
That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?
Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching...
... atthepresenttime.
Turn to page 394.
"Werewolves"?
Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.
-We're not meant to start that for weeks.
-Quiet.
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?
Now, which one of you can tell me the difference...
... betweenanAnimagus and a werewolf?
No one?
-How disappointing.
-Please, sir.
An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
A werewolf has no choice.
With each full moon...
... henolongerrememberswhoheis.
He'd kill his best friend.
The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time...
... you'vespokenoutofturn , Miss Granger.
Are you incapable of restraining yourself...
... ordoyoutakepride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
-He's got a point, you know.
-Five points from Gryffindor.
As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning...
... tworollsof parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis...
-... onrecognizingit .
-lt's Quidditch tomorrow.
Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter.
Loss of limb will not excuse you.
Page 394.
The term "werewolf" ...
... isa contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word " wer" ...
... whichmeans"man,"and "wolf." Werewolf, man-wolf.
There are several ways to become a werewolf.
They include being given the power of shape-shifting...
... beingbittenby awerewolf....
Go, Harry!
Go, Harry!
Aresto momentum!
-He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
-Peaky?
What do you expect?
He fell over 1 00 feet.
Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.
Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
-How are you feeling?
-Oh, brilliant.
You gave us a right good scare.
-What happened?
-Well, you fell off your broom.
Really?
I meant the match.
Who won?
No one blames you, Harry.
Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds.
Dumbledore's furious.
After he saved you, he sent them off.
There's something else you should know too.
When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and... .
Well... .
I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.
is there no chance of fixing it?
No.
Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?
-l mean, more than everyone else?
-Listen.
Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.
They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory...
... untila personis leftwithabsolutely nothing but his worst experiences.
You are not weak, Harry.
Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.
Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
-l'm scared, professor.
-l'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.
You made the one on the train go away.
There was only one that night.
-But you made it go away.
-l don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.
But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you...
... perhapsI shouldteachyou .
But after the holidays.
For now, I need to rest.
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!
-Guys, let me go.
-Clever, Harry.
-But not clever enough.
-We've got a better way.
-l'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
-We know.
We'll get you there.
-We'll show you a quicker way.
-lf you pipe down.
-Bless him.
-Let me go!
Come on, guys.
Don't--
-Now, Harry.
-Come and join the big boys.
What are you doing?
!
-What's this rubbish?
-"What's this rubbish?" he says.
-lt's the secret to our success.
-lt's a wrench giving it to you--
But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
George, if you will.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs...
... areproudto present the Marauder's Map. "
We owe them so much.
Hang on.
This is Hogwarts.
And that--
-No. ls that really--?
-Dumbledore.
-ln his study.
-Pacing.
Does that a lot.
-So this map shows--
-Everyone.
-Where they are.
-What they're doing.
-Every minute.
-Every day.
-Brilliant!
Where did you get it?
-From Filch's office.
-First year.
-There are seven secret passageways...
-... outofthecastle.
-We'd recommend this one.
-The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
-Leads you to Honeyduke's.
Hurry.
Filch is heading this way.
And don't forget.
When you're done, just give it a tap and say:
"Mischief managed. " Otherwise, anyone can read it.
Now, how much do you want?
Delicious.
It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain.
Did I mention that?
Twice.
Do you want to move a bit closer?
To the Shrieking Shack?
Actually, I'm fine here.
Well, well.
Look who's here.
You two shopping for your new dream home?
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?
-Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
-Not very friendly.
Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
-Hope you don't mean yourself.
-How dare you talk to me!
You filthy little mudblood!
Who is that?
-Don't stand there!
Do something!
-What?
What's up, Malfoy?
Lost your skis?
Get out of the way!
Move!
Malfoy!
Wait!
Wait!
Harry!
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.
Those weasels!
Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
He won't keep it.
He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.
-Aren't you?
-Sure.
Along with his invisibility Cloak.
Look who it is.
Madam Rosmerta.
-Ron fancies her.
-That's not true!
-Professor McGonagall!
-Cornelius!
Allow me, minister.
-Oh, Hagrid... .
-Sorry about that.
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors...
-... intomypubeveryothernight !
-We have... .
-We have a killer on the loose.
-Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
And what would bring him here?
-Harry Potter.
-Harry Potter?
Come.
Harry!
-No underage wizards allowed in today!
-Shut the damn door!
-So rude.
-Thick heads.
-Thick heads?
!
-How dare they!
-Who are they calling thick heads?
-Young whippersnappers!
Nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place.
Tell me what this is all about.
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death--
Remember?
They hid.
Few knew where they were.
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.
Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night...
... healsokilledPeterPettigrew!
-Peter Pettigrew?
-Little lump of a boy.
-Always trailing after Black.
-l remember.
Never let James and Sirius out of his sight.
-What happened?
-Peter tried to warn the Potters...
... andmighthave,had henot run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.
He destroyed him!
A finger.
That's all that was left.
A finger.
Nothing else.
Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters...
-... buthe'sthereasonthey 'redead .
-He wants to finish things.
-l don't believe it.
-That's not the worst of it.
-What could be worse?
-This:
Sirius Black was...
... andremainsto thisday ...
... HarryPotter'sgodfather!
Ron, look!
-Sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me.
-Merry Christmas.
Harry, what happened?
He was their friend...
... andhebetrayedthem.
He was their friend!
I hope he finds me.
Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!
Harry.
There you are.
You came.
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic...
... wellbeyondtheOrdinary Wizarding Level.
I'm sure.
Well, everything's prepared.
The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm.
Did you ever hear of it?
No?
Well... .
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one...
... itworkslikeashield,withthe dementor feeding on it rather than him.
But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory.
Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.
Can you do this?
Yes.
Very well.
Close your eyes.
Concentrate.
Explore your past.
Do you have a memory?
Allow it to fill you up.
Lose yourself within it.
Then speak the incantation, Extecto Patronum.
-Extecto Patronum.
-Very good.
Shall we?
Wand at the ready.
Extecto Patronum!
Extecto....
Extecto....
Extect....
Here we go.
Come on.
Sit up.
Deep breaths.
It's all right. I didn't expect you to do it the first time.
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this.
You'll feel better.
-That's one nasty dementor.
-Oh, no, no, no.
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.
As a matter of interest, what were you thinking?
-Which memory did you choose?
-The first time I rode a broom.
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.
Well, it is.
It's the happiest I've ever felt...
-... butit'scomplicated.
-ls it strong?
Then let's give it a try.
You feel ready?
Just do it.
Extecto Patronum!
Extecto Patronum!
Yes!
Well done, Harry.
Well done!
-l think I've had enough for today.
-Yes.
Sit down.
Here.
Eat this, it helps. lt really helps.
And just so you know, Harry...
... Ithinkyou'dhavegivenyourfather a run for his money.
And that...
... issayingsomething.
I was thinking of him.
And Mum.
Seeing their faces.
They were talking to me.
Just talking.
That's the memory I chose.
I don't even know if it's real.
But it's the best I have.
-Beautiful day.
-Gorgeous.
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?
-Ronald has lost his rat.
-l haven't lost anything!
-Your cat killed him!
-Rubbish.
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers...
... isalwayslurkingabout.
And Scabbers is gone.
Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!
-Your cat killed him!
-Did not.
-Did.
-Didn't.
How did it go, Hagrid?
The hearing?
Well, first off, the committee members took turns...
... talkingaboutwhywewere there.
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak...
... wasa goodhippogriff, always cleaned his feathers.
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.
He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature...
... whowouldkillyou as soon as look at you.
And then?
And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.
-They're not sacking you!
-No, I'm not sacked.
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
Spiders!
There's-
- There's spiders.
Spiders.
They want me to tap-dance.
-l don't wanna tap-dance!
-Tell those spiders.
Right, yeah.
Tell them. I'll tell them... .
-Peter Pettigrew?
-Little lumt of a boy.
-Always trailing after Sirius Black.
-Black was vicious.
He didn 't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!
-Put that light out!
-Sorry.
-Watch it there, boy.
-We're trying to sleep here!
Mischief managed.
Nox.
Potter.
What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
I was sleepwalking.
How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter.
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.
My dad didn't strut.
And nor do I.
If you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.
Turn out your pockets.
Turn out your pockets!
What's this?
-Spare bit of parchment.
-Really?
Open it.
Reveal your secrets.
Read it.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs...
... offertheircompliments to Professor Snape and... . "
Go on.
"And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business. "
-You insolent little--
-Professor!
Well, well.
Lupin.
Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?
Harry, are you all right?
That remains to be seen.
I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.
-Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
-l seriously doubt it, Severus.
It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone...
... whotriesto readit.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.
Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.
It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise.
Harry, would you come with me, please?
Professor, good night.
Are you deaf?
Put that light out!
Come in.
I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession...
... butquitefrankly,Iam astounded that you didn't hand it in.
Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black...
... isa mapto you?
-No.
-No, sir.
Your father never set much store by the rules either.
But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.
Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected...
... witha killeron theloose seems to me a poor way to repay them!
Now, I will not cover up for you again.
-Do you hear me?
-Yes, sir.
I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.
Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works.
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.
Oh, really?
And who might that be?
Peter Pettigrew.
That's not possible.
It's just what I saw.
Good night, professor.
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.
The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the inner Eye.
Only then can you see.
Try again.
Now, what do we have here?
Do you mind me trying?
The Grim, possibly.
My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class...
... Isensedthatyou did not possess the proper spirit...
... forthenobleart ofDivination.
No, you see, there.
You may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled...
... asanoldmaid's,your soul as dry as the pages of the books...
... towhichyousodesperatelycleave.
Have I said something?
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental...
... butnowit 'sin theopen for everyone to see.
Hang on.
-We better take this back.
-l'm not going back.
-Fine.
See you later.
-See you.
Harry Potter....
-Professor Trelawney--
-He will return tonight.
Sorry?
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder...
... shallbreakfree.
Innocent blood shall be spilt...
... andservantandmaster shall be reunited once more.
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?
No.
Nothing.
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. lt's just too horrible.
-lt just got worse.
-What did I say?
Father said...
... Icankeepthe hippogriff'shead .
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.
This is going to be rich.
-Look who's here.
-Come to see the show?
You!
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
Malfoy, are you okay?
-Let's go.
Quick.
-Not a word to anyone, understood?
-That felt good.
-Not good, brilliant.
Look at him.
Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
Why don't we just set him free?
They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore...
... wouldgetintotrouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.
Says he wants to be with me when they... .
When it happens.
Great man, Dumbledore.
A great man.
-We'll stay with you too.
-You'll do no such thing!
Think I want you seeing something like that?
No.
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh.
Before you do, Ron... .
Scabbers!
You're alive!
-Keep a closer eye on your pet.
-l think you owe someone an apology.
Right.
Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.
I meant me!
Blimey.
What was that?
Hagrid!
Oh, crikey.
No, minister.
Over this way.
It's late. lt's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.
Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble.
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!
Quick.
Quick!
Hagrid.
-lt'll be fine. lt'll be okay.
-Go on, go on!
-That's ling you see over there--
-On the slope.
-On the slope-
- Ah, Hagrid.
-Professor Dumbledore.
-Good evening.
-Minister.
Make your way through.
-Have a tea, if you like.
-No, Hagrid.
-Gentlemen.
-l'd like a cup of tea.
Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we?
Very well. lt is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal...
... ofDangerousCreatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak...
... hereinaftercalled"thecondemned," shall be executed this day at sundown.
-Dear, dear... .
-Now, now, Hagrid.
Now, come on.
-All right. lt'll be all right.
-The execution shall dispatch--
What?
I thought I just saw--
-Never mind.
-Let's go!
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Oh, no.
He bit me.
Scabbers.
Ron.
Ron!
-Ron!
-Scabbers, come back.
Wait!
-Scabbers, you bit me!
-Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
That's not good.
Ron, run!
Harry, Hermione, run!
It's the Grim!
-Harry!
-Ron!
Ron, wait!
Harry!
-Help!
-Ron!
-Ron.
Ron.
-Ron!
Come on!
Move!
Duck!
Harry!
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Don't worry.
-Where do you suppose this goes?
-l have a hunch.
I just hope I'm wrong.
We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
Come on.
Ron.
-Ron.
You're okay.
-The dog.
Where is it?
It's a trap.
He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.
If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!
No.
Only one will die tonight.
Then it'll be you!
Are you going to kill me, Harry?
Extelliarmus!
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?
Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within.
Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you?
-l found him.
-l know.
-lt's him.
-l understand.
-Let's kill him!
-No!
I trusted you!
And all this time, you've been his friend.
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.
How long have you known?
-Since Professor Snape set the essay.
-Well, Hermione.
You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!
-Wait!
-l did my waiting!
Twelve years of it!
In Azkaban!
Very well.
Kill him.
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.
I know why.
You betrayed my parents.
-You're the reason they're dead!
-No, it wasn't him.
Somebody did betray your parents...
... somebodywho,untilquiterecently, I believed to be dead!
-Who was it, then?
-Peter Pettigrew!
And he's in this room!
Right now!
Come out, come out, Peter!
-Come out, come out and play!
-Extelliarmus!
Vengeance is sweet.
How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
Severus-- l told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle.
Here's the proof.
Brilliant, Snape.
You've put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion.
If you'll excuse us, Remus and I have business...
-... toattendto .
-Give me a reason. I beg you!
-Don't be a fool.
-He can't help it. lt's habit.
-Be quiet.
-Be quiet yourself!
You two, quarrelling like an old married couple.
Run along and play with your chemistry set!
I could do it, you know.
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.
A Dementor's Kiss.
One can only imagine what that must be like.
It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.
Severus, please.
After you.
Extelliarmus!
-Harry!
What did you just do?
-You attacked a teacher!
-Tell me about Peter.
-He was at school with us.
We thought he was our friend!
-No.
Pettigrew's dead.
You killed him!
-No, he didn't.
I thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map!
-The map was lying, then.
-The map never lies!
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!
-Me?
!
He's mental!
-Not you!
Your rat!
-Scabbers has been in my family for--
-Twelve years?
Curiously long life for a common garden rat!
-He's missing a toe, isn't he?
-So what?
-All they could find of Pettigrew was his--
-Finger!
Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!
-And then he transformed into a rat!
-Show me.
-Give it to him, Ron.
-What are you trying to do to him?
Scabbers!
Leave him alone!
Get off him!
What are you doing?
Remus?
Sirius.
My old friends!
Harry!
Look at you.
You look so much like your father.
-James.
We were the best of friends--
-How dare you speak to Harry!
How dare you talk about James in front of him!
-You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
-l didn't mean to!
The Dark Lord.
You have no idea the weapons he possesses!
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?
-What would you have done?
-Died, rather than betray my friends!
James wouldn't have wanted me killed!
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!
Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would.
Together!
No!
-Harry, this man-- -l know what he is.
But we'll take him to the castle.
-Bless you, boy.
Bless you!
-Get off!
I said we'd take you to the castle.
After that, the dementors can have you.
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.
A bit?
A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!
I was going for the rat.
Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog.
More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent.
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.
Okay.
-You better go.
-No.
Don't worry, okay?
It's fine. I'll stay.
You go, I'll stay.
-You okay?
-l'm fine.
Go.
-That looks really painful.
-So painful.
They might chop it.
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
It's too late. lt's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.
It'll be nice to do it again as a free man.
That was a noble thing you did back there.
He doesn't deserve it.
I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends...
... tobecomekillers.
Besides, dead, the truth dies with him.
Alive, you're free.
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!
Ron!
Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me...
... tothedementors,willyou?
I was your rat!
-Sweet, clever girl!
Surely you won't--
-Get away from her!
I don't know if you know, Harry...
... butwhenyouwereborn ,James and Lily made me your godfather.
I know.
I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle...
... butifyoueverwanted a different home... .
What?
Come and live with you?
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.
Harry!
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live!
Here!
This flesh is only flesh!
Extelliarmus!
Harry!
Remus!
Remus!
Run!
Run!
-Come on.
-Wait.
Wait.
Hermione!
Bad idea.
Bad idea.
Professor?
Professor Lupin?
Nice doggy.
Nice doggy!
There you are, Potter!
Sirius!
Come back here, Potter!
Sirius!
No.
Sirius!
Extecto Patronum!
Harry?
I saw my dad.
What?
He sent the dementors away.
I saw him across the lake.
Harry, they've captured Sirius.
Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.
-They're gonna kill him?
-No. lt's worse.
Much worse.
They're going to suck out his soul.
Headmaster, stop them.
-They've got the wrong man.
-lt's true.
Sirius is innocent.
-lt's Scabbers who did it.
-Scabbers?
He's my rat, sir.
He's not really a rat.
He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.
-But then they gave him an owl--
-The point is, we know the truth.
-Please believe us.
-l do, Miss Granger.
But the word of three 1 3-year-old wizards will convince few others.
A child's voice, however honest and true...
... ismeaninglessto those who have forgotten how to listen.
Mysterious thing, time.
Powerful...
... andwhenmeddledwith, dangerous.
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen.
And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime.
If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss.
If you succeed tonight...
... morethanoneinnocentlife may be spared.
Three turns should do it, I think.
Oh, and by the way.
When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin.
Good luck.
What the bloody hell was that all about?
Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk... .
What just happened?
-Where's Ron?
-7:30.
Where were we at 7:30?
I don't know.
Going to Hagrid's?
Come on.
And we can't be seen.
Hermione!
Hermione!
Hermione, wait.
Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
That's us.
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
This is not normal.
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first term.
This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
-You mean we've gone back in time?
-Yes.
Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.
Good punch.
Thanks.
Malfoy's coming.
-Run.
-Not a word to anyone, understood?
I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood!
Mark my words.
-That felt good.
-Not good, brilliant.
Come on.
We should be at Hagrid's.
Look.
Buckbeak's still alive.
Of course.
Remember what Dumbledore said?
If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.
Let's go.
Here they come. I'd better hurry.
Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.
Scabbers, you're alive!
-Keep a closer eye on your pet.
-That's Pettigrew.
-Harry, you can't.
-He betrayed my parents.
-You don't expect me to sit here.
-Yes, and you must!
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.
If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad.
Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time.
We can't be seen.
Fudge is coming.
And we aren't leaving?
Why aren't we leaving?
Are you mad?
That hurt.
Sorry.
We're coming out the back door.
Go!
is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
What?
I thought I just saw... .
-Never mind.
-Let's go.
Okay, go, Harry.
Go!
Get away.
Get off.
Minister, I really think I should sign as well.
Yes, very well.
Perhaps it would be... .
Okay, Buckbeak.
Come quickly.
Come with us now.
Come on.
Keep trying.
Come on.
Quickly.
Buckbeak.
Okay?
Quickly.
Hurry up.
Okay?
-Your name only.
-lt's such a very long name... .
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.
Come and get the nice dead ferret.
-Come on. lt's here.
Come on, Beaky.
-Here we are, minister.
Follow me.
-Now, look there.
-Where?
-Look beyond the rocks.
-What am I supposed to see?
Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
-Oh, yes. indeed, indeed.
-And all the strawberries.
-Come on, Buckbeak.
Come on.
-l see no strawberries.
-Over there.
-Where?
-Over there.
-This way.
-Let's get this over, please.
-All right.
But where is it?
I saw the beast, just now.
-Not a moment ago!
-How extraordinary.
Buckbeak.
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.
-Hagrid?
-Buckbeak.
I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.
-Right.
-Well, well.
We must search the grounds.
Well, search the skies, if you must, minister.
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy.
Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required.
Thank you.
You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor.
-Come on.
-This way.
This way, now.
-Now what?
-We save Sirius.
-How?
-No idea.
-Look. it's Lupin.
-Immobulus!
And Snape's coming.
And now we wait.
And now we wait.
-At least someone's enjoying himself.
-Yeah.
-Hermione?
-Yeah?
Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius...
... Ididseesomeone.
That someone made the dementors go away.
With a Patronus.
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
According to him...
... onlya reallypowerfulwizard could have conjured it.
It was my dad.
My dad conjured the Patronus.
-Harry, but your dad's--
-Dead. I know.
I'm just telling you what I saw.
Here we come.
You see Sirius talking to me there?
-He's asking me to come live with him.
-That's great.
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys' .
It'll just be me and him.
We could live in the country...
... someplaceyoucansee the sky .
He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
Harry!
Run!
Let's go.
-What are you doing?
-Saving your life.
Thanks.
-Great.
Now he's coming for us.
-Yeah, I didn't think about that.
Run!
That was so scary.
Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
Sirius.
Come on!
-This is horrible.
-Don't worry.
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.
Any minute now.
Right there.
You'll see.
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.
-Sirius.
-You're dying...
... bothofyou.
Harry!
Extecto Patronum!
You were right, Hermione.
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!
I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.
I knew I could do it this time because...
... well,I hadalreadydoneit.
-Does that make sense?
-No.
But I don't like flying... !
Bombarda!
I'll be forever grateful for this...
... tobothof you.
-l want to go with you.
-One day, perhaps.
For some time, my life will be too unpredictable.
And besides...
-... you'remeantto be here.
-But you're innocent.
And you know it.
And for now, that will do.
I expect you're tired of hearing this...
... butyoulooksolike your father.
Except your eyes.
-You have--
-My mother's eyes.
It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little.
But know this:
The ones that love us never really leave us.
And you can always find them...
... inhere.
You really are the brightest witch of your age.
We have to go.
-Well?
-He's free.
We did it.
Did what?
Good night.
How did you get there?
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.
-What's he talking about, Harry?
-l don't know.
Honestly, Ron.
How can somebody be in two places at once?
Hello, Harry.
I saw you coming.
I've looked worse, believe me.
-You've been sacked.
-No.
No. I resigned, actually.
Resigned?
Why?
Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition.
This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want...
... well,someonelikeme teaching their children.
-But Dumbledore--
-He has already...
... riskedenoughon my behalf.
Besides, people like me are... .
Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now.
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
None of it made any difference.
-Pettigrew escaped.
-Didn't make any difference?
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.
You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.
It made a great deal of difference.
If I am proud of anything...
... itisof howmuch you have learned this year.
Now, since I am no longer your teacher...
... Ifeelno guiltwhatsoever about giving this back to you.
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
Until then...
... mischiefmanaged.
Stand back, I said!
Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle.
Harry.
Wherever did you get it?
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.
-What are you talking about?
-Quiet.
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.
Did not.
-lt's a Firebolt.
-lt's the fastest broom in the world.
For me?
-But who sent it?
-No one knows.
This came with it.
-Go on, Harry!
-Yeah, let's see.
How fast is it, Harry?
Lumos.
I solemnly swear that I am ut to no good.
Mischief managed.
Nox.

Harry, open the door.
Marge.
How lovely to see...
Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.
What is it?
Nothing.
School stuff.
Later perhaps, if you behave.
I will if she does.
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.
Don't say yes in that ungrateful way.
Damn good of my brother to keep you.
He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?
Give us a kiss.
Come on.
Up, up.
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
Okay.
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.
Excellent nosh, Petunia.
A bit more.
Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs.
Just a bit more.
That's a boy.
You wanna try a little drop of brandy?
A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?
What are you smirking at?
Where did you send the boy, Vernon?
St. Brutus'.
It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I've been beaten loads of times.
Excellent.
I won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it.
You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out.
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.
What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?
Nothing.
He didn't work.
He was unemployed.
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.
Don't worry.
Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.
I think it's time you went to bed.
Quiet, Vernon.
You, clean it up.
Actually, it's nothing to do with the father.
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.
If something's wrong with the bitch, then something's wrong with the pup.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Right.
Let me tell you...
Vernon!
Vernon!
Vernon, do something!
Stop!
I've got you, Marge.
I've got you.
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.
Oh, Vernon.
Oh, God.
Marge!
Please!
Marge!
Come back!
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.
- You put her right!
- No.
She deserved what she got.
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.
- Yeah?
Try me.
- They won't let you back now.
You've nowhere to go.
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.
"Welcome to the Knight Bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard.
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening."
What you doing down there?
- I fell over.
- What you fall over for?
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.
Well, come on, then.
In.
No, no, no.
I'll get this.
You get in.
Come on.
Come on.
Move on, move on.
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London.
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup make sure you eat it before it eats you.
- But the Muggles.
Can't they see us?
- Muggles?
They don't see nothing, do they?
No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel.
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!
Ten, nine, eight seven, six, five four, three, three and a half two, one and three quarters.
Yes!
Who is that?
That man.
Who is that?
Who is...?
That is Sirius Black, that is.
Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black.
He's a murderer.
Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?
He's the first one that done it.
He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.
I reckon you've heard of him.
Yeah.
Him I've heard of.
Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock.
They're getting closer, Ernie.
Ernie, they're right on top of us!
Mind your head.
Hey, guys?
Guys?
Why the long faces?
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there.
Nearly there.
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.
Mr. Potter, at last.
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!
Room 11.
Hedwig.
Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter.
He arrived here just five minutes before yourself.
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack.
The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately.
She has been properly punctured and her memory modified.
She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.
So that's that and no harm done.
Pea soup?
No, thank you.
- Minister?
- Yes?
- I don't understand.
- Understand?
I broke the law.
Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
Come now.
The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts.
On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things was very, very irresponsible.
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.
Sirius Black, you mean?
But what's he got to do with me?
Nothing, of course.
You're safe.
And that's what matters.
And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.
Hedwig.
Oh, by the way, Harry.
Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't wander.
Right!
You gonna move that bus or what?
Housekeeping.
I'll come back later.
I'm warning you, Hermione.
Keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?
- It's in his nature.
- A cat?
Is that what they told you?
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...
Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.
Harry.
Harry.
- Egypt.
What's it like?
- Brilliant.
Loads of old stuff like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.
- The day maid.
- Night maid.
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.
- Got everything?
- Yes.
- Yes?
All your books?
- It's all upstairs.
- Your clothes?
- Everything.
- Good boy.
- Thank you.
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah.
It should be great.
Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you.
But I think that you need to know the facts.
You are in danger.
Grave danger.
Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?
What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?
Thirteen years ago, when you stopped...
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.
Sorry.
When you stopped You-Know-Who Black lost everything.
But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant.
And in his mind you are the only thing that stands in the way of You-Know-Who returning to power.
And that is why he has escaped from Azkaban.
To find you.
And kill me.
Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear you won't go looking for Black.
Mr. Weasley why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
Quick.
Quick.
Ron, Ron!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Don't lose him!
I didn't mean to blow her up.
I just...
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
I was lucky not to be arrested.
I still think it was brilliant.
Come on.
Everywhere else is full.
Who do you think that is?
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?
How is it she knows everything?
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be.
Why?
I gotta tell you something.
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
- Yeah.
But they'll catch Black, won't they?
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.
Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.
Why are we stopping?
We can't be there yet.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.
Ouch, Ron.
That was my foot.
There's something moving out there.
I think someone's coming aboard.
Bloody hell!
What's happening?
Harry.
Harry, are you all right?
Thank you.
Here, eat this.
It'll help.
It's all right.
It's chocolate.
What was that thing that came?
It was a dementor.
One of the guards of Azkaban.
It's gone now.
It was searching the train for Sirius Black.
If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver.
Eat.
You'll feel better.
What happened to me?
Well, you sort of went rigid.
We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
And did either of you two you know pass out?
- No.
I felt weird, though.
Like I'd never be cheerful again.
But someone was screaming.
A woman.
No one was screaming, Harry.
Welcome!
Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.
Now, I'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast.
First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin who's kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
Good luck, professor.
Of course.
That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.
Potter.
Is it true you fainted?
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.
Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.
Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid.
Finally, on a more disquieting note at the request of the Ministry of Magic Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban until such a time as Sirius Black is captured.
The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
Now whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution.
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.
Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.
It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
But you know, happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light.
Fortuna Major.
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no.
Wait, wait.
Watch this.
- Amazing.
Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.
- Yes, all right.
Go in.
- Thank you.
Still doing that after three years.
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.
Green.
That's a monkey.
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?
Do not give him one again.
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
- Ron, catch.
- I will.
I think we have a winner.
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.
Look at him.
His face.
Welcome, my children.
In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination.
In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight.
Hello.
I am Professor Trelawney.
Together we shall cast ourselves into the future.
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves.
So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you.
What do you see?
The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read.
But first, you must broaden your minds.
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.
- Where did you come from?
- Me?
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...
Is your grandmother quite well?
I think so.
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.
Pity.
Broaden your minds.
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?
- I think you are.
- Sure.
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.
Yeah.
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.
And that there could be the sun and that's happiness.
So you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.
Give me the cup.
Oh, my dear boy.
My dear you have the Grim.
The Grin?
What's the Grin?
Not the Grin, you idiot.
The Grim.
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.
It's among the darkest omens in our world.
It's an omen of death."
You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Oh, honestly, Ron.
If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline.
Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.
Ancient Runes?
Exactly how many classes are you taking?
A fair few.
Hang on.
That's not possible.
Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.
You have to be in two classes at once.
Don't be silly.
How could anyone be in two classes at once?
"Broaden your minds.
Use your Inner Eye to see the future."
That's it.
Come on, now.
Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.
I got a real treat for you today.
A great lesson.
So follow me.
Right, you lot.
Less chattering.
Form a group over there.
And open your books to page 49.
Exactly how do we do that?
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay.
Okay.
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah.
Terribly funny.
Witty.
God, this place has gone to the dogs.
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.
Shut up, Malfoy.
Dementor!
Dementor!
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.
Yeah.
Isn't he beautiful?
Say hello to Buckbeak.
Hagrid, exactly what is that?
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.
First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
It may be the last thing you ever do.
Now, who'd like to come and say hello?
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Come on now.
Now you have to let him make the first move.
It's only polite.
So step up.
Give him a nice bow.
Then you wait and see if he bows back.
If he does, you can go and touch him.
If not...
Well, we'll get to that later.
Just make your bow.
Nice and low.
Back off, Harry.
Back off.
Keep still.
Keep still.
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.
Right.
I think you can go and pat him now.
Go on.
Don't be shy.
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow.
Slow.
Not so fast, Harry.
Slow down, Harry.
That's it...
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...
That's it...
Yes!
Well done!
Well done, Harry, well done!
Does he get to fly?
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Put you over here, just behind the wing joint.
Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that.
Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak.
That was wicked, Harry!
Oh, please.
Well done, well done.
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.
You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!
Malfoy, no...
No!
Buckbeak!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa!
Buckbeak!
Away, you silly creature...
- It's killed me!
- Calm down.
It's just a scratch!
Hagrid!
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher.
I'll do it.
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!
You and your bloody chicken!
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.
Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm.
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.
- He's been sighted!
- Who?
Sirius Black!
Dufftown?
That's not far from here.
You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?
That's right.
Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.
Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
Intriguing, isn't it?
Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what is inside?
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.
Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...
Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart.
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.
After me.
Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.
So much for the easy part.
You see, the incantation alone is not enough.
What really finishes a boggart is laughter.
You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.
Let me explain.
Neville, would you join me, please?
Come on, don't be shy.
Come on.
Come on.
Hello.
Neville, what frightens you most of all?
Professor Snape.
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.
Professor Snape.
Yes, frightens all.
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.
No it won't.
I want you to picture her clothes.
Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe here's what I want you to do.
Excuse me.
Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.
Can you do that?
Yes.
Wand at the ready.
One, two, three.
Think, Neville, think.
Riddikulus!
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible!
Okay to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...
Form a line!
I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most and turn it into something funny.
Next!
Ron!
Concentrate.
Face your fear.
Be brave!
Wand at the ready, Ron.
Riddikulus!
Yes!
You see?
Very good, very good!
Marvelous!
Absolutely, very, very enjoyable!
Parvati!
Next!
Show us what you see.
Keep your nerve.
Steady.
Riddikulus!
And next!
Step up, step up!
Wonderful, wonderful!
Here!
Riddikulus!
Right.
Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.
Collect your books from the back.
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you!
Sorry!
Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege.
Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school that privilege shall not be extended again.
No permission form signed, no visiting the village.
That's the rule, Potter.
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.
I thought if you signed it, then I could...
I can't.
Only a parent or a guardian can sign.
Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate.
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.
Forget about it, guys.
See you later.
Professor, can I ask you something?
You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?
I thought it'd be obvious.
I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.
I did think of Voldemort at first.
But then I remembered that night on the train and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.
That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.
This is very wise.
Before I fainted I heard something.
A woman screaming.
Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.
Our pain becomes their power.
I think it was my mother the night she was murdered.
The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.
Not by your scar, by your eyes.
They're your mother, Lily's.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
I knew her.
Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.
Not only was she a singularly gifted witch she was also an uncommonly kind woman.
She had a way of seeing the beauty in others even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves.
And your father, James, on the other hand he...
He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble.
A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.
You're more like them than you know, Harry.
In time, you'll come to see just how much.
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain.
I know.
What's going on?
Probably Neville forgot the password again.
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.
Let me through, please.
Excuse me!
I'm Head Boy!
Get back, all of you.
No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.
The Fat Lady!
She's gone!
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.
It's not funny, Ron.
Keep calm, everyone.
Break into fours.
Back to your common room.
- Be quiet.
- Make way.
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.
You heard.
Move!
Mr. Filch?
Round up the ghosts.
Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
There's no need for ghosts, professor.
The Fat Lady's there.
Mind where you're going!
Slow down!
You listen!
I'm Head Boy!
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!
Dear lady, who did this to you?
Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.
He's here, somewhere in the castle!
Sirius Black!
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery.
There's nothing there.
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.
I didn't really expect him to linger.
Remarkable feat, don't you think?
To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own...
Any theories on how he managed it?
Many.
Each as unlikely as the next.
You may recall prior to the start of term I expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor...
Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?
Perhaps.
But for now, let him sleep.
For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.
Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
Turn to page 394.
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?
That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?
Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time.
Turn to page 394.
"Werewolves"?
Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?
Now, which one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?
No one?
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.
An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
A werewolf has no choice.
With each full moon he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.
The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.
Are you incapable of restraining yourself or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.
As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.
Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter.
Loss of limb will not excuse you.
Page 394.
The term "werewolf" is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer" which means "man," and "wolf." Werewolf, man-wolf.
There are several ways to become a werewolf.
They include being given the power of shape-shifting being bitten by a werewolf...
Go, Harry!
Go, Harry!
Aresto momentum!
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.
Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.
Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.
You gave us a right good scare.
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.
Really?
I meant the match.
Who won?
No one blames you, Harry.
Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds.
Dumbledore's furious.
After he saved you, he sent them off.
There's something else you should know too.
When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and...
Well...
I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.
Is there no chance of fixing it?
No.
Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.
Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.
They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.
You are not weak, Harry.
Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.
Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.
You made the one on the train go away.
There was only one that night.
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.
But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.
For now, I need to rest.
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.
We'll get you there.
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- If you pipe down.
- Bless him.
- Let me go!
Come on, guys.
Don't...
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.
What are you doing?
!
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...
But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
George, if you will.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder's Map."
We owe them so much.
Hang on.
This is Hogwarts.
And that...
- No.
Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.
- In his study.
- Pacing.
Does that a lot.
- So this map shows...
- Everyone.
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.
- Every minute.
- Every day.
- Brilliant!
Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.
Hurry.
Filch is heading this way.
And don't forget.
When you're done, just give it a tap and say:
"Mischief managed." Otherwise, anyone can read it.
Now, how much do you want?
Delicious.
It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain.
Did I mention that?
Twice.
Do you want to move a bit closer?
To the Shrieking Shack?
Actually, I'm fine here.
Well, well.
Look who's here.
You two shopping for your new dream home?
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.
Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!
You filthy little mudblood!
Who is that?
- Don't stand there!
Do something!
- What?
What's up, Malfoy?
Lost your skis?
Get out of the way!
Move!
Malfoy!
Wait!
Wait!
Harry!
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.
Those weasels!
Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
He won't keep it.
He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.
- Aren't you?
- Sure.
Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
Look who it is.
Madam Rosmerta.
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!
Allow me, minister.
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors into my pub every other night!
- We have...
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
And what would bring him here?
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?
Come.
Harry!
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!
- So rude.
- Thick heads.
- Thick heads?
!
- How dare they!
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!
Nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place.
Tell me what this is all about.
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death...
Remember?
They hid.
Few knew where they were.
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.
Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night he also killed Peter Pettigrew!
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.
Never let James and Sirius out of his sight.
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters and might have, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.
He destroyed him!
A finger.
That's all that was left.
A finger.
Nothing else.
Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.
- What could be worse?
- This:
Sirius Black was and remains to this day Harry Potter's godfather!
Ron, look!
- Sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.
Harry, what happened?
He was their friend and he betrayed them.
He was their friend!
I hope he finds me.
Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!
Harry.
There you are.
You came.
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level.
I'm sure.
Well, everything's prepared.
The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm.
Did you ever hear of it?
No?
Well...
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.
But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory.
Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.
Can you do this?
Yes.
Very well.
Close your eyes.
Concentrate.
Explore your past.
Do you have a memory?
Allow it to fill you up.
Lose yourself within it.
Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum.
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.
Shall we?
Wand at the ready.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto...
Expecto...
Expect...
Here we go.
Come on.
Sit up.
Deep breaths.
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to do it the first time.
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this.
You'll feel better.
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.
As a matter of interest, what were you thinking?
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.
Well, it is.
It's the happiest I've ever felt but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?
Then let's give it a try.
You feel ready?
Just do it.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto Patronum!
Yes!
Well done, Harry.
Well done!
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes.
Sit down.
Here.
Eat this, it helps.
It really helps.
And just so you know, Harry I think you'd have given your father a run for his money.
And that is saying something.
I was thinking of him.
And Mum.
Seeing their faces.
They were talking to me.
Just talking.
That's the memory I chose.
I don't even know if it's real.
But it's the best I have.
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.
Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.
- Did.
- Didn't.
How did it go, Hagrid?
The hearing?
Well, first off, the committee members took turns talking about why we were there.
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers.
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.
He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you.
And then?
And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
Spiders!
There's...
There's spiders.
Spiders.
They want me to tap-dance.
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- Tell those spiders.
Right, yeah.
Tell them.
I'll tell them...
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.
He didn 't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!
Mischief managed.
Nox.
Potter.
What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
I was sleepwalking.
How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter.
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.
My dad didn't strut.
And nor do I.
If you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.
Turn out your pockets.
Turn out your pockets!
What's this?
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really?
Open it.
Reveal your secrets.
Read it.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."
Go on.
"And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business."
- You insolent little...
- Professor!
Well, well.
Lupin.
Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?
Harry, are you all right?
That remains to be seen.
I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.
It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.
Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.
It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise.
Harry, would you come with me, please?
Professor, good night.
Are you deaf?
Put that light out!
Come in.
I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in.
Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black is a map to you?
- No.
- No, sir.
Your father never set much store by the rules either.
But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.
Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!
Now, I will not cover up for you again.
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.
I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.
Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works.
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.
Oh, really?
And who might that be?
Peter Pettigrew.
That's not possible.
It's just what I saw.
Good night, professor.
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.
The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.
Only then can you see.
Try again.
Now, what do we have here?
Do you mind me trying?
The Grim, possibly.
My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.
You may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave.
Have I said something?
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental but now it's in the open for everyone to see.
Hang on.
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.
- Fine.
See you later.
- See you.
Harry Potter...
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.
Sorry?
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder shall break free.
Innocent blood shall be spilt and servant and master shall be reunited once more.
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?
No.
Nothing.
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak.
It's just too horrible.
- It just got worse.
- What did I say?
Father said I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.
This is going to be rich.
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?
You!
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
Malfoy, are you okay?
- Let's go.
Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Look at him.
Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
Why don't we just set him free?
They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.
Says he wants to be with me when they...
When it happens.
Great man, Dumbledore.
A great man.
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!
Think I want you seeing something like that?
No.
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh.
Before you do, Ron...
Scabbers!
You're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.
Right.
Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.
I meant me!
Blimey.
What was that?
Hagrid!
Oh, crikey.
No, minister.
Over this way.
It's late.
It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.
Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble.
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!
Quick.
Quick!
Hagrid.
- It'll be fine.
It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.
- On the slope...
Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.
- Good evening.
- Minister.
Make your way through.
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.
Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we?
Very well.
It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak hereinafter called "the condemned," shall be executed this day at sundown.
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid.
Now, come on.
- All right.
It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go!
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Oh, no.
He bit me.
Scabbers.
Ron.
Ron!
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.
Wait!
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
That's not good.
Ron, run!
Harry, Hermione, run!
It's the Grim!
- Harry!
- Ron!
Ron, wait!
Harry!
- Help!
- Ron!
- Ron.
Ron.
- Ron!
Come on!
Move!
Duck!
Harry!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.
I just hope I'm wrong.
We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
Come on.
Ron.
- Ron.
You're okay.
- The dog.
Where is it?
It's a trap.
He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.
If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!
No.
Only one will die tonight.
Then it'll be you!
Are you going to kill me, Harry?
Expelliarmus!
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?
Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within.
Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you?
- I found him.
- I know.
- It's him.
- I understand.
- Let's kill him!
- No!
I trusted you!
And all this time, you've been his friend.
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.
How long have you known?
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.
You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!
Twelve years of it!
In Azkaban!
Very well.
Kill him.
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.
I know why.
You betrayed my parents.
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.
Somebody did betray your parents somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!
And he's in this room!
Right now!
Come out, come out, Peter!
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!
Vengeance is sweet.
How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
Severus...
I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle.
Here's the proof.
Brilliant, Snape.
You've put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion.
If you'll excuse us, Remus and I have business to attend to.
- Give me a reason.
I beg you!
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it.
It's habit.
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!
You two, quarrelling like an old married couple.
Run along and play with your chemistry set!
I could do it, you know.
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.
A Dementor's Kiss.
One can only imagine what that must be like.
It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.
Severus, please.
After you.
Expelliarmus!
- Harry!
What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.
We thought he was our friend!
- No.
Pettigrew's dead.
You killed him!
- No, he didn't.
I thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map!
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!
- Me?
!
He's mental!
- Not you!
Your rat!
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?
Curiously long life for a common garden rat!
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!
Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?
Scabbers!
Leave him alone!
Get off him!
What are you doing?
Remus?
Sirius.
My old friends!
Harry!
Look at you.
You look so much like your father.
- James.
We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!
How dare you talk about James in front of him!
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!
The Dark Lord.
You have no idea the weapons he possesses!
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!
James wouldn't have wanted me killed!
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!
Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would.
Together!
No!
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.
But we'll take him to the castle.
- Bless you, boy.
Bless you!
- Get off!
I said we'd take you to the castle.
After that, the dementors can have you.
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.
A bit?
A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!
I was going for the rat.
Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog.
More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent.
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.
Okay.
- You better go.
- No.
Don't worry, okay?
It's fine.
I'll stay.
You go, I'll stay.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
Go.
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.
They might chop it.
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
It's too late.
It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.
It'll be nice to do it again as a free man.
That was a noble thing you did back there.
He doesn't deserve it.
I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends to become killers.
Besides, dead, the truth dies with him.
Alive, you're free.
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!
Ron!
Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!
- Sweet, clever girl!
Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!
I don't know if you know, Harry but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather.
I know.
I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle but if you ever wanted a different home...
What?
Come and live with you?
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.
Harry!
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live!
Here!
This flesh is only flesh!
Expelliarmus!
Harry!
Remus!
Remus!
Run!
Run!
- Come on.
- Wait.
Wait.
Hermione!
Bad idea.
Bad idea.
Professor?
Professor Lupin?
Nice doggy.
Nice doggy!
There you are, Potter!
Sirius!
Come back here, Potter!
Sirius!
No.
Sirius!
Expecto Patronum!
Harry?
I saw my dad.
What?
He sent the dementors away.
I saw him across the lake.
Harry, they've captured Sirius.
Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.
- They're gonna kill him?
- No.
It's worse.
Much worse.
They're going to suck out his soul.
Headmaster, stop them.
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true.
Sirius is innocent.
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?
He's my rat, sir.
He's not really a rat.
He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.
But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.
A child's voice, however honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.
Mysterious thing, time.
Powerful and when meddled with, dangerous.
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen.
And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime.
If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss.
If you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared.
Three turns should do it, I think.
Oh, and by the way.
When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin.
Good luck.
What the bloody hell was that all about?
Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk...
What just happened?
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.
Where were we at 7:30?
I don't know.
Going to Hagrid's?
Come on.
And we can't be seen.
Hermione!
Hermione!
Hermione, wait.
Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
That's us.
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
This is not normal.
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first term.
This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.
Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.
Good punch.
Thanks.
Malfoy's coming.
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood!
Mark my words.
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Come on.
We should be at Hagrid's.
Look.
Buckbeak's still alive.
Of course.
Remember what Dumbledore said?
If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.
Let's go.
Here they come.
I'd better hurry.
Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.
Scabbers, you're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.
If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad.
Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time.
We can't be seen.
Fudge is coming.
And we aren't leaving?
Why aren't we leaving?
Are you mad?
That hurt.
Sorry.
We're coming out the back door.
Go!
Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go.
Okay, go, Harry.
Go!
Get away.
Get off.
Minister, I really think I should sign as well.
Yes, very well.
Perhaps it would be...
Okay, Buckbeak.
Come quickly.
Come with us now.
Come on.
Keep trying.
Come on.
Quickly.
Buckbeak.
Okay?
Quickly.
Hurry up.
Okay?
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.
Come and get the nice dead ferret.
- Come on.
It's here.
Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister.
Follow me.
- Now, look there.
- Where?
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?
Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
- Oh, yes.
Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.
- Come on, Buckbeak.
Come on.
- I see no strawberries.
- Over there.
- Where?
- Over there.
- This way.
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.
But where is it?
I saw the beast, just now.
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.
Buckbeak.
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.
I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.
- Right.
- Well, well.
We must search the grounds.
Well, search the skies, if you must, minister.
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy.
Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required.
Thank you.
You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor.
- Come on.
- This way.
This way, now.
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.
- How?
- No idea.
- Look.
It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!
And Snape's coming.
And now we wait.
And now we wait.
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.
- Hermione?
- Yeah?
Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius I did see someone.
That someone made the dementors go away.
With a Patronus.
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
According to him only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
It was my dad.
My dad conjured the Patronus.
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead.
I know.
I'm just telling you what I saw.
Here we come.
You see Sirius talking to me there?
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'.
It'll just be me and him.
We could live in the country someplace you can see the sky.
He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
Harry!
Run!
Let's go.
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.
Thanks.
- Great.
Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that.
Run!
That was so scary.
Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
Sirius.
Come on!
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.
Any minute now.
Right there.
You'll see.
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.
- Sirius.
- You're dying both of you.
Harry!
Expecto Patronum!
You were right, Hermione.
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!
I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.
I knew I could do it this time because well, I had already done it.
- Does that make sense?
- No.
But I don't like flying...!
Bombarda!
I'll be forever grateful for this to both of you.
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.
For some time, my life will be too unpredictable.
And besides you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.
And you know it.
And for now, that will do.
I expect you're tired of hearing this but you look so like your father.
Except your eyes.
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.
It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little.
But know this:
The ones that love us never really leave us.
And you can always find them in here.
You really are the brightest witch of your age.
We have to go.
- Well?
- He's free.
We did it.
Did what?
Good night.
How did you get there?
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.
Honestly, Ron.
How can somebody be in two places at once?
Hello, Harry.
I saw you coming.
I've looked worse, believe me.
- You've been sacked.
- No.
No.
I resigned, actually.
Resigned?
Why?
Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition.
This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want well, someone like me teaching their children.
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already risked enough on my behalf.
Besides, people like me are...
Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now.
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
None of it made any difference.
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.
You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.
It made a great deal of difference.
If I am proud of anything it is of how much you have learned this year.
Now, since I am no longer your teacher I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you.
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
Until then mischief managed.
Stand back, I said!
Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle.
Harry.
Wherever did you get it?
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.
Did not.
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.
For me?
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.
This came with it.
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.
How fast is it, Harry?
Lumos.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
Mischief managed.
Nox.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
Harry.
Harry.
Harry, open the door.
Marge.
How lovely to see...
Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.
What is it?
Nothing.
School stuff.
Later perhaps, if you behave.
I will if she does.
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.
Don't say yes in that ungrateful way.
Damn good of my brother to keep you.
He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep, Vernon.
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?
Give us a kiss.
Come on.
Up, up.
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
Okay.
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.
Excellent nosh, Petunia.
A bit more.
Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs.
Just a bit more.
That's a boy.
You wanna try a little drop of brandy?
A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?
What are you smirking at?
Where did you send the boy, Vernon?
St. Brutus'.
It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I've been beaten loads of times.
Excellent.
I won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it.
You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out, Vernon.
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.
What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?
Nothing.
He didn't work.
He was unemployed.
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.
Don't worry.
Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.
I think it's time you went to bed.
Quiet, Vernon.
You, clean it up.
Actually, it's nothing to do with the father.
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.
If there's something wrong with the bitch, then there's something wrong with the pup.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Right.
Let me tell you...
Vernon!
Vernon!
Vernon, do something!
Stop!
I've got you, Marge.
I've got you.
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.
Oh, Vernon.
Oh, God.
Marge!
Please!
Marge!
Come back!
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.
- You put her right!
- No.
She deserved what she got.
- Just keep away from me.
- You're not allowed to do magic outside school.
- Yeah?
Try me.
- They won't let you back now.
You've nowhere to go.
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.
"Welcome to the Knight Bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard.
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening. "
What you doing down there?
- I fell over.
- What you fall over for?
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.
Well, come on, then.
In.
No, no, no.
I'll get this.
You get in.
Come on.
Come on.
Move on, move on.
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.
- What did you say your name was again?
- I didn't.
- For whereabouts are you headed?
- For Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London.
Do you hear that, Ern?
"The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London. "
The Leaky Cauldron.
Hey...
If you have pea soup make sure you eat it before it eats you.
- But the Muggles.
Can't they see us?
- Muggles?
They don't see nothing, do they?
No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel.
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!
Ten, nine, eight seven, six, five four, three, three and a half two, one and three quarters.
Yes!
Who is that?
That man.
Who is that?
Who is...?
That is Sirius Black, that is.
Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black.
He's a murderer.
Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?
He's the first one that done it.
He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.
I reckon you've heard of him.
Yeah.
Him I've heard of.
Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock.
They're getting closer, Ernie.
Ernie, they're right on top of us!
Mind your head.
Hey, guys?
Guys?
Why the long faces?
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there.
Nearly there.
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.
Mr. Potter, at last.
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!
Room 11.
Hedwig.
Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter.
He arrived here just five minutes before yourself.
As the Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter that earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack.
The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately.
She has been properly punctured and her memory modified.
She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.
So that's that and no harm done.
Pea soup?
No, thank you.
- Minister?
- Yes?
- I don't understand.
- Understand?
I broke the law.
Underage wizards aren't allowed to use magic at home.
Come now, Harry.
The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts.
On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things was very, very irresponsible.
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.
Sirius Black, you mean?
But what's he got to do with me?
Nothing, of course.
You're safe.
And that's what matters.
And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty of having them brought here for you.
Now Tom will show you to your room.
Hedwig.
Oh, by the way, Harry.
Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't wander.
Right!
You gonna move that bus or what?
Housekeeping.
I'll come back later.
I'm warning you, Hermione.
Keep that bloody beast of yours away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?
- It's in his nature.
- A cat?
Is that what they told you?
- Looks more like a pig with hair if you ask me.
- That's rich...
It's all right, Crookshanks, you just ignore the mean little boy.
Harry.
Harry.
- Egypt.
What's it like?
- Brilliant.
Loads of old stuff like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
-You know the Egyptians used to worship cats
-Along with the dung beetle.
- Not flashing that clipping about again, are you, Ron?
- I haven't shown anyone.
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.
- The day maid.
- The night maid.
- The cook.
- The bloke that came to fix the toilet.
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you too.
- Now, I think, you have everything you'll need?
- Yeah.
- Yes?
All of your books?
- Yeah, It's all upstairs.
- And all of your clothes?
- Everything is there.
- Good boy.
- Thank you.
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah.
It should be great.
Harry, there are some within the Ministry who would strongly discourage me from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you.
But I think that you need to know the facts.
You are in danger.
Grave danger.
Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?
What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?
Thirteen years ago, when you stopped...
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.
Sorry.
When you stopped You-Know-Who Black lost everything.
But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant.
And in his mind you are the only thing that stands in the way of You-Know-Who returning to power.
And that is why he has escaped from Azkaban.
To find you.
And kill me.
Harry, I want you to swear to me that whatever you might hear you won't go looking for Black.
Mr. Weasley why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
Quick.
Quick.
Ron, Ron!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Don't lose him!
I didn't mean to blow her up.
I just...
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
I think I was lucky not to be arrested actually.
I still think it was brilliant.
Come on.
Everywhere else is full.
Who do you think that is?
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?
How is it she knows everything?
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be.
Why?
I gotta tell you something.
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
- Yeah.
But they'll catch Black, won't they?
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.
Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.
Why are we stopping?
We can't be there yet.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.
Ouch, Ron.
That was my foot.
There's something moving out there.
I think someone's coming aboard.
Bloody hell!
What's happening?
Harry.
Harry, are you all right?
Thank you.
Here, eat this.
It'll help.
It's all right.
It's chocolate.
What was that thing that came?
It was a dementor.
One of the guards of Azkaban.
It's gone now.
It was searching the train for Sirius Black.
If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver.
Eat.
You'll feel better.
What happened to me?
Well, you sort of went rigid.
We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
And did either of you two you know pass out?
- No.
I felt weird, though.
Like I'd never be cheerful again.
But someone was screaming.
A woman.
No one was screaming, Harry.
Welcome!
Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.
Now, I'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast.
First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin who's kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
Good luck, professor.
Of course.
That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.
Potter.
Is it true you fainted?
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.
Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher for many years has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.
Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid.
Finally, on a more disquieting note at the request of the Ministry of Magic Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban until such a time as Sirius Black is captured.
The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
Now whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution.
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.
Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.
It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
But you know, happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light.
Fortuna Major.
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no.
Wait, wait.
Watch this.
- Amazing.
Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.
- Yes, all right.
Go in.
- Thank you.
Still doing that after three years.
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.
Green.
That's a monkey.
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?
Do not give him one again.
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
- Ron, catch.
- I will.
I think we have a winner.
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.
Look at him.
His face.
Welcome, my children.
In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination.
In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight.
Hello.
I am Professor Trelawney.
Together we shall cast ourselves into the future.
This term, we'll be focussing on Tasseomancy, which is the art of reading tea leaves.
So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you.
What do you see?
The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read.
But first, you must broaden your minds.
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.
- Where did you come from?
- Me?
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...
Is your grandmother quite well?
I think so.
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.
Pity.
Broaden your minds.
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?
- I think you are.
- Sure.
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.
Yeah.
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.
And that there could be the sun and that's happiness.
So you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.
Give me the cup.
Oh, my dear boy.
My dear you have the Grim.
The Grin?
What's the Grin?
Not the Grin, you idiot.
The Grim.
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.
It's among the darkest omens in our world.
It's an omen of death. "
You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black, do ya?
Oh, honestly, Ron.
If you ask me, Divination's a very woolly discipline.
Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.
Ancient Runes?
Exactly how many classes are you taking this term?
A fair few.
Hang on.
That's not possible.
Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.
You have to be in two classes at once.
Don't be silly, Ronald.
How could anyone be in two classes at once?
"Broaden your minds.
Use your Inner Eye to see the future. "
That's it.
Come on, now.
Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.
I got a real treat for you today.
A great lesson.
So follow me.
Right, you lot.
Less chattering.
Form a group over there.
And open your books to page 49.
Exactly how do we do that?
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay.
Okay.
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah.
Terribly funny.
Really witty.
God, this place has gone to the dogs.
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.
Shut up, Malfoy.
Dementor!
Dementor!
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.
Yeah.
Isn't he beautiful?
Say hello to Buckbeak.
Hagrid, exactly what is that?
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.
First thing you wanna know about hippogriff is that they're very proud creatures.
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
It may just be the last thing you ever do.
Now, who'd like to come and say hello?
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Come on now.
Now you have to let him make the first move.
It's only polite.
So step up.
Give him a nice bow.
Then you wait and see if he bows back.
If he does, you can go and touch him.
If not...
Well, we'll get to that later.
Just make your bow.
Nice and low.
Back off, Harry.
Back off.
Keep still.
Keep still.
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.
Right.
I think you can go and pat him now.
Go on.
Don't be shy.
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow.
Slow.
Not so fast, Harry.
Slow down, Harry.
That's it...
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...
That's it...
Yes!
Well done!
Well done, Harry, well done!
Does he get to fly?
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Put you over here, just behind the wing joint.
Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that.
Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak.
That was wicked, Harry!
Oh, please.
Well done, well done.
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.
You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!
Malfoy, no...
No!
Buckbeak!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa!
Buckbeak!
Away, you silly creature...
- It's killed mw!
It's killed me!
- Calm down.
It's just a scratch!
Hagrid!
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher.
I'll do it.
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!
You and your bloody chicken!
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.
According to Madam Pomfrey, another minute or two and I could've lost my arm.
- I couldn't possibly do any homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- But at least Hagrid didn't get fired.
Yeah, but I heard Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.
- He's been sighted!
- Who?
Sirius Black!
Dufftown?
That's not far from here.
You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?
He's already slipped past them once, hasn't he?
Who's to say he won't do it again?
That's right.
Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.
Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
Intriguing, isn't it?
Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what is inside?
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.
Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
They take the shape of whatever a particular person fears the most.
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...
Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart.
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.
After me.
Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.
Well, so much for the easy part.
You see, the incantation alone is not enough.
What really finishes a boggart is laughter.
You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.
Let me explain.
Neville, would you join me, please?
Come on, don't be shy.
Come on.
Come on.
Hello.
Neville, what frightens you most of all?
Professor Snape.
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.
Professor Snape.
Yes, frightens all.
And, I believe you live with your grandmother.
Yes, but I don't want that boggart to turn into her, either.
No it won't.
I want you to picture her clothes.
Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe here's what I want you to do.
Excuse me.
Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.
Can you do that?
Yes.
Wand at the ready.
One, two, three.
Think, Neville, think.
Riddikulus!
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible!
Okay to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...
Form a line!
I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most and turn it into something funny.
Next!
Ron!
Concentrate.
Face your fear.
Be brave!
Wand at the ready, Ron.
Riddikulus!
Yes!
You see?
Very good, very good!
Marvelous!
Absolutely, very, very enjoyable!
Parvati!
Next!
Show us what you see.
Keep your nerve.
Steady.
Riddikulus!
And next!
Step up, step up!
Wonderful, wonderful!
Here!
Riddikulus!
Right.
Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.
You'd all have to collect your books from the back of the class.
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you!
Sorry!
Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.
Now, Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege.
Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school in any way that privilege shall not be extended again.
No permission form signed, no visiting the village.
That's the rule, Potter.
All those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.
But professor, I thought if you signed it, then I could...
I can't.
Only a parent or a guardian can sign.
Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate.
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.
Forget about it, guys.
See you later.
Professor, can I ask you something?
You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?
I would've thought it'd be obvious.
I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.
I did think of Voldemort at first.
But then I remembered that night on the train and the dementor.
- And I'm very impressed.
That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.
This is very wise.
Before I fainted I heard something.
A woman screaming.
Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.
Our pain becomes their power.
I think it was my mother the night she was murdered.
You know, the very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.
Not by your scar, by your eyes.
They're your mother, Lily's.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
I knew her.
Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.
Not only was she a singularly gifted witch she was also an uncommonly kind woman.
She had a way of seeing the beauty in others... even, and perhaps most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves.
And your father, James, on the other hand he...
He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble.
A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.
You're more like them than you know, Harry.
In time, you'll come to see just how much.
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
We never did get a chance to go to the Shrieking Shack though.
- You heard that it's the most isolated building in Britain.
- Yeah, I know.
What's going on?
Probably Neville forgot the password again.
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.
Let me through, please.
Excuse me!
I'm Head Boy!
Get back, all of you.
No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been fully searched.
The Fat Lady!
She's gone!
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.
It's not funny, Ron.
Keep calm, everyone.
Break into fours.
Back to your common room.
- Be quiet.
- Make way.
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.
You heard.
Move!
Mr. Filch?
Round up the ghosts.
Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
There's no need for ghosts, professor.
The Fat Lady's there.
Hey!
Mind where you're going!
Slow down!
You listen!
I'm Head Boy!
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!
Dear lady, who did this to you?
Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.
He's here, somewhere in the castle!
Sirius Black!
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery, sir.
But he's not been there.
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons, Headmaster.
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.
I didn't really expect him to linger.
Remarkable feat, don't you think?
To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own...
Any theories on how he might've managed it?
Many.
Each as unlikely as the next.
You may recall prior to the start of term I'd expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor...
Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black to enter it.
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe and I'm more than willing to send the students back to their houses.
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?
Perhaps.
But for now, let him sleep.
For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.
Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
Turn to page 394.
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?
That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?
Suffice it to say that your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time.
Turn to page 394.
"Werewolves"?
But sir, we've just begun learning about red caps and hinkypunks.
- We're not meant to start nocturnal beasts for weeks.
- Quiet.
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?
Now, which one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?
No one?
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.
An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
A werewolf has no choice.
With each full moon when he transforms he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend if he cross his path.
Furthermore, The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.
Are you incapable of restraining yourself or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.
As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with particular emphasis on recognizing it.
- Sir, It's Quidditch tomorrow.
Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter.
Loss of limb will not excuse you.
Page 394.
The term "werewolf" is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer" which means "man, " and "wolf. " Werewolf, man-wolf.
There are several ways to become a werewolf.
They include being given the power of shape-shifting being bitten by a werewolf...
Go, Harry!
Go, Harry!
Aresto momentum!
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.
- Yeah, come on Ron.
Let's walk you off the Astronomy tower, - and see what you look like.
Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.
You gave us a right good scare there, mate.
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.
Really?
I meant the match.
Who won?
No one blames you, Harry.
The Dementors aren't supposed to come inside the grounds.
Dumbledore's furious.
After he saved you, he sent them straight off.
There's something else you should know too, Harry.
When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and...
Well...
I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.
Is there no chance of fixing it?
No.
Professor, why do the Dementors affect me so?
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.
The Dementors are amongst the foulest creatures to walk this earth.
They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.
You are not weak, Harry.
The Dementors affect you most of all because there are true horrors in your past.
Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.
You made that Dementor on the train go away.
There was only one that night.
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.
But as the dementors seem to have developed a particular interest in you perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.
For now, I need to rest.
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.
- But not clever enough.
- Besides, We've got a better way.
- Guys, come on, I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.
- Don't worry.
- We'll get you there.
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- If you pipe down.
- Oh, Bless him.
- Let me go!
Come on, guys.
Don't...
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.
What are you doing?
!
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.
- That there's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you, believe me.
But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
George, if you will.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder's Map. "
We owe them so much.
Hang on.
This is Hogwarts.
And that...
- No.
Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.
- In his study.
- Pacing.
Does that a lot.
- So, you mean, this map shows...
- Everyone.
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.
- Every minute.
- Of every day.
- Brilliant!
Where did you get it?
- Nicked it from Filch's office, of course.
- First year.
- Now listen.
There are 7 secret passageways ...out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- It'll lead you stright to Honeyduke seller.
But you best hurry.
Filch is heading this way.
And Harry, don't forget.
When you're done, just give it a tap and say:
"Mischief managed. " Otherwise, anyone can read it.
Now, how much do you want?
Delicious.
It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain.
Did I mention that?
Twice.
Do you want to move a bit closer?
To the Shrieking Shack?
Actually, I'm fine here.
Well, well.
Look who's here.
You two shopping for your new dream home?
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.
Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!
You filthy little mudblood!
Who is that?
- Don't stand there!
Do something!
- What?
What's up, Malfoy?
Lost your skis?
Get out of the way!
Move!
Malfoy!
Wait!
Wait!
Harry!
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.
Those weasels!
Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
But Harry isn't going to keep it.
He's going to turn it over to Professor McGonagall.
- Aren't you?
- Oh sure.
Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
Look who it is.
Madam Rosmerta.
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!
Allow me, minister.
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors into my pub every other night!
- We have...
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
And what would bring him here?
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?
Come.
Harry!
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!
- So rude.
- Thick heads.
- Thick heads?
!
- How dare they!
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!
Nobody's going to come to a pub where they're gonna get scared out of their wits.
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place I can assure you.
Now, tell me what this is all about.
Well now, years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death...
Do you remember?
They went into hiding.
Few knew where they were.
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.
Not only did Black lead You-Know-Who to the Potters that night but he also killed one of their friends, Peter Pettigrew!
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- I remember him.
Never let James and Sirius out of his sight.
- But what happened?
- Well, Peter Pettigrew tried to warn the Potters and might have managed to, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.
He destroyed him!
A finger.
That's all that was left.
A finger.
Nothing else.
Yes.
Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters but he's the reason they're dead.
- And now he wants to finish what he started.
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.
- What could be worse?
- This:
Sirius Black was and remains to this day Harry Potter's godfather!
Ron, look!
- Sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.
Harry, what happened?
He was their friend and he betrayed them.
He was their friend!
I hope he finds me.
Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!
Harry.
There you are.
You came.
Now, are you sure about this, Harry?
You know, this is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level.
I'm sure.
Well, everything's prepared.
Now the spell I'm going to try to teach you is called the Patronus Charm.
Did you ever hear of it?
No?
Well...
A Patronus is a kind of positive force, and for the wizard who can conjure one it works something like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.
But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory.
Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.
Can you do this?
Yes.
Very well.
Close your eyes.
Concentrate.
Explore your past.
Do you have a memory?
Allow it to fill you up.
Lose yourself within it.
Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum.
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.
Shall we?
Wand at the ready.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto...
Expecto...
Expect...
Here we go.
Come on.
Sit up.
Deep breaths.
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to do it the first time.
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this.
You'll feel better.
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.
As a matter of interest, what were you thinking?
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.
Well, it is.
It's the happiest I've ever felt but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?
Then let's give it a try.
You feel ready?
Just do it.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto Patronum!
Yes!
Well done, Harry.
Well done!
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes.
Sit down.
Here.
Eat this, it helps.
It really helps.
And just so you know, Harry I think you'd have given your father a run for his money.
And that is saying something.
I was thinking of him.
And Mum.
Seeing their faces.
They were talking to me.
Just talking.
That's the memory I chose.
I don't even know if it's real.
But it's the best I have.
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.
Unless of course you've been ripped to pieces!
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.
Well, maybe you should learn to take better care of your pets!
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.
- Did.
- Didn't.
How did it go, Hagrid?
The hearing?
Well, first off, the committee members took turns talking about why we were there.
And then I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers.
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.
He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you.
And then?
And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
Spiders!
There's...
There's spiders.
Spiders.
They want me to tap-dance.
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- You tell those spiders, Ron.
Right, yeah.
Tell them.
I'll tell them...
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!
Mischief managed.
Nox.
Potter.
What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
I was sleepwalking.
How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter.
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.
My dad didn't strut.
And nor do I.
Now if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.
Turn out your pockets.
Turn out your pockets!
What's this?
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really?
Open it.
Reveal your secrets.
Read it.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and... "
Go on.
"And request that he keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business. "
- Why you insolent little...
- Professor!
Well, well.
Lupin.
Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?
Harry, you all right?
That remains to be seen.
I have just now confiscated a rather curious artifact from Mr. Potter.
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.
It looks to me as though it's merely a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.
Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.
It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise.
Harry, would you come with me, please?
Professor, good night.
Are you deaf?
Put that light out!
Come in.
Now I haven't the faintest idea harry how this map came to be in your possession but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in.
It did never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black is a map to you?
- No.
- No, sir.
You know, Your father never set much store by the rules either.
But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.
Gambling their sacrifice by wandering around the castle unprotected with a killer on the loose seems to me a pretty poor way to repay them!
Now, I will not cover up for you again, Harry.
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.
I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.
Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works.
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.
Oh, really?
And who might that be?
Peter Pettigrew.
That's not possible.
It's just what I saw.
Good night, professor.
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.
The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.
Only then can you see.
Try again.
Now, what do we have here?
Do you mind me trying?
The Grim, possibly.
My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.
You may be young in years, but the heart that beats beneath your bosom is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave.
Have I said something?
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
I mean, not that she wasn't always mental but now it's out in the open for everyone to see.
Hang on.
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.
- Fine.
See you later.
- See you.
Harry Potter...
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.
Sorry?
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder shall break free.
Innocent blood shall be spilt and servant and master shall be reunited once more.
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?
No.
Nothing.
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak.
It's just too horrible.
- It just got worse.
- What did I tell you?
Father said that I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I think I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' common room.
This is going to be rich.
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?
You!
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
Malfoy, are you okay?
- Let's go.
Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Look at him.
Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
Why don't we just set him free?
They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore would get into trouble.
He's coming down you know, Dumbledore.
Says he wants to be with me when they...
When it happens.
Great man, Dumbledore.
A great man.
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!
Think I want you seeing something like that?
No.
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh.
Before you do, Ron...
Scabbers!
You're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pets, Ron.
- I think that means you owe someone an apology.
Right.
Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.
I meant me!
Blimey.
What was that?
Hagrid!
Oh, crikey.
No, minister.
Over this way.
It's late.
It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.
Someone sees you outside the castle this time of night, you'll be in trouble.
Big trouble.
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!
Quick.
Quick!
Hagrid.
- It'll be fine.
It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!
- That's the ling you see over there...
- On the slope.
- On the slope...
Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.
- Good evening.
- Minister.
Just make your way through.
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.
Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we?
Very well.
It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff known as Buckbeak hereinafter called "the condemned," shall be executed this day at sundown.
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid.
Now, come on.
- All right.
It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go!
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Oh, no.
He bit me.
Scabbers.
Ron.
Ron!
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.
Wait!
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
That's not good.
Ron, run!
Harry, Hermione, run!
It's the Grim!
- Harry!
- Ron!
Ron, wait!
Harry!
- Help!
- Ron!
- Ron.
Ron.
- Ron!
Come on!
Move!
Duck!
Harry!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.
I just hope I'm wrong.
We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
Come on.
Ron.
- Ron.
You're okay.
- The dog.
Where is it?
Harry, It's a trap.
He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.
If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!
No.
Only one will die tonight.
Then it'll be you!
Are you going to kill me, Harry?
Expelliarmus!
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?
Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within.
Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you, Remus?
- I found him.
- I know.
- It's him.
- I understand.
- Let's kill him!
- No!
I trusted you!
And all this time, you've been his friend.
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.
How long have you known?
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, well, well, Hermione.
You really are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!
Twelve years of it!
In Azkaban!
Very well.
Kill him.
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.
I know why.
You betrayed my parents.
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, Harry, it wasn't him.
Somebody did betray your parents but it was somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!
And he's in this room!
Right now!
Come out, come out, Peter!
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!
Vengeance is sweet.
How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
Severus...
I told Dumbledore you were helping your old friend into the castle And now here's the proof.
Brilliant, Snape.
Once again you've put your keen and penetrating mind to the task and as usual come to the wrong conclusion.
Now, if you'll excuse us, Remus and I have some unfinished business to attend to.
- Give me a reason.
I beg you!
- Severus, Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it.
It's habit by now.
- Sirius, Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself, Remus!
Listen to you two, quarrelling like an old married couple.
Why don't you run along and play with your chemistry set!
I could do it, you know.
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.
A Dementor's Kiss.
One can only imagine what that must be like to endure.
It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.
Severus, please.
After you.
Expelliarmus!
- Harry!
What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!
- Tell me about Peter Pettigrew.
- He was at school with us.
We thought he was our friend!
- No.
Pettigrew's dead.
You killed him!
- No, he didn't.
I thought so too, until you mentioned seeing Pettigrew on the map!
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!
- Me?
!
He's mental!
- Not you!
Your rat!
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?
Curiously long life for a common garden rat!
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!
Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?
Scabbers!
Leave him alone!
Get off him!
What are you doing?
Remus?
Sirius.
My old friends!
Harry!
Look at you.
You look so much like your father.
- Like James.
We were the best of friends, he and I...
- How dare you speak to Harry!
How dare you talk about James in front of him!
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort, didn't you?
- I didn't mean to!
The Dark Lord.
You have no idea the weapons he possesses!
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?
- What would you have done?
- I would've died, rather than betray my friends!
Harry, James wouldn't have wanted me killed!
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!
You should've realized Peter, that if Voldemort didn't kill you, then we would.
Together!
No!
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.
But we'll take him to the castle.
- Bless you, boy.
Bless you!
- Get off!
I said we'd take you to the castle.
After that, the dementors can have you.
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.
A bit?
A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!
I was going for the rat.
Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog.
In fact more than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent.
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.
Okay.
- You better go.
- No.
Don't worry, okay?
It's fine.
I'll stay.
You go, I'll stay.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
Go.
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.
They might chop it.
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
It's too late.
It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.
It'll be nice to do it again as a free man.
That was a noble thing you did back there.
He doesn't deserve it.
Well, I just didn't think my dad would have wanted his two best friends to become killers.
Besides, dead, the truth dies with him.
Alive, you're free.
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!
Ron!
Haven't I been a good friend?
good pet?
You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!
- Sweet girl, clever girl!
Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!
I don't know if you know, Harry but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather.
I know.
Well, I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle but if you ever wanted a different home...
What?
Come and live with you?
Well, It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.
Harry!
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live!
This heart, here!
This flesh is only flesh!
Expelliarmus!
Harry!
Remus!
Remus!
Run!
Run!
- Come on.
- Wait.
Wait.
Hermione!
Bad idea.
Bad idea.
Professor?
Professor Lupin?
Nice doggy.
Nice doggy!
There you are, Potter!
Sirius!
Come back here, Potter!
Sirius!
No.
Sirius!
Expecto Patronum!
Harry?
I saw my dad.
What?
He sent the dementors away.
I saw him across the lake.
Listen, Harry.
They've captured Sirius.
Any minute the dementors are going to perform the Kiss.
- You mean, they're going to kill him?
- No.
It's worse.
Much worse.
They're going to suck out his soul.
Headmaster, you've got to stop them.
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true, sir.
Sirius is innocent.
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?
He's my rat, sir.
He's not really a rat.
He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.
But I'm sorry to say the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.
A child's voice, however honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.
Mysterious thing, time.
Powerful and when meddled with, dangerous.
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen.
And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime.
If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss.
If you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared.
Three turns should do it, I think.
Oh, and by the way.
When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin.
Good luck.
What the bloody hell was that all about?
Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk...
What just happened?
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.
Where were we at 7:30?
I don't know.
Going to Hagrid's?
Come on.
And we can't be seen.
Hermione!
Hermione!
Hermione, wait.
Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
That's us.
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
This is not normal.
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first term.
This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.
Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.
Good punch.
Thanks.
Malfoy's coming.
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood!
Mark my words.
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Come on.
We should be at Hagrid's.
Look.
Buckbeak's still alive.
Of course.
Remember what Dumbledore said?
If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.
Let's go.
Here they come.
I'd better hurry.
Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.
Scabbers, you're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.
- Harry, you can't.
- Hermione, that's the man who betrayed my parents.
- You don't expect me to just sit here.
- Yes, and you must!
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.
If you just go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad.
Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time.
We can't be seen.
Fudge is coming.
And we aren't leaving?
Why aren't we leaving?
Are you mad?
That hurt.
Sorry.
Come on, we're coming out the back door.
Go!
Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go.
Okay, go, Harry.
Go!
Get away.
Get off.
Minister, I really think I should sign as well.
Yes, very well.
Perhaps it would be...
Okay, Buckbeak.
Come quickly.
Come with us now.
Okay, Come on.
Keep trying.
Come on.
Quickly.
Buckbeak.
Okay?
Quickly.
Hurry up.
Okay?
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.
Come and get the nice dead ferret.
- Come on.
It's here.
Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister.
Follow me.
- Now, look there.
See.
- Where?
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?
Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
- Oh, yes.
Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries, you see.
- Come on, Buckbeak.
Come on.
- I see no strawberries.
- Over there.
- Where?
- Over there.
- This way.
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.
But where is it?
I saw the beast, just now.
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.
Buckbeak.
Oh, Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.
I don't think the minister's suggesting that you had anything to do with this, Hagrid.
After all, how could you?
You've been with us all the time.
- Right.
- Well, well.
We must search the grounds.
Well, search the skies, if you must, minister.
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy.
Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required.
Thank you.
You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor.
- Come on.
- This way.
This way, now.
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.
- How?
- No idea.
- Look.
It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!
And Snape's coming.
And now we wait.
And now we wait.
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.
- Hermione?
- Yeah?
Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius I did see someone.
That someone made the dementors go away.
With a Patronus.
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
According to him only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
It was my dad.
It was my dad who conjured the Patronus.
- But Harry, your dad's...
- Dead.
I know.
I'm just telling you what I saw.
Here we come.
You see Sirius talking to me there?
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'.
It'll just be me and him.
We could live in the country someplace you can see the sky.
I think, he'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
Harry!
Run!
Let's go.
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.
Thanks.
- Great.
Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that.
Run!
That was so scary.
Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
Sirius.
Come on!
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.
Any minute now.
Right there.
You'll see.
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.
- Sirius.
- You're dying both of you.
Harry!
Expecto Patronum!
You were right, Hermione.
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!
I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.
I knew I could do it this time because well, I had already done it.
- Does that make sense?
- No.
But I don't like flying...!
Bombarda!
I'll be forever grateful for this to both of you.
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.
For some time, my life will be too unpredictable.
And besides you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.
And you know it.
And for now, that will do.
I expect you're tired of hearing this but you look so like your father.
Except your eyes.
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.
It's cruel that I gotta spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little.
But know this:
The ones that love us never really leave us.
And you can always find them in here.
You really are the brightest witch of your age.
We have to go.
- Well?
- He's free.
We did it.
Did what?
Good night.
How did you get there?
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.
Honestly, Ron.
How can somebody be in two places at once?
Hello, Harry.
I saw you coming.
I've looked worse, believe me.
- You've been sacked.
- No.
No.
I resigned, actually.
Resigned?
Why?
Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition.
This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want well, someone like me teaching their children.
- But Dumbledore...
- Dumbledore has already risked enough on my behalf.
Besides, people like me are...
Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now.
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
None of it made any difference.
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?
Harry, It made all the difference in the world.
You helped uncover the truth.
You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.
It made a great deal of difference.
If I am proud of anything it is of how much you have learned this year.
Now, since I am no longer your teacher I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you.
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
Until then mischief managed.
Stand back, I said!
Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle.
Harry.
Wherever did you get it?
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.
Did not.
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.
For me?
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.
This came with it.
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.
How fast is it, Harry?
Lumos.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
Mischief managed.
Nox.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima!
Harry.
Harry.
Harry, open the door.
Marge.
How lovely to see...
Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.
What is it?
Nothing.
School stuff.
Later perhaps, if you behave.
I will if she does.
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.
Don't say yes in that ungrateful way.
Damn good of my brother to keep you.
He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?
Give us a kiss.
Come on.
Up, up.
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
Okay.
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.
Excellent nosh, Petunia.
A bit more.
Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs.
Just a bit more.
That's a boy.
You wanna try a little drop of brandy?
A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?
What are you smirking at?
Where did you send the boy, Vernon?
St. Brutus'.
It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I've been beaten loads of times.
Excellent.
I won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it.
You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out.
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.
What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?
Nothing.
He didn't work.
He was unemployed.
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.
Don't worry.
Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.
I think it's time you went to bed.
Quiet, Vernon.
You, clean it up.
Actually, it's nothing to do with the father.
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.
If something's wrong with the bitch, then something's wrong with the pup.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Right.
Let me tell you...
Vernon!
Vernon!
Vernon, do something!
Stop!
I've got you, Marge.
I've got you.
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.
Oh, Vernon.
Oh, God.
Marge!
Please!
Marge!
Come back!
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.
- You put her right!
- No.
She deserved what she got.
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.
- Yeah?
Try me.
- They won't let you back now.
You've nowhere to go.
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.
"Welcome to the Knight Bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard.
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening."
What you doing down there?
- I fell over.
- What you fall over for?
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.
Well, come on, then.
In.
No, no, no.
I'll get this.
You get in.
Come on.
Come on.
Move on, move on.
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London.
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup make sure you eat it before it eats you.
- But the Muggles.
Can't they see us?
- Muggles?
They don't see nothing, do they?
No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel.
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!
Ten, nine, eight seven, six, five four, three, three and a half two, one and three quarters.
Yes!
Who is that?
That man.
Who is that?
Who is...?
That is Sirius Black, that is.
Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black.
He's a murderer.
Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?
He's the first one that done it.
He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.
I reckon you've heard of him.
Yeah.
Him I've heard of.
Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock.
They're getting closer, Ernie.
Ernie, they're right on top of us!
Mind your head.
Hey, guys?
Guys?
Why the long faces?
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there.
Nearly there.
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.
Mr. Potter, at last.
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!
Room 11.
Hedwig.
Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter.
He arrived here just five minutes before yourself.
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack.
The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately.
She has been properly punctured and her memory modified.
She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.
So that's that and no harm done.
Pea soup?
No, thank you.
- Minister?
- Yes?
- I don't understand.
- Understand?
I broke the law.
Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
Come now.
The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts.
On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things was very, very irresponsible.
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.
Sirius Black, you mean?
But what's he got to do with me?
Nothing, of course.
You're safe.
And that's what matters.
And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.
Hedwig.
Oh, by the way, Harry.
Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't wander.
Right!
You gonna move that bus or what?
Housekeeping.
I'll come back later.
I'm warning you, Hermione.
Keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?
- It's in his nature.
- A cat?
Is that what they told you?
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...
Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.
Harry.
Harry.
- Egypt.
What's it like?
- Brilliant.
Loads of old stuff like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.
- The day maid.
- Night maid.
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.
- Got everything?
- Yes.
- Yes?
All your books?
- It's all upstairs.
- Your clothes?
- Everything.
- Good boy.
- Thank you.
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah.
It should be great.
Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you.
But I think that you need to know the facts.
You are in danger.
Grave danger.
Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?
What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?
Thirteen years ago, when you stopped...
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.
Sorry.
When you stopped You-Know-Who Black lost everything.
But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant.
And in his mind you are the only thing that stands in the way of You-Know-Who returning to power.
And that is why he has escaped from Azkaban.
To find you.
And kill me.
Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear you won't go looking for Black.
Mr. Weasley why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
Quick.
Quick.
Ron, Ron!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Don't lose him!
I didn't mean to blow her up.
I just...
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
I was lucky not to be arrested.
I still think it was brilliant.
Come on.
Everywhere else is full.
Who do you think that is?
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?
How is it she knows everything?
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be.
Why?
I gotta tell you something.
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
- Yeah.
But they'll catch Black, won't they?
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.
Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.
Why are we stopping?
We can't be there yet.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.
Ouch, Ron.
That was my foot.
There's something moving out there.
I think someone's coming aboard.
Bloody hell!
What's happening?
Harry.
Harry, are you all right?
Thank you.
Here, eat this.
It'll help.
It's all right.
It's chocolate.
What was that thing that came?
It was a dementor.
One of the guards of Azkaban.
It's gone now.
It was searching the train for Sirius Black.
If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver.
Eat.
You'll feel better.
What happened to me?
Well, you sort of went rigid.
We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
And did either of you two you know pass out?
- No.
I felt weird, though.
Like I'd never be cheerful again.
But someone was screaming.
A woman.
No one was screaming, Harry.
Welcome!
Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.
Now, I'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast.
First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin who's kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
Good luck, professor.
Of course.
That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.
Potter.
Is it true you fainted?
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.
Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.
Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid.
Finally, on a more disquieting note at the request of the Ministry of Magic Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban until such a time as Sirius Black is captured.
The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
Now whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution.
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.
Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.
It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
But you know, happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light.
Fortuna Major.
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no.
Wait, wait.
Watch this.
- Amazing.
Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.
- Yes, all right.
Go in.
- Thank you.
Still doing that after three years.
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.
Green.
That's a monkey.
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?
Do not give him one again.
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
- Ron, catch.
- I will.
I think we have a winner.
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.
Look at him.
His face.
Welcome, my children.
In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination.
In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight.
Hello.
I am Professor Trelawney.
Together we shall cast ourselves into the future.
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves.
So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you.
What do you see?
The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read.
But first, you must broaden your minds.
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.
- Where did you come from?
- Me?
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...
Is your grandmother quite well?
I think so.
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.
Pity.
Broaden your minds.
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?
- I think you are.
- Sure.
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.
Yeah.
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.
And that there could be the sun and that's happiness.
So you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.
Give me the cup.
Oh, my dear boy.
My dear you have the Grim.
The Grin?
What's the Grin?
Not the Grin, you idiot.
The Grim.
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.
It's among the darkest omens in our world.
It's an omen of death."
You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Oh, honestly, Ron.
If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline.
Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.
Ancient Runes?
Exactly how many classes are you taking?
A fair few.
Hang on.
That's not possible.
Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.
You have to be in two classes at once.
Don't be silly.
How could anyone be in two classes at once?
"Broaden your minds.
Use your Inner Eye to see the future."
That's it.
Come on, now.
Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.
I got a real treat for you today.
A great lesson.
So follow me.
Right, you lot.
Less chattering.
Form a group over there.
And open your books to page 49.
Exactly how do we do that?
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay.
Okay.
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah.
Terribly funny.
Witty.
God, this place has gone to the dogs.
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.
Shut up, Malfoy.
Dementor!
Dementor!
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.
Yeah.
Isn't he beautiful?
Say hello to Buckbeak.
Hagrid, exactly what is that?
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.
First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
It may be the last thing you ever do.
Now, who'd like to come and say hello?
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Come on now.
Now you have to let him make the first move.
It's only polite.
So step up.
Give him a nice bow.
Then you wait and see if he bows back.
If he does, you can go and touch him.
If not...
Well, we'll get to that later.
Just make your bow.
Nice and low.
Back off, Harry.
Back off.
Keep still.
Keep still.
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.
Right.
I think you can go and pat him now.
Go on.
Don't be shy.
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow.
Slow.
Not so fast, Harry.
Slow down, Harry.
That's it...
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...
That's it...
Yes!
Well done!
Well done, Harry, well done!
Does he get to fly?
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Put you over here, just behind the wing joint.
Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that.
Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak.
That was wicked, Harry!
Oh, please.
Well done, well done.
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.
You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!
Malfoy, no...
No!
Buckbeak!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa!
Buckbeak!
Away, you silly creature...
- It's killed me!
- Calm down.
It's just a scratch!
Hagrid!
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher.
I'll do it.
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!
You and your bloody chicken!
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.
Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm.
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.
- He's been sighted!
- Who?
Sirius Black!
Dufftown?
That's not far from here.
You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?
That's right.
Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.
Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
Intriguing, isn't it?
Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what is inside?
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.
Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...
Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart.
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.
After me.
Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.
So much for the easy part.
You see, the incantation alone is not enough.
What really finishes a boggart is laughter.
You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.
Let me explain.
Neville, would you join me, please?
Come on, don't be shy.
Come on.
Come on.
Hello.
Neville, what frightens you most of all?
Professor Snape.
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.
Professor Snape.
Yes, frightens all.
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.
No it won't.
I want you to picture her clothes.
Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe here's what I want you to do.
Excuse me.
Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.
Can you do that?
Yes.
Wand at the ready.
One, two, three.
Think, Neville, think.
Riddikulus!
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible!
Okay to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...
Form a line!
I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most and turn it into something funny.
Next!
Ron!
Concentrate.
Face your fear.
Be brave!
Wand at the ready, Ron.
Riddikulus!
Yes!
You see?
Very good, very good!
Marvelous!
Absolutely, very, very enjoyable!
Parvati!
Next!
Show us what you see.
Keep your nerve.
Steady.
Riddikulus!
And next!
Step up, step up!
Wonderful, wonderful!
Here!
Riddikulus!
Right.
Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.
Collect your books from the back.
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you!
Sorry!
Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege.
Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school that privilege shall not be extended again.
No permission form signed, no visiting the village.
That's the rule, Potter.
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.
I thought if you signed it, then I could...
I can't.
Only a parent or a guardian can sign.
Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate.
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.
Forget about it, guys.
See you later.
Professor, can I ask you something?
You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?
I thought it'd be obvious.
I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.
I did think of Voldemort at first.
But then I remembered that night on the train and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.
That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.
This is very wise.
Before I fainted I heard something.
A woman screaming.
Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.
Our pain becomes their power.
I think it was my mother the night she was murdered.
The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.
Not by your scar, by your eyes.
They're your mother, Lily's.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
I knew her.
Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.
Not only was she a singularly gifted witch she was also an uncommonly kind woman.
She had a way of seeing the beauty in others even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves.
And your father, James, on the other hand he...
He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble.
A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.
You're more like them than you know, Harry.
In time, you'll come to see just how much.
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain.
I know.
What's going on?
Probably Neville forgot the password again.
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.
Let me through, please.
Excuse me!
I'm Head Boy!
Get back, all of you.
No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.
The Fat Lady!
She's gone!
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.
It's not funny, Ron.
Keep calm, everyone.
Break into fours.
Back to your common room.
- Be quiet.
- Make way.
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.
You heard.
Move!
Mr. Filch?
Round up the ghosts.
Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
There's no need for ghosts, professor.
The Fat Lady's there.
Mind where you're going!
Slow down!
You listen!
I'm Head Boy!
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!
Dear lady, who did this to you?
Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.
He's here, somewhere in the castle!
Sirius Black!
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery.
There's nothing there.
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.
I didn't really expect him to linger.
Remarkable feat, don't you think?
To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own...
Any theories on how he managed it?
Many.
Each as unlikely as the next.
You may recall prior to the start of term I expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor...
Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?
Perhaps.
But for now, let him sleep.
For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.
Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
Turn to page 394.
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?
That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?
Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time.
Turn to page 394.
"Werewolves"?
Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?
Now, which one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?
No one?
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.
An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
A werewolf has no choice.
With each full moon he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.
The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.
Are you incapable of restraining yourself or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.
As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.
Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter.
Loss of limb will not excuse you.
Page 394.
The term "werewolf" is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer" which means "man," and "wolf." Werewolf, man-wolf.
There are several ways to become a werewolf.
They include being given the power of shape-shifting being bitten by a werewolf...
Go, Harry!
Go, Harry!
Aresto momentum!
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.
Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.
Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.
You gave us a right good scare.
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.
Really?
I meant the match.
Who won?
No one blames you, Harry.
Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds.
Dumbledore's furious.
After he saved you, he sent them off.
There's something else you should know too.
When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and...
Well...
I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.
Is there no chance of fixing it?
No.
Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.
Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.
They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.
You are not weak, Harry.
Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.
Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.
You made the one on the train go away.
There was only one that night.
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.
But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.
For now, I need to rest.
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.
We'll get you there.
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- Lf you pipe down.
- Bless him.
- Let me go!
Come on, guys.
Don't...
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.
What are you doing?
!
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...
But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
George, if you will.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder's Map."
We owe them so much.
Hang on.
This is Hogwarts.
And that...
- No.
Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.
- In his study.
- Pacing.
Does that a lot.
- So this map shows...
- Everyone.
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.
- Every minute.
- Every day.
- Brilliant!
Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.
Hurry.
Filch is heading this way.
And don't forget.
When you're done, just give it a tap and say:
"Mischief managed." Otherwise, anyone can read it.
Now, how much do you want?
Delicious.
It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain.
Did I mention that?
Twice.
Do you want to move a bit closer?
To the Shrieking Shack?
Actually, I'm fine here.
Well, well.
Look who's here.
You two shopping for your new dream home?
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.
Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!
You filthy little mudblood!
Who is that?
- Don't stand there!
Do something!
- What?
What's up, Malfoy?
Lost your skis?
Get out of the way!
Move!
Malfoy!
Wait!
Wait!
Harry!
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.
Those weasels!
Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
He won't keep it.
He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.
- Aren't you?
- Sure.
Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
Look who it is.
Madam Rosmerta.
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!
Allow me, minister.
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors into my pub every other night!
- We have...
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
And what would bring him here?
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?
Come.
Harry!
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!
- So rude.
- Thick heads.
- Thick heads?
!
- How dare they!
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!
Nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place.
Tell me what this is all about.
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death...
Remember?
They hid.
Few knew where they were.
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.
Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night he also killed Peter Pettigrew!
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.
Never let James and Sirius out of his sight.
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters and might have, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.
He destroyed him!
A finger.
That's all that was left.
A finger.
Nothing else.
Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.
- What could be worse?
- This:
Sirius Black was and remains to this day Harry Potter's godfather!
Ron, look!
- Sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.
Harry, what happened?
He was their friend and he betrayed them.
He was their friend!
I hope he finds me.
Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!
Harry.
There you are.
You came.
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level.
I'm sure.
Well, everything's prepared.
The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm.
Did you ever hear of it?
No?
Well...
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.
But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory.
Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.
Can you do this?
Yes.
Very well.
Close your eyes.
Concentrate.
Explore your past.
Do you have a memory?
Allow it to fill you up.
Lose yourself within it.
Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum.
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.
Shall we?
Wand at the ready.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto...
Expecto...
Expect...
Here we go.
Come on.
Sit up.
Deep breaths.
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to do it the first time.
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this.
You'll feel better.
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.
As a matter of interest, what were you thinking?
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.
Well, it is.
It's the happiest I've ever felt but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?
Then let's give it a try.
You feel ready?
Just do it.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto Patronum!
Yes!
Well done, Harry.
Well done!
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes.
Sit down.
Here.
Eat this, it helps.
It really helps.
And just so you know, Harry I think you'd have given your father a run for his money.
And that is saying something.
I was thinking of him.
And Mum.
Seeing their faces.
They were talking to me.
Just talking.
That's the memory I chose.
I don't even know if it's real.
But it's the best I have.
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.
Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.
- Did.
- Didn't.
How did it go, Hagrid?
The hearing?
Well, first off, the committee members took turns talking about why we were there.
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers.
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.
He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you.
And then?
And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
Spiders!
There's...
There's spiders.
Spiders.
They want me to tap-dance.
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- Tell those spiders.
Right, yeah.
Tell them.
I'll tell them...
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.
He didn 't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!
Mischief managed.
Nox.
Potter.
What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
I was sleepwalking.
How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter.
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.
My dad didn't strut.
And nor do I.
If you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.
Turn out your pockets.
Turn out your pockets!
What's this?
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really?
Open it.
Reveal your secrets.
Read it.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."
Go on.
"And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business."
- You insolent little...
- Professor!
Well, well.
Lupin.
Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?
Harry, are you all right?
That remains to be seen.
I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.
It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.
Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.
It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise.
Harry, would you come with me, please?
Professor, good night.
Are you deaf?
Put that light out!
Come in.
I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in.
Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black is a map to you?
- No.
- No, sir.
Your father never set much store by the rules either.
But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.
Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!
Now, I will not cover up for you again.
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.
I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.
Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works.
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.
Oh, really?
And who might that be?
Peter Pettigrew.
That's not possible.
It's just what I saw.
Good night, professor.
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.
The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.
Only then can you see.
Try again.
Now, what do we have here?
Do you mind me trying?
The Grim, possibly.
My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.
You may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave.
Have I said something?
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental but now it's in the open for everyone to see.
Hang on.
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.
- Fine.
See you later.
- See you.
Harry Potter...
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.
Sorry?
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder shall break free.
Innocent blood shall be spilt and servant and master shall be reunited once more.
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?
No.
Nothing.
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak.
It's just too horrible.
- It just got worse.
- What did I say?
Father said I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.
This is going to be rich.
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?
You!
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
Malfoy, are you okay?
- Let's go.
Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Look at him.
Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
Why don't we just set him free?
They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.
Says he wants to be with me when they...
When it happens.
Great man, Dumbledore.
A great man.
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!
Think I want you seeing something like that?
No.
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh.
Before you do, Ron...
Scabbers!
You're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.
Right.
Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.
I meant me!
Blimey.
What was that?
Hagrid!
Oh, crikey.
No, minister.
Over this way.
It's late.
It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.
Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble.
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!
Quick.
Quick!
Hagrid.
- It'll be fine.
It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.
- On the slope...
Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.
- Good evening.
- Minister.
Make your way through.
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.
Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we?
Very well.
It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak hereinafter called "the condemned," shall be executed this day at sundown.
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid.
Now, come on.
- All right.
It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go!
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Oh, no.
He bit me.
Scabbers.
Ron.
Ron!
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.
Wait!
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
That's not good.
Ron, run!
Harry, Hermione, run!
It's the Grim!
- Harry!
- Ron!
Ron, wait!
Harry!
- Help!
- Ron!
- Ron.
Ron.
- Ron!
Come on!
Move!
Duck!
Harry!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.
I just hope I'm wrong.
We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
Come on.
Ron.
- Ron.
You're okay.
- The dog.
Where is it?
It's a trap.
He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.
If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!
No.
Only one will die tonight.
Then it'll be you!
Are you going to kill me, Harry?
Expelliarmus!
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?
Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within.
Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you?
- I found him.
- I know.
- It's him.
- I understand.
- Let's kill him!
- No!
I trusted you!
And all this time, you've been his friend.
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.
How long have you known?
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.
You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!
Twelve years of it!
In Azkaban!
Very well.
Kill him.
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.
I know why.
You betrayed my parents.
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.
Somebody did betray your parents somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!
And he's in this room!
Right now!
Come out, come out, Peter!
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!
Vengeance is sweet.
How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
Severus...
I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle.
Here's the proof.
Brilliant, Snape.
You've put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion.
If you'll excuse us, Remus and I have business to attend to.
- Give me a reason.
I beg you!
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it.
It's habit.
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!
You two, quarrelling like an old married couple.
Run along and play with your chemistry set!
I could do it, you know.
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.
A Dementor's Kiss.
One can only imagine what that must be like.
It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.
Severus, please.
After you.
Expelliarmus!
- Harry!
What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.
We thought he was our friend!
- No.
Pettigrew's dead.
You killed him!
- No, he didn't.
I thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map!
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!
- Me?
!
He's mental!
- Not you!
Your rat!
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?
Curiously long life for a common garden rat!
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!
Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?
Scabbers!
Leave him alone!
Get off him!
What are you doing?
Remus?
Sirius.
My old friends!
Harry!
Look at you.
You look so much like your father.
- James.
We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!
How dare you talk about James in front of him!
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!
The Dark Lord.
You have no idea the weapons he possesses!
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!
James wouldn't have wanted me killed!
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!
Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would.
Together!
No!
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.
But we'll take him to the castle.
- Bless you, boy.
Bless you!
- Get off!
I said we'd take you to the castle.
After that, the dementors can have you.
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.
A bit?
A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!
I was going for the rat.
Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog.
More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent.
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.
Okay.
- You better go.
- No.
Don't worry, okay?
It's fine.
I'll stay.
You go, I'll stay.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
Go.
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.
They might chop it.
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
It's too late.
It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.
It'll be nice to do it again as a free man.
That was a noble thing you did back there.
He doesn't deserve it.
I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends to become killers.
Besides, dead, the truth dies with him.
Alive, you're free.
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!
Ron!
Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!
- Sweet, clever girl!
Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!
I don't know if you know, Harry but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather.
I know.
I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle but if you ever wanted a different home...
What?
Come and live with you?
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.
Harry!
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live!
Here!
This flesh is only flesh!
Expelliarmus!
Harry!
Remus!
Remus!
Run!
Run!
- Come on.
- Wait.
Wait.
Hermione!
Bad idea.
Bad idea.
Professor?
Professor Lupin?
Nice doggy.
Nice doggy!
There you are, Potter!
Sirius!
Come back here, Potter!
Sirius!
No.
Sirius!
Expecto Patronum!
Harry?
I saw my dad.
What?
He sent the dementors away.
I saw him across the lake.
Harry, they've captured Sirius.
Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.
- They're gonna kill him?
- No.
It's worse.
Much worse.
They're going to suck out his soul.
Headmaster, stop them.
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true.
Sirius is innocent.
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?
He's my rat, sir.
He's not really a rat.
He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.
But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.
A child's voice, however honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.
Mysterious thing, time.
Powerful and when meddled with, dangerous.
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen.
And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime.
If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss.
If you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared.
Three turns should do it, I think.
Oh, and by the way.
When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin.
Good luck.
What the bloody hell was that all about?
Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk...
What just happened?
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.
Where were we at 7:30?
I don't know.
Going to Hagrid's?
Come on.
And we can't be seen.
Hermione!
Hermione!
Hermione, wait.
Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
That's us.
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
This is not normal.
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first term.
This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.
Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.
Good punch.
Thanks.
Malfoy's coming.
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood!
Mark my words.
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Come on.
We should be at Hagrid's.
Look.
Buckbeak's still alive.
Of course.
Remember what Dumbledore said?
If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.
Let's go.
Here they come.
I'd better hurry.
Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.
Scabbers, you're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.
If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad.
Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time.
We can't be seen.
Fudge is coming.
And we aren't leaving?
Why aren't we leaving?
Are you mad?
That hurt.
Sorry.
We're coming out the back door.
Go!
Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go.
Okay, go, Harry.
Go!
Get away.
Get off.
Minister, I really think I should sign as well.
Yes, very well.
Perhaps it would be...
Okay, Buckbeak.
Come quickly.
Come with us now.
Come on.
Keep trying.
Come on.
Quickly.
Buckbeak.
Okay?
Quickly.
Hurry up.
Okay?
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.
Come and get the nice dead ferret.
- Come on.
It's here.
Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister.
Follow me.
- Now, look there.
- Where?
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?
Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
- Oh, yes.
Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.
- Come on, Buckbeak.
Come on.
- I see no strawberries.
- Over there.
- Where?
- Over there.
- This way.
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.
But where is it?
I saw the beast, just now.
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.
Buckbeak.
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.
I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.
- Right.
- Well, well.
We must search the grounds.
Well, search the skies, if you must, minister.
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy.
Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required.
Thank you.
You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor.
- Come on.
- This way.
This way, now.
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.
- How?
- No idea.
- Look.
It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!
And Snape's coming.
And now we wait.
And now we wait.
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.
- Hermione?
- Yeah?
Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius I did see someone.
That someone made the dementors go away.
With a Patronus.
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
According to him only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
It was my dad.
My dad conjured the Patronus.
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead.
I know.
I'm just telling you what I saw.
Here we come.
You see Sirius talking to me there?
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'.
It'll just be me and him.
We could live in the country someplace you can see the sky.
He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
Harry!
Run!
Let's go.
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.
Thanks.
- Great.
Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that.
Run!
That was so scary.
Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
Sirius.
Come on!
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.
Any minute now.
Right there.
You'll see.
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.
- Sirius.
- You're dying both of you.
Harry!
Expecto Patronum!
You were right, Hermione.
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!
I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.
I knew I could do it this time because well, I had already done it.
- Does that make sense?
- No.
But I don't like flying...!
Bombarda!
I'll be forever grateful for this to both of you.
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.
For some time, my life will be too unpredictable.
And besides you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.
And you know it.
And for now, that will do.
I expect you're tired of hearing this but you look so like your father.
Except your eyes.
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.
It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little.
But know this:
The ones that love us never really leave us.
And you can always find them in here.
You really are the brightest witch of your age.
We have to go.
- Well?
- He's free.
We did it.
Did what?
Good night.
How did you get there?
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.
Honestly, Ron.
How can somebody be in two places at once?
Hello, Harry.
I saw you coming.
I've looked worse, believe me.
- You've been sacked.
- No.
No.
I resigned, actually.
Resigned?
Why?
Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition.
This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want well, someone like me teaching their children.
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already risked enough on my behalf.
Besides, people like me are...
Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now.
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
None of it made any difference.
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.
You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.
It made a great deal of difference.
If I am proud of anything it is of how much you have learned this year.
Now, since I am no longer your teacher I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you.
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
Until then mischief managed.
Stand back, I said!
Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle.
Harry.
Wherever did you get it?
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.
Did not.
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.
For me?
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.
This came with it.
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.
How fast is it, Harry?
Lumos.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
Mischief managed.
Nox.
23.976
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima!
Harry.
Harry.
Harry, open the door.
Marge.
How lovely to see...
Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.
What is it?
Nothing.
School stuff.
Later perhaps, if you behave.
I will if she does.
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.
Don't say yes in that ungrateful way.
Damn good of my brother to keep you.
He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?
Give us a kiss.
Come on.
Up, up.
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
Okay.
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.
Excellent nosh, Petunia.
A bit more.
Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs.
Just a bit more.
That's a boy.
You wanna try a little drop of brandy?
A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?
What are you smirking at?
Where did you send the boy, Vernon?
St. Brutus'.
It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I've been beaten loads of times.
Excellent.
I won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it.
You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out.
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.
What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?
Nothing.
He didn't work.
He was unemployed.
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.
Don't worry.
Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.
I think it's time you went to bed.
Quiet, Vernon.
You, clean it up.
Actually, it's nothing to do with the father.
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.
If something's wrong with the bitch, then something's wrong with the pup.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Right.
Let me tell you...
Vernon!
Vernon!
Vernon, do something!
Stop!
I've got you, Marge.
I've got you.
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.
Oh, Vernon.
Oh, God.
Marge!
Please!
Marge!
Come back!
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.
- You put her right!
- No.
She deserved what she got.
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.
- Yeah?
Try me.
- They won't let you back now.
You've nowhere to go.
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.
"Welcome to the Knight Bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard.
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening."
What you doing down there?
- I fell over.
- What you fell over for?
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.
Well, come on, then.
In.
No, no, no.
I'll get this.
You get in.
Come on.
Come on.
Move on, move on.
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London.
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup make sure you eat it before it eats you.
- But the Muggles.
Can't they see us?
- Muggles?
They don't see nothing, do they?
No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel.
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!
Ten, nine, eight seven, six, five four, three, three and a half two, one and three quarters.
Yes!
Who is that?
That man.
Who is that?
Who is...?
That is Sirius Black, that is.
Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black.
He's a murderer.
Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?
He's the first one that done it.
He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.
I reckon you've heard of him.
Yeah.
Him I've heard of.
Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock.
They're getting closer, Ernie.
Ernie, they're right on top of us!
Mind your head.
Hey, guys?
Guys?
Why the long faces?
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there.
Nearly there.
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.
Mr. Potter, at last.
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!
Room 11.
Hedwig.
Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter.
He arrived here just five minutes before yourself.
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack.
The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately.
She has been properly punctured and her memory modified.
She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.
So that's that and no harm done.
Pea soup?
No, thank you.
- Minister?
- Yes?
- I don't understand.
- Understand?
I broke the law.
Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
Come now.
The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts.
On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things was very, very irresponsible.
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.
Sirius Black, you mean?
But what's he got to do with me?
Nothing, of course.
You're safe.
And that's what matters.
And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.
Hedwig.
Oh, by the way, Harry.
Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't wander.
Right!
You gonna move that bus or what?
Housekeeping.
I'll come back later.
I'm warning you, Hermione.
Keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?
- It's in his nature.
- A cat?
Is that what they told you?
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...
Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.
Harry.
Harry.
- Egypt.
What's it like?
- Brilliant.
Loads of old stuff like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.
- The day maid.
- Night maid.
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.
- Got everything?
- Yes.
- Yes?
All your books?
- It's all upstairs.
- Your clothes?
- Everything.
- Good boy.
- Thank you.
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah.
It should be great.
Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you.
But I think that you need to know the facts.
You are in danger.
Grave danger.
Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?
What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?
Thirteen years ago, when you stopped...
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.
Sorry.
When you stopped You-Know-Who Black lost everything.
But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant.
And in his mind you are the only thing that stands in the way of You-Know-Who returning to power.
And that is why he has escaped from Azkaban.
To find you.
And kill me.
Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear you won't go looking for Black.
Mr. Weasley why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
Quick.
Quick.
Ron, Ron!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Don't lose him!
I didn't mean to blow her up.
I just...
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
I was lucky not to be arrested.
I still think it was brilliant.
Come on.
Everywhere else is full.
Who do you think that is?
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?
How is it she knows everything?
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be.
Why?
I gotta tell you something.
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
- Yeah.
But they'll catch Black, won't they?
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.
Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.
Why are we stopping?
We can't be there yet.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.
Ouch, Ron.
That was my foot.
There's something moving out there.
I think someone's coming aboard.
Bloody hell!
What's happening?
Harry.
Harry, are you all right?
Thank you.
Here, eat this.
It'll help.
It's all right.
It's chocolate.
What was that thing that came?
It was a dementor.
One of the guards of Azkaban.
It's gone now.
It was searching the train for Sirius Black.
If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver.
Eat.
You'll feel better.
What happened to me?
Well, you sort of went rigid.
We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
And did either of you two you know pass out?
- No.
I felt weird, though.
Like I'd never be cheerful again.
But someone was screaming.
A woman.
No one was screaming, Harry.
Welcome!
Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.
Now, I'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast.
First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin who's kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
Good luck, professor.
Of course.
That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.
Potter.
Is it true you fainted?
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.
Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.
Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid.
Finally, on a more disquieting note at the request of the Ministry of Magic Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban until such a time as Sirius Black is captured.
The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
Now whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution.
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.
Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.
It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
But you know, happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light.
Fortuna Major.
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no.
Wait, wait.
Watch this.
- Amazing.
Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.
- Yes, all right.
Go in.
- Thank you.
Still doing that after three years.
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.
Green.
That's a monkey.
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?
Do not give him one again.
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
- Ron, catch.
- I will.
I think we have a winner.
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.
Look at him.
His face.
Welcome, my children.
In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination.
In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight.
Hello.
I am Professor Trelawney.
Together we shall cast ourselves into the future.
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves.
So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you.
What do you see?
The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read.
But first, you must broaden your minds.
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.
- Where did you come from?
- Me?
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...
Is your grandmother quite well?
I think so.
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.
Pity.
Broaden your minds.
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?
- I think you are.
- Sure.
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.
Yeah.
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.
And that there could be the sun and that's happiness.
So you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.
Give me the cup.
Oh, my dear boy.
My dear you have the Grim.
The Grin?
What's the Grin?
Not the Grin, you idiot.
The Grim.
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.
It's among the darkest omens in our world.
It's an omen of death."
You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Oh, honestly, Ron.
If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline.
Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.
Ancient Runes?
Exactly how many classes are you taking?
A fair few.
Hang on.
That's not possible.
Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.
You have to be in two classes at once.
Don't be silly.
How could anyone be in two classes at once?
"Broaden your minds.
Use your Inner Eye to see the future."
That's it.
Come on, now.
Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.
I got a real treat for you today.
A great lesson.
So follow me.
Right, you lot.
Less chattering.
Form a group over there.
And open your books to page 49.
Exactly how do we do that?
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay.
Okay.
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah.
Terribly funny.
Witty.
God, this place has gone to the dogs.
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.
Shut up, Malfoy.
Dementor!
Dementor!
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.
Yeah.
Isn't he beautiful?
Say hello to Buckbeak.
Hagrid, exactly what is that?
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.
First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
It may be the last thing you ever do.
Now, who'd like to come and say hello?
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Come on now.
Now you have to let him make the first move.
It's only polite.
So step up.
Give him a nice bow.
Then you wait and see if he bows back.
If he does, you can go and touch him.
If not...
Well, we'll get to that later.
Just make your bow.
Nice and low.
Back off, Harry.
Back off.
Keep still.
Keep still.
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.
Right.
I think you can go and pat him now.
Go on.
Don't be shy.
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow.
Slow.
Not so fast, Harry.
Slow down, Harry.
That's it...
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...
That's it...
Yes!
Well done!
Well done, Harry, well done!
Does he get to fly?
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Put you over here, just behind the wing joint.
Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that.
Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak.
That was wicked, Harry!
Oh, please.
Well done, well done.
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.
You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!
Malfoy, no...
No!
Buckbeak!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa!
Buckbeak!
Away, you silly creature...
- It's killed me!
- Calm down.
It's just a scratch!
Hagrid!
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher.
I'll do it.
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!
You and your bloody chicken!
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.
Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm.
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.
- He's been sighted!
- Who?
Sirius Black!
Dufftown?
That's not far from here.
You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?
That's right.
Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.
Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
Intriguing, isn't it?
Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what is inside?
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.
Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...
Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart.
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.
After me.
Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.
So much for the easy part.
You see, the incantation alone is not enough.
What really finishes a boggart is laughter.
You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.
Let me explain.
Neville, would you join me, please?
Come on, don't be shy.
Come on.
Come on.
Hello.
Neville, what frightens you most of all?
Professor Snape.
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.
Professor Snape.
Yes, frightens all.
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.
No it won't.
I want you to picture her clothes.
Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe here's what I want you to do.
Excuse me.
Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.
Can you do that?
Yes.
Wand at the ready.
One, two, three.
Think, Neville, think.
Riddikulus!
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible!
Okay to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...
Form a line!
I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most and turn it into something funny.
Next!
Ron!
Concentrate.
Face your fear.
Be brave!
Wand at the ready, Ron.
Riddikulus!
Yes!
You see?
Very good, very good!
Marvelous!
Absolutely, very, very enjoyable!
Parvati!
Next!
Show us what you see.
Keep your nerve.
Steady.
Riddikulus!
And next!
Step up, step up!
Wonderful, wonderful!
Here!
Riddikulus!
Right.
Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.
Collect your books from the back.
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you!
Sorry!
Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege.
Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school that privilege shall not be extended again.
No permission form signed, no visiting the village.
That's the rule, Potter.
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.
I thought if you signed it, then I could...
I can't.
Only a parent or a guardian can sign.
Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate.
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.
Forget about it, guys.
See you later.
Professor, can I ask you something?
You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?
I thought it'd be obvious.
I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.
I did think of Voldemort at first.
But then I remembered that night on the train and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.
That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.
This is very wise.
Before I fainted I heard something.
A woman screaming.
Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.
Our pain becomes their power.
I think it was my mother the night she was murdered.
The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.
Not by your scar, by your eyes.
They're your mother, Lily's.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
I knew her.
Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.
Not only was she a singularly gifted witch she was also an uncommonly kind woman.
She had a way of seeing the beauty in others even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves.
And your father, James, on the other hand he...
He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble.
A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.
You're more like them than you know, Harry.
In time, you'll come to see just how much.
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain.
I know.
What's going on?
Probably Neville forgot the password again.
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.
Let me through, please.
Excuse me!
I'm Head Boy!
Get back, all of you.
No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.
The Fat Lady!
She's gone!
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.
It's not funny, Ron.
Keep calm, everyone.
Break into fours.
Back to your common room.
- Be quiet.
- Make way.
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.
You heard.
Move!
Mr. Filch?
Round up the ghosts.
Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
There's no need for ghosts, professor.
The Fat Lady's there.
Mind where you're going!
Slow down!
You listen!
I'm Head Boy!
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!
Dear lady, who did this to you?
Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.
He's here, somewhere in the castle!
Sirius Black!
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery.
There's nothing there.
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.
I didn't really expect him to linger.
Remarkable feat, don't you think?
To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own...
Any theories on how he managed it?
Many.
Each as unlikely as the next.
You may recall prior to the start of term I expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor...
Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?
Perhaps.
But for now, let him sleep.
For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.
Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
Turn to page 394.
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?
That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?
Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time.
Turn to page 394.
"Werewolves"?
Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?
Now, which one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?
No one?
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.
An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
A werewolf has no choice.
With each full moon he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.
The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.
Are you incapable of restraining yourself or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.
As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.
Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter.
Loss of limb will not excuse you.
Page 394.
The term "werewolf" is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer" which means "man," and "wolf." Werewolf, man-wolf.
There are several ways to become a werewolf.
They include being given the power of shape-shifting being bitten by a werewolf...
Go, Harry!
Go, Harry!
Aresto momentum!
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.
Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.
Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.
You gave us a right good scare.
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.
Really?
I meant the match.
Who won?
No one blames you, Harry.
Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds.
Dumbledore's furious.
After he saved you, he sent them off.
There's something else you should know too.
When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and...
Well...
I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.
Is there no chance of fixing it?
No.
Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.
Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.
They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.
You are not weak, Harry.
Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.
Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.
You made the one on the train go away.
There was only one that night.
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.
But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.
For now, I need to rest.
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.
We'll get you there.
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- lf you pipe down.
- Bless him.
- Let me go!
Come on, guys.
Don't...
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.
What are you doing?
!
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...
But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
George, if you will.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder's Map."
We owe them so much.
Hang on.
This is Hogwarts.
And that...
- No.
Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.
- In his study.
- Pacing.
Does that a lot.
- So this map shows...?
- Everyone.
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.
- Every minute.
- Every day.
- Brilliant!
Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.
Hurry.
Filch is heading this way.
And don't forget.
When you're done, just give it a tap and say:
"Mischief managed." Otherwise, anyone can read it.
Now, how much do you want?
Delicious.
It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain.
Did I mention that?
Twice.
Do you want to move a bit closer?
To the Shrieking Shack?
Actually, I'm fine here.
Well, well.
Look who's here.
You two shopping for your new dream home?
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.
Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!
You filthy little mudblood!
Who is that?
- Don't stand there!
Do something!
- What?
What's up, Malfoy?
Lost your skis?
Get out of the way!
Move!
Malfoy!
Wait!
Wait!
Harry!
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.
Those weasels!
Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
He won't keep it.
He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.
- Aren't you?
- Sure.
Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
Look who it is.
Madam Rosmerta.
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!
Allow me, minister.
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors into my pub every other night!
- We have...
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
And what would bring him here?
And what would bring him here?
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?
Come.
Harry!
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!
- So rude.
- Thick heads.
- Thick heads?
!
- How dare they!
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!
Nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place.
Tell me what this is all about.
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death...
Remember?
They hid.
Few knew where they were.
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.
Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night he also killed Peter Pettigrew!
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.
Never let James and Sirius out of his sight.
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters and might have, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.
He destroyed him!
A finger.
That's all that was left.
A finger.
Nothing else.
Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.
- What could be worse?
- This:
Sirius Black was and remains to this day Harry Potter's godfather!
Ron, look!
- Sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.
Harry, what happened?
He was their friend and he betrayed them.
He was their friend!
I hope he finds me.
Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!
Harry.
There you are.
You came.
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level.
I'm sure.
Well, everything's prepared.
The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm.
Did you ever hear of it?
No?
Well...
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.
But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory.
Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.
Can you do this?
Yes.
Very well.
Close your eyes.
Concentrate.
Explore your past.
Do you have a memory?
Allow it to fill you up.
Lose yourself within it.
Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum.
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.
Shall we?
Wand at the ready.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto...
Expecto...
Expect...
Here we go.
Come on.
Sit up.
Deep breaths.
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to do it the first time.
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this.
You'll feel better.
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.
As a matter of interest, what were you thinking?
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.
Well, it is.
It's the happiest I've ever felt but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?
Then let's give it a try.
You feel ready?
Just do it.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto Patronum!
Yes!
Well done, Harry.
Well done!
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes.
Sit down.
Here.
Eat this, it helps.
It really helps.
And just so you know, Harry I think you'd have given your father a run for his money.
And that is saying something.
I was thinking of him.
And Mum.
Seeing their faces.
They were talking to me.
Just talking.
That's the memory I chose.
I don't even know if it's real.
But it's the best I have.
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.
Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.
- Did.
- Didn't.
How did it go, Hagrid?
The hearing?
Well, first off, the committee members took turns talking about why we were there.
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers.
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.
He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you.
And then?
And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
Spiders!
There's...
There's spiders.
Spiders.
They want me to tap-dance.
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- You tell those spiders.
Right, yeah.
Tell them.
I'll tell them...
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!
Mischief managed.
Nox.
Potter.
What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
I was sleepwalking.
How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter.
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.
My dad didn't strut.
And nor do I.
Now, if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.
Turn out your pockets.
Turn out your pockets!
What's this?
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really?
Open it.
Reveal your secrets.
Read it.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."
Go on.
"And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business."
- You insolent little...
- Professor!
Well, well.
Lupin.
Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?
Harry, are you all right?
That remains to be seen.
I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.
It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.
Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.
It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise.
Harry, would you come with me, please?
Professor, good night.
Are you deaf?
Put that light out!
Come in.
I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in.
Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black is a map to you?
- No.
- No, sir.
Your father never set much store by the rules either.
But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.
Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!
Now, I will not cover up for you again.
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.
I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.
Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works.
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.
Oh, really?
And who might that be?
Peter Pettigrew.
That's not possible.
It's just what I saw.
Good night, professor.
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.
The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.
Only then can you see.
Try again.
Now, what do we have here?
Do you mind me trying?
The Grim, possibly.
My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.
You may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave.
Have I said something?
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental but now it's in the open for everyone to see.
Hang on.
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.
- Fine.
See you later.
- See you.
Harry Potter...
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.
Sorry?
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder shall break free.
Innocent blood shall be spilt and servant and master shall be reunited once more.
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?
No.
Nothing.
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak.
It's just too horrible.
- It just got worse.
- What did I say?
Father said I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.
This is going to be rich.
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?
You!
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
Malfoy, are you okay?
- Let's go.
Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Look at him.
Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
Why don't we just set him free?
They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.
Says he wants to be with me when they...
When it happens.
Great man, Dumbledore.
A great man.
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!
Think I want you seeing something like that?
No.
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh.
Before you do, Ron...
Scabbers!
You're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.
Right.
Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.
I meant me!
Blimey.
What was that?
Hagrid!
Oh, crikey.
No, minister.
Over this way.
It's late.
It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.
Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble.
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!
Quick.
Quick!
Hagrid.
- It'll be fine.
It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.
- On the slope...
Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.
- Good evening.
- Minister.
Make your way through.
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.
Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we?
Very well.
It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak hereinafter called "the condemned," shall be executed this day at sundown.
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid.
Now, come on.
- All right.
It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go!
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Oh, no.
He bit me.
Scabbers.
Ron.
Ron!
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.
Wait!
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
That's not good.
Ron, run!
Harry, Hermione, run!
It's the Grim!
- Harry!
- Ron!
Ron, wait!
Harry!
- Help!
- Ron!
- Ron.
Ron.
- Ron!
Come on!
Move!
Duck!
Harry!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.
I just hope I'm wrong.
We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
Come on.
Ron.
- Ron.
You're okay.
- The dog.
Where is it?
It's a trap.
He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.
If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!
No.
Only one will die tonight.
Then it'll be you!
Are you going to kill me, Harry?
Expelliarmus!
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?
Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within.
Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you?
- I found him.
- I know.
- He's here.
- I understand.
- Let's kill him!
- No!
I trusted you!
And all this time, you've been his friend.
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.
How long have you known?
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.
You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!
Twelve years of it!
In Azkaban!
Very well.
Kill him.
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.
I know why.
You betrayed my parents.
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.
Somebody did betray your parents somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!
And he's in this room!
Right now!
Come out, come out, Peter!
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!
Vengeance is sweet.
How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
Severus...
I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle.
Here's the proof.
Brilliant, Snape.
You put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion.
If you'll excuse us, Remus and I have business to attend to.
- Give me a reason.
I beg you!
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it.
It's habit.
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!
You two, quarrelling like an old married couple.
Run along and play with your chemistry set!
I could do it, you know.
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.
A Dementor's Kiss.
One can only imagine what that must be like.
It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.
Severus, please.
After you.
Expelliarmus!
- Harry!
What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.
We thought he was our friend!
- No.
Pettigrew's dead.
You killed him!
- No, he didn't.
I thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map!
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!
- Me?
!
He's mental!
- Not you!
Your rat!
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?
Curiously long life for a common garden rat!
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!
Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?
Scabbers!
Leave him alone!
Get off him!
What are you doing?
Remus?
Sirius.
My old friends!
Harry!
Look at you.
You look so much like your father.
- James.
We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!
How dare you talk about James in front of him!
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!
The Dark Lord.
You have no idea the weapons he possesses!
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!
James wouldn't have wanted me killed!
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!
Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would.
Together!
No!
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.
But we'll take him to the castle.
- Bless you, boy.
Bless you!
- Get off!
I said we'd take you to the castle.
After that, the dementors can have you.
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.
A bit?
A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!
I was going for the rat.
Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog.
More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent.
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.
Okay.
- You better go.
- No.
Don't worry, okay?
It's fine.
I'll stay.
You go, I'll stay.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
Go.
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.
They might chop it.
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
It's too late.
It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.
It'll be nice to do it again as a free man.
That was a noble thing you did back there.
He doesn't deserve it.
I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends to become killers.
Besides, dead, the truth dies with him.
Alive, you're free.
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!
Ron!
Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!
- Sweet, clever girl!
Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!
I don't know if you know, Harry but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather.
I know.
I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle but if you ever wanted a different home...
What?
Come and live with you?
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.
Harry!
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live!
Here!
This flesh is only flesh!
Expelliarmus!
Harry!
Remus!
Remus!
Run!
Run!
- Come on.
- Wait.
Wait.
Hermione!
Bad idea.
Bad idea.
Professor?
Professor Lupin?
Nice doggy.
Nice doggy!
There you are, Potter!
Sirius!
Come back here, Potter!
Sirius!
No.
Sirius!
Expecto Patronum!
Harry?
I saw my dad.
What?
He sent the dementors away.
I saw him across the lake.
Harry, they've captured Sirius.
Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.
- They're gonna kill him?
- No.
It's worse.
Much worse.
They're going to suck out his soul.
Headmaster, stop them.
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true.
Sirius is innocent.
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?
He's my rat, sir.
He's not really a rat.
He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.
But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.
A child's voice, however honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.
Mysterious thing, time.
Powerful and when meddled with, dangerous.
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen.
And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime.
If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss.
If you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared.
Three turns should do it, I think.
Oh, and by the way.
When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin.
Good luck.
What the bloody hell was that all about?
Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk...
What just happened?
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.
Where were we at 7:30?
I don't know.
Going to Hagrid's?
Come on.
And we can't be seen.
Hermione!
Hermione!
Hermione, wait.
Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
That's us.
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
This is not normal.
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first term.
This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.
Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.
Good punch.
Thanks.
Malfoy's coming.
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood!
Mark my words.
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Come on.
We should be at Hagrid's.
Look.
Buckbeak's still alive.
Of course.
Remember what Dumbledore said?
If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.
Let's go.
Here they come.
I'd better hurry.
Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.
Scabbers, you're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.
If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad.
Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time.
We can't be seen.
Fudge is coming.
And we aren't leaving?
Why aren't we leaving?
Are you mad?
That hurt.
Sorry.
We're coming out the back door.
Go!
Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go.
Okay, go, Harry.
Go!
Get away.
Get off.
Minister, I really think I should sign as well.
Yes, very well.
Perhaps it would be...
Okay, Buckbeak.
Come quickly.
Come with us now.
Come on.
Keep trying.
Come on.
Quickly.
Buckbeak.
Okay?
Quickly.
Hurry up.
Okay?
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.
Come and get the nice dead ferret.
- Come on.
It's here.
Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister.
Follow me.
- Now, look there.
- Where?
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?
Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
- Oh, yes.
Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.
- Come on, Buckbeak.
Come on.
- I see no strawberries.
- Over there.
- Where?
- Over there.
- This way.
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.
But where is it?
I saw the beast, just now.
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.
Buckbeak.
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.
I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.
- Right.
- Well, well...
We must search the grounds.
Well, search the skies, if you must, minister.
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy.
Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required.
Thank you.
You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor.
- Come on.
- This way.
This way, now.
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.
- How?
- No idea.
- Look.
It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!
And Snape's coming.
And now we wait.
And now we wait.
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.
- Hermione?
- Yeah?
Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius I did see someone.
That someone made the dementors go away.
With a Patronus.
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
According to him only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
It was my dad.
My dad conjured the Patronus.
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead.
I know.
I'm just telling you what I saw.
Here we come.
You see Sirius talking to me there?
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'.
It'll just be me and him.
We could live in the country someplace you can see the sky.
He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
Harry!
Run!
Let's go.
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.
Thanks.
- Great.
Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that.
Run!
That was so scary.
Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
Sirius.
Come on!
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.
Any minute now.
Right there.
You'll see.
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.
- Sirius.
- You're dying both of you.
Harry!
Expecto Patronum!
You were right, Hermione.
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!
I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.
I knew I could do it this time because well, I had already done it.
- Does that make sense?
- No.
But I don't like flying...!
Bombarda!
I'll be forever grateful for this to both of you.
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.
For some time, my life will be too unpredictable.
And besides you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.
And you know it.
And for now, that will do.
I expect you're tired of hearing this but you look so like your father.
Except your eyes.
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.
It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little.
But know this:
The ones that love us never really leave us.
And you can always find them in here.
You really are the brightest witch of your age.
We have to go.
- Well?
- He's free.
We did it.
Did what?
Good night.
How did you get there?
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.
Honestly, Ron.
How can somebody be in two places at once?
Hello, Harry.
I saw you coming.
I've looked worse, believe me.
- You've been sacked.
- No.
No.
I resigned, actually.
Resigned?
Why?
Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition.
This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want well, someone like me teaching their children.
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already risked enough on my behalf.
Besides, people like me are...
Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now.
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
None of it made any difference.
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.
You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.
It made a great deal of difference.
If I am proud of anything it is of how much you have learned this year.
Now, since I am no longer your teacher I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you.
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
Until then mischief managed.
Stand back, I said!
Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle.
Harry.
Wherever did you get it?
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.
Did not.
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.
For me?
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.
This came with it.
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.
How fast is it, Harry?
Lumos.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
Mischief managed.
Nox.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima!
Harry.
Harry.
Harry, open the door.
Marge.
How lovely to see...
Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.
What is it?
Nothing.
School stuff.
Later perhaps, if you behave.
I will if she does.
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.
Don't say yes in that ungrateful way.
Damn good of my brother to keep you.
He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?
Give us a kiss.
Come on.
Up, up.
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
Okay.
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.
Excellent nosh, Petunia.
A bit more.
Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs.
Just a bit more.
That's a boy.
You wanna try a little drop of brandy?
A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?
What are you smirking at?
Where did you send the boy, Vernon?
St. Brutus'.
It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I've been beaten loads of times.
Excellent.
I won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it.
You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out.
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.
What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?
Nothing.
He didn't work.
He was unemployed.
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.
Don't worry.
Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.
I think it's time you went to bed.
Quiet, Vernon.
You, clean it up.
Actually, it's nothing to do with the father.
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.
If something's wrong with the bitch, then something's wrong with the pup.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Right.
Let me tell you...
Vernon!
Vernon!
Vernon, do something!
Stop!
I've got you, Marge.
I've got you.
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.
Oh, Vernon.
Oh, God.
Marge!
Please!
Marge!
Come back!
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.
- You put her right!
- No.
She deserved what she got.
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.
- Yeah?
Try me.
- They won't let you back now.
You've nowhere to go.
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.
"Welcome to the Knight Bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard.
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening."
What you doing down there?
- I fell over.
- What you fall over for?
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.
Well, come on, then.
In.
No, no, no.
I'll get this.
You get in.
Come on.
Come on.
Move on, move on.
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London.
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup make sure you eat it before it eats you.
- But the Muggles.
Can't they see us?
- Muggles?
They don't see nothing, do they?
No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel.
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!
Ten, nine, eight seven, six, five four, three, three and a half two, one and three quarters.
Yes!
Who is that?
That man.
Who is that?
Who is...?
That is Sirius Black, that is.
Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black.
He's a murderer.
Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?
He's the first one that done it.
He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.
I reckon you've heard of him.
Yeah.
Him I've heard of.
Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock.
They're getting closer, Ernie.
Ernie, they're right on top of us!
Mind your head.
Hey, guys?
Guys?
Why the long faces?
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there.
Nearly there.
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.
Mr. Potter, at last.
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!
Room 11.
Hedwig.
Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter.
He arrived here just five minutes before yourself.
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack.
The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately.
She has been properly punctured and her memory modified.
She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.
So that's that and no harm done.
Pea soup?
No, thank you.
- Minister?
- Yes?
- I don't understand.
- Understand?
I broke the law.
Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
Come now.
The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts.
On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things was very, very irresponsible.
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.
Sirius Black, you mean?
But what's he got to do with me?
Nothing, of course.
You're safe.
And that's what matters.
And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.
Hedwig.
Oh, by the way, Harry.
Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't wander.
Right!
You gonna move that bus or what?
Housekeeping.
I'll come back later.
I'm warning you, Hermione.
Keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?
- It's in his nature.
- A cat?
Is that what they told you?
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...
Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.
Harry.
Harry.
- Egypt.
What's it like?
- Brilliant.
Loads of old stuff like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.
- The day maid.
- Night maid.
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.
- Got everything?
- Yes.
- Yes?
All your books?
- It's all upstairs.
- Your clothes?
- Everything.
- Good boy.
- Thank you.
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah.
It should be great.
Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you.
But I think that you need to know the facts.
You are in danger.
Grave danger.
Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?
What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?
Thirteen years ago, when you stopped...
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.
Sorry.
When you stopped You-Know-Who Black lost everything.
But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant.
And in his mind you are the only thing that stands in the way of You-Know-Who returning to power.
And that is why he has escaped from Azkaban.
To find you.
And kill me.
Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear you won't go looking for Black.
Mr. Weasley why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
Quick.
Quick.
Ron, Ron!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Don't lose him!
I didn't mean to blow her up.
I just...
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
I was lucky not to be arrested.
I still think it was brilliant.
Come on.
Everywhere else is full.
Who do you think that is?
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?
How is it she knows everything?
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be.
Why?
I gotta tell you something.
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
- Yeah.
But they'll catch Black, won't they?
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.
Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.
Why are we stopping?
We can't be there yet.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.
Ouch, Ron.
That was my foot.
There's something moving out there.
I think someone's coming aboard.
Bloody hell!
What's happening?
Harry.
Harry, are you all right?
Thank you.
Here, eat this.
It'll help.
It's all right.
It's chocolate.
What was that thing that came?
It was a dementor.
One of the guards of Azkaban.
It's gone now.
It was searching the train for Sirius Black.
If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver.
Eat.
You'll feel better.
What happened to me?
Well, you sort of went rigid.
We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
And did either of you two you know pass out?
- No.
I felt weird, though.
Like I'd never be cheerful again.
But someone was screaming.
A woman.
No one was screaming, Harry.
Welcome!
Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.
Now, I'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast.
First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin who's kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
Good luck, professor.
Of course.
That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.
Potter.
Is it true you fainted?
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.
Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.
Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid.
Finally, on a more disquieting note at the request of the Ministry of Magic Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban until such a time as Sirius Black is captured.
The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
Now whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution.
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.
Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.
It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
But you know, happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light.
Fortuna Major.
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no.
Wait, wait.
Watch this.
- Amazing.
Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.
- Yes, all right.
Go in.
- Thank you.
Still doing that after three years.
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.
Green.
That's a monkey.
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?
Do not give him one again.
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
- Ron, catch.
- I will.
I think we have a winner.
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.
Look at him.
His face.
Welcome, my children.
In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination.
In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight.
Hello.
I am Professor Trelawney.
Together we shall cast ourselves into the future.
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves.
So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you.
What do you see?
The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read.
But first, you must broaden your minds.
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.
- Where did you come from?
- Me?
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...
Is your grandmother quite well?
I think so.
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.
Pity.
Broaden your minds.
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?
- I think you are.
- Sure.
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.
Yeah.
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.
And that there could be the sun and that's happiness.
So you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.
Give me the cup.
Oh, my dear boy.
My dear you have the Grim.
The Grin?
What's the Grin?
Not the Grin, you idiot.
The Grim.
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.
It's among the darkest omens in our world.
It's an omen of death."
You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Oh, honestly, Ron.
If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline.
Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.
Ancient Runes?
Exactly how many classes are you taking?
A fair few.
Hang on.
That's not possible.
Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.
You have to be in two classes at once.
Don't be silly.
How could anyone be in two classes at once?
"Broaden your minds.
Use your Inner Eye to see the future."
That's it.
Come on, now.
Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.
I got a real treat for you today.
A great lesson.
So follow me.
Right, you lot.
Less chattering.
Form a group over there.
And open your books to page 49.
Exactly how do we do that?
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay.
Okay.
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah.
Terribly funny.
Witty.
God, this place has gone to the dogs.
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.
Shut up, Malfoy.
Dementor!
Dementor!
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.
Yeah.
Isn't he beautiful?
Say hello to Buckbeak.
Hagrid, exactly what is that?
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.
First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
It may be the last thing you ever do.
Now, who'd like to come and say hello?
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Come on now.
Now you have to let him make the first move.
It's only polite.
So step up.
Give him a nice bow.
Then you wait and see if he bows back.
If he does, you can go and touch him.
If not...
Well, we'll get to that later.
Just make your bow.
Nice and low.
Back off, Harry.
Back off.
Keep still.
Keep still.
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.
Right.
I think you can go and pat him now.
Go on.
Don't be shy.
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow.
Slow.
Not so fast, Harry.
Slow down, Harry.
That's it...
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...
That's it...
Yes!
Well done!
Well done, Harry, well done!
Does he get to fly?
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Put you over here, just behind the wing joint.
Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that.
Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak.
That was wicked, Harry!
Oh, please.
Well done, well done.
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.
You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!
Malfoy, no...
No!
Buckbeak!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa!
Buckbeak!
Away, you silly creature...
- It's killed me!
- Calm down.
It's just a scratch!
Hagrid!
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher.
I'll do it.
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!
You and your bloody chicken!
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.
Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm.
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.
- He's been sighted!
- Who?
Sirius Black!
Dufftown?
That's not far from here.
You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?
That's right.
Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.
Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
Intriguing, isn't it?
Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what is inside?
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.
Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...
Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart.
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.
After me.
Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.
So much for the easy part.
You see, the incantation alone is not enough.
What really finishes a boggart is laughter.
You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.
Let me explain.
Neville, would you join me, please?
Come on, don't be shy.
Come on.
Come on.
Hello.
Neville, what frightens you most of all?
Professor Snape.
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.
Professor Snape.
Yes, frightens all.
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.
No it won't.
I want you to picture her clothes.
Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe here's what I want you to do.
Excuse me.
Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.
Can you do that?
Yes.
Wand at the ready.
One, two, three.
Think, Neville, think.
Riddikulus!
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible!
Okay to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...
Form a line!
I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most and turn it into something funny.
Next!
Ron!
Concentrate.
Face your fear.
Be brave!
Wand at the ready, Ron.
Riddikulus!
Yes!
You see?
Very good, very good!
Marvelous!
Absolutely, very, very enjoyable!
Parvati!
Next!
Show us what you see.
Keep your nerve.
Steady.
Riddikulus!
And next!
Step up, step up!
Wonderful, wonderful!
Here!
Riddikulus!
Right.
Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.
Collect your books from the back.
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you!
Sorry!
Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege.
Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school that privilege shall not be extended again.
No permission form signed, no visiting the village.
That's the rule, Potter.
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.
I thought if you signed it, then I could...
I can't.
Only a parent or a guardian can sign.
Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate.
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.
Forget about it, guys.
See you later.
Professor, can I ask you something?
You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?
I thought it'd be obvious.
I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.
I did think of Voldemort at first.
But then I remembered that night on the train and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.
That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.
This is very wise.
Before I fainted I heard something.
A woman screaming.
Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.
Our pain becomes their power.
I think it was my mother the night she was murdered.
The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.
Not by your scar, by your eyes.
They're your mother, Lily's.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
I knew her.
Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.
Not only was she a singularly gifted witch she was also an uncommonly kind woman.
She had a way of seeing the beauty in others even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves.
And your father, James, on the other hand he...
He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble.
A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.
You're more like them than you know, Harry.
In time, you'll come to see just how much.
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain.
I know.
What's going on?
Probably Neville forgot the password again.
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.
Let me through, please.
Excuse me!
I'm Head Boy!
Get back, all of you.
No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.
The Fat Lady!
She's gone!
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.
It's not funny, Ron.
Keep calm, everyone.
Break into fours.
Back to your common room.
- Be quiet.
- Make way.
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.
You heard.
Move!
Mr. Filch?
Round up the ghosts.
Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
There's no need for ghosts, professor.
The Fat Lady's there.
Mind where you're going!
Slow down!
You listen!
I'm Head Boy!
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!
Dear lady, who did this to you?
Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.
He's here, somewhere in the castle!
Sirius Black!
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery.
There's nothing there.
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.
I didn't really expect him to linger.
Remarkable feat, don't you think?
To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own...
Any theories on how he managed it?
Many.
Each as unlikely as the next.
You may recall prior to the start of term I expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor...
Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?
Perhaps.
But for now, let him sleep.
For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.
Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
Turn to page 394.
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?
That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?
Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time.
Turn to page 394.
"Werewolves"?
Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?
Now, which one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?
No one?
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.
An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
A werewolf has no choice.
With each full moon he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.
The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.
Are you incapable of restraining yourself or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.
As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.
Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter.
Loss of limb will not excuse you.
Page 394.
The term "werewolf" is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer" which means "man," and "wolf." Werewolf, man-wolf.
There are several ways to become a werewolf.
They include being given the power of shape-shifting being bitten by a werewolf...
Go, Harry!
Go, Harry!
Aresto momentum!
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.
Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.
Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.
You gave us a right good scare.
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.
Really?
I meant the match.
Who won?
No one blames you, Harry.
Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds.
Dumbledore's furious.
After he saved you, he sent them off.
There's something else you should know too.
When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and...
Well...
I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.
Is there no chance of fixing it?
No.
Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.
Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.
They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.
You are not weak, Harry.
Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.
Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.
You made the one on the train go away.
There was only one that night.
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.
But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.
For now, I need to rest.
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.
We'll get you there.
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- If you pipe down.
- Bless him.
- Let me go!
Come on, guys.
Don't...
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.
What are you doing?
!
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...
But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
George, if you will.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder's Map."
We owe them so much.
Hang on.
This is Hogwarts.
And that...
- No.
Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.
- In his study.
- Pacing.
Does that a lot.
- So this map shows...
- Everyone.
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.
- Every minute.
- Every day.
- Brilliant!
Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.
Hurry.
Filch is heading this way.
And don't forget.
When you're done, just give it a tap and say:
"Mischief managed." Otherwise, anyone can read it.
Now, how much do you want?
Delicious.
It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain.
Did I mention that?
Twice.
Do you want to move a bit closer?
To the Shrieking Shack?
Actually, I'm fine here.
Well, well.
Look who's here.
You two shopping for your new dream home?
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.
Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!
You filthy little mudblood!
Who is that?
- Don't stand there!
Do something!
- What?
What's up, Malfoy?
Lost your skis?
Get out of the way!
Move!
Malfoy!
Wait!
Wait!
Harry!
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.
Those weasels!
Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
He won't keep it.
He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.
- Aren't you?
- Sure.
Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
Look who it is.
Madam Rosmerta.
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!
Allow me, minister.
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors into my pub every other night!
- We have...
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
And what would bring him here?
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?
Come.
Harry!
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!
- So rude.
- Thick heads.
- Thick heads?
!
- How dare they!
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!
Nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place.
Tell me what this is all about.
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death...
Remember?
They hid.
Few knew where they were.
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.
Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night he also killed Peter Pettigrew!
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.
Never let James and Sirius out of his sight.
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters and might have, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.
He destroyed him!
A finger.
That's all that was left.
A finger.
Nothing else.
Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.
- What could be worse?
- This:
Sirius Black was and remains to this day Harry Potter's godfather!
Ron, look!
- Sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.
Harry, what happened?
He was their friend and he betrayed them.
He was their friend!
I hope he finds me.
Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!
Harry.
There you are.
You came.
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level.
I'm sure.
Well, everything's prepared.
The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm.
Did you ever hear of it?
No?
Well...
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.
But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory.
Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.
Can you do this?
Yes.
Very well.
Close your eyes.
Concentrate.
Explore your past.
Do you have a memory?
Allow it to fill you up.
Lose yourself within it.
Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum.
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.
Shall we?
Wand at the ready.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto...
Expecto...
Expect...
Here we go.
Come on.
Sit up.
Deep breaths.
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to do it the first time.
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this.
You'll feel better.
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.
As a matter of interest, what were you thinking?
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.
Well, it is.
It's the happiest I've ever felt but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?
Then let's give it a try.
You feel ready?
Just do it.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto Patronum!
Yes!
Well done, Harry.
Well done!
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes.
Sit down.
Here.
Eat this, it helps.
It really helps.
And just so you know, Harry I think you'd have given your father a run for his money.
And that is saying something.
I was thinking of him.
And Mum.
Seeing their faces.
They were talking to me.
Just talking.
That's the memory I chose.
I don't even know if it's real.
But it's the best I have.
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.
Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.
- Did.
- Didn't.
How did it go, Hagrid?
The hearing?
Well, first off, the committee members took turns talking about why we were there.
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers.
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.
He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you.
And then?
And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
Spiders!
There's...
There's spiders.
Spiders.
They want me to tap-dance.
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- Tell those spiders.
Right, yeah.
Tell them.
I'll tell them...
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.
He didn 't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!
Mischief managed.
Nox.
Potter.
What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
I was sleepwalking.
How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter.
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.
My dad didn't strut.
And nor do I.
If you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.
Turn out your pockets.
Turn out your pockets!
What's this?
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really?
Open it.
Reveal your secrets.
Read it.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."
Go on.
"And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business."
- You insolent little...
- Professor!
Well, well.
Lupin.
Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?
Harry, are you all right?
That remains to be seen.
I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.
It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.
Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.
It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise.
Harry, would you come with me, please?
Professor, good night.
Are you deaf?
Put that light out!
Come in.
I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in.
Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black is a map to you?
- No.
- No, sir.
Your father never set much store by the rules either.
But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.
Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!
Now, I will not cover up for you again.
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.
I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.
Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works.
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.
Oh, really?
And who might that be?
Peter Pettigrew.
That's not possible.
It's just what I saw.
Good night, professor.
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.
The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.
Only then can you see.
Try again.
Now, what do we have here?
Do you mind me trying?
The Grim, possibly.
My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.
You may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave.
Have I said something?
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental but now it's in the open for everyone to see.
Hang on.
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.
- Fine.
See you later.
- See you.
Harry Potter...
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.
Sorry?
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder shall break free.
Innocent blood shall be spilt and servant and master shall be reunited once more.
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?
No.
Nothing.
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak.
It's just too horrible.
- It just got worse.
- What did I say?
Father said I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.
This is going to be rich.
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?
You!
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
Malfoy, are you okay?
- Let's go.
Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Look at him.
Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
Why don't we just set him free?
They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.
Says he wants to be with me when they...
When it happens.
Great man, Dumbledore.
A great man.
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!
Think I want you seeing something like that?
No.
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh.
Before you do, Ron...
Scabbers!
You're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.
Right.
Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.
I meant me!
Blimey.
What was that?
Hagrid!
Oh, crikey.
No, minister.
Over this way.
It's late.
It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.
Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble.
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!
Quick.
Quick!
Hagrid.
- It'll be fine.
It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.
- On the slope...
Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.
- Good evening.
- Minister.
Make your way through.
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.
Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we?
Very well.
It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak hereinafter called "the condemned," shall be executed this day at sundown.
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid.
Now, come on.
- All right.
It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go!
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Oh, no.
He bit me.
Scabbers.
Ron.
Ron!
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.
Wait!
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
That's not good.
Ron, run!
Harry, Hermione, run!
It's the Grim!
- Harry!
- Ron!
Ron, wait!
Harry!
- Help!
- Ron!
- Ron.
Ron.
- Ron!
Come on!
Move!
Duck!
Harry!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.
I just hope I'm wrong.
We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
Come on.
Ron.
- Ron.
You're okay.
- The dog.
Where is it?
It's a trap.
He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.
If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!
No.
Only one will die tonight.
Then it'll be you!
Are you going to kill me, Harry?
Expelliarmus!
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?
Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within.
Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you?
- I found him.
- I know.
- It's him.
- I understand.
- Let's kill him!
- No!
I trusted you!
And all this time, you've been his friend.
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.
How long have you known?
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.
You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!
Twelve years of it!
In Azkaban!
Very well.
Kill him.
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.
I know why.
You betrayed my parents.
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.
Somebody did betray your parents somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!
And he's in this room!
Right now!
Come out, come out, Peter!
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!
Vengeance is sweet.
How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
Severus...
I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle.
Here's the proof.
Brilliant, Snape.
You've put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion.
If you'll excuse us, Remus and I have business to attend to.
- Give me a reason.
I beg you!
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it.
It's habit.
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!
You two, quarrelling like an old married couple.
Run along and play with your chemistry set!
I could do it, you know.
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.
A Dementor's Kiss.
One can only imagine what that must be like.
It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.
Severus, please.
After you.
Expelliarmus!
- Harry!
What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.
We thought he was our friend!
- No.
Pettigrew's dead.
You killed him!
- No, he didn't.
I thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map!
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!
- Me?
!
He's mental!
- Not you!
Your rat!
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?
Curiously long life for a common garden rat!
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!
Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?
Scabbers!
Leave him alone!
Get off him!
What are you doing?
Remus?
Sirius.
My old friends!
Harry!
Look at you.
You look so much like your father.
- James.
We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!
How dare you talk about James in front of him!
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!
The Dark Lord.
You have no idea the weapons he possesses!
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!
James wouldn't have wanted me killed!
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!
Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would.
Together!
No!
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.
But we'll take him to the castle.
- Bless you, boy.
Bless you!
- Get off!
I said we'd take you to the castle.
After that, the dementors can have you.
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.
A bit?
A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!
I was going for the rat.
Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog.
More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent.
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.
Okay.
- You better go.
- No.
Don't worry, okay?
It's fine.
I'll stay.
You go, I'll stay.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
Go.
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.
They might chop it.
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
It's too late.
It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.
It'll be nice to do it again as a free man.
That was a noble thing you did back there.
He doesn't deserve it.
I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends to become killers.
Besides, dead, the truth dies with him.
Alive, you're free.
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!
Ron!
Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!
- Sweet, clever girl!
Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!
I don't know if you know, Harry but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather.
I know.
I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle but if you ever wanted a different home...
What?
Come and live with you?
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.
Harry!
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live!
Here!
This flesh is only flesh!
Expelliarmus!
Harry!
Remus!
Remus!
Run!
Run!
- Come on.
- Wait.
Wait.
Hermione!
Bad idea.
Bad idea.
Professor?
Professor Lupin?
Nice doggy.
Nice doggy!
There you are, Potter!
Sirius!
Come back here, Potter!
Sirius!
No.
Sirius!
Expecto Patronum!
Harry?
I saw my dad.
What?
He sent the dementors away.
I saw him across the lake.
Harry, they've captured Sirius.
Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.
- They're gonna kill him?
- No.
It's worse.
Much worse.
They're going to suck out his soul.
Headmaster, stop them.
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true.
Sirius is innocent.
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?
He's my rat, sir.
He's not really a rat.
He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.
But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.
A child's voice, however honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.
Mysterious thing, time.
Powerful and when meddled with, dangerous.
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen.
And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime.
If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss.
If you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared.
Three turns should do it, I think.
Oh, and by the way.
When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin.
Good luck.
What the bloody hell was that all about?
Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk...
What just happened?
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.
Where were we at 7:30?
I don't know.
Going to Hagrid's?
Come on.
And we can't be seen.
Hermione!
Hermione!
Hermione, wait.
Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
That's us.
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
This is not normal.
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first term.
This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.
Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.
Good punch.
Thanks.
Malfoy's coming.
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood!
Mark my words.
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Come on.
We should be at Hagrid's.
Look.
Buckbeak's still alive.
Of course.
Remember what Dumbledore said?
If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.
Let's go.
Here they come.
I'd better hurry.
Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.
Scabbers, you're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.
If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad.
Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time.
We can't be seen.
Fudge is coming.
And we aren't leaving?
Why aren't we leaving?
Are you mad?
That hurt.
Sorry.
We're coming out the back door.
Go!
Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go.
Okay, go, Harry.
Go!
Get away.
Get off.
Minister, I really think I should sign as well.
Yes, very well.
Perhaps it would be...
Okay, Buckbeak.
Come quickly.
Come with us now.
Come on.
Keep trying.
Come on.
Quickly.
Buckbeak.
Okay?
Quickly.
Hurry up.
Okay?
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.
Come and get the nice dead ferret.
- Come on.
It's here.
Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister.
Follow me.
- Now, look there.
- Where?
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?
Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
- Oh, yes.
Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.
- Come on, Buckbeak.
Come on.
- I see no strawberries.
- Over there.
- Where?
- Over there.
- This way.
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.
But where is it?
I saw the beast, just now.
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.
Buckbeak.
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.
I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.
- Right.
- Well, well.
We must search the grounds.
Well, search the skies, if you must, minister.
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy.
Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required.
Thank you.
You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor.
- Come on.
- This way.
This way, now.
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.
- How?
- No idea.
- Look.
It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!
And Snape's coming.
And now we wait.
And now we wait.
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.
- Hermione?
- Yeah?
Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius I did see someone.
That someone made the dementors go away.
With a Patronus.
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
According to him only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
It was my dad.
My dad conjured the Patronus.
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead.
I know.
I'm just telling you what I saw.
Here we come.
You see Sirius talking to me there?
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'.
It'll just be me and him.
We could live in the country someplace you can see the sky.
He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
Harry!
Run!
Let's go.
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.
Thanks.
- Great.
Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that.
Run!
That was so scary.
Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
Sirius.
Come on!
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.
Any minute now.
Right there.
You'll see.
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.
- Sirius.
- You're dying both of you.
Harry!
Expecto Patronum!
You were right, Hermione.
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!
I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.
I knew I could do it this time because well, I had already done it.
- Does that make sense?
- No.
But I don't like flying...!
Bombarda!
I'll be forever grateful for this to both of you.
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.
For some time, my life will be too unpredictable.
And besides you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.
And you know it.
And for now, that will do.
I expect you're tired of hearing this but you look so like your father.
Except your eyes.
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.
It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little.
But know this:
The ones that love us never really leave us.
And you can always find them in here.
You really are the brightest witch of your age.
We have to go.
- Well?
- He's free.
We did it.
Did what?
Good night.
How did you get there?
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.
Honestly, Ron.
How can somebody be in two places at once?
Hello, Harry.
I saw you coming.
I've looked worse, believe me.
- You've been sacked.
- No.
No.
I resigned, actually.
Resigned?
Why?
Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition.
This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want well, someone like me teaching their children.
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already risked enough on my behalf.
Besides, people like me are...
Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now.
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
None of it made any difference.
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.
You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.
It made a great deal of difference.
If I am proud of anything it is of how much you have learned this year.
Now, since I am no longer your teacher I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you.
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
Until then mischief managed.
Stand back, I said!
Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle.
Harry.
Wherever did you get it?
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.
Did not.
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.
For me?
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.
This came with it.
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.
How fast is it, Harry?
Lumos.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
Mischief managed.
Nox.

Harry.
Harry.
Harry, open the door.
Marge.
How lovely to see...
Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.
What is it?
Nothing.
School stuff.
Later perhaps, if you behave.
I will if she does.
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.
Don't say yes in that ungrateful way.
Damn good of my brother to keep you.
He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?
Give us a kiss.
Come on.
Up, up.
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
Okay.
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.
Excellent nosh, Petunia.
A bit more.
Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs.
Just a bit more.
That's a boy.
You wanna try a little drop of brandy?
A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?
What are you smirking at?
Where did you send the boy, Vernon?
St. Brutus'.
It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I've been beaten loads of times.
Excellent.
I won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it.
You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out.
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.
What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?
Nothing.
He didn't work.
He was unemployed.
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.
Don't worry.
Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.
I think it's time you went to bed.
Quiet, Vernon.
You, clean it up.
Actually, it's nothing to do with the father.
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.
If something's wrong with the bitch, then something's wrong with the pup.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Right.
Let me tell you...
Vernon!
Vernon!
Vernon, do something!
Stop!
I've got you, Marge.
I've got you.
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.
Oh, Vernon.
Oh, God.
Marge!
Please!
Marge!
Come back!
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.
- You put her right!
- No.
She deserved what she got.
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.
- Yeah?
Try me.
- They won't let you back now.
You've nowhere to go.
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.
"Welcome to the Knight Bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard.
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening."
What you doing down there?
- I fell over.
- What you fall over for?
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.
Well, come on, then.
In.
No, no, no.
I'll get this.
You get in.
Come on.
Come on.
Move on, move on.
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London.
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup make sure you eat it before it eats you.
- But the Muggles.
Can't they see us?
- Muggles?
They don't see nothing, do they?
No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel.
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!
Ten, nine, eight seven, six, five four, three, three and a half two, one and three quarters.
Yes!
Who is that?
That man.
Who is that?
Who is...?
That is Sirius Black, that is.
Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black.
He's a murderer.
Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?
He's the first one that done it.
He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.
I reckon you've heard of him.
Yeah.
Him I've heard of.
Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock.
They're getting closer, Ernie.
Ernie, they're right on top of us!
Mind your head.
Hey, guys?
Guys?
Why the long faces?
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there.
Nearly there.
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.
Mr. Potter, at last.
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!
Room 11.
Hedwig.
Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter.
He arrived here just five minutes before yourself.
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack.
The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately.
She has been properly punctured and her memory modified.
She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.
So that's that and no harm done.
Pea soup?
No, thank you.
- Minister?
- Yes?
- I don't understand.
- Understand?
I broke the law.
Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
Come now.
The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts.
On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things was very, very irresponsible.
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.
Sirius Black, you mean?
But what's he got to do with me?
Nothing, of course.
You're safe.
And that's what matters.
And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.
Hedwig.
Oh, by the way, Harry.
Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't wander.
Right!
You gonna move that bus or what?
Housekeeping.
I'll come back later.
I'm warning you, Hermione.
Keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?
- It's in his nature.
- A cat?
Is that what they told you?
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...
Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.
Harry.
Harry.
- Egypt.
What's it like?
- Brilliant.
Loads of old stuff like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.
- The day maid.
- Night maid.
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.
- Got everything?
- Yes.
- Yes?
All your books?
- It's all upstairs.
- Your clothes?
- Everything.
- Good boy.
- Thank you.
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah.
It should be great.
Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you.
But I think that you need to know the facts.
You are in danger.
Grave danger.
Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?
What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?
Thirteen years ago, when you stopped...
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.
Sorry.
When you stopped You-Know-Who Black lost everything.
But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant.
And in his mind you are the only thing that stands in the way of You-Know-Who returning to power.
And that is why he has escaped from Azkaban.
To find you.
And kill me.
Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear you won't go looking for Black.
Mr. Weasley why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
Quick.
Quick.
Ron, Ron!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Don't lose him!
I didn't mean to blow her up.
I just...
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
I was lucky not to be arrested.
I still think it was brilliant.
Come on.
Everywhere else is full.
Who do you think that is?
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?
How is it she knows everything?
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be.
Why?
I gotta tell you something.
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
- Yeah.
But they'll catch Black, won't they?
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.
Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.
Why are we stopping?
We can't be there yet.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.
Ouch, Ron.
That was my foot.
There's something moving out there.
I think someone's coming aboard.
Bloody hell!
What's happening?
Harry.
Harry, are you all right?
Thank you.
Here, eat this.
It'll help.
It's all right.
It's chocolate.
What was that thing that came?
It was a dementor.
One of the guards of Azkaban.
It's gone now.
It was searching the train for Sirius Black.
If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver.
Eat.
You'll feel better.
What happened to me?
Well, you sort of went rigid.
We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
And did either of you two you know pass out?
- No.
I felt weird, though.
Like I'd never be cheerful again.
But someone was screaming.
A woman.
No one was screaming, Harry.
Welcome!
Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.
Now, I'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast.
First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin who's kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
Good luck, professor.
Of course.
That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.
Potter.
Is it true you fainted?
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.
Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.
Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid.
Finally, on a more disquieting note at the request of the Ministry of Magic Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban until such a time as Sirius Black is captured.
The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
Now whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution.
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.
Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.
It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
But you know, happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light.
Fortuna Major.
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no.
Wait, wait.
Watch this.
- Amazing.
Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.
- Yes, all right.
Go in.
- Thank you.
Still doing that after three years.
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.
Green.
That's a monkey.
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?
Do not give him one again.
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
- Ron, catch.
- I will.
I think we have a winner.
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.
Look at him.
His face.
Welcome, my children.
In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination.
In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight.
Hello.
I am Professor Trelawney.
Together we shall cast ourselves into the future.
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves.
So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you.
What do you see?
The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read.
But first, you must broaden your minds.
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.
- Where did you come from?
- Me?
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...
Is your grandmother quite well?
I think so.
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.
Pity.
Broaden your minds.
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?
- I think you are.
- Sure.
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.
Yeah.
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.
And that there could be the sun and that's happiness.
So you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.
Give me the cup.
Oh, my dear boy.
My dear you have the Grim.
The Grin?
What's the Grin?
Not the Grin, you idiot.
The Grim.
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.
It's among the darkest omens in our world.
It's an omen of death."
You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Oh, honestly, Ron.
If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline.
Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.
Ancient Runes?
Exactly how many classes are you taking?
A fair few.
Hang on.
That's not possible.
Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.
You have to be in two classes at once.
Don't be silly.
How could anyone be in two classes at once?
"Broaden your minds.
Use your Inner Eye to see the future."
That's it.
Come on, now.
Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.
I got a real treat for you today.
A great lesson.
So follow me.
Right, you lot.
Less chattering.
Form a group over there.
And open your books to page 49.
Exactly how do we do that?
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay.
Okay.
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah.
Terribly funny.
Witty.
God, this place has gone to the dogs.
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.
Shut up, Malfoy.
Dementor!
Dementor!
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.
Yeah.
Isn't he beautiful?
Say hello to Buckbeak.
Hagrid, exactly what is that?
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.
First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
It may be the last thing you ever do.
Now, who'd like to come and say hello?
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Come on now.
Now you have to let him make the first move.
It's only polite.
So step up.
Give him a nice bow.
Then you wait and see if he bows back.
If he does, you can go and touch him.
If not...
Well, we'll get to that later.
Just make your bow.
Nice and low.
Back off, Harry.
Back off.
Keep still.
Keep still.
Well done, Harry.
Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.
Right.
I think you can go and pat him now.
Go on.
Don't be shy.
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow.
Slow.
Not so fast, Harry.
Slow down, Harry.
That's it...
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...
That's it...
Yes!
Well done!
Well done, Harry, well done!
Does he get to fly?
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Put you over here, just behind the wing joint.
Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that.
Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak.
That was wicked, Harry!
Oh, please.
Well done, well done.
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.
You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!
Malfoy, no...
No!
Buckbeak!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa!
Buckbeak!
Away, you silly creature...
- It's killed me!
- Calm down.
It's just a scratch!
Hagrid!
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher.
I'll do it.
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!
You and your bloody chicken!
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.
Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm.
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.
- He's been sighted!
- Who?
Sirius Black!
Dufftown?
That's not far from here.
You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?
That's right.
Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.
Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
Intriguing, isn't it?
Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what is inside?
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.
Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...
Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart.
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.
After me.
Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.
So much for the easy part.
You see, the incantation alone is not enough.
What really finishes a boggart is laughter.
You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.
Let me explain.
Neville, would you join me, please?
Come on, don't be shy.
Come on.
Come on.
Hello.
Neville, what frightens you most of all?
Professor Snape.
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.
Professor Snape.
Yes, frightens all.
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.
No it won't.
I want you to picture her clothes.
Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe here's what I want you to do.
Excuse me.
Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.
Can you do that?
Yes.
Wand at the ready.
One, two, three.
Think, Neville, think.
Riddikulus!
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible!
Okay to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...
Form a line!
I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most and turn it into something funny.
Next!
Ron!
Concentrate.
Face your fear.
Be brave!
Wand at the ready, Ron.
Riddikulus!
Yes!
You see?
Very good, very good!
Marvelous!
Absolutely, very, very enjoyable!
Parvati!
Next!
Show us what you see.
Keep your nerve.
Steady.
Riddikulus!
And next!
Step up, step up!
Wonderful, wonderful!
Here!
Riddikulus!
Right.
Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.
Collect your books from the back.
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you!
Sorry!
Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege.
Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school that privilege shall not be extended again.
No permission form signed, no visiting the village.
That's the rule, Potter.
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.
I thought if you signed it, then I could...
I can't.
Only a parent or a guardian can sign.
Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate.
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.
Forget about it, guys.
See you later.
Professor, can I ask you something?
You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?
I thought it'd be obvious.
I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.
I did think of Voldemort at first.
But then I remembered that night on the train and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.
That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.
This is very wise.
Before I fainted I heard something.
A woman screaming.
Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.
Our pain becomes their power.
I think it was my mother the night she was murdered.
The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.
Not by your scar, by your eyes.
They're your mother, Lily's.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
I knew her.
Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.
Not only was she a singularly gifted witch she was also an uncommonly kind woman.
She had a way of seeing the beauty in others even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves.
And your father, James, on the other hand he...
He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble.
A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.
You're more like them than you know, Harry.
In time, you'll come to see just how much.
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain.
I know.
What's going on?
Probably Neville forgot the password again.
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.
Let me through, please.
Excuse me!
I'm Head Boy!
Get back, all of you.
No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.
The Fat Lady!
She's gone!
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.
It's not funny, Ron.
Keep calm, everyone.
Break into fours.
Back to your common room.
- Be quiet.
- Make way.
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.
You heard.
Move!
Mr. Filch?
Round up the ghosts.
Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
There's no need for ghosts, professor.
The Fat Lady's there.
Mind where you're going!
Slow down!
You listen!
I'm Head Boy!
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!
Dear lady, who did this to you?
Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.
He's here, somewhere in the castle!
Sirius Black!
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery.
There's nothing there.
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.
I didn't really expect him to linger.
Remarkable feat, don't you think?
To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own...
Any theories on how he managed it?
Many.
Each as unlikely as the next.
You may recall prior to the start of term I expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor...
Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?
Perhaps.
But for now, let him sleep.
For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.
Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
Turn to page 394.
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?
That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?
Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time.
Turn to page 394.
"Werewolves"?
Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?
Now, which one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?
No one?
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.
An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
A werewolf has no choice.
With each full moon he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.
The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.
Are you incapable of restraining yourself or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.
As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.
Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter.
Loss of limb will not excuse you.
Page 394.
The term "werewolf" is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer" which means "man," and "wolf." Werewolf, man-wolf.
There are several ways to become a werewolf.
They include being given the power of shape-shifting being bitten by a werewolf...
Go, Harry!
Go, Harry!
Aresto momentum!
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.
Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.
Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.
You gave us a right good scare.
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.
Really?
I meant the match.
Who won?
No one blames you, Harry.
Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds.
Dumbledore's furious.
After he saved you, he sent them off.
There's something else you should know too.
When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and...
Well...
I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.
Is there no chance of fixing it?
No.
Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.
Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.
They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.
You are not weak, Harry.
Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.
Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.
You made the one on the train go away.
There was only one that night.
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.
But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.
For now, I need to rest.
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.
We'll get you there.
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- Lf you pipe down.
- Bless him.
- Let me go!
Come on, guys.
Don't...
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.
What are you doing?
!
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...
But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
George, if you will.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder's Map."
We owe them so much.
Hang on.
This is Hogwarts.
And that...
- No.
Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.
- In his study.
- Pacing.
Does that a lot.
- So this map shows...
- Everyone.
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.
- Every minute.
- Every day.
- Brilliant!
Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.
Hurry.
Filch is heading this way.
And don't forget.
When you're done, just give it a tap and say:
"Mischief managed." Otherwise, anyone can read it.
Now, how much do you want?
Delicious.
It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain.
Did I mention that?
Twice.
Do you want to move a bit closer?
To the Shrieking Shack?
Actually, I'm fine here.
Well, well.
Look who's here.
You two shopping for your new dream home?
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.
Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!
You filthy little mudblood!
Who is that?
- Don't stand there!
Do something!
- What?
What's up, Malfoy?
Lost your skis?
Get out of the way!
Move!
Malfoy!
Wait!
Wait!
Harry!
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.
Those weasels!
Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
He won't keep it.
He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.
- Aren't you?
- Sure.
Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
Look who it is.
Madam Rosmerta.
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!
Allow me, minister.
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors into my pub every other night!
- We have...
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
And what would bring him here?
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?
Come.
Harry!
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!
- So rude.
- Thick heads.
- Thick heads?
!
- How dare they!
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!
Nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place.
Tell me what this is all about.
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death...
Remember?
They hid.
Few knew where they were.
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.
Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night he also killed Peter Pettigrew!
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.
Never let James and Sirius out of his sight.
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters and might have, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.
He destroyed him!
A finger.
That's all that was left.
A finger.
Nothing else.
Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.
- What could be worse?
- This:
Sirius Black was and remains to this day Harry Potter's godfather!
Ron, look!
- Sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.
Harry, what happened?
He was their friend and he betrayed them.
He was their friend!
I hope he finds me.
Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!
Harry.
There you are.
You came.
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level.
I'm sure.
Well, everything's prepared.
The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm.
Did you ever hear of it?
No?
Well...
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.
But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory.
Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.
Can you do this?
Yes.
Very well.
Close your eyes.
Concentrate.
Explore your past.
Do you have a memory?
Allow it to fill you up.
Lose yourself within it.
Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum.
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.
Shall we?
Wand at the ready.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto...
Expecto...
Expect...
Here we go.
Come on.
Sit up.
Deep breaths.
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to do it the first time.
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this.
You'll feel better.
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.
As a matter of interest, what were you thinking?
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.
Well, it is.
It's the happiest I've ever felt but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?
Then let's give it a try.
You feel ready?
Just do it.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto Patronum!
Yes!
Well done, Harry.
Well done!
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes.
Sit down.
Here.
Eat this, it helps.
It really helps.
And just so you know, Harry I think you'd have given your father a run for his money.
And that is saying something.
I was thinking of him.
And Mum.
Seeing their faces.
They were talking to me.
Just talking.
That's the memory I chose.
I don't even know if it's real.
But it's the best I have.
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.
Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.
- Did.
- Didn't.
How did it go, Hagrid?
The hearing?
Well, first off, the committee members took turns talking about why we were there.
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers.
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.
He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you.
And then?
And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
Spiders!
There's...
There's spiders.
Spiders.
They want me to tap-dance.
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- Tell those spiders.
Right, yeah.
Tell them.
I'll tell them...
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.
He didn 't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!
Mischief managed.
Nox.
Potter.
What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
I was sleepwalking.
How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter.
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.
My dad didn't strut.
And nor do I.
If you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.
Turn out your pockets.
Turn out your pockets!
What's this?
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really?
Open it.
Reveal your secrets.
Read it.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."
Go on.
"And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business."
- You insolent little...
- Professor!
Well, well.
Lupin.
Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?
Harry, are you all right?
That remains to be seen.
I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.
It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.
Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.
It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise.
Harry, would you come with me, please?
Professor, good night.
Are you deaf?
Put that light out!
Come in.
I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in.
Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black is a map to you?
- No.
- No, sir.
Your father never set much store by the rules either.
But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.
Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!
Now, I will not cover up for you again.
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.
I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.
Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works.
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.
Oh, really?
And who might that be?
Peter Pettigrew.
That's not possible.
It's just what I saw.
Good night, professor.
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.
The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.
Only then can you see.
Try again.
Now, what do we have here?
Do you mind me trying?
The Grim, possibly.
My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.
You may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave.
Have I said something?
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental but now it's in the open for everyone to see.
Hang on.
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.
- Fine.
See you later.
- See you.
Harry Potter...
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.
Sorry?
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder shall break free.
Innocent blood shall be spilt and servant and master shall be reunited once more.
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?
No.
Nothing.
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak.
It's just too horrible.
- It just got worse.
- What did I say?
Father said I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.
This is going to be rich.
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?
You!
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
Malfoy, are you okay?
- Let's go.
Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Look at him.
Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
Why don't we just set him free?
They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.
Says he wants to be with me when they...
When it happens.
Great man, Dumbledore.
A great man.
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!
Think I want you seeing something like that?
No.
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh.
Before you do, Ron...
Scabbers!
You're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.
Right.
Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.
I meant me!
Blimey.
What was that?
Hagrid!
Oh, crikey.
No, minister.
Over this way.
It's late.
It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.
Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble.
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!
Quick.
Quick!
Hagrid.
- It'll be fine.
It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.
- On the slope...
Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.
- Good evening.
- Minister.
Make your way through.
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.
Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we?
Very well.
It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak hereinafter called "the condemned," shall be executed this day at sundown.
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid.
Now, come on.
- All right.
It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go!
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Oh, no.
He bit me.
Scabbers.
Ron.
Ron!
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.
Wait!
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
That's not good.
Ron, run!
Harry, Hermione, run!
It's the Grim!
- Harry!
- Ron!
Ron, wait!
Harry!
- Help!
- Ron!
- Ron.
Ron.
- Ron!
Come on!
Move!
Duck!
Harry!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.
I just hope I'm wrong.
We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
Come on.
Ron.
- Ron.
You're okay.
- The dog.
Where is it?
It's a trap.
He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.
If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!
No.
Only one will die tonight.
Then it'll be you!
Are you going to kill me, Harry?
Expelliarmus!
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?
Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within.
Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you?
- I found him.
- I know.
- It's him.
- I understand.
- Let's kill him!
- No!
I trusted you!
And all this time, you've been his friend.
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.
How long have you known?
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.
You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!
Twelve years of it!
In Azkaban!
Very well.
Kill him.
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.
I know why.
You betrayed my parents.
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.
Somebody did betray your parents somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!
And he's in this room!
Right now!
Come out, come out, Peter!
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!
Vengeance is sweet.
How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
Severus...
I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle.
Here's the proof.
Brilliant, Snape.
You've put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion.
If you'll excuse us, Remus and I have business to attend to.
- Give me a reason.
I beg you!
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it.
It's habit.
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!
You two, quarrelling like an old married couple.
Run along and play with your chemistry set!
I could do it, you know.
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.
A Dementor's Kiss.
One can only imagine what that must be like.
It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.
Severus, please.
After you.
Expelliarmus!
- Harry!
What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.
We thought he was our friend!
- No.
Pettigrew's dead.
You killed him!
- No, he didn't.
I thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map!
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!
- Me?
!
He's mental!
- Not you!
Your rat!
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?
Curiously long life for a common garden rat!
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!
Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?
Scabbers!
Leave him alone!
Get off him!
What are you doing?
Remus?
Sirius.
My old friends!
Harry!
Look at you.
You look so much like your father.
- James.
We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!
How dare you talk about James in front of him!
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!
The Dark Lord.
You have no idea the weapons he possesses!
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!
James wouldn't have wanted me killed!
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!
Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would.
Together!
No!
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.
But we'll take him to the castle.
- Bless you, boy.
Bless you!
- Get off!
I said we'd take you to the castle.
After that, the dementors can have you.
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.
A bit?
A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!
I was going for the rat.
Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog.
More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent.
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.
Okay.
- You better go.
- No.
Don't worry, okay?
It's fine.
I'll stay.
You go, I'll stay.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
Go.
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.
They might chop it.
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
It's too late.
It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.
It'll be nice to do it again as a free man.
That was a noble thing you did back there.
He doesn't deserve it.
I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends to become killers.
Besides, dead, the truth dies with him.
Alive, you're free.
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!
Ron!
Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!
- Sweet, clever girl!
Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!
I don't know if you know, Harry but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather.
I know.
I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle but if you ever wanted a different home...
What?
Come and live with you?
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.
Harry!
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live!
Here!
This flesh is only flesh!
Expelliarmus!
Harry!
Remus!
Remus!
Run!
Run!
- Come on.
- Wait.
Wait.
Hermione!
Bad idea.
Bad idea.
Professor?
Professor Lupin?
Nice doggy.
Nice doggy!
There you are, Potter!
Sirius!
Come back here, Potter!
Sirius!
No.
Sirius!
Expecto Patronum!
Harry?
I saw my dad.
What?
He sent the dementors away.
I saw him across the lake.
Harry, they've captured Sirius.
Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.
- They're gonna kill him?
- No.
It's worse.
Much worse.
They're going to suck out his soul.
Headmaster, stop them.
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true.
Sirius is innocent.
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?
He's my rat, sir.
He's not really a rat.
He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.
But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.
A child's voice, however honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.
Mysterious thing, time.
Powerful and when meddled with, dangerous.
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen.
And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime.
If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss.
If you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared.
Three turns should do it, I think.
Oh, and by the way.
When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin.
Good luck.
What the bloody hell was that all about?
Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk...
What just happened?
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.
Where were we at 7:30?
I don't know.
Going to Hagrid's?
Come on.
And we can't be seen.
Hermione!
Hermione!
Hermione, wait.
Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
That's us.
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
This is not normal.
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first term.
This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.
Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.
Good punch.
Thanks.
Malfoy's coming.
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood!
Mark my words.
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Come on.
We should be at Hagrid's.
Look.
Buckbeak's still alive.
Of course.
Remember what Dumbledore said?
If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.
Let's go.
Here they come.
I'd better hurry.
Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.
Scabbers, you're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.
If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad.
Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time.
We can't be seen.
Fudge is coming.
And we aren't leaving?
Why aren't we leaving?
Are you mad?
That hurt.
Sorry.
We're coming out the back door.
Go!
Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go.
Okay, go, Harry.
Go!
Get away.
Get off.
Minister, I really think I should sign as well.
Yes, very well.
Perhaps it would be...
Okay, Buckbeak.
Come quickly.
Come with us now.
Come on.
Keep trying.
Come on.
Quickly.
Buckbeak.
Okay?
Quickly.
Hurry up.
Okay?
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.
Come and get the nice dead ferret.
- Come on.
It's here.
Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister.
Follow me.
- Now, look there.
- Where?
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?
Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
- Oh, yes.
Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.
- Come on, Buckbeak.
Come on.
- I see no strawberries.
- Over there.
- Where?
- Over there.
- This way.
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.
But where is it?
I saw the beast, just now.
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.
Buckbeak.
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.
I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.
- Right.
- Well, well.
We must search the grounds.
Well, search the skies, if you must, minister.
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy.
Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required.
Thank you.
You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor.
- Come on.
- This way.
This way, now.
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.
- How?
- No idea.
- Look.
It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!
And Snape's coming.
And now we wait.
And now we wait.
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.
- Hermione?
- Yeah?
Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius I did see someone.
That someone made the dementors go away.
With a Patronus.
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
According to him only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
It was my dad.
My dad conjured the Patronus.
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead.
I know.
I'm just telling you what I saw.
Here we come.
You see Sirius talking to me there?
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'.
It'll just be me and him.
We could live in the country someplace you can see the sky.
He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
Harry!
Run!
Let's go.
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.
Thanks.
- Great.
Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that.
Run!
That was so scary.
Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
Sirius.
Come on!
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.
Any minute now.
Right there.
You'll see.
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.
- Sirius.
- You're dying both of you.
Harry!
Expecto Patronum!
You were right, Hermione.
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!
I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.
I knew I could do it this time because well, I had already done it.
- Does that make sense?
- No.
But I don't like flying...!
Bombarda!
I'll be forever grateful for this to both of you.
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.
For some time, my life will be too unpredictable.
And besides you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.
And you know it.
And for now, that will do.
I expect you're tired of hearing this but you look so like your father.
Except your eyes.
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.
It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little.
But know this:
The ones that love us never really leave us.
And you can always find them in here.
You really are the brightest witch of your age.
We have to go.
- Well?
- He's free.
We did it.
Did what?
Good night.
How did you get there?
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.
Honestly, Ron.
How can somebody be in two places at once?
Hello, Harry.
I saw you coming.
I've looked worse, believe me.
- You've been sacked.
- No.
No.
I resigned, actually.
Resigned?
Why?
Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition.
This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want well, someone like me teaching their children.
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already risked enough on my behalf.
Besides, people like me are...
Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now.
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
None of it made any difference.
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.
You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.
It made a great deal of difference.
If I am proud of anything it is of how much you have learned this year.
Now, since I am no longer your teacher I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you.
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
Until then mischief managed.
Stand back, I said!
Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle.
Harry.
Wherever did you get it?
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.
Did not.
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.
For me?
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.
This came with it.
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.
How fast is it, Harry?
Lumos.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
Mischief managed.
Nox.
TRU:
previously on Tru Calling:
Anyway, I just wanted to say welcome.
I'm Tru.
Jack.
JACK:
A couple of years ago... I died.
And then, I came back.
Some would say once you survive something like that... that you were brought back for a reason.
I guess we'll see.
davis:
How did it go with Jack?
I just can't get a read on him, for some reason.
One minute he's in your face and almost obnoxious.
The next, he's charming, trying to be your best friend.
Leave the key.
Step away from the car.
Hang on to your keys, Harrison.
-You sure about that?
-Yeah.
What, you got some kind of death wish?
Death isn't something you have to wish for. lt's coming anyway.
Death is part of life.
TRU:
Someone stopped us from saving her.
But that doesn't make any sense.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Slow instrumental music]
davis:
So you ended up ordering takeout?
What did you get?
TRU:
Moo Shu pork.
davis:
Nice choice.
With the pancakes?
No, straight from the box.
You?
I'm just digging into a rack of lamb with some garlic mashed potatoes.
TRU:
Cereal again?
davis:
Yeah.
The doctor says I'm fiber-poor.
So what are you doing tonight?
You know, the usual.
Nothing?
davis:
Exactly.
Look, me being alone on a Friday night is one thing... but you, on the other hand....
With my life, it's rejuvenating to have a night off.
And besides, I told you. I'm between exes.
[Davis mumbling]
What?
It's okay to say that you miss someone.
Luc?
Why would you say that I miss Luc?
I didn't say Luc.
You said Luc.
Yeah, well--
davis:
The way I see it is, just because we're alone... doesn't mean that we're lonely.
So by that reasoning, you'd argue that my neighbor across the way?
She looks like she's having the time of her life.
davis:
She's probably miserable.
TRU:
Gotta tell you, Davis, it sure seems like she's having fun to me.
davis:
Trust me.
Nothing is ever exactly what it seems.
Listen, I've got to go.
The Outer Limits marathon is about to start.
I'll let you go.
davis:
Tru, for what it's worth... I happen to think that you have a pretty exciting life, you know?
Time travel... saving lives, pretty cool boss.
Yeah.
Good night, Davis.
Good night, Tru.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
WOMAN: [On Machine] Leave me a message, I'II call you back.
Consider this a warning.
You can make all the trouble you want... but it's only a matter of time before I find you.
And when I do, let's just say there won't be a second warning.
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
[Theme music]
Help me.
[Slow instrumental music]
[Knocking on door]
DELlVERYMAN:
Delivery!
[Knocking continues]
Coming.
[Quizzical instrumental music]
TRU: 4B, not 3B.
Four, as in upstairs!
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
Tru?
Hey.
I haven't seen you around much.
I thought you moved.
No, I've just been working some weird hours lately.
But the delivery man left this at my door by accident.
Cool.
Thanks.
[Stuttering] Hey, Tru!
Can I get your advice on something?
Sure.
There is this girl.
And she lives nearby... and she is amazing.
Right.
She's always busy running around all over town... but whenever I see her, she just makes me want to smile.
I see.
Yeah, and, well... I've been wanting to ask her out for a while... but I'm afraid that if she says no, things will get weird.
You know, on account of us being neighbors.
Yeah.
I would advise you... to first make sure that she's ready to date.
And after that, I would take things slow.
Right.
Yeah.
Slow.
Very slow, you know?
Okay.
Makes sense.
-Okay.
Thank you.
-No problem.
Just the morgue attendant I was looking for.
I'll bet you say that to all the girls.
Remember I told you I was looking for a new apartment?
I found the perfect one-bedroom.
It's close to work, utilities included.
-Congrats.
-l haven't signed the lease yet...
-'cause I wanted to run it by you first.
-Me, why?
The thing is, it's in the building across the street from yours... and I didn't want you feeling crowded or anything.
So I figured I should check with you.
Are you kidding?
You should jump on it.
TRU:
Places in my neighborhood are so hard to find.
Morning, gang.
Hey, you got your state license forms.
Davis only called me three times to remind me.
So you're sure about this?
Positive. it'll be so nice to have a friend across the street.
-Guess I got a lease to sign.
-Sweet.
LUC:
See you.
TRU:
Okay, bye.
[Slow instrumental music]
davis:
Signed and dated.
Perfect.
You put the morgue as your mailing address.
I hope that's okay.
I've been staying at a friend's place since I moved here.
-Figured this was the best place to get me.
-Not a problem.
As a matter of fact, you got some mail this morning.
davis:
Here it is.
davis:
The Schenkman Center.
That's an impressive facility.
Yeah, one of the best in the country.
davis:
Were you there long?
I don't remember it being on your résumé.
It was a long time ago.
I didn't think it was relevant.
davis:
Did you ever run into a guy named Tom Forrester?
An old college buddy of mine.
We used to play DD on the weekends.
We called him Wizard.
Forrester.
Yeah, sure.
Big fella.
JACK:
Hell of a guy.
davis:
Yeah.
Good old Wizard. I wonder what he's....
davis:
I should give him a call.
harrison:
So the meet's at noon.
harrison:
High noon.
TRU:
Don't be so dramatic.
It's the first time me and Lindsay are seeing each other since the breakup.
We're exchanging stuff.
How is that not dramatic?
Look, I want you both to be happy.
But the truth is, it's not so bad being single.
[Peppy music playing in diner]
Who are you kidding?
Not me.
And you've been busted up since you and Luc split.
TRU:
That's just not true.
harrison:
Yeah?
And what's your love life now?
Talking on the phone with Davis all day?
Telling me your upstairs neighbor has a crush on you?
You're pleasant today.
You're right, I'm sorry.
I'm just nervous.
harrison:
Anyway, I got to get going.
Whose turn is it?
You ask that like we actually take turns.
Yeah, well, I'll get the next one.
I'll hold my breath.
I don't care.
You listen to me, for the last time, leave me alone.
TRU:
My neighbor looks like she's having the time of her life.
Some guys won't take no for an answer.
Well, try saying yes.
Yes, you're a psycho.
Yes, I was right to break up with you.
I'll have to remember that.
You look familiar.
Have we met?
No, but I've seen you around the neighborhood.
Thanks, Chris.
-l'm Tru Davies.
-Chris Barronson.
-Always nice to put a name with a face.
-Absolutely.
-Thanks.
Take care.
-Bye.
One Motley Crue concert tee.
One deck of naked lady cards.
[Whooping]
Two eggs of Silly Putty.
And 13 assorted comic books.
I've been looking for these.
All right, where's my stuff?
That's it?
Yeah, I turned my place upside down... and that is all I could find.
That's not even mine.
Yeah, well, uh...
[Rhythmic instrumental music]
Look, the reason I asked you to meet me here today... is because I wanted to look you in the eye... into those eyes... and tell you that I want you back.
What?
Just give me one more chance, that's all I'm asking for.
No, I've given you, like, 50 chances... and you blew every single one of them.
You're just too self-absorbed to know it.
And you're the perfect girlfriend, right?
What?
You're so needy.
And demanding.
You always order the most expensive thing on the menu... when you knew I couldn't afford it.
harrison:
Right?
Hmm?
[Rhythmic instrumental music continues]
Take care of yourself, Harrison.
When will I learn to shut my mouth?
Hi.
Tom Forrester, please.
[Davis clearing throat]
Hi, Wiz?
Hi, it's Gothar, the Elf King.
Yeah.
Davis.
Yeah.
Listen, turns out we have a friend in common.
Jack Harper.
[Exclaims affirmatively]
Yeah, he used to work with you at Schenkman.
[Mysterious instrumental music]
Mmm-Hmm.
Really?
[Slow instrumental music]
[Phone ringing]
TRU:
Hello?
So your brother and I are officially through.
Can't say I'm surprised, but I'm so sorry.
lindsay:
He made this sad, Iast-ditch attempt to patch things up.
And when I said no, he called me needy and demanding.
Can you believe that?
[Tense instrumental music]
Hello, Tru, you there?
TRU:
Yeah, sorry, I just....
There's this couple across the building and they're having this nasty fight.
lindsay:
Are they still going at it?
I can't tell.
They just turned the lights off.
One guess.
Makeup sex.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Anyway, Linds, I got to get to work.
lindsay:
Fine. I'll talk to you later, okay?
TRU:
Okay.
JACK:
Incoming.
Hey, Tru?
I thought you said your neighborhood was getting better?
It is.
I've got a homicide here that might disagree.
You picked this up near my place?
A building across the street, if I'm not mistaken.
Victim's name is Chris Barronson, died from massive head trauma.
Chris Barronson?
Friend of yours?
No, we just met.
Today.
-You sure you want to see this?
-Yeah.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
That's not Chris Barronson.
-lt's what his id said.
-No, Chris is a girl.
I saw this guy at her place earlier tonight.
He was furious about something.
You know, the cops said something about thinking the killer was a woman.
Bag this, will you?
Two people, same name, same apartment?
-lt's either coincidence...
-Doubtful.
...or our buddy here's been up to no good.
Hi, Tru.
I thought you were home for the night.
-l was, but--
-Couldn't stay away?
Actually, if you have a moment?
I'm kind of in the middle of something.
Can it wait?
It's actually important.
We need to talk.
[Tense instrumental music]
Tru, go ahead. I got this.
-Tru?
-Yeah.
Okay, I'm coming.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Please save me.
[Knocking on door]
DELlVERYMAN:
Delivery!
DELlVERYMAN:
Delivery!
[Fast-paced instrumental music]
Wait!
Hold on!
You've got the wrong apartment!
Even when you relive days they still get away.
So your neighbor and victim have the same name?
He's dead and she's the prime suspect?
Yep.
But it wouldn't be any fun if it were easy.
Okay, well, here's a theory.
Could be identity theft.
He took her identity and she killed him for it.
davis:
Identity theft is on the rise.
They're either stealing it online... or taking a picture of your credit card with a cell phone.
She seemed so normal.
It's hard to imagine her killing anyone.
People can do a lot of things in self-defense.
davis:
Especially when they're pushed past their limit.
For the last time, leave me alone.
-Maybe you're right.
-Hi, Jack.
Sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to drop off my state license forms.
davis:
Super.
Thanks.
JACK:
Hey.
TRU:
Hi.
We were just going over the new intake procedure.
Cool.
You mind if I check the mail?
Unfortunately, this is the only address most people have for me.
-No, go ahead.
-Thanks.
Tru, about the new intake procedure.
[Davis clearing throat]
Were there any other clues about the victim's real identity?
He had a pen with a logo on it.
It was a sunburst with a capital "A" inside.
Probably from his work. I'll look into it.
An identity thief with a day job.
All the better to meet new victims.
I got to get going.
Chris will be at the diner any minute.
Okay. I'll call you if anything comes up.
There was something else... you wanted to tell me right before the day rewound.
-l did?
-You said it was important.
No clue.
Too bad I don't relive days.
davis:
But look on the bright side.
If you don't change too many things today... then we'll have the same conversation tonight.
Here's hoping.
harrison:
Yeah.
A redo day.
I get it.
No time for breakfast.
harrison:
But considering you're 24 hours ahead of me... what happened with Lindsay yesterday?
Do you want my advice?
Save the sit-down for another day.
Another week even.
Man. lt was that bad?
Put it this way:
Yeah.
All right.
Thanks for the heads up.
Too bad you're blowing off breakfast 'cause I would've picked up the tab today.
It must be nice living in your world, Harry.
Jack, is Tru around?
-You just missed her, man.
-Damn.
I needed to ask her something.
There's kind of a time factor.
She should be on her cell.
No, this is one of those things that's best to do in person.
Make sure she means what she says.
You mean women don't always say what they actually mean?
Not the ones I fall for.
LUC:
See you, man.
JACK:
Yeah.
MAN:
You're finished.
The fun is over.
For the last time, leave me alone.
Coffee, please.
Some guys, they just can't take no for an answer.
-Ex-boyfriend?
-lt's sort of a long story.
Thanks, Chris.
You know, you look familiar.
You don't live on York by any chance?
Yeah, I do.
-Same here. I'm Tru Davies.
-Chris Barronson.
It's always nice to put a name with a face.
Chris Barronson.
Yeah.
Have you heard of me?
Sort of.
There was this guy outside your building this morning... asking all these questions about you.
He seemed pretty belligerent.
About 6', dark brown hair?
Same guy who just can't take no for an answer?
Only he's not an ex.
Well, it's nothing I should get into.
If you're heading home, I could walk with you.
You know, in case he's still around.
-Okay.
-Okay.
chris:
It was six months ago... when I found out he'd stolen my identity.
I was applying for a loan, and the bank ran a credit check.
They found 10 different credit cards in my name.
He'd used them to run up nearly $60,000 in charges.
And now he's threatening you?
-Because I went to the police.
-No arrest?
Id theft's tricky to prosecute.
You need absolute proof, which I don't have.
But it's getting worse because now I feel like someone's been watching me.
That's creepy.
Any idea how this all started?
No, but there's a million ways.
If you don't have a shredder, a firewall... a digitally scrambled phone... you may as well have a sign up saying:
Ruin my life.
Anyway, thanks for the company.
And do me a favor, if you see that guy again... just say I moved or something.
No problem.
Because if I run into him, there's no telling what might happen.
-Jack?
-Hey.
TRU:
What are you doing here?
JACK:
Moving in.
You're kidding?
No. I saw the "For Rent" sign and snapped it up.
JACK:
Lucky for me.
The guy who was supposed to take it... missed the deadline 'cause he had to run it by his girlfriend or something.
The thing is, it's in the building across the street from yours... and I didn't want you feeling crowded.
But his loss is my gain.
Third floor, great view.
Unbelievable.
So I've heard.
JACK:
I got to get started with the packing process. I'll see you later on.
Tru, your friend, who I just met.
She wouldn't happen to be single, would she?
I'm not sure a new guy is what she needs right now.
TRU:
Besides, a word of advice.
Girls don't appreciate being hit on by their neighbors.
We need to find some more interesting neighbors.
Maybe you need to find some less desperate tenants.
Look, she's having guy trouble right now.
JACK:
A bad breakup?
TRU:
Not exactly.
All right.
Fine.
Don't tell me.
I'll find out on my own soon enough.
Hey, wait.
The truth is, there's this guy that's been harassing her... and the last thing she needs is--
-Two.
-Yeah.
Enough said.
TRU:
Okay.
JACK:
You know, Tru... if that other guy really is a problem, I wouldn't mind keeping an eye on her.
I know you think I'm heartless... but I have been known to show an interest in people other than myself.
Thanks, but I've got it under control.
I'd expect no less.
[Phone ringing]
TRU:
Hello.
davis:
Hi, it's me.
I found your logo and your identity thief.
Really?
It's a company called Advantix.
They sell medical equipment.
And there is a salesman there by the name of Chris Barronson.
Did you get an address?
Don't need to.
He's coming to the morgue in 20 minutes to make a presentation.
You made an appointment with the guy?
I told him we weren't happy with our current distributor.
You're always chasing the bad guy.
Why not make them come to you for once?
TRU:
Nice, D. I'll see you in 20.
davis:
Okay.
This is my colleague, Tru.
This is Chris Barronson.
Please save me.
This is my first sales call to a morgue.
Most of our equipment's designed to keep the patient out of a place like this.
Everyone passes through sooner or later.
Right.
Anyway, let me show you guys what might be useful.
Had this job long, Mr. Barronson?
Eight, nine months.
Why?
Does it pay well?
Only if you buy what I sell.
I guess you don't sell that much.
All right.
Who are you people?
I think who you are is the bigger question.
What?
We know who the real Chris Barronson is and you are not her.
And it's only a matter of time before the police figure that out.
Right.
She's good.
I'll give her that.
She pulled a fast one on you guys.
-l don't think you get it.
-No, I do.
You don't get it.
All right, the police are on my side.
Except they're too inept to do anything about it.
Look, I'm the real Chris Barronson, okay?
Here, see?
All right?
She stole my identity.
And if you guys know who she is... you'd better talk some sense into her before I find her myself.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
The DMV has his picture on file back to the early '90s.
The state police confirm there were six identity theft reports... filed by a man named Chris Barronson.
Looks like he's the real deal.
Which means the girl you met in the diner isn't.
She probably gave me that name... because it was on the credit card she was using.
I've spent the day helping a con woman... while the guy who needs help wants nothing to do with me.
Helping the criminal may be the only way to help the victim.
Since the real Chris won't talk to you, focus on the fake one.
See if you can't keep her from committing a murder today.
Right.
[cellphone ringing]
TRU:
Hello.
JACK:
It's Jack.
TRU:
What's up?
JACK:
Your friend's on the move.
TRU:
She left the building?
JACK:
But don't worry.
JACK:
I'm keeping an eye on her.
TRU:
You followed her?
You seemed worried about her.
Thought I was doing you a favor.
TRU:
Where is she now?
JACK:
She's headed back into your neighborhood.
But about an hour ago, she was in a jewelry store downtown.
Did she buy anything?
Yeah, a necklace.
But she didn't keep it long.
She walked six blocks to a pawnshop... and sold it for half of what she just paid for it.
Crazy.
She's almost home now.
She's all yours. I got some errands to run.
Wait, Jack?
You got to let me hang up so you can miss me.
Cute, but, no.
You followed her.
I can't help wondering why.
She looked like she might be in trouble.
And aside from a little white-collar crime, she's harmless.
Just be careful.
She's not exactly who she seems.
Who is?
-Jack is following her?
-He was trying to help.
Listen, I want you to take this before you go.
It's the name and the number of the cop I talked to, just in case.
Who's Tom Forrester?
He's an old college buddy of mine, but I haven't talked to him in years.
Why?
Yesterday, you had a note to call him.
Remember to find out what it is you want to tell me.
We have to keep the days as similar as possible.
Okay. I'll give him a ring.
He's a hell of a guy.
Great Dungeon Master.
God, did I just say that out loud?
[Soft instrumental music]
[Phone ringing]
Harrison.
harrison:
Look, about today, I....
lindsay:
Let me guess.
Not gonna work for you.
No, not so much.
You lost all my stuff, didn't you?
No. lt's not that. lt's just.... lt just isn't the best day for it.
Why not?
Well, because, I got to.... lt just isn't.
Okay?
Fine.
Whatever.
We'll just do it tomorrow, same time, same place.
harrison:
I'll be there. I promise.
lindsay:
Yeah.
Bye.
You better be right about this, Tru.
Excuse me, miss?
I didn't want you to forget this.
-Randall?
-Lindsay?
[Laughing] My God.
Feel like telling me who you really are?
I already told you. I'm Chris Barronson.
Look, don't bother. I know you're not.
I know you've been buying jewelry... with someone else's credit card and pawning it off for quick cash.
How did you know that?
It doesn't really matter.
It's just time for you to stop.
Just give this guy, Chris, his life back.
I will.
Someday.
Someday isn't soon enough.
Trust me on this.
I don't trust anyone.
That's why I'm so good at what I do.
Stay out of it, Tru.
You're in over your head.
Hey, Tru.
What a nice surprise.
How's it going?
TRU:
Good, thanks.
I got a package for you delivered to me inadvertently this morning.
Do you want to come up and....
There's this girl.
Right.
I've been wanting to ask her out.
You know what?
I'll just drop it off later.
I'll save you the time, okay?
I'd be happy to come by.
I'd love to see your place.
-l'm actually just in a hurry, so....
-Okay.
Can I ask you one question?
Sorry, I'm in the middle of something.
But I'll catch up with you later, okay?
davis:
What is she doing now?
TRU:
Looks like she's packing.
davis:
What is she doing now?
TRU:
Looks like she's packing.
davis:
That's good.
Maybe you spooked her enough... so she'II be gone by the time the real Chris Barronson shows up.
Maybe, but we can't count on it.
-l talked to Tom Forrester, by the way.
-And?
He told me about his wife and his kids... and his research after leaving the Schenkman Center.
But it's certainly nothing I need to discuss with you.
It was worth a shot.
davis:
You don't think that the important thing... has anything to do with the kidney stone I passed last week, do you?
Okay, probably not. I'll keep looking.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Beeping] I know you think you can handle this, but you're the one in over her head.
TRU:
It'II only get worse.
Running won't solve anything.
Let me help you or I'll tell the police where to find you.
It's your choice.
[Sustained buzzing]
It was just so easy, you know?
Like free money.
And at first, I only did it to get by.
But now, it's....
God, you got to believe me.
I had no idea it would go this far.
Okay.
But it has.
And now we have to do something about it.
I'm scared.
The messages this guy's been leaving for me.
What if I paid him back?
Do you think he would still turn me in to the police?
You can pay him back?
Yeah, I could give him cash.
Really?
You have that much money?
I told you, I was good.
If only that were something to be proud of.
[Somber instrumental music]
You.
You turned my life upside down.
She wants to make amends.
That's why I called.
Sure, now that I know where to find her.
-l'm so sorry.
-You're sorry?
-l'm so sorry.
-You're sorry?
-No, I really am.
-Sorry doesn't cover it.
Here.
Maybe this will.
It's the least I can do with you giving me a second chance.
I almost forgot.
Here.
The credit card I took out in your name.
If I ever hear from you again, or if I see you--
You won't. I promise.
Fine.
chris:
I have a phone call to make.
And you?
You should be gone when I get back.
Thanks, Tru.
I know you probably don't care... but my real name is Cathy.
It's nice to meet you, Cathy.
CATHY:
Here, let me get this.
TRU:
No, I got it.
This one's on me.
Thank you again for everything.
TRU:
Hey.
You caught me using a city vehicle for personal business.
What vehicle?
I want to thank you for helping me out today.
It's nothing you wouldn't have done for me.
Thanks.
Still, I mean you took it upon yourself to look out for someone... I told you was in trouble, no questions asked.
Should I have asked some?
I can't help thinking most people would.
Whatever's going on between you and your friend... it's none of my business.
-lt's never stopped you before.
-All right, fine.
Tell me.
And if I don't?
I'll ply you with alcohol and pry it out of you.
Right.
Or you'll owe me one.
Lock up the van for me, will you?
-Keys?
-They must be inside.
-l talked to Tom Forrester.
-And?
He told me about his research after leaving the Schenkman Center.
Here you go.
I guess you can lock up yourself.
chris:
Hey.
waitress:
Hey.
Could I get a roast beef sandwich to go?
Sure thing.
-Nothing smaller?
-No, not tonight.
I'm sorry, but this bill's a fake.
You got to be kidding me.
You said your friend Tom worked at the Schenkman Center, right?
Did you mention Jack when you spoke to him?
No, why would I?
TRU:
Jack had a letter from the Schenkman Center in his coat.
I bet you found it first yesterday.
Why don't I give Tom another call?
Yeah, just let me know what he says, okay?
Here we go again.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Beeping]
Lock yourself out?
Yeah, it happens to me at least once a week.
Here, I'm sorry. I'm the new tenant.
chris:
I appreciate it.
JACK:
You bet.
JACK:
Here you go.
chris:
Thank you.
TRU:
Matt?
[Mysterious instrumental music]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Now I feel like someone's been watching me.
There is this girl.
And she lives nearby.
[Dramatic instrumental music intensifies]
TRU:
Chris.
What is he doing?
[Arresting instrumental music]
Matt?
[Racy instrumental music]
[Beeping]
TRU:
Come on.
JACK:
hello?
Jack, it's Tru!
I need to get in.
Hey, Tru.
What are you doing on this side of the street?
Please, Jack, I need to get into Cathy's apartment right away.
Cathy?
Who's Cathy?
Chris.
Chris is Cathy.
The girl that you followed.
-Please, Jack, hurry!
-Okay.
Let me just try and figure this thing out.
It's trickier than I thought.
Did that do it?
Thanks.
Excuse me.
JACK:
Tru, did that do it?
Tru?
Tru?
[Matt exclaiming]
I'm telling you, stay away from her!
She's a nice girl!
Put it down, Matt.
MATT:
He broke into her apartment!
He wants to hurt her!
I know you want to protect her, but you don't know anything about her!
Yes, I do!
I watched her every single day since she moved in.
I know her better than anyone.
No, she's not who you think.
Look, she's a thief.
She stole this man's identity.
No.
She can't be.
She's perfect!
She would never do that!
It's okay, Matt.
You're not the only one that she's fooled.
But I'm telling you the truth.
She's stolen thousands of dollars.
She's ruined people's lives.
She's a thief?
I'm sorry.
[Matt breathing heavily]
MATT:
I'm sorry.
TRU:
Are you okay?
Why did you come here?
I thought that we had an agreement.
Yeah, we did.
Till I found out that the money she gave me was fake.
Now she's gone, I'm still broke... and I'm probably never gonna see her again.
You never know.
Stranger things have happened.
I don't understand what's taking so long.
It's been 45 minutes already.
I'm very sorry.
Did my card not go through?
The card number's fine, but our computer's down.
Just give us another minute, we'll get you all sorted out, Miss Davies.
TRU:
Heading out of town, Tru?
You know, it's a good thing I don't believe every sob story I hear.
Mine, for example?
You almost had me.
But then you absolutely blew it back there at the diner.
This one's on me.
You pulled out your camera cell phone the second I put my credit card down.
All I had to do was call the credit card company... and report a stolen credit card.
I knew you had the number, but I was hoping that you wouldn't use it.
Then I got the call.
WOMAN:
Miss, there's activity reported on your credit card at A vaIon Car rental.
TRU:
Thank you.
is it too late for me to explain?
To me?
Yeah.
But I know a couple of guys who'd be happy to listen.
[Police siren wailing]
TRU:
Really, you had a good day?
lindsay:
It was the best, Tru.
The perfect afternoon with the perfect guy.
Wait, you were with my brother?
No.
Harrison was his usual self.
Called to cancel after I was already there.
But that's how I spotted Randall.
Randall?
I met him a few years ago when I was studying abroad.
He's actually in town for a few weeks and he's a total opposite of your brother.
TRU:
Well, lucky break.
Just when I was starting to think they didn't make them like this anymore.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Good night, Tru.
LUC: [On Machine] Hey, it's Luc.
I couldn't get to the phone right now.
Leave me a message.
Hey, Luc, it's me, Tru.
I heard through the grapevine... that you missed out on that apartment across the street... and I just wanted to call and say that I'm sorry.
I know that we're not together anymore... but it would've been nice to be neighbors.
Just to know you were close.
I'II talk to you soon.
I just wanted to call.
Okay, bye.
[Phone ringing]
Luc?
No, Tru. lt's me, I'm sorry.
I saw the morgue number and thought he was working tonight.
What's up?
I talked to my friend at Schenkman.
What I had to tell you is definitely about Jack.
Turns out he was a patient there.
A patient?
But Schenkman's a psychiatric facility.
It seems like he was there voluntarily.
He checked himself in so he could check himself out.
Well, we knew something was off with Jack, but--
davis:
There's more.
When Jack committed himself, he thought he was going crazy.
But the doctors couldn't diagnosis it.
Going crazy how?
He thought he was reliving days.
[Slow instrumental music]
Reliving days?
Like me?
Exactly like you.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Rock music]
Previously on Tru Calling:
Anyway, I just wanted to say welcome.
I'm Tru.
Jack.
A couple of years ago...
I died.
And then, I came back.
Some would say once you survive something like that... that you were brought back for a reason.
I guess we'll see.
How did it go with Jack?
I just can't get a read on him, for some reason.
One minute he's in your face and almost obnoxious.
The next, he's charming, trying to be your best friend.
Leave the key.
Step away from the car.
Hang on to your keys, Harrison.
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.
What, you got some kind of death wish?
Death isn't something you have to wish for.
It's coming anyway.
Death is part of life.
Someone stopped us from saving her.
But that doesn't make any sense.
So you ended up ordering takeout?
What did you get?
Moo Shu pork.
Nice choice.
With the pancakes?
No, straight from the box.
You?
I'm just digging into a rack of lamb with some garlic mashed potatoes.
Cereal again?
Yeah.
The doctor says I'm fiber-poor.
So what are you doing tonight?
You know, the usual.
Nothing?
Exactly.
Look, me being alone on a Friday night is one thing... but you, on the other hand...
With my life, it's rejuvenating to have a night off.
And besides, I told you.
I'm between exes.
What?
It's okay to say that you miss someone.
Luc?
Why would you say that I miss Luc?
I didn't say Luc.
You said Luc.
Yeah, well-
The way I see it is, just because we're alone... doesn't mean that we're lonely.
So by that reasoning, you'd argue that my neighbor across the way?
She looks like she's having the time of her life.
She's probably miserable.
Gotta tell you, Davis, it sure seems like she's having fun to me.
Trust me.
Nothing is ever exactly what it seems.
Listen, I've got to go.
The Outer Limits marathon is about to start.
I'll let you go.
Tru, for what it's worth...
I happen to think that you have a pretty exciting life, you know?
Time travel... saving lives, pretty cool boss.
Yeah.
Good night, Davis.
Good night, Tru.
Leave me a message, I'll call you back.
Consider this a warning.
You can make all the trouble you want... but it's only a matter of time before I find you.
And when I do, let's just say there won't be a second warning.
Help me.
Delivery!
Coming.
4B, not 3B.
Four, as in upstairs!
Tru?
Hey.
I haven't seen you around much.
I thought you moved.
No, I've just been working some weird hours lately.
But the delivery man left this at my door by accident.
Cool.
Thanks.
Hey, Tru!
Can I get your advice on something?
Sure.
There is this girl.
And she lives nearby... and she is amazing.
Right.
She's always busy running around all over town... but whenever I see her, she just makes me want to smile.
I see.
Yeah, and, well...
I've been wanting to ask her out for a while... but I'm afraid that if she says no, things will get weird.
You know, on account of us being neighbors.
Yeah.
I would advise you... to first make sure that she's ready to date.
And after that, I would take things slow.
Right.
Yeah.
Slow.
Very slow, you know?
Okay.
Makes sense.
- Okay.
Thank you.
- No problem.
Just the morgue attendant I was looking for.
I'll bet you say that to all the girls.
Remember I told you I was looking for a new apartment?
I found the perfect one-bedroom.
It's close to work, utilities included.
- Congrats.
- I haven't signed the lease yet...
- 'cause I wanted to run it by you first.
- Me, why?
The thing is, it's in the building across the street from yours... and I didn't want you feeling crowded or anything.
So I figured I should check with you.
Are you kidding?
You should jump on it.
Places in my neighborhood are so hard to find.
Morning, gang.
Hey, you got your state license forms.
Davis only called me three times to remind me.
So you're sure about this?
Positive.
It'll be so nice to have a friend across the street.
- Guess I got a lease to sign.
- Sweet.
See you.
Okay, bye.
Signed and dated.
Perfect.
You put the morgue as your mailing address.
I hope that's okay.
I've been staying at a friend's place since I moved here.
- Figured this was the best place to get me.
- Not a problem.
As a matter of fact, you got some mail this morning.
Here it is.
The Schenkman Center.
That's an impressive facility.
Yeah, one of the best in the country.
Were you there long?
I don't remember it being on your résumé.
It was a long time ago.
I didn't think it was relevant.
Did you ever run into a guy named Tom Forrester?
An old college buddy of mine.
We used to play DD on the weekends.
We called him Wizard.
Forrester.
Yeah, sure.
Big fella.
Hell of a guy.
Yeah.
Good old Wizard.
I wonder what he's...
I should give him a call.
So the meet's at noon.
High noon.
Don't be so dramatic.
It's the first time me and Lindsay are seeing each other since the breakup.
We're exchanging stuff.
How is that not dramatic?
Look, I want you both to be happy.
But the truth is, it's not so bad being single.
Who are you kidding?
Not me.
And you've been busted up since you and Luc split.
That's just not true.
Yeah?
And what's your love life now?
Talking on the phone with Davis all day?
Telling me your upstairs neighbor has a crush on you?
You're pleasant today.
You're right, I'm sorry.
I'm just nervous.
Anyway, I got to get going.
Whose turn is it?
You ask that like we actually take turns.
Yeah, well, I'll get the next one.
I'll hold my breath.
I don't care.
You listen to me, for the last time, leave me alone.
My neighbor looks like she's having the time of her life.
Some guys won't take no for an answer.
Well, try saying yes.
Yes, you're a psycho.
Yes, I was right to break up with you.
I'll have to remember that.
You look familiar.
Have we met?
No, but I've seen you around the neighborhood.
Thanks, Chris.
- I'm Tru Davies.
- Chris Barronson.
- Always nice to put a name with a face.
- Absolutely.
- Thanks.
Take care.
- Bye.
One Motley Crue concert tee.
One deck of naked lady cards.
Two eggs of Silly Putty.
And 13 assorted comic books.
I've been looking for these.
All right, where's my stuff?
That's it?
Yeah, I turned my place upside down... and that is all I could find.
That's not even mine.
Yeah, well, uh...
Look, the reason I asked you to meet me here today... is because I wanted to look you in the eye... into those eyes... and tell you that I want you back.
What?
Just give me one more chance, that's all I'm asking for.
No, I've given you, like, 50 chances... and you blew every single one of them.
You're just too self-absorbed to know it.
And you're the perfect girlfriend, right?
What?
You're so needy.
And demanding.
You always order the most expensive thing on the menu... when you knew I couldn't afford it.
Right?
Hmm?
Take care of yourself, Harrison.
When will I learn to shut my mouth?
Hi.
Tom Forrester, please.
Hi, Wiz?
Hi, it's Gothar, the Elf King.
Yeah.
Davis.
Yeah.
Listen, turns out we have a friend in common.
Jack Harper.
Yeah, he used to work with you at Schenkman.
Mmm-Hmm.
Really?
Hello?
So your brother and I are officially through.
Can't say I'm surprised, but I'm so sorry.
He made this sad, last-ditch attempt to patch things up.
And when I said no, he called me needy and demanding.
Can you believe that?
Hello, Tru, you there?
Yeah, sorry, I just...
There's this couple across the building and they're having this nasty fight.
Are they still going at it?
I can't tell.
They just turned the lights off.
One guess.
Makeup sex.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Anyway, Linds, I got to get to work.
Fine.
I'll talk to you later, okay?
Okay.
Incoming.
Hey, Tru?
I thought you said your neighborhood was getting better?
It is.
I've got a homicide here that might disagree.
You picked this up near my place?
A building across the street, if I'm not mistaken.
Victim's name is Chris Barronson, died from massive head trauma.
Chris Barronson?
Friend of yours?
No, we just met.
Today.
- You sure you want to see this?
- Yeah.
That's not Chris Barronson.
- It's what his ID said.
- No, Chris is a girl.
I saw this guy at her place earlier tonight.
He was furious about something.
You know, the cops said something about thinking the killer was a woman.
Bag this, will you?
Two people, same name, same apartment?
- It's either coincidence...
- Doubtful.
...or our buddy here's been up to no good.
Hi, Tru.
I thought you were home for the night.
- I was, but-
- Couldn't stay away?
Actually, if you have a moment?
I'm kind of in the middle of something.
Can it wait?
It's actually important.
We need to talk.
Tru, go ahead.
I got this.
- Tru?
- Yeah.
Okay, I'm coming.
Please save me.
Delivery!
Delivery!
Wait!
Hold on!
You've got the wrong apartment!
Even when you relive days they still get away.
So your neighbor and victim have the same name?
He's dead and she's the prime suspect?
Yep.
But it wouldn't be any fun if it were easy.
Okay, well, here's a theory.
Could be identity theft.
He took her identity and she killed him for it.
Identity theft is on the rise.
They're either stealing it online... or taking a picture of your credit card with a cell phone.
She seemed so normal.
It's hard to imagine her killing anyone.
People can do a lot of things in self-defense.
Especially when they're pushed past their limit.
For the last time, leave me alone.
- Maybe you're right.
- Hi, Jack.
Sorry to interrupt.
I just wanted to drop off my state license forms.
Super.
Thanks.
Hey.
Hi.
We were just going over the new intake procedure.
Cool.
You mind if I check the mail?
Unfortunately, this is the only address most people have for me.
- No, go ahead.
- Thanks.
Tru, about the new intake procedure.
Were there any other clues about the victim's real identity?
He had a pen with a logo on it.
It was a sunburst with a capital "A" inside.
Probably from his work.
I'll look into it.
An identity thief with a day job.
All the better to meet new victims.
I got to get going.
Chris will be at the diner any minute.
Okay.
I'll call you if anything comes up.
There was something else... you wanted to tell me right before the day rewound.
- I did?
- You said it was important.
No clue.
Too bad I don't relive days.
But look on the bright side.
If you don't change too many things today... then we'll have the same conversation tonight.
Here's hoping.
Yeah.
A redo day.
I get it.
No time for breakfast.
But considering you're 24 hours ahead of me... what happened with Lindsay yesterday?
Do you want my advice?
Save the sit-down for another day.
Another week even.
Man.
It was that bad?
Put it this way:
Yeah.
All right.
Thanks for the heads up.
Too bad you're blowing off breakfast 'cause I would've picked up the tab today.
It must be nice living in your world, Harry.
Jack, is Tru around?
- You just missed her, man.
- Damn.
I needed to ask her something.
There's kind of a time factor.
She should be on her cell.
No, this is one of those things that's best to do in person.
Make sure she means what she says.
You mean women don't always say what they actually mean?
Not the ones I fall for.
See you, man.
Yeah.
You're finished.
The fun is over.
For the last time, leave me alone.
Coffee, please.
Some guys, they just can't take no for an answer.
- Ex-boyfriend?
- It's sort of a long story.
Thanks, Chris.
You know, you look familiar.
You don't live on York by any chance?
Yeah, I do.
- Same here.
I'm Tru Davies.
- Chris Barronson.
It's always nice to put a name with a face.
Chris Barronson.
Yeah.
Have you heard of me?
Sort of.
There was this guy outside your building this morning... asking all these questions about you.
He seemed pretty belligerent.
About 6', dark brown hair?
Same guy who just can't take no for an answer?
Only he's not an ex.
Well, it's nothing I should get into.
If you're heading home, I could walk with you.
You know, in case he's still around.
- Okay.
- Okay.
It was six months ago... when I found out he'd stolen my identity.
I was applying for a loan, and the bank ran a credit check.
They found 10 different credit cards in my name.
He'd used them to run up nearly $60,000 in charges.
And now he's threatening you?
- Because I went to the police.
- No arrest?
ID theft's tricky to prosecute.
You need absolute proof, which I don't have.
But it's getting worse because now I feel like someone's been watching me.
That's creepy.
Any idea how this all started?
No, but there's a million ways.
If you don't have a shredder, a firewall... a digitally scrambled phone... you may as well have a sign up saying:
Ruin my life.
Anyway, thanks for the company.
And do me a favor, if you see that guy again... just say I moved or something.
No problem.
Because if I run into him, there's no telling what might happen.
- Jack?
- Hey.
What are you doing here?
Moving in.
You're kidding?
No.
I saw the "For Rent" sign and snapped it up.
Lucky for me.
The guy who was supposed to take it... missed the deadline 'cause he had to run it by his girlfriend or something.
The thing is, it's in the building across the street from yours... and I didn't want you feeling crowded.
But his loss is my gain.
Third floor, great view.
Unbelievable.
So I've heard.
I got to get started with the packing process.
I'll see you later on.
Tru, your friend, who I just met.
She wouldn't happen to be single, would she?
I'm not sure a new guy is what she needs right now.
Besides, a word of advice.
Girls don't appreciate being hit on by their neighbors.
We need to find some more interesting neighbors.
Maybe you need to find some less desperate tenants.
Look, she's having guy trouble right now.
A bad breakup?
Not exactly.
All right.
Fine.
Don't tell me.
I'll find out on my own soon enough.
Hey, wait.
The truth is, there's this guy that's been harassing her... and the last thing she needs is-
- Two.
- Yeah.
Enough said.
Okay.
You know, Tru... if that other guy really is a problem, I wouldn't mind keeping an eye on her.
I know you think I'm heartless... but I have been known to show an interest in people other than myself.
Thanks, but I've got it under control.
I'd expect no less.
Hello.
Hi, it's me.
I found your logo and your identity thief.
Really?
It's a company called Advantix.
They sell medical equipment.
And there is a salesman there by the name of Chris Barronson.
Did you get an address?
Don't need to.
He's coming to the morgue in 20 minutes to make a presentation.
You made an appointment with the guy?
I told him we weren't happy with our current distributor.
You're always chasing the bad guy.
Why not make them come to you for once?
Nice, D. I'll see you in 20.
Okay.
This is my colleague, Tru.
This is Chris Barronson.
Please save me.
This is my first sales call to a morgue.
Most of our equipment's designed to keep the patient out of a place like this.
Everyone passes through sooner or later.
Right.
Anyway, let me show you guys what might be useful.
Had this job long, Mr. Barronson?
Eight, nine months.
Why?
Does it pay well?
Only if you buy what I sell.
I guess you don't sell that much.
All right.
Who are you people?
I think who you are is the bigger question.
What?
We know who the real Chris Barronson is and you are not her.
And it's only a matter of time before the police figure that out.
Right.
She's good.
I'll give her that.
She pulled a fast one on you guys.
- I don't think you get it.
- No, I do.
You don't get it.
All right, the police are on my side.
Except they're too inept to do anything about it.
Look, I'm the real Chris Barronson, okay?
Here, see?
All right?
She stole my identity.
And if you guys know who she is... you'd better talk some sense into her before I find her myself.
The DMV has his picture on file back to the early '9Os.
The state police confirm there were six identity theft reports... filed by a man named Chris Barronson.
Looks like he's the real deal.
Which means the girl you met in the diner isn't.
She probably gave me that name... because it was on the credit card she was using.
I've spent the day helping a con woman... while the guy who needs help wants nothing to do with me.
Helping the criminal may be the only way to help the victim.
Since the real Chris won't talk to you, focus on the fake one.
See if you can't keep her from committing a murder today.
Right.
Hello.
It's Jack.
What's up?
Your friend's on the move.
She left the building?
But don't worry.
I'm keeping an eye on her.
You followed her?
You seemed worried about her.
Thought I was doing you a favor.
Where is she now?
She's headed back into your neighborhood.
But about an hour ago, she was in a jewelry store downtown.
Did she buy anything?
Yeah, a necklace.
But she didn't keep it long.
She walked six blocks to a pawnshop... and sold it for half of what she just paid for it.
Crazy.
She's almost home now.
She's all yours.
I got some errands to run.
Wait, Jack?
You got to let me hang up so you can miss me.
Cute, but, no.
You followed her.
I can't help wondering why.
She looked like she might be in trouble.
And aside from a little white-collar crime, she's harmless.
Just be careful.
She's not exactly who she seems.
Who is?
- Jack is following her?
- He was trying to help.
Listen, I want you to take this before you go.
It's the name and the number of the cop I talked to, just in case.
Who's Tom Forrester?
He's an old college buddy of mine, but I haven't talked to him in years.
Why?
Yesterday, you had a note to call him.
Remember to find out what it is you want to tell me.
We have to keep the days as similar as possible.
Okay.
I'll give him a ring.
He's a hell of a guy.
Great Dungeon Master.
God, did I just say that out loud?
Harrison.
Look, about today, I...
Let me guess.
Not gonna work for you.
No, not so much.
You lost all my stuff, didn't you?
No.
It's not that.
It's just...
It just isn't the best day for it.
Why not?
Well, because, I got to...
It just isn't.
Okay?
Fine.
Whatever.
We'll just do it tomorrow, same time, same place.
I'll be there.
I promise.
Yeah.
Bye.
You better be right about this, Tru.
Excuse me, miss?
I didn't want you to forget this.
- Randall?
- Lindsay?
My God.
Feel like telling me who you really are?
I already told you.
I'm Chris Barronson.
Look, don't bother.
I know you're not.
I know you've been buying jewelry... with someone else's credit card and pawning it off for quick cash.
How did you know that?
It doesn't really matter.
It's just time for you to stop.
Just give this guy, Chris, his life back.
I will.
Someday.
Someday isn't soon enough.
Trust me on this.
I don't trust anyone.
That's why I'm so good at what I do.
Stay out of it, Tru.
You're in over your head.
Hey, Tru.
What a nice surprise.
How's it going?
Good, thanks.
I got a package for you delivered to me inadvertently this morning.
Do you want to come up and...
There's this girl.
Right.
I've been wanting to ask her out.
You know what?
I'll just drop it off later.
I'll save you the time, okay?
I'd be happy to come by.
I'd love to see your place.
- I'm actually just in a hurry, so...
- Okay.
Can I ask you one question?
Sorry, I'm in the middle of something.
But I'll catch up with you later, okay?
What is she doing now?
Looks like she's packing.
What is she doing now?
Looks like she's packing.
That's good.
Maybe you spooked her enough... so she'll be gone by the time the real Chris Barronson shows up.
Maybe, but we can't count on it.
- I talked to Tom Forrester, by the way.
- And?
He told me about his wife and his kids... and his research after leaving the Schenkman Center.
But it's certainly nothing I need to discuss with you.
It was worth a shot.
You don't think that the important thing... has anything to do with the kidney stone I passed last week, do you?
Okay, probably not.
I'll keep looking.
I know you think you can handle this, but you're the one in over her head.
It'll only get worse.
Running won't solve anything.
Let me help you or I'll tell the police where to find you.
It's your choice.
It was just so easy, you know?
Like free money.
And at first, I only did it to get by.
But now, it's...
God, you got to believe me.
I had no idea it would go this far.
Okay.
But it has.
And now we have to do something about it.
I'm scared.
The messages this guy's been leaving for me.
What if I paid him back?
Do you think he would still turn me in to the police?
You can pay him back?
Yeah, I could give him cash.
Really?
You have that much money?
I told you, I was good.
If only that were something to be proud of.
You.
You turned my life upside down.
She wants to make amends.
That's why I called.
Sure, now that I know where to find her.
- I'm so sorry.
- You're sorry?
- No, I really am.
- Sorry doesn't cover it.
Here.
Maybe this will.
It's the least I can do with you giving me a second chance.
I almost forgot.
Here.
The credit card I took out in your name.
If I ever hear from you again, or if I see you-
You won't.
I promise.
Fine.
I have a phone call to make.
And you?
You should be gone when I get back.
Thanks, Tru.
I know you probably don't care... but my real name is Cathy.
It's nice to meet you, Cathy.
Here, let me get this.
No, I got it.
This one's on me.
Thank you again for everything.
Hey.
You caught me using a city vehicle for personal business.
What vehicle?
I want to thank you for helping me out today.
It's nothing you wouldn't have done for me.
Thanks.
Still, I mean you took it upon yourself to look out for someone...
I told you was in trouble, no questions asked.
Should I have asked some?
I can't help thinking most people would.
Whatever's going on between you and your friend... it's none of my business.
- It's never stopped you before.
- All right, fine.
Tell me.
And if I don't?
I'll ply you with alcohol and pry it out of you.
Right.
Or you'll owe me one.
Lock up the van for me, will you?
- Keys?
- They must be inside.
- I talked to Tom Forrester.
- And?
He told me about his research after leaving the Schenkman Center.
Here you go.
I guess you can lock up yourself.
Hey.
Hey.
Could I get a roast beef sandwich to go?
Sure thing.
- Nothing smaller?
- No, not tonight.
I'm sorry, but this bill's a fake.
You got to be kidding me.
You said your friend Tom worked at the Schenkman Center, right?
Did you mention Jack when you spoke to him?
No, why would I?
Jack had a letter from the Schenkman Center in his coat.
I bet you found it first yesterday.
Why don't I give Tom another call?
Yeah, just let me know what he says, okay?
Here we go again.
Lock yourself out?
Yeah, it happens to me at least once a week.
Here, I'm sorry.
I'm the new tenant.
I appreciate it.
You bet.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Matt?
Now I feel like someone's been watching me.
There is this girl.
And she lives nearby.
Chris.
What is he doing?
Matt?
Come on.
Hello?
Jack, it's Tru!
I need to get in.
Hey, Tru.
What are you doing on this side of the street?
Please, Jack, I need to get into Cathy's apartment right away.
Cathy?
Who's Cathy?
Chris.
Chris is Cathy.
The girl that you followed.
- Please, Jack, hurry!
- Okay.
Let me just try and figure this thing out.
It's trickier than I thought.
Did that do it?
Thanks.
Excuse me.
Tru, did that do it?
Tru?
Tru?
I'm telling you, stay away from her!
She's a nice girl!
Put it down, Matt.
He broke into her apartment!
He wants to hurt her!
I know you want to protect her, but you don't know anything about her!
Yes, I do!
I watched her every single day since she moved in.
I know her better than anyone.
No, she's not who you think.
Look, she's a thief.
She stole this man's identity.
No.
She can't be.
She's perfect!
She would never do that!
It's okay, Matt.
You're not the only one that she's fooled.
But I'm telling you the truth.
She's stolen thousands of dollars.
She's ruined people's lives.
She's a thief?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Why did you come here?
I thought that we had an agreement.
Yeah, we did.
Till I found out that the money she gave me was fake.
Now she's gone, I'm still broke... and I'm probably never gonna see her again.
You never know.
Stranger things have happened.
I don't understand what's taking so long.
It's been 45 minutes already.
I'm very sorry.
Did my card not go through?
The card number's fine, but our computer's down.
Just give us another minute, we'll get you all sorted out, Miss Davies.
Heading out of town, Tru?
You know, it's a good thing I don't believe every sob story I hear.
Mine, for example?
You almost had me.
But then you absolutely blew it back there at the diner.
This one's on me.
You pulled out your camera cell phone the second I put my credit card down.
All I had to do was call the credit card company... and report a stolen credit card.
I knew you had the number, but I was hoping that you wouldn't use it.
Then I got the call.
Miss, there's activity reported on your credit card at A valon Car rental.
Thank you.
Is it too late for me to explain?
To me?
Yeah.
But I know a couple of guys who'd be happy to listen.
Really, you had a good day?
It was the best, Tru.
The perfect afternoon with the perfect guy.
Wait, you were with my brother?
No.
Harrison was his usual self.
Called to cancel after I was already there.
But that's how I spotted Randall.
Randall?
I met him a few years ago when I was studying abroad.
He's actually in town for a few weeks and he's a total opposite of your brother.
Well, lucky break.
Just when I was starting to think they didn't make them like this anymore.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Good night, Tru.
Hey, it's Luc.
I couldn't get to the phone right now.
Leave me a message.
Hey, Luc, it's me, Tru.
I heard through the grapevine... that you missed out on that apartment across the street... and I just wanted to call and say that I'm sorry.
I know that we're not together anymore... but it would've been nice to be neighbors.
Just to know you were close.
I'll talk to you soon.
I just wanted to call.
Okay, bye.
Luc?
No, Tru.
It's me, I'm sorry.
I saw the morgue number and thought he was working tonight.
What's up?
I talked to my friend at Schenkman.
What I had to tell you is definitely about Jack.
Turns out he was a patient there.
A patient?
But Schenkman's a psychiatric facility.
It seems like he was there voluntarily.
He checked himself in so he could check himself out.
Well, we knew something was off with Jack, but-
There's more.
When Jack committed himself, he thought he was going crazy.
But the doctors couldn't diagnosis it.
Going crazy how?
He thought he was reliving days.
Reliving days?
Like me?
Exactly like you.
Previously on Tru Calling:
Anyway, I just wanted to say welcome.
I'm Tru.
Jack.
A couple of years ago...
I died.
And then, I came back.
Some would say once you survive something like that... that you were brought back for a reason.
I guess we'll see.
How did it go with Jack?
I just can't get a read on him, for some reason.
One minute he's in your face and almost obnoxious.
The next, he's charming, trying to be your best friend.
Leave the key.
Step away from the car.
Hang on to your keys, Harrison.
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.
What, you got some kind of death wish?
Death isn't something you have to wish for.
It's coming anyway.
Death is part of life.
Someone stopped us from saving her.
But that doesn't make any sense.
So you ended up ordering takeout?
What did you get?
Moo Shu pork.
Nice choice.
With the pancakes?
No, straight from the box.
You?
I'm just digging into a rack of lamb with some garlic mashed potatoes.
Cereal again?
Yeah.
The doctor says I'm fiber-poor.
So what are you doing tonight?
You know, the usual.
Nothing?
Exactly.
Look, me being alone on a Friday night is one thing... but you, on the other hand...
With my life, it's rejuvenating to have a night off.
And besides, I told you.
I'm between exes.
What?
It's okay to say that you miss someone.
Luc?
Why would you say that I miss Luc?
I didn't say Luc.
You said Luc.
Yeah, well-
The way I see it is, just because we're alone... doesn't mean that we're lonely.
So by that reasoning, you'd argue that my neighbor across the way?
She looks like she's having the time of her life.
She's probably miserable.
Gotta tell you, Davis, it sure seems like she's having fun to me.
Trust me.
Nothing is ever exactly what it seems.
Listen, I've got to go.
The Outer Limits marathon is about to start.
I'll let you go.
Tru, for what it's worth...
I happen to think that you have a pretty exciting life, you know?
Time travel... saving lives, pretty cool boss.
Yeah.
Good night, Davis.
Good night, Tru.
Leave me a message, I'll call you back.
Consider this a warning.
You can make all the trouble you want... but it's only a matter of time before I find you.
And when I do, let's just say there won't be a second warning.
Help me.
Delivery!
Coming.
4B, not 3B.
Four, as in upstairs!
Tru?
Hey.
I haven't seen you around much.
I thought you moved.
No, I've just been working some weird hours lately.
But the delivery man left this at my door by accident.
Cool.
Thanks.
Hey, Tru!
Can I get your advice on something?
Sure.
There is this girl.
And she lives nearby... and she is amazing.
Right.
She's always busy running around all over town... but whenever I see her, she just makes me want to smile.
I see.
Yeah, and, well...
I've been wanting to ask her out for a while... but I'm afraid that if she says no, things will get weird.
You know, on account of us being neighbors.
Yeah.
I would advise you... to first make sure that she's ready to date.
And after that, I would take things slow.
Right.
Yeah.
Slow.
Very slow, you know?
Okay.
Makes sense.
- Okay.
Thank you.
- No problem.
Just the morgue attendant I was looking for.
I'll bet you say that to all the girls.
Remember I told you I was looking for a new apartment?
I found the perfect one-bedroom.
It's close to work, utilities included.
- Congrats.
- I haven't signed the lease yet...
- 'cause I wanted to run it by you first.
- Me, why?
The thing is, it's in the building across the street from yours... and I didn't want you feeling crowded or anything.
So I figured I should check with you.
Are you kidding?
You should jump on it.
Places in my neighborhood are so hard to find.
Morning, gang.
Hey, you got your state license forms.
Davis only called me three times to remind me.
So you're sure about this?
Positive.
It'll be so nice to have a friend across the street.
- Guess I got a lease to sign.
- Sweet.
See you.
Okay, bye.
Signed and dated.
Perfect.
You put the morgue as your mailing address.
I hope that's okay.
I've been staying at a friend's place since I moved here.
- Figured this was the best place to get me.
- Not a problem.
As a matter of fact, you got some mail this morning.
Here it is.
The Schenkman Center.
That's an impressive facility.
Yeah, one of the best in the country.
Were you there long?
I don't remember it being on your résumé.
It was a long time ago.
I didn't think it was relevant.
Did you ever run into a guy named Tom Forrester?
An old college buddy of mine.
We used to play DD on the weekends.
We called him Wizard.
Forrester.
Yeah, sure.
Big fella.
Hell of a guy.
Yeah.
Good old Wizard.
I wonder what he's...
I should give him a call.
So the meet's at noon.
High noon.
Don't be so dramatic.
It's the first time me and Lindsay are seeing each other since the breakup.
We're exchanging stuff.
How is that not dramatic?
Look, I want you both to be happy.
But the truth is, it's not so bad being single.
Who are you kidding?
Not me.
And you've been busted up since you and Luc split.
That's just not true.
Yeah?
And what's your love life now?
Talking on the phone with Davis all day?
Telling me your upstairs neighbor has a crush on you?
You're pleasant today.
You're right, I'm sorry.
I'm just nervous.
Anyway, I got to get going.
Whose turn is it?
You ask that like we actually take turns.
Yeah, well, I'll get the next one.
I'll hold my breath.
I don't care.
You listen to me, for the last time, leave me alone.
My neighbor looks like she's having the time of her life.
Some guys won't take no for an answer.
Well, try saying yes.
Yes, you're a psycho.
Yes, I was right to break up with you.
I'll have to remember that.
You look familiar.
Have we met?
No, but I've seen you around the neighborhood.
Thanks, Chris.
- I'm Tru Davies.
- Chris Barronson.
- Always nice to put a name with a face.
- Absolutely.
- Thanks.
Take care.
- Bye.
One Motley Crue concert tee.
One deck of naked lady cards.
Two eggs of Silly Putty.
And 13 assorted comic books.
I've been looking for these.
All right, where's my stuff?
That's it?
Yeah, I turned my place upside down... and that is all I could find.
That's not even mine.
Yeah, well, uh...
Look, the reason I asked you to meet me here today... is because I wanted to look you in the eye... into those eyes... and tell you that I want you back.
What?
Just give me one more chance, that's all I'm asking for.
No, I've given you, like, 50 chances... and you blew every single one of them.
You're just too self-absorbed to know it.
And you're the perfect girlfriend, right?
What?
You're so needy.
And demanding.
You always order the most expensive thing on the menu... when you knew I couldn't afford it.
Right?
Hmm?
Take care of yourself, Harrison.
When will I learn to shut my mouth?
Hi.
Tom Forrester, please.
Hi, Wiz?
Hi, it's Gothar, the Elf King.
Yeah.
Davis.
Yeah.
Listen, turns out we have a friend in common.
Jack Harper.
Yeah, he used to work with you at Schenkman.
Mmm-Hmm.
Really?
Hello?
So your brother and I are officially through.
Can't say I'm surprised, but I'm so sorry.
He made this sad, last-ditch attempt to patch things up.
And when I said no, he called me needy and demanding.
Can you believe that?
Hello, Tru, you there?
Yeah, sorry, I just...
There's this couple across the building and they're having this nasty fight.
Are they still going at it?
I can't tell.
They just turned the lights off.
One guess.
Makeup sex.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Anyway, Linds, I got to get to work.
Fine.
I'll talk to you later, okay?
Okay.
Incoming.
Hey, Tru?
I thought you said your neighborhood was getting better?
It is.
I've got a homicide here that might disagree.
You picked this up near my place?
A building across the street, if I'm not mistaken.
Victim's name is Chris Barronson, died from massive head trauma.
Chris Barronson?
Friend of yours?
No, we just met.
Today.
- You sure you want to see this?
- Yeah.
That's not Chris Barronson.
- It's what his ID said.
- No, Chris is a girl.
I saw this guy at her place earlier tonight.
He was furious about something.
You know, the cops said something about thinking the killer was a woman.
Bag this, will you?
Two people, same name, same apartment?
- It's either coincidence...
- Doubtful.
...or our buddy here's been up to no good.
Hi, Tru.
I thought you were home for the night.
- I was, but-
- Couldn't stay away?
Actually, if you have a moment?
I'm kind of in the middle of something.
Can it wait?
It's actually important.
We need to talk.
Tru, go ahead.
I got this.
- Tru?
- Yeah.
Okay, I'm coming.
Please save me.
Delivery!
Delivery!
Wait!
Hold on!
You've got the wrong apartment!
Even when you relive days they still get away.
So your neighbor and victim have the same name?
He's dead and she's the prime suspect?
Yep.
But it wouldn't be any fun if it were easy.
Okay, well, here's a theory.
Could be identity theft.
He took her identity and she killed him for it.
Identity theft is on the rise.
They're either stealing it online... or taking a picture of your credit card with a cell phone.
She seemed so normal.
It's hard to imagine her killing anyone.
People can do a lot of things in self-defense.
Especially when they're pushed past their limit.
For the last time, leave me alone.
- Maybe you're right.
- Hi, Jack.
Sorry to interrupt.
I just wanted to drop off my state license forms.
Super.
Thanks.
Hey.
Hi.
We were just going over the new intake procedure.
Cool.
You mind if I check the mail?
Unfortunately, this is the only address most people have for me.
- No, go ahead.
- Thanks.
Tru, about the new intake procedure.
Were there any other clues about the victim's real identity?
He had a pen with a logo on it.
It was a sunburst with a capital "A" inside.
Probably from his work.
I'll look into it.
An identity thief with a day job.
All the better to meet new victims.
I got to get going.
Chris will be at the diner any minute.
Okay.
I'll call you if anything comes up.
There was something else... you wanted to tell me right before the day rewound.
- I did?
- You said it was important.
No clue.
Too bad I don't relive days.
But look on the bright side.
If you don't change too many things today... then we'll have the same conversation tonight.
Here's hoping.
Yeah.
A redo day.
I get it.
No time for breakfast.
But considering you're 24 hours ahead of me... what happened with Lindsay yesterday?
Do you want my advice?
Save the sit-down for another day.
Another week even.
Man.
It was that bad?
Put it this way:
Yeah.
All right.
Thanks for the heads up.
Too bad you're blowing off breakfast 'cause I would've picked up the tab today.
It must be nice living in your world, Harry.
Jack, is Tru around?
- You just missed her, man.
- Damn.
I needed to ask her something.
There's kind of a time factor.
She should be on her cell.
No, this is one of those things that's best to do in person.
Make sure she means what she says.
You mean women don't always say what they actually mean?
Not the ones I fall for.
See you, man.
Yeah.
You're finished.
The fun is over.
For the last time, leave me alone.
Coffee, please.
Some guys, they just can't take no for an answer.
- Ex-boyfriend?
- It's sort of a long story.
Thanks, Chris.
You know, you look familiar.
You don't live on York by any chance?
Yeah, I do.
- Same here.
I'm Tru Davies.
- Chris Barronson.
It's always nice to put a name with a face.
Chris Barronson.
Yeah.
Have you heard of me?
Sort of.
There was this guy outside your building this morning... asking all these questions about you.
He seemed pretty belligerent.
About 6', dark brown hair?
Same guy who just can't take no for an answer?
Only he's not an ex.
Well, it's nothing I should get into.
If you're heading home, I could walk with you.
You know, in case he's still around.
- Okay.
- Okay.
It was six months ago... when I found out he'd stolen my identity.
I was applying for a loan, and the bank ran a credit check.
They found 10 different credit cards in my name.
He'd used them to run up nearly $60,000 in charges.
And now he's threatening you?
- Because I went to the police.
- No arrest?
ID theft's tricky to prosecute.
You need absolute proof, which I don't have.
But it's getting worse because now I feel like someone's been watching me.
That's creepy.
Any idea how this all started?
No, but there's a million ways.
If you don't have a shredder, a firewall... a digitally scrambled phone... you may as well have a sign up saying:
Ruin my life.
Anyway, thanks for the company.
And do me a favor, if you see that guy again... just say I moved or something.
No problem.
Because if I run into him, there's no telling what might happen.
- Jack?
- Hey.
What are you doing here?
Moving in.
You're kidding?
No.
I saw the "For Rent" sign and snapped it up.
Lucky for me.
The guy who was supposed to take it... missed the deadline 'cause he had to run it by his girlfriend or something.
The thing is, it's in the building across the street from yours... and I didn't want you feeling crowded.
But his loss is my gain.
Third floor, great view.
Unbelievable.
So I've heard.
I got to get started with the packing process.
I'll see you later on.
Tru, your friend, who I just met.
She wouldn't happen to be single, would she?
I'm not sure a new guy is what she needs right now.
Besides, a word of advice.
Girls don't appreciate being hit on by their neighbors.
We need to find some more interesting neighbors.
Maybe you need to find some less desperate tenants.
Look, she's having guy trouble right now.
A bad breakup?
Not exactly.
All right.
Fine.
Don't tell me.
I'll find out on my own soon enough.
Hey, wait.
The truth is, there's this guy that's been harassing her... and the last thing she needs is-
- Two.
- Yeah.
Enough said.
Okay.
You know, Tru... if that other guy really is a problem, I wouldn't mind keeping an eye on her.
I know you think I'm heartless... but I have been known to show an interest in people other than myself.
Thanks, but I've got it under control.
I'd expect no less.
Hello.
Hi, it's me.
I found your logo and your identity thief.
Really?
It's a company called Advantix.
They sell medical equipment.
And there is a salesman there by the name of Chris Barronson.
Did you get an address?
Don't need to.
He's coming to the morgue in 20 minutes to make a presentation.
You made an appointment with the guy?
I told him we weren't happy with our current distributor.
You're always chasing the bad guy.
Why not make them come to you for once?
Nice, D. I'll see you in 20.
Okay.
This is my colleague, Tru.
This is Chris Barronson.
Please save me.
This is my first sales call to a morgue.
Most of our equipment's designed to keep the patient out of a place like this.
Everyone passes through sooner or later.
Right.
Anyway, let me show you guys what might be useful.
Had this job long, Mr. Barronson?
Eight, nine months.
Why?
Does it pay well?
Only if you buy what I sell.
I guess you don't sell that much.
All right.
Who are you people?
I think who you are is the bigger question.
What?
We know who the real Chris Barronson is and you are not her.
And it's only a matter of time before the police figure that out.
Right.
She's good.
I'll give her that.
She pulled a fast one on you guys.
- I don't think you get it.
- No, I do.
You don't get it.
All right, the police are on my side.
Except they're too inept to do anything about it.
Look, I'm the real Chris Barronson, okay?
Here, see?
All right?
She stole my identity.
And if you guys know who she is... you'd better talk some sense into her before I find her myself.
The DMV has his picture on file back to the early '9Os.
The state police confirm there were six identity theft reports... filed by a man named Chris Barronson.
Looks like he's the real deal.
Which means the girl you met in the diner isn't.
She probably gave me that name... because it was on the credit card she was using.
I've spent the day helping a con woman... while the guy who needs help wants nothing to do with me.
Helping the criminal may be the only way to help the victim.
Since the real Chris won't talk to you, focus on the fake one.
See if you can't keep her from committing a murder today.
Right.
Hello.
It's Jack.
What's up?
Your friend's on the move.
She left the building?
But don't worry.
I'm keeping an eye on her.
You followed her?
You seemed worried about her.
Thought I was doing you a favor.
Where is she now?
She's headed back into your neighborhood.
But about an hour ago, she was in a jewelry store downtown.
Did she buy anything?
Yeah, a necklace.
But she didn't keep it long.
She walked six blocks to a pawnshop... and sold it for half of what she just paid for it.
Crazy.
She's almost home now.
She's all yours.
I got some errands to run.
Wait, Jack?
You got to let me hang up so you can miss me.
Cute, but, no.
You followed her.
I can't help wondering why.
She looked like she might be in trouble.
And aside from a little white-collar crime, she's harmless.
Just be careful.
She's not exactly who she seems.
Who is?
- Jack is following her?
- He was trying to help.
Listen, I want you to take this before you go.
It's the name and the number of the cop I talked to, just in case.
Who's Tom Forrester?
He's an old college buddy of mine, but I haven't talked to him in years.
Why?
Yesterday, you had a note to call him.
Remember to find out what it is you want to tell me.
We have to keep the days as similar as possible.
Okay.
I'll give him a ring.
He's a hell of a guy.
Great Dungeon Master.
God, did I just say that out loud?
Harrison.
Look, about today, I...
Let me guess.
Not gonna work for you.
No, not so much.
You lost all my stuff, didn't you?
No.
It's not that.
It's just...
It just isn't the best day for it.
Why not?
Well, because, I got to...
It just isn't.
Okay?
Fine.
Whatever.
We'll just do it tomorrow, same time, same place.
I'll be there.
I promise.
Yeah.
Bye.
You better be right about this, Tru.
Excuse me, miss?
I didn't want you to forget this.
- Randall?
- Lindsay?
My God.
Feel like telling me who you really are?
I already told you.
I'm Chris Barronson.
Look, don't bother.
I know you're not.
I know you've been buying jewelry... with someone else's credit card and pawning it off for quick cash.
How did you know that?
It doesn't really matter.
It's just time for you to stop.
Just give this guy, Chris, his life back.
I will.
Someday.
Someday isn't soon enough.
Trust me on this.
I don't trust anyone.
That's why I'm so good at what I do.
Stay out of it, Tru.
You're in over your head.
Hey, Tru.
What a nice surprise.
How's it going?
Good, thanks.
I got a package for you delivered to me inadvertently this morning.
Do you want to come up and...
There's this girl.
Right.
I've been wanting to ask her out.
You know what?
I'll just drop it off later.
I'll save you the time, okay?
I'd be happy to come by.
I'd love to see your place.
- I'm actually just in a hurry, so...
- Okay.
Can I ask you one question?
Sorry, I'm in the middle of something.
But I'll catch up with you later, okay?
What is she doing now?
Looks like she's packing.
What is she doing now?
Looks like she's packing.
That's good.
Maybe you spooked her enough... so she'll be gone by the time the real Chris Barronson shows up.
Maybe, but we can't count on it.
- I talked to Tom Forrester, by the way.
- And?
He told me about his wife and his kids... and his research after leaving the Schenkman Center.
But it's certainly nothing I need to discuss with you.
It was worth a shot.
You don't think that the important thing... has anything to do with the kidney stone I passed last week, do you?
Okay, probably not.
I'll keep looking.
I know you think you can handle this, but you're the one in over her head.
It'll only get worse.
Running won't solve anything.
Let me help you or I'll tell the police where to find you.
It's your choice.
It was just so easy, you know?
Like free money.
And at first, I only did it to get by.
But now, it's...
God, you got to believe me.
I had no idea it would go this far.
Okay.
But it has.
And now we have to do something about it.
I'm scared.
The messages this guy's been leaving for me.
What if I paid him back?
Do you think he would still turn me in to the police?
You can pay him back?
Yeah, I could give him cash.
Really?
You have that much money?
I told you, I was good.
If only that were something to be proud of.
You.
You turned my life upside down.
She wants to make amends.
That's why I called.
Sure, now that I know where to find her.
- I'm so sorry.
- You're sorry?
- No, I really am.
- Sorry doesn't cover it.
Here.
Maybe this will.
It's the least I can do with you giving me a second chance.
I almost forgot.
Here.
The credit card I took out in your name.
If I ever hear from you again, or if I see you-
You won't.
I promise.
Fine.
I have a phone call to make.
And you?
You should be gone when I get back.
Thanks, Tru.
I know you probably don't care... but my real name is Cathy.
It's nice to meet you, Cathy.
Here, let me get this.
No, I got it.
This one's on me.
Thank you again for everything.
Hey.
You caught me using a city vehicle for personal business.
What vehicle?
I want to thank you for helping me out today.
It's nothing you wouldn't have done for me.
Thanks.
Still, I mean you took it upon yourself to look out for someone...
I told you was in trouble, no questions asked.
Should I have asked some?
I can't help thinking most people would.
Whatever's going on between you and your friend... it's none of my business.
- It's never stopped you before.
- All right, fine.
Tell me.
And if I don't?
I'll ply you with alcohol and pry it out of you.
Right.
Or you'll owe me one.
Lock up the van for me, will you?
- Keys?
- They must be inside.
- I talked to Tom Forrester.
- And?
He told me about his research after leaving the Schenkman Center.
Here you go.
I guess you can lock up yourself.
Hey.
Hey.
Could I get a roast beef sandwich to go?
Sure thing.
- Nothing smaller?
- No, not tonight.
I'm sorry, but this bill's a fake.
You got to be kidding me.
You said your friend Tom worked at the Schenkman Center, right?
Did you mention Jack when you spoke to him?
No, why would I?
Jack had a letter from the Schenkman Center in his coat.
I bet you found it first yesterday.
Why don't I give Tom another call?
Yeah, just let me know what he says, okay?
Here we go again.
Lock yourself out?
Yeah, it happens to me at least once a week.
Here, I'm sorry.
I'm the new tenant.
I appreciate it.
You bet.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Matt?
Now I feel like someone's been watching me.
There is this girl.
And she lives nearby.
Chris.
What is he doing?
Matt?
Come on.
Hello?
Jack, it's Tru!
I need to get in.
Hey, Tru.
What are you doing on this side of the street?
Please, Jack, I need to get into Cathy's apartment right away.
Cathy?
Who's Cathy?
Chris.
Chris is Cathy.
The girl that you followed.
- Please, Jack, hurry!
- Okay.
Let me just try and figure this thing out.
It's trickier than I thought.
Did that do it?
Thanks.
Excuse me.
Tru, did that do it?
Tru?
Tru?
I'm telling you, stay away from her!
She's a nice girl!
Put it down, Matt.
He broke into her apartment!
He wants to hurt her!
I know you want to protect her, but you don't know anything about her!
Yes, I do!
I watched her every single day since she moved in.
I know her better than anyone.
No, she's not who you think.
Look, she's a thief.
She stole this man's identity.
No.
She can't be.
She's perfect!
She would never do that!
It's okay, Matt.
You're not the only one that she's fooled.
But I'm telling you the truth.
She's stolen thousands of dollars.
She's ruined people's lives.
She's a thief?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Why did you come here?
I thought that we had an agreement.
Yeah, we did.
Till I found out that the money she gave me was fake.
Now she's gone, I'm still broke... and I'm probably never gonna see her again.
You never know.
Stranger things have happened.
I don't understand what's taking so long.
It's been 45 minutes already.
I'm very sorry.
Did my card not go through?
The card number's fine, but our computer's down.
Just give us another minute, we'll get you all sorted out, Miss Davies.
Heading out of town, Tru?
You know, it's a good thing I don't believe every sob story I hear.
Mine, for example?
You almost had me.
But then you absolutely blew it back there at the diner.
This one's on me.
You pulled out your camera cell phone the second I put my credit card down.
All I had to do was call the credit card company... and report a stolen credit card.
I knew you had the number, but I was hoping that you wouldn't use it.
Then I got the call.
Miss, there's activity reported on your credit card at A valon Car rental.
Thank you.
Is it too late for me to explain?
To me?
Yeah.
But I know a couple of guys who'd be happy to listen.
Really, you had a good day?
It was the best, Tru.
The perfect afternoon with the perfect guy.
Wait, you were with my brother?
No.
Harrison was his usual self.
Called to cancel after I was already there.
But that's how I spotted Randall.
Randall?
I met him a few years ago when I was studying abroad.
He's actually in town for a few weeks and he's a total opposite of your brother.
Well, lucky break.
Just when I was starting to think they didn't make them like this anymore.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Good night, Tru.
Hey, it's Luc.
I couldn't get to the phone right now.
Leave me a message.
Hey, Luc, it's me, Tru.
I heard through the grapevine... that you missed out on that apartment across the street... and I just wanted to call and say that I'm sorry.
I know that we're not together anymore... but it would've been nice to be neighbors.
Just to know you were close.
I'll talk to you soon.
I just wanted to call.
Okay, bye.
Luc?
No, Tru.
It's me, I'm sorry.
I saw the morgue number and thought he was working tonight.
What's up?
I talked to my friend at Schenkman.
What I had to tell you is definitely about Jack.
Turns out he was a patient there.
A patient?
But Schenkman's a psychiatric facility.
It seems like he was there voluntarily.
He checked himself in so he could check himself out.
Well, we knew something was off with Jack, but-
There's more.
When Jack committed himself, he thought he was going crazy.
But the doctors couldn't diagnosis it.
Going crazy how?
He thought he was reliving days.
Reliving days?
Like me?
Exactly like you.
previously on Tru Calling:
Anyway, I just wanted to say welcome.
I'm Tru.
Jack.
A couple of years ago...
I died.
And then, I came back.
Some would say once you survive something like that... that you were brought back for a reason.
I guess we'll see.
How did it go with Jack?
I just can't get a read on him, for some reason.
One minute he's in your face and almost obnoxious.
The next, he's charming, trying to be your best friend.
Leave the key.
Step away from the car.
Hang on to your keys, Harrison.
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.
What, you got some kind of death wish?
Death isn't something you have to wish for.
It's coming anyway.
Death is part of life.
Someone stopped us from saving her.
But that doesn't make any sense.
So you ended up ordering takeout?
What did you get?
Moo Shu pork.
Nice choice.
With the pancakes?
No, straight from the box.
You?
I'm just digging into a rack of lamb with some garlic mashed potatoes.
Cereal again?
Yeah.
The doctor says I'm fiber- poor.
So what are you doing tonight?
You know, the usual.
Nothing?
Exactly.
Look, me being alone on a Friday night is one thing... but you, on the other hand....
With my life, it's rejuvenating to have a night off.
And besides, I told you.
I'm between exes.
What?
It's okay to say that you miss someone.
Luc?
Why would you say that I miss Luc?
I didn't say Luc.
You said Luc.
Yeah, well--
The way I see it is, just because we're alone... doesn't mean that we're lonely.
So by that reasoning, you'd argue that my neighbor across the way?
She looks like she's having the time of her life.
She's probably miserable.
Gotta tell you, Davis, it sure seems like she's having fun to me.
Trust me.
Nothing is ever exactly what it seems.
Listen, I've got to go.
The Outer Limits marathon is about to start.
I'll let you go.
Tru, for what it's worth...
I happen to think that you have a pretty exciting life, you know?
Time travel... saving lives, pretty cool boss.
Yeah.
Good night, Davis.
Good night, Tru.
Leave me a message, I'II call you back.
Consider this a warning.
You can make all the trouble you want... but it's only a matter of time before I find you.
And when I do, let's just say there won't be a second warning.
Help me.
Delivery!
Coming.
4B, not 3B.
Four, as in upstairs!
Tru?
Hey.
I haven't seen you around much.
I thought you moved.
No, I've just been working some weird hours lately.
But the delivery man left this at my door by accident.
Cool.
Thanks.
Hey, Tru!
Can I get your advice on something?
Sure.
There is this girl.
And she lives nearby... and she is amazing.
Right.
She's always busy running around all over town... but whenever I see her, she just makes me want to smile.
I see.
Yeah, and, well...
I've been wanting to ask her out for a while... but I'm afraid that if she says no, things will get weird.
You know, on account of us being neighbors.
Yeah.
I would advise you... to first make sure that she's ready to date.
And after that, I would take things slow.
Right.
Yeah.
Slow.
Very slow, you know?
Okay.
Makes sense.
- Okay.
Thank you.
- No problem.
Just the morgue attendant I was looking for.
I'll bet you say that to all the girls.
Remember I told you I was looking for a new apartment?
I found the perfect one- bedroom.
It's close to work, utilities included.
- Congrats.
- I haven't signed the lease yet...
- 'cause I wanted to run it by you first.
- Me, why?
The thing is, it's in the building across the street from yours... and I didn't want you feeling crowded or anything.
So I figured I should check with you.
Are you kidding?
You should jump on it.
Places in my neighborhood are so hard to find.
Morning, gang.
Hey, you got your state license forms.
Davis only called me three times to remind me.
So you're sure about this?
Positive.
It'll be so nice to have a friend across the street.
- Guess I got a lease to sign.
- Sweet.
See you.
Okay, bye.
Signed and dated.
Perfect.
You put the morgue as your mailing address.
I hope that's okay.
I've been staying at a friend's place since I moved here.
- Figured this was the best place to get me.
- Not a problem.
As a matter of fact, you got some mail this morning.
Here it is.
The Schenkman Center.
That's an impressive facility.
Yeah, one of the best in the country.
Were you there long?
I don't remember it being on your résumé.
It was a long time ago.
I didn't think it was relevant.
Did you ever run into a guy named Tom Forrester?
An old college buddy of mine.
We used to play DD on the weekends.
We called him Wizard.
Forrester.
Yeah, sure.
Big fella.
Hell of a guy.
Yeah.
Good old Wizard.
I wonder what he's....
I should give him a call.
So the meet's at noon.
High noon.
Don't be so dramatic.
It's the first time me and Lindsay are seeing each other since the breakup.
We're exchanging stuff.
How is that not dramatic?
Look, I want you both to be happy.
But the truth is, it's not so bad being single.
Who are you kidding?
Not me.
And you've been busted up since you and Luc split.
That's just not true.
Yeah?
And what's your love life now?
Talking on the phone with Davis all day?
Telling me your upstairs neighbor has a crush on you?
You're pleasant today.
You're right, I'm sorry.
I'm just nervous.
Anyway, I got to get going.
Whose turn is it?
You ask that like we actually take turns.
Yeah, well, I'll get the next one.
I'll hold my breath.
I don't care.
You listen to me, for the last time, leave me alone.
My neighbor looks like she's having the time of her life.
Some guys won't take no for an answer.
Well, try saying yes.
Yes, you're a psycho.
Yes, I was right to break up with you.
I'll have to remember that.
You look familiar.
Have we met?
No, but I've seen you around the neighborhood.
Thanks, Chris.
- I'm Tru Davies.
- Chris Barronson.
- Always nice to put a name with a face.
- Absolutely.
- Thanks.
Take care.
- Bye.
One Motley Crue concert tee.
One deck of naked lady cards.
Two eggs of Silly Putty.
And 13 assorted comic books.
I've been looking for these.
All right, where's my stuff?
That's it?
Yeah, I turned my place upside down... and that is all I could find.
That's not even mine.
Yeah, well, uh...
Look, the reason I asked you to meet me here today... is because I wanted to look you in the eye... into those eyes... and tell you that I want you back.
What?
Just give me one more chance, that's all I'm asking for.
No, I've given you, like, 50 chances... and you blew every single one of them.
You're just too self- absorbed to know it.
And you're the perfect girlfriend, right?
What?
You're so needy.
And demanding.
You always order the most expensive thing on the menu... when you knew I couldn't afford it.
Right?
Hmm?
Take care of yourself, Harrison.
When will I learn to shut my mouth?
Hi.
Tom Forrester, please.
Hi, Wiz?
Hi, it's Gothar, the Elf King.
Yeah.
Davis.
Yeah.
Listen, turns out we have a friend in common.
Jack Harper.
Yeah, he used to work with you at Schenkman.
Mmm
- Hmm.
Really?
Hello?
So your brother and I are officially through.
Can't say I'm surprised, but I'm so sorry.
He made this sad, last- ditch attempt to patch things up.
And when I said no, he called me needy and demanding.
Can you believe that?
Hello, Tru, you there?
Yeah, sorry, I just....
There's this couple across the building and they're having this nasty fight.
Are they still going at it?
I can't tell.
They just turned the lights off.
One guess.
Makeup sex.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Anyway, Linds, I got to get to work.
Fine.
I'll talk to you later, okay?
Okay.
lncoming.
Hey, Tru?
I thought you said your neighborhood was getting better?
It is.
I've got a homicide here that might disagree.
You picked this up near my place?
A building across the street, if I'm not mistaken.
Victim's name is Chris Barronson, died from massive head trauma.
Chris Barronson?
Friend of yours?
No, we just met.
Today.
- You sure you want to see this?
- Yeah.
That's not Chris Barronson.
- It's what his id said.
- No, Chris is a girl.
I saw this guy at her place earlier tonight.
He was furious about something.
You know, the cops said something about thinking the killer was a woman.
Bag this, will you?
Two people, same name, same apartment?
- It's either coincidence...
- Doubtful.
...or our buddy here's been up to no good.
Hi, Tru.
I thought you were home for the night.
- I was, but--
- Couldn't stay away?
Actually, if you have a moment?
I'm kind of in the middle of something.
Can it wait?
It's actually important.
We need to talk.
Tru, go ahead.
I got this.
- Tru?
- Yeah.
Okay, I'm coming.
Please save me.
Delivery!
Delivery!
Wait!
Hold on!
You've got the wrong apartment!
Even when you relive days they still get away.
So your neighbor and victim have the same name?
He's dead and she's the prime suspect?
Yep.
But it wouldn't be any fun if it were easy.
Okay, well, here's a theory.
Could be identity theft.
He took her identity and she killed him for it.
ldentity theft is on the rise.
They're either stealing it online... or taking a picture of your credit card with a cell phone.
She seemed so normal.
It's hard to imagine her killing anyone.
People can do a lot of things in self- defense.
Especially when they're pushed past their limit.
For the last time, leave me alone.
- Maybe you're right.
- Hi, Jack.
Sorry to interrupt.
I just wanted to drop off my state license forms.
Super.
Thanks.
Hey.
Hi.
We were just going over the new intake procedure.
Cool.
You mind if I check the mail?
Unfortunately, this is the only address most people have for me.
- No, go ahead.
- Thanks.
Tru, about the new intake procedure.
Were there any other clues about the victim's real identity?
He had a pen with a logo on it.
It was a sunburst with a capital"A" inside.
Probably from his work.
I'll look into it.
An identity thief with a day job.
All the better to meet new victims.
I got to get going.
Chris will be at the diner any minute.
Okay.
I'll call you if anything comes up.
There was something else... you wanted to tell me right before the day rewound.
- I did?
- You said it was important.
No clue.
Too bad I don't relive days.
But look on the bright side.
If you don't change too many things today... then we'll have the same conversation tonight.
Here's hoping.
Yeah.
A redo day.
I get it.
No time for breakfast.
But considering you're 24 hours ahead of me... what happened with Lindsay yesterday?
Do you want my advice?
Save the sit- down for another day.
Another week even.
Man.
It was that bad?
Put it this way:
Yeah.
All right.
Thanks for the heads up.
Too bad you're blowing off breakfast 'cause I would've picked up the tab today.
It must be nice living in your world, Harry.
Jack, is Tru around?
- You just missed her, man.
- Damn.
I needed to ask her something.
There's kind of a time factor.
She should be on her cell.
No, this is one of those things that's best to do in person.
Make sure she means what she says.
You mean women don't always say what they actually mean?
Not the ones I fall for.
See you, man.
Yeah.
You're finished.
The fun is over.
For the last time, leave me alone.
Coffee, please.
Some guys, they just can't take no for an answer.
- Ex- boyfriend?
- It's sort of a long story.
Thanks, Chris.
You know, you look familiar.
You don't live on York by any chance?
Yeah, I do.
- Same here.
I'm Tru Davies.
- Chris Barronson.
It's always nice to put a name with a face.
Chris Barronson.
Yeah.
Have you heard of me?
Sort of.
There was this guy outside your building this morning... asking all these questions about you.
He seemed pretty belligerent.
About 6', dark brown hair?
Same guy who just can't take no for an answer?
Only he's not an ex.
Well, it's nothing I should get into.
If you're heading home, I could walk with you.
You know, in case he's still around.
- Okay.
- Okay.
It was six months ago... when I found out he'd stolen my identity.
I was applying for a loan, and the bank ran a credit check.
They found 10 different credit cards in my name.
He'd used them to run up nearly $60, 000 in charges.
And now he's threatening you?
- Because I went to the police.
- No arrest?
lD theft's tricky to prosecute.
You need absolute proof, which I don't have.
But it's getting worse because now I feel like someone's been watching me.
That's creepy.
Any idea how this all started?
No, but there's a million ways.
If you don't have a shredder, a firewall... a digitally scrambled phone... you may as well have a sign up saying:
Ruin my life.
Anyway, thanks for the company.
And do me a favor, if you see that guy again... just say I moved or something.
No problem.
Because if I run into him, there's no telling what might happen.
- Jack?
- Hey.
What are you doing here?
Moving in.
You're kidding?
No.
I saw the"For Rent" sign and snapped it up.
Lucky for me.
The guy who was supposed to take it... missed the deadline'cause he had to run it by his girlfriend or something.
The thing is, it's in the building across the street from yours... and I didn't want you feeling crowded.
But his loss is my gain.
Third floor, great view.
Unbelievable.
So I've heard.
I got to get started with the packing process.
I'll see you later on.
Tru, your friend, who I just met.
She wouldn't happen to be single, would she?
I'm not sure a new guy is what she needs right now.
Besides, a word of advice.
Girls don't appreciate being hit on by their neighbors.
We need to find some more interesting neighbors.
Maybe you need to find some less desperate tenants.
Look, she's having guy trouble right now.
A bad breakup?
Not exactly.
All right.
Fine.
Don't tell me.
I'll find out on my own soon enough.
Hey, wait.
The truth is, there's this guy that's been harassing her... and the last thing she needs is--
- Two.
- Yeah.
Enough said.
Okay.
You know, Tru... if that other guy really is a problem, I wouldn't mind keeping an eye on her.
I know you think I'm heartless... but I have been known to show an interest in people other than myself.
Thanks, but I've got it under control.
I'd expect no less.
Hello.
Hi, it's me.
I found your logo and your identity thief.
Really?
It's a company called Advantix.
They sell medical equipment.
And there is a salesman there by the name of Chris Barronson.
Did you get an address?
Don't need to.
He's coming to the morgue in 20 minutes to make a presentation.
You made an appointment with the guy?
I told him we weren't happy with our current distributor.
You're always chasing the bad guy.
Why not make them come to you for once?
Nice, D. I'll see you in 20.
Okay.
This is my colleague, Tru.
This is Chris Barronson.
Please save me.
This is my first sales call to a morgue.
Most of our equipment's designed to keep the patient out of a place like this.
Everyone passes through sooner or later.
Right.
Anyway, let me show you guys what might be useful.
Had this job long, Mr. Barronson?
Eight, nine months.
Why?
Does it pay well?
Only if you buy what I sell.
I guess you don't sell that much.
All right.
Who are you people?
I think who you are is the bigger question.
What?
We know who the real Chris Barronson is and you are not her.
And it's only a matter of time before the police figure that out.
Right.
She's good.
I'll give her that.
She pulled a fast one on you guys.
- I don't think you get it.
- No, I do.
You don't get it.
All right, the police are on my side.
Except they're too inept to do anything about it.
Look, I'm the real Chris Barronson, okay?
Here, see?
All right?
She stole my identity.
And if you guys know who she is... you'd better talk some sense into her before I find her myself.
The DMV has his picture on file back to the early'90s.
The state police confirm there were six identity theft reports... filed by a man named Chris Barronson.
Looks like he's the real deal.
Which means the girl you met in the diner isn't.
She probably gave me that name... because it was on the credit card she was using.
I've spent the day helping a con woman... while the guy who needs help wants nothing to do with me.
Helping the criminal may be the only way to help the victim.
Since the real Chris won't talk to you, focus on the fake one.
See if you can't keep her from committing a murder today.
Right.
Hello.
It's Jack.
What's up?
Your friend's on the move.
She left the building?
But don't worry.
I'm keeping an eye on her.
You followed her?
You seemed worried about her.
Thought I was doing you a favor.
Where is she now?
She's headed back into your neighborhood.
But about an hour ago, she was in a jewelry store downtown.
Did she buy anything?
Yeah, a necklace.
But she didn't keep it long.
She walked six blocks to a pawnshop... and sold it for half of what she just paid for it.
Crazy.
She's almost home now.
She's all yours.
I got some errands to run.
Wait, Jack?
You got to let me hang up so you can miss me.
Cute, but, no.
You followed her.
I can't help wondering why.
She looked like she might be in trouble.
And aside from a little white- collar crime, she's harmless.
Just be careful.
She's not exactly who she seems.
Who is?
- Jack is following her?
- He was trying to help.
Listen, I want you to take this before you go.
It's the name and the number of the cop I talked to, just in case.
Who's Tom Forrester?
He's an old college buddy of mine, but I haven't talked to him in years.
Why?
Yesterday, you had a note to call him.
Remember to find out what it is you want to tell me.
We have to keep the days as similar as possible.
Okay.
I'll give him a ring.
He's a hell of a guy.
Great Dungeon Master.
God, did I just say that out loud?
Harrison.
Look, about today, I....
Let me guess.
Not gonna work for you.
No, not so much.
You lost all my stuff, didn't you?
No.
It's not that.
It's just....
It just isn't the best day for it.
Why not?
Well, because, I got to....
It just isn't.
Okay?
Fine.
Whatever.
We'll just do it tomorrow, same time, same place.
I'll be there.
I promise.
Yeah.
Bye.
You better be right about this, Tru.
Excuse me, miss?
I didn't want you to forget this.
- Randall?
- Lindsay?
My God.
Feel like telling me who you really are?
I already told you.
I'm Chris Barronson.
Look, don't bother.
I know you're not.
I know you've been buying jewelry... with someone else's credit card and pawning it off for quick cash.
How did you know that?
It doesn't really matter.
It's just time for you to stop.
Just give this guy, Chris, his life back.
I will.
Someday.
Someday isn't soon enough.
Trust me on this.
I don't trust anyone.
That's why I'm so good at what I do.
Stay out of it, Tru.
You're in over your head.
Hey, Tru.
What a nice surprise.
How's it going?
Good, thanks.
I got a package for you delivered to me inadvertently this morning.
Do you want to come up and....
There's this girl.
Right.
I've been wanting to ask her out.
You know what?
I'll just drop it off later.
I'll save you the time, okay?
I'd be happy to come by.
I'd love to see your place.
- I'm actually just in a hurry, so....
- Okay.
Can I ask you one question?
Sorry, I'm in the middle of something.
But I'll catch up with you later, okay?
What is she doing now?
Looks like she's packing.
What is she doing now?
Looks like she's packing.
That's good.
Maybe you spooked her enough... so she'II be gone by the time the real Chris Barronson shows up.
Maybe, but we can't count on it.
- I talked to Tom Forrester, by the way.
- And?
He told me about his wife and his kids... and his research after leaving the Schenkman Center.
But it's certainly nothing I need to discuss with you.
It was worth a shot.
You don't think that the important thing... has anything to do with the kidney stone I passed last week, do you?
Okay, probably not.
I'll keep looking.
I know you think you can handle this, but you're the one in over her head.
It'II only get worse.
Running won't solve anything.
Let me help you or I'll tell the police where to find you.
It's your choice.
It was just so easy, you know?
Like free money.
And at first, I only did it to get by.
But now, it's....
God, you got to believe me.
I had no idea it would go this far.
Okay.
But it has.
And now we have to do something about it.
I'm scared.
The messages this guy's been leaving for me.
What if I paid him back?
Do you think he would still turn me in to the police?
You can pay him back?
Yeah, I could give him cash.
Really?
You have that much money?
I told you, I was good.
If only that were something to be proud of.
You.
You turned my life upside down.
She wants to make amends.
That's why I called.
Sure, now that I know where to find her.
- I'm so sorry.
- You're sorry?
- I'm so sorry.
- You're sorry?
- No, I really am.
- Sorry doesn't cover it.
Here.
Maybe this will.
It's the least I can do with you giving me a second chance.
I almost forgot.
Here.
The credit card I took out in your name.
If I ever hear from you again, or if I see you--
You won't.
I promise.
Fine.
I have a phone call to make.
And you?
You should be gone when I get back.
Thanks, Tru.
I know you probably don't care... but my real name is Cathy.
It's nice to meet you, Cathy.
Here, let me get this.
No, I got it.
This one's on me.
Thank you again for everything.
Hey.
You caught me using a city vehicle for personal business.
What vehicle?
I want to thank you for helping me out today.
It's nothing you wouldn't have done for me.
Thanks.
Still, I mean you took it upon yourself to look out for someone...
I told you was in trouble, no questions asked.
Should I have asked some?
I can't help thinking most people would.
Whatever's going on between you and your friend... it's none of my business.
- It's never stopped you before.
- All right, fine.
Tell me.
And if I don't?
I'll ply you with alcohol and pry it out of you.
Right.
Or you'll owe me one.
Lock up the van for me, will you?
- Keys?
- They must be inside.
- I talked to Tom Forrester.
- And?
He told me about his research after leaving the Schenkman Center.
Here you go.
I guess you can lock up yourself.
Hey.
Hey.
Could I get a roast beef sandwich to go?
Sure thing.
- Nothing smaller?
- No, not tonight.
I'm sorry, but this bill's a fake.
You got to be kidding me.
You said your friend Tom worked at the Schenkman Center, right?
Did you mention Jack when you spoke to him?
No, why would I?
Jack had a letter from the Schenkman Center in his coat.
I bet you found it first yesterday.
Why don't I give Tom another call?
Yeah, just let me know what he says, okay?
Here we go again.
Lock yourself out?
Yeah, it happens to me at least once a week.
Here, I'm sorry.
I'm the new tenant.
I appreciate it.
You bet.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Matt?
Now I feel like someone's been watching me.
There is this girl.
And she lives nearby.
Chris.
What is he doing?
Matt?
Come on.
hello?
Jack, it's Tru!
I need to get in.
Hey, Tru.
What are you doing on this side of the street?
Please, Jack, I need to get into Cathy's apartment right away.
Cathy?
Who's Cathy?
Chris.
Chris is Cathy.
The girl that you followed.
- Please, Jack, hurry!
- Okay.
Let me just try and figure this thing out.
It's trickier than I thought.
Did that do it?
Thanks.
Excuse me.
Tru, did that do it?
Tru?
Tru?
I'm telling you, stay away from her!
She's a nice girl!
Put it down, Matt.
He broke into her apartment!
He wants to hurt her!
I know you want to protect her, but you don't know anything about her!
Yes, I do!
I watched her every single day since she moved in.
I know her better than anyone.
No, she's not who you think.
Look, she's a thief.
She stole this man's identity.
No.
She can't be.
She's perfect!
She would never do that!
It's okay, Matt.
You're not the only one that she's fooled.
But I'm telling you the truth.
She's stolen thousands of dollars.
She's ruined people's lives.
She's a thief?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Why did you come here?
I thought that we had an agreement.
Yeah, we did.
Till I found out that the money she gave me was fake.
Now she's gone, I'm still broke... and I'm probably never gonna see her again.
You never know.
Stranger things have happened.
I don't understand what's taking so long.
It's been 45 minutes already.
I'm very sorry.
Did my card not go through?
The card number's fine, but our computer's down.
Just give us another minute, we'll get you all sorted out, Miss Davies.
Heading out of town, Tru?
You know, it's a good thing I don't believe every sob story I hear.
Mine, for example?
You almost had me.
But then you absolutely blew it back there at the diner.
This one's on me.
You pulled out your camera cell phone the second I put my credit card down.
All I had to do was call the credit card company... and report a stolen credit card.
I knew you had the number, but I was hoping that you wouldn't use it.
Then I got the call.
Miss, there's activity reported on your credit card at A vaIon Car rental.
Thank you.
Is it too late for me to explain?
To me?
Yeah.
But I know a couple of guys who'd be happy to listen.
Really, you had a good day?
It was the best, Tru.
The perfect afternoon with the perfect guy.
Wait, you were with my brother?
No.
Harrison was his usual self.
Called to cancel after I was already there.
But that's how I spotted Randall.
Randall?
I met him a few years ago when I was studying abroad.
He's actually in town for a few weeks and he's a total opposite of your brother.
Well, lucky break.
Just when I was starting to think they didn't make them like this anymore.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Good night, Tru.
Hey, it's Luc.
I couldn't get to the phone right now.
Leave me a message.
Hey, Luc, it's me, Tru.
I heard through the grapevine... that you missed out on that apartment across the street... and I just wanted to call and say that I'm sorry.
I know that we're not together anymore... but it would've been nice to be neighbors.
Just to know you were close.
I'II talk to you soon.
I just wanted to call.
Okay, bye.
Luc?
No, Tru.
It's me, I'm sorry.
I saw the morgue number and thought he was working tonight.
What's up?
I talked to my friend at Schenkman.
What I had to tell you is definitely about Jack.
Turns out he was a patient there.
A patient?
But Schenkman's a psychiatric facility.
It seems like he was there voluntarily.
He checked himself in so he could check himself out.
Well, we knew something was off with Jack, but--
There's more.
When Jack committed himself, he thought he was going crazy.
But the doctors couldn't diagnosis it.
Going crazy how?
He thought he was reliving days.
Reliving days?
Like me?
Exactly like you.
It was the summer of 1916, and Life seemed good.
It was hot.
One of the hottest summers on record.
Beach bathing was now all the rage.
Bigger than the bicycle.
Even bigger than the horseless carriage.
Across the ocean, they were fighting a war.
But nobody really thought we 'd get caught up in it.
Right off our coast, German U-boats prowLed the waters, Looking for a kill.
But that wasn 't our problem.
New York, philly, Boston were all facing a polio epidemic.
Mothers were desperate to get their kids out of town to our beaches where the air was fresh and clean.
Then, out of nowhere, our own local crisis hit.
It took us by surprise and it knocked us for a Loop.
In some, it brought out the best.
In others, well....
That summer was hard.
The hardest of my Life.
It started in july with those hot, sunny days.
If you were anywhere near the Jersey shore, all you could think about was getting out of the heat and into that cool, cool water.
T ake my word for it!
I wouldn't lie to you, folks.
I've used it myself.
I'd show you my tan, but I' m wearing too many clothes!
Genuine, guaranteed sun-browning lotion!
-And another sale!
-Ahoy there, lifeguard!
Yeah, you!
So how many lives have you saved today?
.
Hello, Louise.
-All set for a swim, are we, Stan?
.
-Yeah.
You two can smirk all you want but while I'm out here, I'll sell one of these suits.
Why not put on a sandwich board and parade up and down.
You are looking for trouble.
And of what sort?
.
Ladies and gentlemen, step right up!
Thank you, sir.
Stanley!
Alex, will you please teach your friend here some manners...
-...before the big day arrives?
.
-I'm afraid it's too late for that.
Hey, boys and girls!
This way, please!
Stan, did you come down here to advertise your shop or is there something I can do for you?
.
As a matter of fact, he escorted me, Alex.
I need your opinion, if you'd be so kind.
Which one do you like better?
.
Stanley won't offer an opinion about anything connected to the wedding.
And I'd value a man's point of view on this one particular thing.
Green.
Goes with your eyes.
-See?
.
-What?
.
Thank you, Alex.
I knew you would take me seriously.
And you can keep the cake.
This is your genuine, guaranteed sun-browning lotion!
Sun-browning lotion.
That's what I should do.
-Selling snake oil for 2 bits a bottle.
-Don't undersell yourself.
You could be the first one with your foot in the door.
The first one to get it slammed on my nose, you mean.
You don't want to be sitting in that chair five years from now.
Take my word for it.
I wouldn't lie to you, folks.
I've used it myself.
-Look, I've been thinking.
-That's a dangerous pastime for you.
No, I was just wondering with our wedding coming up and, well, you know, you and Louise--
Look, Stan, that was a long time ago.
I wish only happiness for both of you.
Happiness, and nothing but.
Thanks, Alex.
That means a lot.
To both of us.
I'll see you later.
Ladies and gentlemen!
How you doing?
.
Good to see you.
Are you gonna dance?
.
Charles, don't be long.
We have to dress for dinner.
Relax, Mother.
There's loads of time.
Why don't you come in?
.
All of you!
-Easy there!
-So sorry.
-There's a lot of children around here.
-Sure.
Sure.
-How is it past the breakers?
.
-It's rough in spots.
I meant the temperature.
I can handle the undertow.
Well, it's cold.
It'll sap your strength faster than you think.
Thanks for your concern.
Come on!
Hey, come on!
You wanna swim?
.
All right.
I'm gonna have to ask you to take this little social hour elsewhere.
-See you, Danny.
-See you later.
Chitchat's all right, but you can't let it develop.
Besides being a distraction, it's unprofessional.
I had it covered, I really did.
Old man, gray hair, swimming goggles, 80 yards out, where'd he go?
.
Crossed into my zone about two minutes ago.
He's coming in now.
It's all about concentration.
You can't afford distractions and be effective at this job.
Here.
Something to keep you going.
What's...?
.
What's the...?
.
Hello, Mother!
Charles, be careful!
-Don't go out too far!
-He's fine.
Sandy!
Sandy!
Come on!
Come on!
Look at them all in the water.
Isn't this a perfect setting?
.
Help!
-Help!
-Danny!
Help!
Hang on!
I got you!
Hang on!
Hang on there, buddy!
-Come on, guys, get him out!
-Charles!
Grab his legs!
Grab his legs!
-Get him out!
That's it!
-Keep that leg up.
Get him on the beach!
-What happened?
.
-I don't know!
Get his leg up!
-Can you hear me?
.
-Oh, my God!
-Find a doctor!
-He'll bleed to death if we don't wrap it!
That's it!
Come on, keep his leg down!
Hurry up!
Let's get to the hotel!
-Picking him up!
-Come on, let's go!
Get some help!
Clear the way!
Clear the way!
-Look out!
-Coming through!
Stop the traffic!
Stop the traffic!
Gotta get that blanket on him!
-Clear the way!
-Look at that!
-Move!
Let's get him to the couch!
-Set him on the couch!
Doctor!
Where's the doctor?
.
-Doctor!
-Yes.
-He's lost a lot of blood!
-All right.
Step back.
Step back.
All right.
Just elevate this leg.
Put the pressure right there.
I'd like you to meet the lifeguard who pulled young Vansant out of the water.
Good job, son.
-Thank you, sir.
-Alex Mr. Meehan is the New Jersey Commissioner of Fisheries.
-He'd like to ask you a few questions.
-Of course.
Just got back from the morgue.
Sight must've given you a shock.
The Vansants have been coming to our hotel since Charles was a boy.
I couldn't have felt worse if I'd lost one of my own.
I spoke with Mrs. Vansant briefly.
Please, sit down.
As you can imagine, under the circumstances she wasn't able to help us much.
Now, is it true you told the coroner it was a shark attack?
.
Yes, sir.
Did you see a shark yourself?
.
No, but I did see what it was doing.
It was--
Did you actually see, with your own eyes something you could positively identify as being a shark?
.
Well, no, sir, but--
Well, how did you come to the conclusion that it was one?
.
Well, the man had a huge bite taken out of his leg.
-What do you think it was?
.
-What I think is unimportant.
I have to take an analytical approach.
Work with facts.
-All kinds of predators out there.
-Ones that attack like that?
.
I' m not just talking about animal life.
We've got German U-boats.
In these very waters.
I wouldn't even completely rule out an errant torpedo.
-A torpedo?
.
-Alex Mr. Meehan's simply trying to do his job.
All right, I'm sorry, but whatever it was you are gonna close the beach, at least until you know for sure?
.
-Aren't you?
.
-I only control this little piece right here.
But so far, Mr. Meehan doesn't think a closing is warranted.
There's never been an unprovoked shark attack here.
Not in my lifetime.
It's a scientific fact.
Killer sharks won't swim inshore.
-But suppose one did.
-Supposing one did.
It would have been a freak occurrence.
Is that right?
.
-Whatever did that....
-Would be well on its way back out.
-But what if...?
.
What if it--?
.
-Alex, nobody's asking you to take this on your shoulders.
We'll make sure this gets the attention it deserves.
-Hi, Alex!
-Hey, boys!
How was the water today?
.
-lt was a bit rough.
-Well, maybe it'll be nicer tomorrow.
-Yeah, I hope so.
-See you.
-Hey, Lester.
-Yeah?
.
-Catch one for me?
.
-I'll try.
Hey, Alex!
Got some fish for you!
What's the matter?
.
Did you get fired?
.
-Guess you didn't hear about the attack.
-Yes, that I did.
-Was it you that pulled him in?
.
-Yeah.
It takes a mighty brave man to go into the water when he knows he's sharing it with a shark.
-How did you know it was a shark?
.
-That's what the scuttlebutt has.
-You were there.
Was it a shark?
.
-Well, I didn't actually see it.
But you saw its work, right?
.
You saw the bite?
.
-Yeah, I saw the bites.
-How big?
.
That's a big one, all right.
You know, there's a warm current coming in from the south and the east.
It probably pulled in something like a bull, perhaps a tiger.
The man from Fish and Game said a shark wouldn't attack a swimmer.
That shark didn't read the same book as the Fish and Game man.
See, sharks don't think like us.
But believe me when that was happening everything made perfect sense to that shark.
Alex, are you all right?
.
They left the beach open.
They used to say if ever your dog got hold of a chicken, you'd have to shoot it.
Because once it got a taste for poultry it would keep wanting more.
Hey!
Hey, Alex, how are you situated?
.
The fish ain't biting right at the moment and this old shark is just starving to death.
Starving, my foot.
You're just thirsty.
Well, that too.
And thirsting to death is even worse.
You're a good boy.
-Come out of that water with 1 0 toes?
.
-Last time I checked.
If you can stay like that till the end of summer, you'll be ahead of the game.
Thanks, Cap.
Alex!
-Afternoon, Alex!
-Afternoon!
-Hi, boys.
-Hi, Alex!
Giving you a little more width this time around.
It's very much the modern look.
I think it works nicely.
-Well, well, the man of the hour.
-Mr.
Mayor.
-Alex, we heard.
Are you all right?
.
-I'm fine.
Finish what you were doing.
We're finished.
Right, Stanley?
.
Yes, sir.
Unless there's anything else you require?
.
No, no.
Fine piece of work.
Did they find out what caused the accident?
.
Not certain, but possibly a shark.
It's a pity about that boy.
-I understand he was from a good family.
-I'll have it ready Thursday.
-Perfect.
-Now, how about that second suit?
.
-Well....
-Twenty percent off.
Light imported wool.
With this hot spell we've been having....
Stanley, you're a go-getter.
No one can deny that.
Mr. Mayor?
.
If you knew for sure it was a shark, and it was all up to you would you close the beach?
.
Well I can't really say, Alex.
I guess I'd leave it to the experts.
Did you hear the A's beat the Red Sox?
.
Boston's gotta let somebody slip through once in a while.
Alex, keep up the good work.
You sure you're all right?
.
A man up and dies, maybe from a shark attack, and you get going on baseball?
.
I didn't wanna put him on the spot right here in my shop.
-He's the mayor.
-That's his job!
Okay, okay.
But settle down.
You don't just walk into a concert hall and yell "fire" unless you're damn sure.
-Did you forget who's coming to town?
.
-What's that got to do with anything?
.
Woodrow Wilson, president of the United States, Alex.
He could have his vacation anywhere, but he comes to his home state.
Why?
.
T o help promote this sea-bathing craze.
The hotel you work at wasn't even there when we were kids, remember?
.
Just look at Matawan.
Now it's a real town.
You could tear all that down by speaking too soon about something you're not 1 00 percent sure of.
What if it happens again?
.
You know, I hope you run for office someday.
I'd vote for you.
-It's not just about good business, is it?
.
-That's not what I meant.
Doesn't a man still have to stand for something?
.
Alex, don't go away mad.
I'll see you later.
Change.
Industrial development has come so rapidly that it has created a world far different than that which we were born into.
But as one frontier closes so another new frontier has opened.
And yet America has never been better equipped to march towards this new frontier with courage, ingenuity but above all, a commitment to making this world a more humane place.
And so I say to you, my fellow Americans, do not fear this change.
Life as we know it will endure.
America will continue to prosper.
Our shores will be safe from war.
Alex.
-Thanks for coming.
-It's okay, Mr. Engle.
-A great man, our president.
-Yes, sir.
We'll let the Germans and the French fight.
He'll keep us out of the war.
Look, son, I want you to know I've been on Commissioner Meehan's back.
He just telephoned to let me know they've been talking with all the experts.
Big museums in New York and such.
-Yes, sir?
.
-They're all saying the same thing.
Assuming it was an attack from a shark there's absolutely no chance of it ever happening again.
A freak occurrence.
One in a million.
That's good science, son.
Something you can rely on.
Yes, sir.
Thanks for letting me know.
-I guess I'll see you tomorrow.
-No day off?
.
I'd just as soon get back on the job, if it's all the same to you.
Of course.
Of course.
Good man.
Alex.
Louise.
I'm so glad to see you.
I was worried.
It must have been so awful.
I'm fine.
Thanks.
Stanley told me what you said, your good wishes for us.
I meant it.
I really hope you're getting what you want.
Of course it's what I want.
So everything turned out for the best.
-That's right.
-We looked at each other and agreed.
It wasn't meant to be.
Have you ever had any second thoughts?
.
That's not a fair question.
Suppose I had.
Louise.
What about you?
.
-What about me what?
.
-You know what.
The question is no more fair when you ask it.
Fair enough.
He's a good catch, Louise.
You made the right choice.
You're a dear friend.
I hope it will be for always.
The day after charles Vansant was buried six days after the attack, the trains were full.
The hotels were booked and the beaches were packed.
What happened to Vansant could never happen again.
still, most people did little more than get their feet wet.
Looks like you' re slowing down a bit.
Wouldn't surprise me.
I' m out of practice.
-Will you try again?
.
-T ry what?
.
The Olympics.
What else?
.
First, they have to end the war or they'll keep canceling the damn thing.
Second, it's not like I would've made the team.
Sounds like you're still upset about it.
-How old are you?
.
-Nineteen.
Well, I'm not 1 9 anymore, and I'm still out here on this beach.
And being in the Olympics even if it was a tryout, it would have at least been something.
-Damn!
-What?
.
Those boys are out too far.
No, no, no.
No whistles.
Everyone's too jittery.
They're in Kirkwood's zone.
Go tell him to swim out and bring them in closer.
-I'll take care of it.
-All right.
Be careful.
Hey, fellas!
-You've drifted too far out.
-We're good swimmers.
-We got the tube!
-You need to be closer to shore.
-Come on.
-Okay, I'll tell you what.
I'll race you to shore, and you can have a head start.
All right!
Come on!
Did you say something?
.
Swim fast!
Straight to shore!
Just keep going!
Hurry!
Everybody out of the water!
Out of the water, now!
Kirkwood, get the boat!
Get out of the water!
Out of the water!
Get out of the water!
Everyone out of the water!
Get out of the water!
Come on, let's go!
Let's go!
There he is!
Row faster!
-Danny!
-Danny!
-Get him up!
-Come on, get him up!
Danny, Danny!
Come on, stay with us, Danny!
Stay with us!
-Do you see anything?
.
-No.
-Danny!
-You'll be okay.
Stay with us.
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.
Stay with us.
Danny.
Danny.
Alex, for God's sake, son.
Good science, Mr. Engle?
.
-lsn't that what you called it?
.
-Calm down--
No chance of it happening again?
.
Isn't that what the experts said?
.
Nobody should've been in that water.
Nobody!
-Alex, all of us are upset.
-Will you do one thing for me?
.
Go take your good science and your no-chance-of-it-happening-again and you explain it all to Danny Bruder's family!
Extra, extra!
Killer shark attacks again!
Read all about it!
Reward offered!
Extra, extra!
Killer shark!
Extra, extra!
Killer shark attacks again!
Read all about it!
Read all about the killer shark!
Killer shark attacks again!
Extra, extra!
Good afternoon.
I'm Frederick Lucas, director of the museum and I'm joined today by Dr. John Nichols, our resident ichthyologist.
As you're aware, the federal government and the state of New Jersey have asked us to conduct an investigation into the recent shark attacks in New Jersey.
Didn't you two publish an article stating that sharks are never aggressive and that a shark attack on humans is not scientifically possible?
.
The article you cite was not quite as unambiguous as you portray it.
Nevertheless, you can imagine how concerned and intrigued we are as we watch science turn another page.
What can you say to the 30 mayors along the Jersey shore trying to allay the fears of panicked vacationers?
.
I'll hand that one off to Dr. Nichols, who will conduct the investigation.
John.
We continue to believe that another attack is highly unlikely.
However, caution is always in order.
Or perhaps I should say "precaution. "
How do you plan on protecting the public?
.
You're aware of the steel fences that are being installed in the water at Asbury Park and other shore resorts.
We feel this is an adequate response to restore confidence in the community.
-Any other questions?
.
-Sir, over here, sir!
So, Murphy, are you coming or not?
.
I don't like New Jersey.
It's hot down there.
Oh, and it's not hot here?
.
We'll be near the water.
I know a chap who's got a boat.
With a motor.
All right, but just promise me it doesn't involve any dangerous animals, will you?
.
It'll be an adventure, Murphy.
A very profitable adventure.
-Give me it!
Give me it!
Come on!
-You gotta catch me!
Then what?
.
He was running down this way.
Running like hell.
Where the hell have you been the last two days?
.
-We've been worried sick about you.
-I'm sorry.
I needed a little breather.
You dress down your boss, quit your job and you take off?
.
There was a matter about shark attacks.
I think you heard about them.
All right.
Look, you have my undying support on the principle of the thing.
It took some sand to quit, and I admire you for that.
-There's a "but" in there somewhere.
-Alex, you don't think about the future.
Something like this could hurt you.
Suppose you wanted to set up a business.
The sun-browning thing, or....
I don't know.
-What are you driving at?
.
-I could talk to Mr. Engle.
I'm sure he'd take you back.
-Would you please kindly tell me--?
.
-Damn it, it looks like you chickened out.
That's what it looks like, huh?
.
-That what you think?
.
-I didn't say that.
I can't respect a man who'd put people's lives in danger to keep his business open.
I don't intend to work for one.
I don't give a damn how it looks to you or anyone else on this earth!
-Alex, I hear you're looking for a job.
-I need a bigger town.
Hey, hey.
Steady on, now.
Steady on.
-Hey, barman?
.
-Yeah, Cap?
.
-Give us a drink here.
-Coming up.
It's all right.
I'm buying.
I'm buying.
Listen, I got a job.
Gonna put up a big fence to stop those big fish with sharp teeth from nibbling those bathers.
Consequently, I'm in the market for a first mate.
Such a man should be strong of arm, have no brains whatsoever and above all, must be able to hold his liquor.
You got the fence there?
.
-You got it?
.
-Yeah.
-That's it.
-All right.
As soon as we've got this section in, I'm gonna catch us all fish for supper, huh?
.
While you're at it, why not catch the shark.
There's a reward.
Notice you said "the" shark, instead of "a" shark.
Most people assume it's just one.
-Like a mad dog.
-And what if they're wrong?
.
There are more sharks out there this year than ever.
Warm tide bringing them in.
What if they're just in the mood to bite?
.
It happens to other fish.
Why not them?
.
Well, whichever it is, it won't be happening on this beach anymore.
Amen to that.
Okay, it's the usual drill.
We move as fast as we can, stay close to me.
If you see anything, don't panic.
Just sing out and swim for the ladder.
-All right?
.
Let's go.
-Yes, sir.
-Did you get it tight?
.
-Yeah.
-You ready?
.
-Yeah.
-What?
.
What?
.
-I think I saw something.
-What?
.
-A shark.
I don't see no damn shark.
Get them out of the water.
Come on, swim, you devils.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Swim to the boat!
Come on, come on, swim for your lives!
Come on, all of you.
Quick.
Quick.
Move it.
Move it.
Come on, Alex.
Come onboard.
Come on.
Come on.
-Good boy.
-They all in?
.
-Yes.
-Hey, Vic, you got grazed.
Hold on.
-You son of a--
-Hey, hey, hey, Vic.
Hey!
Belay that.
If any man here does not have the stomach nor the steadiness of hand for what we do, go home now.
Otherwise, take five minutes and we're back to work.
Get that covered.
Don't wanna be in the water with that, eh?
.
Well done.
Well done, boys.
Well done.
Well done.
Look.
There it is right there.
All right, I've come all this way with you.
Now, will you tell me what you're cooking up?
.
I just wanna walk around for a bit, take it in.
It's so exciting, all these people.
The sea, the sun.
It's good for you.
Aren't you interested in beach bathing?
.
It sounds mighty dangerous to me.
Are you aware of the fact they've had shark attacks here?
.
-Now you' re getting the idea.
-What?
.
No.
No.
No.
-No.
No.
No.
-Murphy.
Come on, I'll buy you a beer.
All right.
Mr. Fisher.
Mr. Fisher.
Come play.
Please come play.
-Please, play ball?
.
-I don't know, fellas.
I'm kind of tired.
But the other team has Mr. Burlew, and we need a grown-up too.
-And you're not half bad.
-Lester.
-Mom.
-Lester.
Mr. Fisher's a busy man.
I'm sure you boys can find someone else to play.
Mrs. Stillwell, I was just about to say yes.
As long as I get to be on your son's team.
-Oh, my gosh, let's go.
-Yeah, let's go.
-Okey-dokey, who's our best fielder?
.
-Right here.
You guys have been practicing.
Again, highballs.
Very good.
We're ready to lead.
Out into the outfield.
-Over here.
Over here, Alex.
-Throw it here.
-Hey, throw it back.
-Alex, right here.
-Hi, Stan.
-Hi, Alex.
Well, I'm just gonna clean these, put them on a plate.
Plenty for you, Stan.
Thanks, Cap.
Rain check?
.
I'll meet you in there, Cap.
-Oh, I'm sorry--
-I didn't mean to--
-Are we gonna play yet?
.
-I'll meet you at the field in a minute.
See you.
-Sorry I spilled beer on you.
-Yeah, I smelled like a saloon.
It took a lot of explaining to Louise.
-I know you meant well.
-lt wasn't my place to judge.
I got to thinking about what you went through out there on that damn beach.
-Stan, I sent Danny Bruder out there.
-Hey.
You were doing your job.
And he was doing his.
-Yeah, but he--
-Same if it was the other way around.
Danny wouldn't want you to put yourself through all this.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Now time is running out.
-Come in tomorrow, I'll cut you a suit.
-I couldn't accept.
I gotta have my best man looking his best.
Is tomorrow good for you, knuckleball?
.
I'll check my appointments, spitball.
-I never threw a spitball in my life.
-I don't know about that.
Oh, yeah.
Losing your touch there, spitball.
Welcome, Dr. Nichols.
May I take your bag?
.
Thank you.
I'll keep this one.
It's just the other three, thank you.
-Dr.
Nichols.
What kind of shark is it?
.
-ls there just one?
.
The museum has no statement to make now.
-ls the president going swimming here?
.
-I would have no idea.
Good afternoon.
Suite 44, please.
-Here you are.
-Oh, thanks, Eddie.
My pleasure.
Bring your catch in here any time.
Here you are.
Thanks, Cap.
Pardon me.
I'm looking for Mr. Treadmont.
-Oh, yes, he's right over there.
-Alex.
Good evening.
I'm John Nichols.
Ichthyologist with the Museum of Natural History in New York.
-Good evening.
Could I have a moment?
.
-Sure.
Just let me get these plates out of the way, eh?
.
-What kind of "ologist" did you say?
.
-lchthyologist.
I' m a fish man.
-Please, have a seat.
-Oh, thank you.
I'm here about the shark attacks.
Well, I don't know how much help I can be to you, Mr. Nichols.
I really didn't see that much.
I was under the impression you saw both attacks.
Well, a lot of people nowhere near the place can give you all kinds of gory eyewitness details.
I was too busy saving those boys to pay much mind to the shark.
I understand, but you probably saw more than you think.
Now, in your statement you said that young Mr. Bruder was struck numerous times?
.
Yes, sir, I did see that.
With great force?
.
As I understand it, Mr. Bruder's legs were never recovered.
Now, did you see them during the attack?
.
I' m upsetting you.
I' m....
I'm sorry.
I'm here for several days.
Perhaps we could talk again?
.
Yeah.
I'm pretty easy to find.
Mr. Nichols?
.
Just what does an ichthyologist do?
.
Study fish.
Talk about fish.
Write about fish.
-And you went to school for this?
.
-Perhaps more than I should have.
Better to be in the water with the fish, huh?
.
Yeah, except when the big ones bite.
There is that.
Thanks for your time.
On july 12th, 1916, the sun rose at 5:37 a.m.
The gulf Stream continued its flow inshore, warming the waters.
-Morning, matey.
-Hey, Cap.
-Getting a kind of early start, aren't you?
.
-Well gotta get back before it gets too hot.
Got a steady job, a new first mate.
-Might not be bad.
You want some?
.
-No, thanks.
Gotta get to work.
-Catch me a couple for lunch, will you?
.
-Be my pleasure.
Those fish will be biting today.
-Dad?
.
-Yes, son?
.
-Can I go swimming after work?
.
-Sure.
By 8:00, it was already hot and humid.
The people of Matawan went to work, ran their businesses took care of their kids.
-Have a good day, son.
-Y eah.
Thanks, Dad.
Just Like they always did.
By 9, it was clear.
It was gonna be a real scorcher.
-Morning, Frank.
-A good day for the beach.
-Frank, you look confused.
-Sometimes I am confused, Stanley.
Well, remember, you arrest the bad guys and you cut the customers' hair.
-Not the other way around.
-Thanks, brother.
Never gotten it backwards yet.
Thank God.
With the heat rising, the folks from the cities forgot about sharks and headed for the beaches in record numbers.
It was now 12 days since the first attack.
It's lunchtime, everybody.
It's lunch.
-Hey, Lester.
-Hey, fellas.
-You look hot.
-Y eah.
I am hot.
I' m burning up.
You know what you can do about that, don't you?
.
Yeah, I wish, but I can't.
Eight feet?
.
An 8-foot boat, Michael?
.
Why, a shark could bite that in half without trying.
We will not hunt with that.
We're just gonna scout around in it, just see what we can see.
You can do as you please.
I'm on the next train out of here.
Murphy!
I am disappointed in you.
Now, do I know animals?
.
We're gonna go out there, take a look then I can bring the fishing boat.
I've got a sixth sense about these things.
Eight feet, Michael.
I hope you get back all right.
Hey.
You're a long way from home, aren't you?
.
Good God.
-Hello?
.
-Yeah.
Give me the chief of police.
-Frank, for you.
-hello?
hello?
hello?
hello?
-Mulsoff.
-Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, Frank?
Frank?
-Slow down.
Who's talking?
.
-A shark.
It's Cap.
It's Cap, Frank.
Listen, listen, there's a--
There's a live shark heading up the crick.
A shark, you say?
.
That's right.
I'm at Matawan Bridge, I Looked down there's a large shark, and he's heading up the crick.
-ln the crick?
.
-Come on, I'm serious, Frank.
Now, do something about it.
You'd have a better chance of seeing an elephant cooling off there than a shark.
Frank, listen to me.
Frank?
.
Frank?
.
Frank?
.
Damn it!
-Slow down, Cap.
Slow down.
-Listen, I'm gonna need your boat.
-I need your boat.
-Will you listen to me?
.
Hey, come on, guys.
Are we swimming or what?
.
How much longer, Lester?
.
-Well, I usually don't get off until 3:00.
-Three o'clock?
.
-Come on, guys.
We'll go without him.
-Yeah.
-Lester?
.
-Yes, sir?
.
By my count, you've put on 1 00 handles so far.
Yes, sir.
Well, I'm afraid I might get overstocked.
I believe you better knock off early today.
Yes, sir.
Thanks, Dad.
-Yeah, Lester.
Come on.
-Come on, let's go, guys.
-This is great.
-Hey, boys.
You keep away from the water.
There's a shark in here.
There's a shark.
Now, you listen to me.
Keep out, or I'll tell your dad and he'll whop you.
Crazy old man.
Let's go.
-Race you.
-Come on, let's go.
-Get to the water.
-Got it.
-Come on, you guys.
-All right, I'm going in.
-Come on in, it's great.
-Come on.

What's going on?
.
-Lester's in trouble down at the crick.
-He's in the crick.
Okay, guys, we gotta be careful.
If the yardmaster spots us, he'll run us off.
What will he do to us?
.
-They said it was a shark.
-Oh, come on, Red.
-We're almost four miles upriver.
-There's blood out there.
Hit his head on a rock?
.
Or he started vomiting or something.
Oh, my God.
How long has he been under?
.
Nothing.
Alex!
Alex!
-Shark in the crick!
-What the hell are you talking about?
.
We got a damn shark in the crick.
Get onboard.
-It's okay.
-Not yet.
We'll go in a minute.
All right, a little more.
-Keep going, fellas.
All the way.
-Unroll it.
-Right across.
-Frank.
What's all this about?
.
The current will take the boy right out to sea if we don't catch him in something.
-Anything?
.
-No.
Careful!
What the hell?
.
Oh, my God.
That's all for me.
I'm getting out of here.

Excuse me.
-This man is going into shock.
-Stay with me, Stan.
-Stanley!
-Stay with me, buddy.
Come on, buddy.
You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna be all right.
-We need to get him to a hospital.
-Stay with me, buddy.
Shark!

Headed downstream.
-There it is.
Get your rifle.
-Get some dynamite.
-Louise, you stay here.
-Get him off.
Careful, now.
-How long to Asbury Park?
.
-Forty minutes nonstop.
This is a local.
-Not anymore.
Is the track clear?
.
-Just got it clear.
It's against regulation.
My best friend will die if we don't get to a hospital.
-I'm sorry--
-My friend will die.
This train is gonna be in Asbury Park in 30 minutes, with you driving or me.
There you go.
Come on!
Stay there.

You guys okay?
.
-Yeah.
-Go get help, quick.
You'll be all right, lad.
You'll be all right.
-Alex.
-I'm here, Stan.
I found Lester.
I know.
I found Lester.
With four people killed in 12 days and young Joe Dunn fighting for his Life the shark claimed yet another victim the beach towns.
Business was dying.
It seemed Like the whole country had gone shark mad.
Lester's body still hadn 't been found.
But not for Lack of trying.
Everyone either wanted to kill the shark...
-Hold it, ladies.
-... or make a buck off of it.
Good.
The circus was in town.
This is the real shark, ladies and gentlemen.
Morning.
Do you have a plan for killing this monster?
.
As tempting as that sounds, sir, that is simply not my main concern here.
It wasn 't just the experts and the fakes.
But good people got drawn up in it too.
Look closely, but don't put your hands near the jaws.
For even in death, they have been known to take a man's hand off.
-How long did it take you to land her?
.
-Hard to tell.
Time plays tricks when you're fighting for your life.
-How are you sure this one's the killer?
.
-Because when I hauled her aboard a lump of human flesh and bone fell out of her mouth.
Yeah.
Well, that's about all we got time for for this group, I'm afraid.
Thank you very much.
Move along.
The next group now, please.
-Thank you very much.
-Very good, sir.
-Good evening.
-Good evening.
I'm wondering if there's any messages.
Alex.
I'm going shark hunting, Dr. Nichols and I'd appreciate it if you could tell me what I'm looking for.
I think what you're after is a great white shark.
Have you got a minute?
.
It's one of nature's marvels.
Carcharodon carcharias.
The biter with jagged teeth.
There were creatures not unlike it in the age of the dinosaurs.
You know, it can grow to be 20 feet or more.
The ones I saw weren't anywhere near that big.
My examination of the victims' wounds confirms that.
It's a juvenile, if it is a great white.
I haven't ruled out the possibility of a bull shark.
The fact that it went up the creek.
Bulls can survive in fresh water.
Lake Nicaragua, up the Zambezi in Africa.
How do I find it?
.
We've been wrong about so much but my guess is it's a rogue that followed the current inshore found a new source of protein, marked out its territory.
It's still in the bay.
I'd look where it's already been successful.
Successful.
You sure I can't talk you into coming with me?
.
Well, when the Museum of Natural History goes on a shark hunt, Alex or any other kind of hunt, it must do it in a....
A certain way.
So I, unfortunately, must decline.
Well, I appreciate your time, Dr. Nichols.
Alex?
.
If you're determined to go ahead with this, please be careful.
Don't do it on your own.
The great white is highly aggressive.
It will attack willfully and with astonishing force.
I know.
Hey, wait up.
Afternoon, Eddie.
I'm looking for Cap.
-Haven't seen him.
-Hello, Alex.
I'm sorry about your friend.
-You're the doctor.
-No.
Just a Good Samaritan who, in the course of his profession, gained experience in traumatic injury.
What profession would that be?
.
I'm a....
A trainer of dangerous animals at the Barnum Bailey Circus.
And a taxidermist.
Michael Schleisser.
Please, take a seat.
-So you're a lion tamer?
.
-And other beasts.
I train them hunt them, speak to them and stuff them if they misbehave.
-And you're here for the shark?
.
-Maybe.
That all depends on my mood when I wake up in the morning.
If I said you were going after the shark, would I be correct?
.
I suppose you would.
-What do you know about sharks?
.
-Little.
But it doesn't matter.
I have a feel for animals.
I can't explain it.
Let me guess.
You want the shark but it's not about the money.
You do realize there is a reward?
.
Oh, I do.
But you're right, it's not about the money.
So you're seeking either fame or revenge.
You see, Alex, revenge implies a debt.
You owe someone.
Maybe a couple of someones.
And you'd pay with the predator's life or with your own.
You don't really care which way it goes which makes you the most dangerous predator of them all.
If this shark could be talked to death you'd sure be the one to do it.
There was a moment when I....
I thought we might be able to help one another, Alex.
But I believe that you would be a danger to me and to yourself, I might add.
Mr. Schleisser, I just don't wanna see anybody else get killed.
You gonna hang that thing up there until it rots?
.
That thing, as you call it, made me a pretty bundle today.
You went out and caught it on a line, huh?
.
Well, I guess that means you made the water safe for us all.
All right.
All right.
What did you do, go out and buy that thing?
.
A few miles up the coast.
Paid a couple of dollars.
Damn it, can't a man try to make a buck out of the situation?
.
Look, Alex I wanted to go after the killer, and I knew you did too.
Especially after Stan.
But you-
- You see-- You see, you get all heated up and go after revenge and that devil gets you--
What are you saying, you did this for me?
.
-I won't say I didn't.
-Four people are dead.
The boy you pulled out of the crick is barely hanging on.
If people think it's safe to go in the water now--
I know that!
You gotta come clean before somebody else gets hurt.
T omorrow morning, you gotta go into that town and tell them.
You know what they think of me?
.
I was warning them, they were laughing.
I know, and that was wrong, Cap!
But you turned out to be right.
No, no, no.
I'd sooner die than face them.
Well there's only one good way I can think of to avoid that.
Damn you, boy.
You're twice as smart as a revenue man, and three times as devious.
Get your gear and come onboard.
Well, this is all fine and dandy.
If we don't get ourselves killed by your damn shark.
-It's not my damn shark.
-Take the helm a second.
Here, hold her steady on that course.
Think like a shark.
Let's see, then....
Think like a shark.
Go into the water like that and....
Hey.
Hey.
Comes in on the tide.
He was waiting for us.
When the guys were firing in the water.
Then he goes out.
He goes out and finds that warm current again.
Now, where is the warm current?
.
Then I can see....
Fifteen....
That's where your damn shark is.
Just there.
Exactly there.
Give or take about 1 00 square miles.
Don't worry.
Bring her around to port.
Right, let's lay a line of chum down along the ridge line and do a little trolling for shark.
-Cap, off the bow.
-What?
.
Look.
What the hell?
.
Some fool's made a shark a tidy breakfast, maybe.
All right.
Let's go and have a look at it.
Shut her down.
Ahoy there.
What the--?
.
Cap, did you see the size of that thing?
.
-Schleisser?
.
-What in the hell are you doing here?
.
Never mind, just leave.
Please.
-Thank you.
-What are you doing here?
.
Presumably the same thing that you are.
But I can tell you that I was here first.
That I have an anchor planted and you do not.
You saying you' re trying to catch the shark...
-...that just about took my head off?
.
-That's precisely my plan.
That shark is bigger than your boat.
She'll swamp you sooner than you can spit.
Sir, let's not debate the finer points of how to catch this shark or whether it is indeed a she or a he.
For some unknown reason, as you've obviously seen it's attracted to this boat, and to the unique personality of the person seated here before you.
Don't ask me why.
And suppose you don't get capsized and eaten outright.
You plan to reach out and bop it on the head?
.
I'm dragging a net.
The shark will get caught up take me on a long ride, then it will die and that will be that.
That is the dumbest idea I've ever heard in my entire life.
If you would be so kind as to just give me a little more room.
Alex.
Alex, this man is as crazy as a loon.
Now, he's gonna get us killed.
-What do you wanna do?
.
-I don't know.
-What--?
.
-Holy smoke.
-Shark in the net!
-lt'll capsize the boat.
-Watch him.
-Hang on!
Look at that.
-Schleisser, hang on.
-That's it.
Come on.
-Hurry up!
He'll be a dead man.
-Out to sea we go.
Cap, hurry up!
Hang on, Schleisser!
Get the gaffe.
Get the gaffe!
-We gotta try and gaffe him.
-You see, I told you.
-Hold on.
-Hard aport as she goes.
Holy smoke!
-Back her down, Cap.
-Where are you?
.
Where is he now?
.
Where?
.
Man overboard!
Oh, you--!
I see you!
I see you.
-Hand him the gaffe.
-Schleisser!
That's it.
-Grab hold.
-Come on!
Come on!
-Grab ahold!
-Grab it!
-Jump, Schleisser.
-No.
Hold it.
Jump, man, jump!
-Jump.
Grab ahold!
-Come on.
Come on!
Come on.
Jump.
Schleisser!
Come on, now.
Come on, now.
Pull him.
Pull him aboard.
-You all right?
.
-Oh, no.
-My boat.
-Cap, it's getting away.
We'll see about that.
Damn it.
He's getting away.
Do something, man.
He's getting away.
I'm gonna catch him.
Alex, no!
-Swim, boy!
-Get back!
-Damn it, boy.
Get back aboard!
-Come on.
Alex!
Come on!
Get back in the boat now, lad.
-Come on.
-Go, Alex!
Come on.
All right.
All right.
Now, take her around the bow.
Hold her, boys.
Hold her.
-Tie her off.
-All right.
There.
Let her pull for a while, eh?
.
She's deserved it.
Well, we got us a shark, gentlemen.
Damn him!
It's an odd gift.
I don't know where it comes from.
I simply knew where to go.
I knew the shark would come.
Attracted to the boat and the person in it.
-Don't ask me why.
-Aye, shark bait.
That's what he was.
-Tell us about that, captain?
.
-Yeah.
-Tell us a story.
-Well, it all began the day I saw this creature from the bridge over Matawan Creek.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
You think that's the one?
.
We won't know till we look inside, but it's a juvenile great white.
I'd say it's a pretty good candidate.
I hope you'll make some time and tell us everything that happened.
Sure.
It would be a great service to the museum.
I knew at that moment that he was....
Dr. Nichols.
Just how would someone go about getting into your line of work?
.
Well, a person could start by showing up at my office sometime.
It seems all of a sudden I have about 1 0 million questions to ask you.
My friend, I could safely say the same thing.
See you then?
.
Were you afraid, sir?
.
It was, without a doubt, the ride of a lifetime.
I can tell you that.
But there was a third person on that boat who deserves to be here.
-Who?
.
-What's your name?
.
Oh, no.
You two are telling it just fine.
Thank you, Alex.
Now, Cap will tell you the teeth are big.
-How big?
.
-Very big.
Big?
.
This man has not seen big teeth on a shark.
I can show you big teeth on a shark.
Why, there was once I saw this shark....
Later that day, Dr. NichoLs opened up the juvenile white and found pieces of human bone and tissue in its stomach.
The very same day, Lester StiLLweLL's body was recovered in the creek where StanLey died.
Of the five shark victims, only young Joseph Dunn survived.
Two months after the attack he walked out of the hospital with his brother michael a pair of crutches and the Limp he 'd have for the rest of his Life.
That winter, the gulf Stream that had brought the deep-ocean predators into shore moved back out to sea.
The shark attacks of 1916 were over.

My clients are willing to pay your price for the house... if you're willing to buy a home warranty, and repaint the interior.
Done.
- So when you due?
- Nine weeks.
- It's gonna be another girl.
- Ho.
My sister and I were just about as far apart in age as your daughters.
This will be a great house for two girls.
Congratulations.
You'll be really happy here.
Do you mind if I have a few minutes in the house?
- Sure.
We'll take a walk.
- Thanks.
Seeing those buyers, make me think of Rachel in this house... with a husband and children...
You're doing a great job, Rebecca.
It's a hard thing to get through.
It's good that a family is moving in.
Make this place happy, one again.
Just now that it's done, I feel kind of empty.
Hey.
You want to see a movie.
- Com'on..
Some Funny
- I have a prior commitment tonight.
But you're welcome to join me.
Ok.
Check out Lincoln.
How about that Abe Lincoln, huh?
So adorable.
You must be really proud.
Yeah.
We are.
Thank you all for coming down to the high school tonight!
- I'd like to invite you to meet our stars out of the lobby.
- If any of you are still awake.
A special thank-you to Mr. Talbot for bringing kids of all ages together in this production.
How about one more round of applause for our talented performers and musicians!
Good night.
What do you think?
So cute, I can't believe this.
What did you see?
The Dead Zone
- Saison 3 Episode 09 "Cycle Of Violence"
I don't know what triggered the vision.
When I was leaving the theater, I walk through a doorway that hundreds of people passed through.
Just tell us again what you saw.
It was during a school day.
I heard gunshots.
I look down the hallway.
And the students and the teachers, they were scared, they were screaming.
- It was like they was running away from someone.
- Did you see the shooter's face?
No but whoever he was, he was wearing a sweatshirt with a hood.
Then I saw him walking to this room.
I heard another gunshot.
- And then the vision ended.
- These things you see, they always come true?
Yes.
Mr Rowin, unless we do something to stop it, this shooting will happen.
Yeah.
We can't just sit around away for something that will happen.
We have to close the school tomorrow.
But that's a temporary until we can get security in place.
Guards, metal detectors, whatever it takes to guarantee the safety of these kids.
In the meantime, we've got to find this shooter.
- What else we have to go on John?
- I didn't get a good look at this personn.
Rebecca, you've worked with a lot of trouble kids.
Is there anything we should be looking for?
Well, this is a rare chance to save two people:
the victim and the kid who's going to shoot him.
By the time a kid picks up a gun, he may already be dead inside.
- There must be warning signs.
- Each kid is different, but there are some things to look for.
He'll probably expressing anger in other ways, vandalism or making threats, verbally or in writing.
Some kids posts their threats on a website.
Yes.
There is a second element that these kids have in common... and it might sounds obvious but he'll have easy access to a gun.
We're pulling missing gun reports.
The problem is there's a firearms out... and the parents just haven't secured properly.
Okay, we'll start by looking at every students who fit your profile.
I can think of a few suspects.
Most kids who fit the profile never act on their threats.
We have to start somewhere.
I think a locker search is appropriate.
Metal detectors aren't gonna help if the gun is here already.
Maybe something from one of the kid's lockers will help me identify this person.
In the meantime, we need to be discrete about this thing.
Yeah, we got to keep it low-key.
All we do, is to say that there's an unspecified threat...
- against the school, we shut it down tomorrow.
- Or it will be a cause of panic.
Tomorrow morning first, we search lockers.
After that, we interview every student who seems like he might do this kind of thing, and talk to their parents.
"The Complete Encyclopedia of Serial Killers"
Walt, 304.
We pre-screened the contents.
These are the most likely troublemakers.
- All these lockers?
- We thought we cast the wide net, let you do your thing.
Com'on.
Is it him?
I don't know.
But I can't rule him out.
Try this one.
We found a copy of "Soldier of Fortune" and a Marilyn Manson album.
These kinds of things aren't necessarily indicators.
Maybe not.
But we still have to try.
- I can't rule her out either.
- Why ?
She likes burning pictures of her ex-boyfriend.
I did that.
She stays on the list.
Come on.
We got a lot of lockers to go though.
These one aren't suspects.
Maybe not, but... all of this kids have traumatic events ahead of them.
At this point, I can't rule anyone out.
Maybe the interviews will be more productive.
We should get start on those.
Who knows?
The shooter might be sitting in my outer office right now.
Mr. Fitz?
And Derek?
So Derek?
I understand... your sense of humor gets you in trouble sometimes.
Do you ever joke about damaging school property or getting back at a teacher for something...?
Only when I'm awake.
Sometimes I daydream about smashing things up.
So what?
- Do you daydream a lot?
- Do you?
- Derek?
- Did I say I have violent daydreams?
I misspoke.
I usually think about things like daisies, and fluffy bunnies.
I have nothing but love and respect for this institution.
Check out my 'blog if you want to know what I really think about.
- This is your web site?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Dereksworld at Maine blog dot com.
I'll be posting my daydreams about you later today.
Derek, show some respect.
I apologize for whatever my son has done.
- What are your feelings about school Lenora?
- Just another thing to put up with.
I mean, do this until I'm eighteen, work for forty years, marry, squeeze out some babies, divorce, then die.
Lenora!
- She's kidding.
- I'm not kidding.
I hope they close this place down for good.
Here's some condoms.
So there's something else at home that could suggests problems at school?
Is my son in some kind of trouble?
He had this book in his locker.
Charles?
You like this kind of book?
- I thought it was funny and weird...
- When you read these books, do you ever feel sorry for the victims?
- I don't know.
Never thought about it.
- What about the killers?
- What do you fell about them?
- They're freaks, man.
- Ed Gein used to wear human skin.
- Here you go.
Do you have a gun, Charles?
Are you going to make list of gun owners, now?
We're just trying to clear his name, Mr. Kolchak.
He's better than I was at his age.
Even has a kind of homework club.
Is that a four color pen?
- You might want to encourage him to do his own homework.
- Okay.
Thanks for coming in.
Drive safely.
Okay?
That's the last one.
Did you cross anybody off?
No, in fact I added a few names.
So, let's keep it closed for a couple more days.
Just keep looking.
Mr. Smith.
I can't close my school indefinitely waiting for you to find something.
We can't have twelve hundred students with no place to go.
The shooter is gonna find his victims at an arcade or mall just as easily.
At least here on campus we have some kind of control.
The new security is almost up and running.
We're opening school tomorrow.
These kids are really scared.
Just look.
That's not surprising.
I'm scared too.
Thanks for coming down.
Got any new leads?
Anything?
- No.
How about you?
- Not much.
A couple of more students came to our attention.
I was hoping you could talk to them.
One of them isin Mr. Talbot's class in the auditorium upstairs.
- Sure, we'll head up.
- Thanks.
- Mr. Smith?
- Hi, we need to speak to one of your students, Colin?
Colin?
The principal sent you after me.
- Didn't he?
- Yes, but he didn't say why.
It's not because of me.
It's because of my brother.
He got into the gang stuff.
Drugs, mostly.
My parents moved here so that I would have a chance, and even here, everyone looks at me like I'm a criminal.
I'm not!
I believe you.
- So how long have you been playing trumpet?
- Just started this year.
Can I check it out?
Do you have heard about the film"Malcom X"?
I think it should be required reading.
- Can I go back now?
- Sure.
Thanks.
Colin
Colin seems like a good kid.
All those kids we talked to, they could turn into shooters.
Or they could turn into doctors and lawyers.
It's hard to tell.
Until it's too late.
I need to see inside the bag.
- You didn't look in their bags.
- Son, you're not getting by until I see what you're carrying.
I just want to know why you singled me out and no one else.
I don't need a reason.
What do you have in there, anyway?
None of your business.
Then you're not coming in.
I'll be right back.
Give it back.
What are you hiding?
What's we got here?
I said give it back.
Knock it off!
Back off!
Now!
Get away from him.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
But that security guy was being a Nazi.
He singled me out for no reason
- He wouldn't have found anything in your backpack
- That's not the point.
The point is, he has no right.
I didn't do anything.
- Yeah.
- I got it.
You come with me.
- He was the one who got beaten up.
- He is a trouble maker.
############
Hey I want the book.
What are you looking at?
Derek, Johnny was just trying to keep you from getting hurt.
He did a great job, too.
They're sending me home...
"to think about the impact I have on my peers, and how I can fit in better."
I got kicked out of school, once.
Some friends and I put out an unauthorized student newspaper.
Called "The Cleavage Mills Gazette".
No it was great.
Come on!
Hey, I was fourteen.
They were trying to institute mandatory drug tests at school.
We fought it.
Your web site kind of reminded me that.
Pretty gutsy.
- You read it?
- Yeah, I read it.
I really liked the essay that you wrote about the difference between education and indoctrination.
You're a talented writer.
Not that anybody around here gives a damn.
I'm just trying to keep things safe around here for everybody .
I'm not your enemy Derak?
Everybody knows you predicted something.
- What did you see?
- I can't tell you.
Why are they suspending you?
Supposedly for fighting.
I think the real reason is for questioning his rules... and what I said about the school on my 'blog'.
I'll talk to Principal Rowin.
You talking to the principal is what started all this.
I know that.
He refused to be searched.
Then he got in a fight.
If I don't suspend him it breeds disrespect for authority.
There are plenty of kids who have done much worse.
Derek will be the example that puts the others on notice.
Enforcing the rules unequaly will alsolutly breed disrespect for authority.
- You're just making things worse.
- Fine,
I'll let him off with a warning.
But if those bullets fly, parents will blame me.
There's a gunman in my school, and you haven't found him yet.
Have you?
Maybe we've already changed the future.
Maybe the shooting is not gonna happen now.
Yeah.
I hope so.
Is there some problem?
You alright?
I saw the shooter walk into the teacher's lounge.
He aimed his gun at three of the teachers, but didn't shoot, like he was waiting for something.
Do you think he's looking for someone in particular?
Possibly.
- The class change?
- Fire alarm.
On that door.
###########
We got a bomb threat.
- Who's locker is it?
- No ones.
It's supposed to be empty.
What's that.
" BOOM !
There go our rights."
This is a prank.
I want to find this kid.
I want him out of my school, and I want him in jail.
- It's modeling clay.
- It's a terroristic threat.
We should be careful not to overreact to something like this.
Mr. Smith!
I set school policy.
I have to maintain order.
Touch it.
I know how your abilities work.
Go ahead.
I didn't see anything.
Maybe it'll come to you later.
First, you predict a shooting.
Now, we have a bomb scare.
- This is a prank.
- This is security breach.
We have to double our efforts.
I'm supposed to meet Principal Rowin.
You'll have to stand in line with everyone else.
- We have an appointment.
- I don't set the policy.
Hey, Colin
I.D.?
That's Ok..
They're with me.
Go ahead.
Sorry.
You're on the list.
Why?
Take that will you?
Turn around and let me search.
- You suck.
- What did you say?
Nothing.
You guys pointed out that enforcing the rules... unequaly with Derek Fitz would be unfair.
- Yes...
- You were right.
It was unfair to single him out.
So to be absolutly fair, I had no choice but to suspend everyone who refused to be searched.
Including Derek as thirty-one possible crimes, averted.
- You suspended thirty one students?
- Thirty-one potential shooters.
And I suspect anyone.
Hey!
A kid threw a bottle.
Who threw that?
Who threw that bottle?
Colin, you're allright?
I will not tolerate this.
This was an attack on a school employee.
Now, who threw the bottle?
Uh?
Who threw the bottle?
############
Go to hell.
What did you see?
The guard overreacted.
Colin was defending himself.
He's here to protect these students.
The kid resisted.
I saw what happened.
The guard was out of line.
We're going to have to agree to disagree on that point,
What I really want to know is who threw the bottle?
If it hadn't been for that bottle Colin might have been injured even worse.
- That guard should be fired.
- That's for me to decide.
- Who threw the bottle John?
- I can't help you with this.
I'm sorry.
- Why are we here?
- I want to talk to Derek.
He's the one who threw the bottle?
He pulled the locker stunt, too.
He reminds me a lot of myself at that age.
So you knew he was here because of your gift?
Because I've lived in Cleaves Mills all my life.
I'm looking for Derek Fitz.
You guys have seen him?
Thanks.
Hey.
Can't you just leave me alone?
Every time you get near me, bad things happen.
I just wanted to talk to you.
See if you could help us before things got out of hand.
- Little late for that.
- Derek I understand how you feel.
But now is not the time to bait the principal.
You know what I mean?
If no one stands up then they've won, haven't they?
If someone shoots up the school, we've all lost.
We're here because we're worried about you.
- You think I'm it.
You think I'm a psycho.
- No.
- You'd say the same thing if you did as if you didn't.
- No... it's not my think.
We just wanted to...
Just wanted to get me busted?
Derek, Derek!
That generated a lot of love and trust.
And goodwill.
- Was that Derek Fitz?
- Yes.
- I've got a warrant for him.
- Walt, listen.
He's angry, he's a smart ass but he's not your shooter.
I won't be so sure about that.
Even if you could guarantee me he would never shoot anyone,
I don't want a kid like that in my school.
I saw the fight.
And your guard used excessive force.
That kid was just defending himself.
Derek was just trying to help him.
- He's not a bad kid.
- That's not my opinion.
If he's willing to hurt someone who is armed and in uniform... imagine what else he's capable of.
I'm talking to the prosecutor's office about pressing criminal charges.
Wait a minute.
That's overkill.
Walt?
If the guard wants to press charges, my hands are tied.
I have to arrest him.
Derek?
What are you doing here?
They're looking all over for you.
I need to talk to you.
Yeah, come in.
Thanks, I was starving.
They got you throwing the bottle on the surveillance camera.
Damned.
I know that you were just trying to defend Colin.
I'll vouch for you.
But I think we should call your folks for...
I can't go home.
- Why not?
- I just can't.
My Dad will freak.
I wish I could wind back the clock three days.
I just want to go back to class.
I like it.
Even if sometimes I hate it.
Okay.
We can hang on here this afternoon.
I got something I got to sort out.
You said there were something you wanted to talk about?
Whatever it is, it stays right here between us.
Man to man.
Is there a chance...
Am I gonna shoots up the school?
Is that what you think?
I don't know what to think.
Last week I was an A- student with good prospects.
Now I'm expelled.
A fugitive.
I'd like to know for sure.
You're the same kid you were last week, right?
Hello.
Hey Rebecca.
I'm just sitting to talk to a friend.
Listen, I have something I want to check out.
I'll pick you up... in uh..
ten, fifty minutes?
Ok, great.
- You can hang out here for a while, alright.
- You trust me?
Yeah.
Yeah I do.
He came out of the teacher's lounge.
He was looking for someone.
There was another wing.
Right here.
- Maybe it was another hallway.
- This is the only hall with a trophy case.
Johnny, look
They haven't built it yet.
That's it.
The corridor in the vision isn't there now.
What are you getting in?
The shooting is not going to happen for years.
What do you mean we don't need the extra security?
The shooting isn't going to happen for years.
I don't understand.
How do you know?
There's a plan to build a new wing.
Sure, there's a plan.
But we haven't raised the money yet.
Construction is five years off at best.
One day it will be built... and the shooter is going to find his victim in that that wing.
I saw it.
You can get rid of the metal detectors, the security, all of it.
There's more than enough time to find this kid and help him... before he hurts anyone.
Even if you're right... now that's in place, this extra security is necessary in the future.
Your students are terrified.
Your school is a fortress.
Every kid who passes through the doors of my school could be the gunman.
- Or worse, one of his victims.
- Right.
I can't take the chance.
Especially now.
Everyone in Cleaves Mills knows that you...
Johnny Smith, the psychic who is never wrong warned me.
Mr Rowin.
Your security measures are causing more trouble than they're stopping.
Do you understand?
If you don't deal with the root cause of this violence, all the metal detectors in the world won't stop this kind of thing from happening.
Give me the name of the kid who's going to shoot up my school in the future that's a root cause I can do something about.
Even if I saw his face, he won't look anything like the shooter I saw.
He's a little kid now.
- He'd be what, nine or ten now?
- J.J.'s nine.
I'm not suggesting J.J.
There's lots of elementary kids at that show.
The vision might have come from one of them.
huh, fourth graders.
Mr. Smith would like to have a word with you.
Rest of class just take five.
I've got to tell you guys.
- That sounds is excellent.
- Thanks, Mr. Smith.
Now I'll call this huddle... because I wanna see how you guys feels about something.
I was wondering if you guys want a little miniature golf this weekend?
- Sure
- Awesome
- Really?
You have to ask your parents first.
And also to keep it real quiet.
- Thanks!
- Give me one.
Upper.
Down low.
Get out.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Get out.
You're never going to hurt anyone else again.
Johnny?
What's the matter?
I want you to go with Rebecca.
C'mon let's go to the library.
You can get any book you want.
What about the rest of rehearsal?
Mr. Talbot gets mad if we miss out.
You know what Zeke?
I'll talk to Mr. Talbot, ok?
Don't you worry about anything.
Now, "get out of here"!
Walt?
It's John.
I need you to check out a name for me.
No, it's not a student, it's a teacher.
It must be Mr.Talbot.
I guess there's some things even a metal detector can't keep out.
I just thought if I could start over some place new... some place where they didn't know what I'd done... it would be different.
You know, I could keep it under control.
You can change your name but not who you are.
I haven't done anything here
That's all my past.
You did a lot of awful things in Minnesota.
That's not going to happen here.
You're on a plane anyway to stand trial.
If you've done with him,
I want him out of here, away from our kids and behind bars, where he belongs.
Come on!
Let's go !
We just hired him last semester.
Did he...?
No.
- We were lucky.
- Yeah.
It looks like your shooting isn't going to happen after all.
So who was going to shoot up my school?
I'm not going to tell you that.
The kid deserves to have a normal childhood.
- Hello..
- Derek.
- Yeah.
- It's John.
- Ho, Hey!
- How's going my man?
- Staying out of trouble?
- Ate all your food, went through your drawers and set the house on fire.
Now I'm just doing some homeworks.
What's up?
I have just told to Principal Rowin, there's not going to be a shooting.
You're kidding.
Did they get the guy?
There is no guy.
Anymore.
- It's a long story.
- What about me?
Am I still public enemy number one?
I think you should come down and should talk to the Principal together.
If you take responsibility for what you did and apologize, I think I can get you back in class.
- That's all I wanted in the first place.
- Meet me in the principal's office... and put out the fire before you lock up.
You think I can just let these things slide?
- He assaulted a security guard...
- No!
He was defending a fellow student from a security guard who was using excessive force...
He triggered a false alarm.
A fake bomb is not a joke.
- He thouht he was making a statement.
- Look at this kid's file... he's a trouble maker.
Hey.
You!
Stop where you are.
Turn around.
NOW!
That's him.
That's the kid that blindsided me.
Look, Starsky and Hutch,
- I'm just here to talk to Principal Rowin....
- Ok, let's go.
- Get your hands off me...
- Watch him, he might be the shooter...
- Look, you don't believe me, call...
- Gun!
- Something wrong John?
- He's gonna shoot him.
The guards are going to shoot Derek.
Oh my god...
Unit one.
They aren't answering.
We've got to stop them.
Look, Starsky and Hutch,
- I'm just here to talk to Principal Rowin....
- Ok, let's go.
- Get your hands off me...
- Watch him, he might be the shooter...
- Look, you don't believe me, call...
- Gun!
Wait a minute, stop!
Guard!
Don't shoot.
Derek!
No!
- Derek
- He had a gun!
He shot me?
It was just a phone.
Call 911.
They responding?
It was just a phone!
Hang on Derek.
It gonna be OK.

My clients are willing to pay your price for the house... if you're willing to buy a home warranty, and repaint the interior.
Done.
- So when you due?
- Nine weeks.
- It's gonna be another girl.
- Ho.
My sister and I were just about as far apart in age as your daughters.
This will be a great house for two girls.
Congratulations.
You'll be really happy here.
Do you mind if I have a few minutes in the house?
- Sure.
We'll take a walk.
- Thanks.
Seeing those buyers, make me think of Rachel in this house... with a husband and children...
You're doing a great job, Rebecca.
It's a hard thing to get through.
It's good that a family is moving in.
Make this place happy, one again.
Just now that it's done, I feel kind of empty.
Hey.
You want to see a movie.
- Com'on..
Some Funny
- I have a prior commitment tonight.
But you're welcome to join me.
Ok.
Check out Lincoln.
How about that Abe Lincoln, huh?
So adorable.
You must be really proud.
Yeah.
We are.
Thank you all for coming down to the high school tonight!
- I'd like to invite you to meet our stars out of the lobby.
- If any of you are still awake.
A special thank-you to Mr. Talbot for bringing kids of all ages together in this production.
How about one more round of applause for our talented performers and musicians!
Good night.
What do you think?
So cute, I can't believe this.
What did you see?
The Dead Zone
- Saison 3 Episode 09 "Cycle Of Violence"
I don't know what triggered the vision.
When I was leaving the theater, I walk through a doorway that hundreds of people passed through.
Just tell us again what you saw.
It was during a school day.
I heard gunshots.
I look down the hallway.
And the students and the teachers, they were scared, they were screaming.
- It was like they was running away from someone.
- Did you see the shooter's face?
No but whoever he was, he was wearing a sweatshirt with a hood.
Then I saw him walking to this room.
I heard another gunshot.
- And then the vision ended.
- These things you see, they always come true?
Yes.
Mr Rowin, unless we do something to stop it, this shooting will happen.
Yeah.
We can't just sit around away for something that will happen.
We have to close the school tomorrow.
But that's a temporary until we can get security in place.
Guards, metal detectors, whatever it takes to guarantee the safety of these kids.
In the meantime, we've got to find this shooter.
- What else we have to go on John?
- I didn't get a good look at this personn.
Rebecca, you've worked with a lot of trouble kids.
Is there anything we should be looking for?
Well, this is a rare chance to save two people:
the victim and the kid who's going to shoot him.
By the time a kid picks up a gun, he may already be dead inside.
- There must be warning signs.
- Each kid is different, but there are some things to look for.
He'll probably expressing anger in other ways, vandalism or making threats, verbally or in writing.
Some kids posts their threats on a website.
Yes.
There is a second element that these kids have in common... and it might sounds obvious but he'll have easy access to a gun.
We're pulling missing gun reports.
The problem is there's a firearms out... and the parents just haven't secured properly.
Okay, we'll start by looking at every students who fit your profile.
I can think of a few suspects.
Most kids who fit the profile never act on their threats.
We have to start somewhere.
I think a locker search is appropriate.
Metal detectors aren't gonna help if the gun is here already.
Maybe something from one of the kid's lockers will help me identify this person.
In the meantime, we need to be discrete about this thing.
Yeah, we got to keep it low-key.
All we do, is to say that there's an unspecified threat...
- against the school, we shut it down tomorrow.
- Or it will be a cause of panic.
Tomorrow morning first, we search lockers.
After that, we interview every student who seems like he might do this kind of thing, and talk to their parents.
"The Complete Encyclopedia of Serial Killers"
Walt, 304.
We pre-screened the contents.
These are the most likely troublemakers.
- All these lockers?
- We thought we cast the wide net, let you do your thing.
Com'on.
Is it him?
I don't know.
But I can't rule him out.
Try this one.
We found a copy of "Soldier of Fortune" and a Marilyn Manson album.
These kinds of things aren't necessarily indicators.
Maybe not.
But we still have to try.
- I can't rule her out either.
- Why?
She likes burning pictures of her ex-boyfriend.
I did that.
She stays on the list.
Come on.
We got a lot of lockers to go though.
These one aren't suspects.
Maybe not, but... all of this kids have traumatic events ahead of them.
At this point, I can't rule anyone out.
Maybe the interviews will be more productive.
We should get start on those.
Who knows?
The shooter might be sitting in my outer office right now.
Mr. Fitz?
And Derek?
So Derek?
I understand... your sense of humor gets you in trouble sometimes.
Do you ever joke about damaging school property or getting back at a teacher for something...?
Only when I'm awake.
Sometimes I daydream about smashing things up.
So what?
- Do you daydream a lot?
- Do you?
- Derek?
- Did I say I have violent daydreams?
I misspoke.
I usually think about things like daisies, and fluffy bunnies.
I have nothing but love and respect for this institution.
Check out my 'blog if you want to know what I really think about.
- This is your web site?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Dereksworld at Maine blog dot com.
I'll be posting my daydreams about you later today.
Derek, show some respect.
I apologize for whatever my son has done.
- What are your feelings about school Lenora?
- Just another thing to put up with.
I mean, do this until I'm eighteen, work for forty years, marry, squeeze out some babies, divorce, then die.
Lenora!
- She's kidding.
- I'm not kidding.
I hope they close this place down for good.
Here's some condoms.
So there's something else at home that could suggests problems at school?
Is my son in some kind of trouble?
He had this book in his locker.
Charles?
You like this kind of book?
- I thought it was funny and weird...
- When you read these books, do you ever feel sorry for the victims?
- I don't know.
Never thought about it.
- What about the killers?
- What do you fell about them?
- They're freaks, man.
- Ed Gein used to wear human skin.
- Here you go.
Do you have a gun, Charles?
Are you going to make list of gun owners, now?
We're just trying to clear his name, Mr. Kolchak.
He's better than I was at his age.
Even has a kind of homework club.
Is that a four color pen?
- You might want to encourage him to do his own homework.
- Okay.
Thanks for coming in.
Drive safely.
Okay?
That's the last one.
Did you cross anybody off?
No, in fact I added a few names.
So, let's keep it closed for a couple more days.
Just keep looking.
Mr. Smith.
I can't close my school indefinitely waiting for you to find something.
We can't have twelve hundred students with no place to go.
The shooter is gonna find his victims at an arcade or mall just as easily.
At least here on campus we have some kind of control.
The new security is almost up and running.
We're opening school tomorrow.
These kids are really scared.
Just look.
That's not surprising.
I'm scared too.
Thanks for coming down.
Got any new leads?
Anything?
- No.
How about you?
- Not much.
A couple of more students came to our attention.
I was hoping you could talk to them.
One of them isin Mr. Talbot's class in the auditorium upstairs.
- Sure, we'll head up.
- Thanks.
- Mr. Smith?
- Hi, we need to speak to one of your students, Colin?
Colin?
The principal sent you after me.
- Didn't he?
- Yes, but he didn't say why.
It's not because of me.
It's because of my brother.
He got into the gang stuff.
Drugs, mostly.
My parents moved here so that I would have a chance, and even here, everyone looks at me like I'm a criminal.
I'm not!
I believe you.
- So how long have you been playing trumpet?
- Just started this year.
Can I check it out?
Do you have heard about the film"Malcom X"?
I think it should be required reading.
- Can I go back now?
- Sure.
Thanks.
Colin
Colin seems like a good kid.
All those kids we talked to, they could turn into shooters.
Or they could turn into doctors and lawyers.
It's hard to tell.
Until it's too late.
I need to see inside the bag.
- You didn't look in their bags.
- Son, you're not getting by until I see what you're carrying.
I just want to know why you singled me out and no one else.
I don't need a reason.
What do you have in there, anyway?
None of your business.
Then you're not coming in.
I'll be right back.
Give it back.
What are you hiding?
What's we got here?
I said give it back.
Knock it off!
Back off!
Now!
Get away from him.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
But that security guy was being a Nazi.
He singled me out for no reason
- He wouldn't have found anything in your backpack
- That's not the point.
The point is, he has no right.
I didn't do anything.
- Yeah.
- I got it.
You come with me.
- He was the one who got beaten up.
- He is a trouble maker.
############
Hey I want the book.
What are you looking at?
Derek, Johnny was just trying to keep you from getting hurt.
He did a great job, too.
They're sending me home...
"to think about the impact I have on my peers, and how I can fit in better. "
I got kicked out of school, once.
Some friends and I put out an unauthorized student newspaper.
Called "The Cleavage Mills Gazette".
No it was great.
Come on!
Hey, I was fourteen.
They were trying to institute mandatory drug tests at school.
We fought it.
Your web site kind of reminded me that.
Pretty gutsy.
- You read it?
- Yeah, I read it.
I really liked the essay that you wrote about the difference between education and indoctrination.
You're a talented writer.
Not that anybody around here gives a damn.
I'm just trying to keep things safe around here for everybody.
I'm not your enemy Derak?
Everybody knows you predicted something.
- What did you see?
- I can't tell you.
Why are they suspending you?
Supposedly for fighting.
I think the real reason is for questioning his rules... and what I said about the school on my 'blog'.
I'll talk to Principal Rowin.
You talking to the principal is what started all this.
I know that.
He refused to be searched.
Then he got in a fight.
If I don't suspend him it breeds disrespect for authority.
There are plenty of kids who have done much worse.
Derek will be the example that puts the others on notice.
Enforcing the rules unequaly will alsolutly breed disrespect for authority.
- You're just making things worse.
- Fine,
I'll let him off with a warning.
But if those bullets fly, parents will blame me.
There's a gunman in my school, and you haven't found him yet.
Have you?
Maybe we've already changed the future.
Maybe the shooting is not gonna happen now.
Yeah.
I hope so.
Is there some problem?
You alright?
I saw the shooter walk into the teacher's lounge.
He aimed his gun at three of the teachers, but didn't shoot, like he was waiting for something.
Do you think he's looking for someone in particular?
Possibly.
- The class change?
- Fire alarm.
On that door.
###########
We got a bomb threat.
- Who's locker is it?
- No ones.
It's supposed to be empty.
What's that.
" BOOM!
There go our rights. "
This is a prank.
I want to find this kid.
I want him out of my school, and I want him in jail.
- It's modeling clay.
- It's a terroristic threat.
We should be careful not to overreact to something like this.
Mr. Smith!
I set school policy.
I have to maintain order.
Touch it.
I know how your abilities work.
Go ahead.
I didn't see anything.
Maybe it'll come to you later.
First, you predict a shooting.
Now, we have a bomb scare.
- This is a prank.
- This is security breach.
We have to double our efforts.
I'm supposed to meet Principal Rowin.
You'll have to stand in line with everyone else.
- We have an appointment.
- I don't set the policy.
Hey, Colin
I.D.?
That's Ok..
They're with me.
Go ahead.
Sorry.
You're on the list.
Why?
Take that will you?
Turn around and let me search.
- You suck.
- What did you say?
Nothing.
You guys pointed out that enforcing the rules... unequaly with Derek Fitz would be unfair.
- Yes...
- You were right.
It was unfair to single him out.
So to be absolutly fair, I had no choice but to suspend everyone who refused to be searched.
Including Derek as thirty-one possible crimes, averted.
- You suspended thirty one students?
- Thirty-one potential shooters.
And I suspect anyone.
Hey!
A kid threw a bottle.
Who threw that?
Who threw that bottle?
Colin, you're allright?
I will not tolerate this.
This was an attack on a school employee.
Now, who threw the bottle?
Uh?
Who threw the bottle?
############
Go to hell.
What did you see?
The guard overreacted.
Colin was defending himself.
He's here to protect these students.
The kid resisted.
I saw what happened.
The guard was out of line.
We're going to have to agree to disagree on that point,
What I really want to know is who threw the bottle?
If it hadn't been for that bottle Colin might have been injured even worse.
- That guard should be fired.
- That's for me to decide.
- Who threw the bottle John?
- I can't help you with this.
I'm sorry.
- Why are we here?
- I want to talk to Derek.
He's the one who threw the bottle?
He pulled the locker stunt, too.
He reminds me a lot of myself at that age.
So you knew he was here because of your gift?
Because I've lived in Cleaves Mills all my life.
I'm looking for Derek Fitz.
You guys have seen him?
Thanks.
Hey.
Can't you just leave me alone?
Every time you get near me, bad things happen.
I just wanted to talk to you.
See if you could help us before things got out of hand.
- Little late for that.
- Derek I understand how you feel.
But now is not the time to bait the principal.
You know what I mean?
If no one stands up then they've won, haven't they?
If someone shoots up the school, we've all lost.
We're here because we're worried about you.
- You think I'm it.
You think I'm a psycho.
- No.
- You'd say the same thing if you did as if you didn't.
- No... it's not my think.
We just wanted to...
Just wanted to get me busted?
Derek, Derek!
That generated a lot of love and trust.
And goodwill.
- Was that Derek Fitz?
- Yes.
- I've got a warrant for him.
- Walt, listen.
He's angry, he's a smart ass but he's not your shooter.
I won't be so sure about that.
Even if you could guarantee me he would never shoot anyone,
I don't want a kid like that in my school.
I saw the fight.
And your guard used excessive force.
That kid was just defending himself.
Derek was just trying to help him.
- He's not a bad kid.
- That's not my opinion.
If he's willing to hurt someone who is armed and in uniform... imagine what else he's capable of.
I'm talking to the prosecutor's office about pressing criminal charges.
Wait a minute.
That's overkill.
Walt?
If the guard wants to press charges, my hands are tied.
I have to arrest him.
Derek?
What are you doing here?
They're looking all over for you.
I need to talk to you.
Yeah, come in.
Thanks, I was starving.
They got you throwing the bottle on the surveillance camera.
Damned.
I know that you were just trying to defend Colin.
I'll vouch for you.
But I think we should call your folks for...
I can't go home.
- Why not?
- I just can't.
My Dad will freak.
I wish I could wind back the clock three days.
I just want to go back to class.
I like it.
Even if sometimes I hate it.
Okay.
We can hang on here this afternoon.
I got something I got to sort out.
You said there were something you wanted to talk about?
Whatever it is, it stays right here between us.
Man to man.
Is there a chance...
Am I gonna shoots up the school?
Is that what you think?
I don't know what to think.
Last week I was an A- student with good prospects.
Now I'm expelled.
A fugitive.
I'd like to know for sure.
You're the same kid you were last week, right?
Hello.
Hey Rebecca.
I'm just sitting to talk to a friend.
Listen, I have something I want to check out.
I'll pick you up... in uh..
ten, fifty minutes?
Ok, great.
- You can hang out here for a while, alright.
- You trust me?
Yeah.
Yeah I do.
He came out of the teacher's lounge.
He was looking for someone.
There was another wing.
Right here.
- Maybe it was another hallway.
- This is the only hall with a trophy case.
Johnny, look
They haven't built it yet.
That's it.
The corridor in the vision isn't there now.
What are you getting in?
The shooting is not going to happen for years.
What do you mean we don't need the extra security?
The shooting isn't going to happen for years.
I don't understand.
How do you know?
There's a plan to build a new wing.
Sure, there's a plan.
But we haven't raised the money yet.
Construction is five years off at best.
One day it will be built... and the shooter is going to find his victim in that that wing.
I saw it.
You can get rid of the metal detectors, the security, all of it.
There's more than enough time to find this kid and help him... before he hurts anyone.
Even if you're right... now that's in place, this extra security is necessary in the future.
Your students are terrified.
Your school is a fortress.
Every kid who passes through the doors of my school could be the gunman.
- Or worse, one of his victims.
- Right.
I can't take the chance.
Especially now.
Everyone in Cleaves Mills knows that you...
Johnny Smith, the psychic who is never wrong warned me.
Mr Rowin.
Your security measures are causing more trouble than they're stopping.
Do you understand?
If you don't deal with the root cause of this violence, all the metal detectors in the world won't stop this kind of thing from happening.
Give me the name of the kid who's going to shoot up my school in the future that's a root cause I can do something about.
Even if I saw his face, he won't look anything like the shooter I saw.
He's a little kid now.
- He'd be what, nine or ten now?
- J.J.'s nine.
I'm not suggesting J.J.
There's lots of elementary kids at that show.
The vision might have come from one of them.
huh, fourth graders.
Mr. Smith would like to have a word with you.
Rest of class just take five.
I've got to tell you guys.
- That sounds is excellent.
- Thanks, Mr. Smith.
Now I'll call this huddle... because I wanna see how you guys feels about something.
I was wondering if you guys want a little miniature golf this weekend?
- Sure - Awesome
- Really?
You have to ask your parents first.
And also to keep it real quiet.
- Thanks!
- Give me one.
Upper.
Down low.
Get out.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Get out.
You're never going to hurt anyone else again.
Johnny?
What's the matter?
I want you to go with Rebecca.
C'mon let's go to the library.
You can get any book you want.
What about the rest of rehearsal?
Mr. Talbot gets mad if we miss out.
You know what Zeke?
I'll talk to Mr. Talbot, ok?
Don't you worry about anything.
Now, "get out of here"!
Walt?
It's John.
I need you to check out a name for me.
No, it's not a student, it's a teacher.
It must be Mr. Talbot.
I guess there's some things even a metal detector can't keep out.
I just thought if I could start over some place new... some place where they didn't know what I'd done... it would be different.
You know, I could keep it under control.
You can change your name but not who you are.
I haven't done anything here
That's all my past.
You did a lot of awful things in Minnesota.
That's not going to happen here.
You're on a plane anyway to stand trial.
If you've done with him,
I want him out of here, away from our kids and behind bars, where he belongs.
Come on!
Let's go!
We just hired him last semester.
Did he...?
No.
- We were lucky.
- Yeah.
It looks like your shooting isn't going to happen after all.
So who was going to shoot up my school?
I'm not going to tell you that.
The kid deserves to have a normal childhood.
- Hello..
- Derek.
- Yeah.
- It's John.
- Ho, Hey!
- How's going my man?
- Staying out of trouble?
- Ate all your food, went through your drawers and set the house on fire.
Now I'm just doing some homeworks.
What's up?
I have just told to Principal Rowin, there's not going to be a shooting.
You're kidding.
Did they get the guy?
There is no guy.
Anymore.
- It's a long story.
- What about me?
Am I still public enemy number one?
I think you should come down and should talk to the Principal together.
If you take responsibility for what you did and apologize, I think I can get you back in class.
- That's all I wanted in the first place.
- Meet me in the principal's office... and put out the fire before you lock up.
You think I can just let these things slide?
- He assaulted a security guard...
- No!
He was defending a fellow student from a security guard who was using excessive force...
He triggered a false alarm.
A fake bomb is not a joke.
- He thouht he was making a statement.
- Look at this kid's file... he's a trouble maker.
Hey.
You!
Stop where you are.
Turn around.
NOW!
That's him.
That's the kid that blindsided me.
Look, Starsky and Hutch,
- I'm just here to talk to Principal Rowin...
- Ok, let's go.
- Get your hands off me...
- Watch him, he might be the shooter...
- Look, you don't believe me, call...
- Gun!
- Something wrong John?
- He's gonna shoot him.
The guards are going to shoot Derek.
Oh my god...
Unit one.
They aren't answering.
We've got to stop them.
Look, Starsky and Hutch,
- I'm just here to talk to Principal Rowin...
- Ok, let's go.
- Get your hands off me...
- Watch him, he might be the shooter...
- Look, you don't believe me, call...
- Gun!
Wait a minute, stop!
Guard!
Don't shoot.
Derek!
No!
- Derek
- He had a gun!
He shot me?
It was just a phone.
Call 911.
They responding?
It was just a phone!
Hang on Derek.
It gonna be OK.

My clients are willing to pay your price for the house... if you're willing to buy a home warranty, and repaint the interior.
Done.
- So when you due?
- Nine weeks.
- It's gonna be another girl.
- Ho.
My sister and I were just about as far apart in age as your daughters.
This will be a great house for two girls.
Congratulations.
You'll be really happy here.
Do you mind if I have a few minutes in the house?
- Sure.
We'll take a walk.
- Thanks.
Seeing those buyers, make me think of Rachel in this house... with a husband and children...
You're doing a great job, Rebecca.
It's a hard thing to get through.
It's good that a family is moving in.
Make this place happy, one again.
Just now that it's done, I feel kind of empty.
Hey.
You want to see a movie.
- Com'on..
Some Funny
- I have a prior commitment tonight.
But you're welcome to join me.
Ok.
Check out Lincoln.
How about that Abe Lincoln, huh?
So adorable.
You must be really proud.
Yeah.
We are.
Thank you all for coming down to the high school tonight!
- I'd like to invite you to meet our stars out of the lobby.
- If any of you are still awake.
A special thank-you to Mr. Talbot for bringing kids of all ages together in this production.
How about one more round of applause for our talented performers and musicians!
Good night.
What do you think?
So cute, I can't believe this.
What did you see?
The Dead Zone
- Saison 3 Episode 09 "Cycle Of Violence"
I don't know what triggered the vision.
When I was leaving the theater, I walk through a doorway that hundreds of people passed through.
Just tell us again what you saw.
It was during a school day.
I heard gunshots.
I look down the hallway.
And the students and the teachers, they were scared, they were screaming.
- It was like they was running away from someone.
- Did you see the shooter's face?
No but whoever he was, he was wearing a sweatshirt with a hood.
Then I saw him walking to this room.
I heard another gunshot.
- And then the vision ended.
- These things you see, they always come true?
Yes.
Mr Rowin, unless we do something to stop it, this shooting will happen.
Yeah.
We can't just sit around away for something that will happen.
We have to close the school tomorrow.
But that's a temporary until we can get security in place.
Guards, metal detectors, whatever it takes to guarantee the safety of these kids.
In the meantime, we've got to find this shooter.
- What else we have to go on John?
- I didn't get a good look at this personn.
Rebecca, you've worked with a lot of trouble kids.
Is there anything we should be looking for?
Well, this is a rare chance to save two people:
the victim and the kid who's going to shoot him.
By the time a kid picks up a gun, he may already be dead inside.
- There must be warning signs.
- Each kid is different, but there are some things to look for.
He'll probably expressing anger in other ways, vandalism or making threats, verbally or in writing.
Some kids posts their threats on a website.
Yes.
There is a second element that these kids have in common... and it might sounds obvious but he'll have easy access to a gun.
We're pulling missing gun reports.
The problem is there's a firearms out... and the parents just haven't secured properly.
Okay, we'll start by looking at every students who fit your profile.
I can think of a few suspects.
Most kids who fit the profile never act on their threats.
We have to start somewhere.
I think a locker search is appropriate.
Metal detectors aren't gonna help if the gun is here already.
Maybe something from one of the kid's lockers will help me identify this person.
In the meantime, we need to be discrete about this thing.
Yeah, we got to keep it low-key.
All we do, is to say that there's an unspecified threat...
- against the school, we shut it down tomorrow.
- Or it will be a cause of panic.
Tomorrow morning first, we search lockers.
After that, we interview every student who seems like he might do this kind of thing, and talk to their parents.
"The Complete Encyclopedia of Serial Killers"
Walt, 304.
We pre-screened the contents.
These are the most likely troublemakers.
- All these lockers?
- We thought we cast the wide net, let you do your thing.
Com'on.
Is it him?
I don't know.
But I can't rule him out.
Try this one.
We found a copy of "Soldier of Fortune" and a Marilyn Manson album.
These kinds of things aren't necessarily indicators.
Maybe not.
But we still have to try.
- I can't rule her out either.
- Why ?
She likes burning pictures of her ex-boyfriend.
I did that.
She stays on the list.
Come on.
We got a lot of lockers to go though.
These one aren't suspects.
Maybe not, but... all of this kids have traumatic events ahead of them.
At this point, I can't rule anyone out.
Maybe the interviews will be more productive.
We should get start on those.
Who knows?
The shooter might be sitting in my outer office right now.
Mr. Fitz?
And Derek?
So Derek?
I understand... your sense of humor gets you in trouble sometimes.
Do you ever joke about damaging school property or getting back at a teacher for something...?
Only when I'm awake.
Sometimes I daydream about smashing things up.
So what?
- Do you daydream a lot?
- Do you?
- Derek?
- Did I say I have violent daydreams?
I misspoke.
I usually think about things like daisies, and fluffy bunnies.
I have nothing but love and respect for this institution.
Check out my 'blog if you want to know what I really think about.
- This is your web site?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Dereksworld at Maine blog dot com.
I'll be posting my daydreams about you later today.
Derek, show some respect.
I apologize for whatever my son has done.
- What are your feelings about school Lenora?
- Just another thing to put up with.
I mean, do this until I'm eighteen, work for forty years, marry, squeeze out some babies, divorce, then die.
Lenora!
- She's kidding.
- I'm not kidding.
I hope they close this place down for good.
Here's some condoms.
So there's something else at home that could suggests problems at school?
Is my son in some kind of trouble?
He had this book in his locker.
Charles?
You like this kind of book?
- I thought it was funny and weird...
- When you read these books, do you ever feel sorry for the victims?
- I don't know.
Never thought about it.
- What about the killers?
- What do you fell about them?
- They're freaks, man.
- Ed Gein used to wear human skin.
- Here you go.
Do you have a gun, Charles?
Are you going to make list of gun owners, now?
We're just trying to clear his name, Mr. Kolchak.
He's better than I was at his age.
Even has a kind of homework club.
Is that a four color pen?
- You might want to encourage him to do his own homework.
- Okay.
Thanks for coming in.
Drive safely.
Okay?
That's the last one.
Did you cross anybody off?
No, in fact I added a few names.
So, let's keep it closed for a couple more days.
Just keep looking.
Mr. Smith.
I can't close my school indefinitely waiting for you to find something.
We can't have twelve hundred students with no place to go.
The shooter is gonna find his victims at an arcade or mall just as easily.
At least here on campus we have some kind of control.
The new security is almost up and running.
We're opening school tomorrow.
These kids are really scared.
Just look.
That's not surprising.
I'm scared too.
Thanks for coming down.
Got any new leads?
Anything?
- No.
How about you?
- Not much.
A couple of more students came to our attention.
I was hoping you could talk to them.
One of them isin Mr. Talbot's class in the auditorium upstairs.
- Sure, we'll head up.
- Thanks.
- Mr. Smith?
- Hi, we need to speak to one of your students, Colin?
Colin?
The principal sent you after me.
- Didn't he?
- Yes, but he didn't say why.
It's not because of me.
It's because of my brother.
He got into the gang stuff.
Drugs, mostly.
My parents moved here so that I would have a chance, and even here, everyone looks at me like I'm a criminal.
I'm not!
I believe you.
- So how long have you been playing trumpet?
- Just started this year.
Can I check it out?
Do you have heard about the film"Malcom X"?
I think it should be required reading.
- Can I go back now?
- Sure.
Thanks.
Colin
Colin seems like a good kid.
All those kids we talked to, they could turn into shooters.
Or they could turn into doctors and lawyers.
It's hard to tell.
Until it's too late.
I need to see inside the bag.
- You didn't look in their bags.
- Son, you're not getting by until I see what you're carrying.
I just want to know why you singled me out and no one else.
I don't need a reason.
What do you have in there, anyway?
None of your business.
Then you're not coming in.
I'll be right back.
Give it back.
What are you hiding?
What's we got here?
I said give it back.
Knock it off!
Back off!
Now!
Get away from him.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
But that security guy was being a Nazi.
He singled me out for no reason
- He wouldn't have found anything in your backpack
- That's not the point.
The point is, he has no right.
I didn't do anything.
- Yeah.
- I got it.
You come with me.
- He was the one who got beaten up.
- He is a trouble maker.
############
Hey I want the book.
What are you looking at?
Derek, Johnny was just trying to keep you from getting hurt.
He did a great job, too.
They're sending me home...
"to think about the impact I have on my peers, and how I can fit in better."
I got kicked out of school, once.
Some friends and I put out an unauthorized student newspaper.
Called "The Cleavage Mills Gazette".
No it was great.
Come on!
Hey, I was fourteen.
They were trying to institute mandatory drug tests at school.
We fought it.
Your web site kind of reminded me that.
Pretty gutsy.
- You read it?
- Yeah, I read it.
I really liked the essay that you wrote about the difference between education and indoctrination.
You're a talented writer.
Not that anybody around here gives a damn.
I'm just trying to keep things safe around here for everybody .
I'm not your enemy Derak?
Everybody knows you predicted something.
- What did you see?
- I can't tell you.
Why are they suspending you?
Supposedly for fighting.
I think the real reason is for questioning his rules... and what I said about the school on my 'blog'.
I'll talk to Principal Rowin.
You talking to the principal is what started all this.
I know that.
He refused to be searched.
Then he got in a fight.
If I don't suspend him it breeds disrespect for authority.
There are plenty of kids who have done much worse.
Derek will be the example that puts the others on notice.
Enforcing the rules unequaly will alsolutly breed disrespect for authority.
- You're just making things worse.
- Fine,
I'll let him off with a warning.
But if those bullets fly, parents will blame me.
There's a gunman in my school, and you haven't found him yet.
Have you?
Maybe we've already changed the future.
Maybe the shooting is not gonna happen now.
Yeah.
I hope so.
Is there some problem?
You alright?
I saw the shooter walk into the teacher's lounge.
He aimed his gun at three of the teachers, but didn't shoot, like he was waiting for something.
Do you think he's looking for someone in particular?
Possibly.
- The class change?
- Fire alarm.
On that door.
###########
We got a bomb threat.
- Who's locker is it?
- No ones.
It's supposed to be empty.
What's that.
" BOOM !
There go our rights."
This is a prank.
I want to find this kid.
I want him out of my school, and I want him in jail.
- It's modeling clay.
- It's a terroristic threat.
We should be careful not to overreact to something like this.
Mr. Smith!
I set school policy.
I have to maintain order.
Touch it.
I know how your abilities work.
Go ahead.
I didn't see anything.
Maybe it'll come to you later.
First, you predict a shooting.
Now, we have a bomb scare.
- This is a prank.
- This is security breach.
We have to double our efforts.
I'm supposed to meet Principal Rowin.
You'll have to stand in line with everyone else.
- We have an appointment.
- I don't set the policy.
Hey, Colin
I.D.?
That's Ok..
They're with me.
Go ahead.
Sorry.
You're on the list.
Why?
Take that will you?
Turn around and let me search.
- You suck.
- What did you say?
Nothing.
You guys pointed out that enforcing the rules... unequaly with Derek Fitz would be unfair.
- Yes...
- You were right.
It was unfair to single him out.
So to be absolutly fair, I had no choice but to suspend everyone who refused to be searched.
Including Derek as thirty-one possible crimes, averted.
- You suspended thirty one students?
- Thirty-one potential shooters.
And I suspect anyone.
Hey!
A kid threw a bottle.
Who threw that?
Who threw that bottle?
Colin, you're allright?
I will not tolerate this.
This was an attack on a school employee.
Now, who threw the bottle?
Uh?
Who threw the bottle?
############
Go to hell.
What did you see?
The guard overreacted.
Colin was defending himself.
He's here to protect these students.
The kid resisted.
I saw what happened.
The guard was out of line.
We're going to have to agree to disagree on that point,
What I really want to know is who threw the bottle?
If it hadn't been for that bottle Colin might have been injured even worse.
- That guard should be fired.
- That's for me to decide.
- Who threw the bottle John?
- I can't help you with this.
I'm sorry.
- Why are we here?
- I want to talk to Derek.
He's the one who threw the bottle?
He pulled the locker stunt, too.
He reminds me a lot of myself at that age.
So you knew he was here because of your gift?
Because I've lived in Cleaves Mills all my life.
I'm looking for Derek Fitz.
You guys have seen him?
Thanks.
Hey.
Can't you just leave me alone?
Every time you get near me, bad things happen.
I just wanted to talk to you.
See if you could help us before things got out of hand.
- Little late for that.
- Derek I understand how you feel.
But now is not the time to bait the principal.
You know what I mean?
If no one stands up then they've won, haven't they?
If someone shoots up the school, we've all lost.
We're here because we're worried about you.
- You think I'm it.
You think I'm a psycho.
- No.
- You'd say the same thing if you did as if you didn't.
- No... it's not my think.
We just wanted to...
Just wanted to get me busted?
Derek, Derek!
That generated a lot of love and trust.
And goodwill.
- Was that Derek Fitz?
- Yes.
- I've got a warrant for him.
- Walt, listen.
He's angry, he's a smart ass but he's not your shooter.
I won't be so sure about that.
Even if you could guarantee me he would never shoot anyone,
I don't want a kid like that in my school.
I saw the fight.
And your guard used excessive force.
That kid was just defending himself.
Derek was just trying to help him.
- He's not a bad kid.
- That's not my opinion.
If he's willing to hurt someone who is armed and in uniform... imagine what else he's capable of.
I'm talking to the prosecutor's office about pressing criminal charges.
Wait a minute.
That's overkill.
Walt?
If the guard wants to press charges, my hands are tied.
I have to arrest him.
Derek?
What are you doing here?
They're looking all over for you.
I need to talk to you.
Yeah, come in.
Thanks, I was starving.
They got you throwing the bottle on the surveillance camera.
Damned.
I know that you were just trying to defend Colin.
I'll vouch for you.
But I think we should call your folks for...
I can't go home.
- Why not?
- I just can't.
My Dad will freak.
I wish I could wind back the clock three days.
I just want to go back to class.
I like it.
Even if sometimes I hate it.
Okay.
We can hang on here this afternoon.
I got something I got to sort out.
You said there were something you wanted to talk about?
Whatever it is, it stays right here between us.
Man to man.
Is there a chance...
Am I gonna shoots up the school?
Is that what you think?
I don't know what to think.
Last week I was an A- student with good prospects.
Now I'm expelled.
A fugitive.
I'd like to know for sure.
You're the same kid you were last week, right?
Hello.
Hey Rebecca.
I'm just sitting to talk to a friend.
Listen, I have something I want to check out.
I'll pick you up... in uh..
ten, fifty minutes?
Ok, great.
- You can hang out here for a while, alright.
- You trust me?
Yeah.
Yeah I do.
He came out of the teacher's lounge.
He was looking for someone.
There was another wing.
Right here.
- Maybe it was another hallway.
- This is the only hall with a trophy case.
Johnny, look
They haven't built it yet.
That's it.
The corridor in the vision isn't there now.
What are you getting in?
The shooting is not going to happen for years.
What do you mean we don't need the extra security?
The shooting isn't going to happen for years.
I don't understand.
How do you know?
There's a plan to build a new wing.
Sure, there's a plan.
But we haven't raised the money yet.
Construction is five years off at best.
One day it will be built... and the shooter is going to find his victim in that that wing.
I saw it.
You can get rid of the metal detectors, the security, all of it.
There's more than enough time to find this kid and help him... before he hurts anyone.
Even if you're right... now that's in place, this extra security is necessary in the future.
Your students are terrified.
Your school is a fortress.
Every kid who passes through the doors of my school could be the gunman.
- Or worse, one of his victims.
- Right.
I can't take the chance.
Especially now.
Everyone in Cleaves Mills knows that you...
Johnny Smith, the psychic who is never wrong warned me.
Mr Rowin.
Your security measures are causing more trouble than they're stopping.
Do you understand?
If you don't deal with the root cause of this violence, all the metal detectors in the world won't stop this kind of thing from happening.
Give me the name of the kid who's going to shoot up my school in the future that's a root cause I can do something about.
Even if I saw his face, he won't look anything like the shooter I saw.
He's a little kid now.
- He'd be what, nine or ten now?
- J.J.'s nine.
I'm not suggesting J.J.
There's lots of elementary kids at that show.
The vision might have come from one of them.
huh, fourth graders.
Mr. Smith would like to have a word with you.
Rest of class just take five.
I've got to tell you guys.
- That sounds is excellent.
- Thanks, Mr. Smith.
Now I'll call this huddle... because I wanna see how you guys feels about something.
I was wondering if you guys want a little miniature golf this weekend?
- Sure
- Awesome
- Really?
You have to ask your parents first.
And also to keep it real quiet.
- Thanks!
- Give me one.
Upper.
Down low.
Get out.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Get out.
You're never going to hurt anyone else again.
Johnny?
What's the matter?
I want you to go with Rebecca.
C'mon let's go to the library.
You can get any book you want.
What about the rest of rehearsal?
Mr. Talbot gets mad if we miss out.
You know what Zeke?
I'll talk to Mr. Talbot, ok?
Don't you worry about anything.
Now, "get out of here"!
Walt?
It's John.
I need you to check out a name for me.
No, it's not a student, it's a teacher.
It must be Mr.Talbot.
I guess there's some things even a metal detector can't keep out.
I just thought if I could start over some place new... some place where they didn't know what I'd done... it would be different.
You know, I could keep it under control.
You can change your name but not who you are.
I haven't done anything here
That's all my past.
You did a lot of awful things in Minnesota.
That's not going to happen here.
You're on a plane anyway to stand trial.
If you've done with him,
I want him out of here, away from our kids and behind bars, where he belongs.
Come on!
Let's go !
We just hired him last semester.
Did he...?
No.
- We were lucky.
- Yeah.
It looks like your shooting isn't going to happen after all.
So who was going to shoot up my school?
I'm not going to tell you that.
The kid deserves to have a normal childhood.
- Hello..
- Derek.
- Yeah.
- It's John.
- Ho, Hey!
- How's going my man?
- Staying out of trouble?
- Ate all your food, went through your drawers and set the house on fire.
Now I'm just doing some homeworks.
What's up?
I have just told to Principal Rowin, there's not going to be a shooting.
You're kidding.
Did they get the guy?
There is no guy.
Anymore.
- It's a long story.
- What about me?
Am I still public enemy number one?
I think you should come down and should talk to the Principal together.
If you take responsibility for what you did and apologize, I think I can get you back in class.
- That's all I wanted in the first place.
- Meet me in the principal's office... and put out the fire before you lock up.
You think I can just let these things slide?
- He assaulted a security guard...
- No!
He was defending a fellow student from a security guard who was using excessive force...
He triggered a false alarm.
A fake bomb is not a joke.
- He thouht he was making a statement.
- Look at this kid's file... he's a trouble maker.
Hey.
You!
Stop where you are.
Turn around.
NOW!
That's him.
That's the kid that blindsided me.
Look, Starsky and Hutch,
- I'm just here to talk to Principal Rowin....
- Ok, let's go.
- Get your hands off me...
- Watch him, he might be the shooter...
- Look, you don't believe me, call...
- Gun!
- Something wrong John?
- He's gonna shoot him.
The guards are going to shoot Derek.
Oh my god...
Unit one.
They aren't answering.
We've got to stop them.
Look, Starsky and Hutch,
- I'm just here to talk to Principal Rowin....
- Ok, let's go.
- Get your hands off me...
- Watch him, he might be the shooter...
- Look, you don't believe me, call...
- Gun!
Wait a minute, stop!
Guard!
Don't shoot.
Derek!
No!
- Derek
- He had a gun!
He shot me?
It was just a phone.
Call 911.
They responding?
It was just a phone!
Hang on Derek.
It gonna be OK.

- Nine weeks.

- Ho.
My sister and I were just about as far apart in age as your daughters.
This will be a great house for two girls.
Congratulations.
You'll be really happy here.
Do you mind if I have a few minutes in the house?
- Sure.
We'll take a walk.
- Thanks.

I heard another gunshot.
- And then the vision ended.
- These things you see, they always come true?
Yes.
Mr Rowin, unless we do something to stop it, this shooting will happen.
Yeah.
We can't just sit around away for something that will happen.
We have to close the school tomorrow.
But that's a temporary until we can get security in place.
Guards, metal detectors, whatever it takes to guarantee the safety of these kids.
In the meantime, we've got to find this shooter.
- What else we have to go on John?
- I didn't get a good look at this personn.
Rebecca, you've worked with a lot of trouble kids.

Well, this is a rare chance to save two people:

Okay, we'll start by looking at every students who fit your profile.
I can think of a few suspects.
Most kids who fit the profile never act on their threats.
We have to start somewhere.
I think a locker search is appropriate.
Metal detectors aren't gonna help if the gun is here already.
Maybe something from one of the kid's lockers will help me identify this person.
In the meantime, we need to be discrete about this thing.
Yeah, we got to keep it low-key.
All we do, is to say that there's an unspecified threat...
- against the school, we shut it down tomorrow.
- Or it will be a cause of panic.
Tomorrow morning first, we search lockers.
After that, we interview every student who seems like he might do this kind of thing, and talk to their parents.

- All these lockers?
- We thought we cast the wide net, let you do your thing.
Com'on.
Is it him?
I don't know.
But I can't rule him out.
Try this one.
We found a copy of "Soldier of Fortune" and a Marilyn Manson album.
These kinds of things aren't necessarily indicators.
Maybe not.
But we still have to try.
- I can't rule her out either.
- Why ?
She likes burning pictures of her ex-boyfriend.
I did that.
She stays on the list.
Come on.
We got a lot of lockers to go though.
These one aren't suspects.
Maybe not, but... all of this kids have traumatic events ahead of them.
At this point, I can't rule anyone out.
Maybe the interviews will be more productive.
We should get start on those.
Who knows?
The shooter might be sitting in my outer office right now.
Mr. Fitz?
And Derek?
So Derek?
I understand... your sense of humor gets you in trouble sometimes.
Do you ever joke about damaging school property or getting back at a teacher for something...?
Only when I'm awake.
Sometimes I daydream about smashing things up.
So what?
- Do you daydream a lot?
- Do you?
- Derek?
- Did I say I have violent daydreams?
I misspoke.
I usually think about things like daisies, and fluffy bunnies.
I have nothing but love and respect for this institution.
Check out my 'blog if you want to know what I really think about.
- This is your web site?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Dereksworld at Maine blog dot com.
I'll be posting my daydreams about you later today.
Derek, show some respect.
I apologize for whatever my son has done.
- What are your feelings about school Lenora?
- Just another thing to put up with.
I mean, do this until I'm eighteen, work for forty years, marry, squeeze out some babies, divorce, then die.
Lenora!
- She's kidding.
- I'm not kidding.
I hope they close this place down for good.
Here's some condoms.
So there's something else at home that could suggests problems at school?
Is my son in some kind of trouble?
He had this book in his locker.
Charles?
You like this kind of book?
- I thought it was funny and weird...
- When you read these books, do you ever feel sorry for the victims?
- I don't know.
Never thought about it.
- What about the killers?
- What do you fell about them?
- They're freaks, man.
- Ed Gein used to wear human skin.
- Here you go.
Do you have a gun, Charles?
Are you going to make list of gun owners, now?
We're just trying to clear his name, Mr. Kolchak.
He's better than I was at his age.
Even has a kind of homework club.
Is that a four color pen?
- You might want to encourage him to do his own homework.
- Okay.
Thanks for coming in.
Drive safely.
Okay?
That's the last one.
Did you cross anybody off?
No, in fact I added a few names.
So, let's keep it closed for a couple more days.
Just keep looking.
Mr. Smith.
I can't close my school indefinitely waiting for you to find something.
We can't have twelve hundred students with no place to go.
The shooter is gonna find his victims at an arcade or mall just as easily.
At least here on campus we have some kind of control.
The new security is almost up and running.
We're opening school tomorrow.
These kids are really scared.
Just look.
That's not surprising.
I'm scared too.
Thanks for coming down.
Got any new leads?
Anything?
- No.
How about you?
- Not much.
A couple of more students came to our attention.
I was hoping you could talk to them.
One of them isin Mr. Talbot's class in the auditorium upstairs.
- Sure, we'll head up.
- Thanks.
- Mr. Smith?
- Hi, we need to speak to one of your students, Colin?
Colin?
The principal sent you after me.
- Didn't he?
- Yes, but he didn't say why.
It's not because of me.
It's because of my brother.
He got into the gang stuff.
Drugs, mostly.
My parents moved here so that I would have a chance, and even here, everyone looks at me like I'm a criminal.
I'm not!
I believe you.
- So how long have you been playing trumpet?
- Just started this year.
Can I check it out?
Do you have heard about the film"Malcom X"?
I think it should be required reading.
- Can I go back now?
- Sure.
Thanks.
Colin
Colin seems like a good kid.
All those kids we talked to, they could turn into shooters.
Or they could turn into doctors and lawyers.
It's hard to tell.
Until it's too late.
I need to see inside the bag.
- You didn't look in their bags.
- Son, you're not getting by until I see what you're carrying.
I just want to know why you singled me out and no one else.
I don't need a reason.
What do you have in there, anyway?
None of your business.
Then you're not coming in.
I'll be right back.
Give it back.
What are you hiding?
What's we got here?
I said give it back.
Knock it off!
Back off!
Now!
Get away from him.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
But that security guy was being a Nazi.
He singled me out for no reason
- He wouldn't have found anything in your backpack
- That's not the point.
The point is, he has no right.
I didn't do anything.
- Yeah.
- I got it.
You come with me.
- He was the one who got beaten up.
- He is a trouble maker.
############
Hey I want the book.
What are you looking at?
Derek, Johnny was just trying to keep you from getting hurt.
He did a great job, too.
They're sending me home...
"to think about the impact I have on my peers, and how I can fit in better."
I got kicked out of school, once.
Some friends and I put out an unauthorized student newspaper.
Called "The Cleavage Mills Gazette".
No it was great.
Come on!
Hey, I was fourteen.
They were trying to institute mandatory drug tests at school.
We fought it.
Your web site kind of reminded me that.
Pretty gutsy.
- You read it?
- Yeah, I read it.
I really liked the essay that you wrote about the difference between education and indoctrination.
You're a talented writer.
Not that anybody around here gives a damn.
I'm just trying to keep things safe around here for everybody .
I'm not your enemy Derak?
Everybody knows you predicted something.
- What did you see?
- I can't tell you.
Why are they suspending you?
Supposedly for fighting.
I think the real reason is for questioning his rules... and what I said about the school on my 'blog'.
I'll talk to Principal Rowin.
You talking to the principal is what started all this.
I know that.
He refused to be searched.
Then he got in a fight.
If I don't suspend him it breeds disrespect for authority.
There are plenty of kids who have done much worse.
Derek will be the example that puts the others on notice.
Enforcing the rules unequaly will alsolutly breed disrespect for authority.
- You're just making things worse.
- Fine,
I'll let him off with a warning.
But if those bullets fly, parents will blame me.
There's a gunman in my school, and you haven't found him yet.
Have you?
Maybe we've already changed the future.
Maybe the shooting is not gonna happen now.
Yeah.
I hope so.
Is there some problem?
You alright?
I saw the shooter walk into the teacher's lounge.
He aimed his gun at three of the teachers, but didn't shoot, like he was waiting for something.
Do you think he's looking for someone in particular?
Possibly.
- The class change?
- Fire alarm.
On that door.
###########
We got a bomb threat.
- Who's locker is it?
- No ones.
It's supposed to be empty.
What's that.
" BOOM !
There go our rights."
This is a prank.
I want to find this kid.
I want him out of my school, and I want him in jail.
- It's modeling clay.
- It's a terroristic threat.
We should be careful not to overreact to something like this.
Mr. Smith!
I set school policy.
I have to maintain order.
Touch it.
I know how your abilities work.
Go ahead.
I didn't see anything.
Maybe it'll come to you later.
First, you predict a shooting.
Now, we have a bomb scare.
- This is a prank.
- This is security breach.
We have to double our efforts.
I'm supposed to meet Principal Rowin.
You'll have to stand in line with everyone else.
- We have an appointment.
- I don't set the policy.
Hey, Colin
I.D.?
That's Ok..
They're with me.
Go ahead.
Sorry.
You're on the list.
Why?
Take that will you?
Turn around and let me search.
- You suck.
- What did you say?
Nothing.
You guys pointed out that enforcing the rules... unequaly with Derek Fitz would be unfair.
- Yes...
- You were right.
It was unfair to single him out.
So to be absolutly fair, I had no choice but to suspend everyone who refused to be searched.
Including Derek as thirty-one possible crimes, averted.
- You suspended thirty one students?
- Thirty-one potential shooters.
And I suspect anyone.
Hey!
A kid threw a bottle.
Who threw that?
Who threw that bottle?
Colin, you're allright?
I will not tolerate this.
This was an attack on a school employee.
Now, who threw the bottle?
Uh?
Who threw the bottle?
############
Go to hell.
What did you see?
The guard overreacted.
Colin was defending himself.
He's here to protect these students.
The kid resisted.
I saw what happened.
The guard was out of line.
We're going to have to agree to disagree on that point,
What I really want to know is who threw the bottle?
If it hadn't been for that bottle Colin might have been injured even worse.
- That guard should be fired.
- That's for me to decide.
- Who threw the bottle John?
- I can't help you with this.
I'm sorry.
- Why are we here?
- I want to talk to Derek.
He's the one who threw the bottle?
He pulled the locker stunt, too.
He reminds me a lot of myself at that age.
So you knew he was here because of your gift?
Because I've lived in Cleaves Mills all my life.
I'm looking for Derek Fitz.
You guys have seen him?
Thanks.
Hey.
Can't you just leave me alone?
Every time you get near me, bad things happen.
I just wanted to talk to you.
See if you could help us before things got out of hand.
- Little late for that.
- Derek I understand how you feel.
But now is not the time to bait the principal.
You know what I mean?
If no one stands up then they've won, haven't they?
If someone shoots up the school, we've all lost.
We're here because we're worried about you.
- You think I'm it.
You think I'm a psycho.
- No.
- You'd say the same thing if you did as if you didn't.
- No... it's not my think.
We just wanted to...
Just wanted to get me busted?
Derek, Derek!
That generated a lot of love and trust.
And goodwill.
- Was that Derek Fitz?
- Yes.
- I've got a warrant for him.
- Walt, listen.
He's angry, he's a smart ass but he's not your shooter.
I won't be so sure about that.
Even if you could guarantee me he would never shoot anyone,
I don't want a kid like that in my school.
I saw the fight.
And your guard used excessive force.
That kid was just defending himself.
Derek was just trying to help him.
- He's not a bad kid.
- That's not my opinion.
If he's willing to hurt someone who is armed and in uniform... imagine what else he's capable of.
I'm talking to the prosecutor's office about pressing criminal charges.
Wait a minute.
That's overkill.
Walt?
If the guard wants to press charges, my hands are tied.
I have to arrest him.
Derek?
What are you doing here?
They're looking all over for you.
I need to talk to you.
Yeah, come in.
Thanks, I was starving.
They got you throwing the bottle on the surveillance camera.
Damned.
I know that you were just trying to defend Colin.
I'll vouch for you.
But I think we should call your folks for...
I can't go home.
- Why not?
- I just can't.
My Dad will freak.
I wish I could wind back the clock three days.
I just want to go back to class.
I like it.
Even if sometimes I hate it.
Okay.
We can hang on here this afternoon.
I got something I got to sort out.
You said there were something you wanted to talk about?
Whatever it is, it stays right here between us.
Man to man.
Is there a chance...
Am I gonna shoots up the school?
Is that what you think?
I don't know what to think.
Last week I was an A- student with good prospects.
Now I'm expelled.
A fugitive.
I'd like to know for sure.
You're the same kid you were last week, right?
Hello.
Hey Rebecca.
I'm just sitting to talk to a friend.
Listen, I have something I want to check out.
I'll pick you up... in uh..
ten, fifty minutes?
Ok, great.
- You can hang out here for a while, alright.
- You trust me?
Yeah.
Yeah I do.
He came out of the teacher's lounge.
He was looking for someone.
There was another wing.
Right here.
- Maybe it was another hallway.
- This is the only hall with a trophy case.
Johnny, look
They haven't built it yet.
That's it.
The corridor in the vision isn't there now.
What are you getting in?
The shooting is not going to happen for years.
What do you mean we don't need the extra security?
The shooting isn't going to happen for years.
I don't understand.
How do you know?
There's a plan to build a new wing.
Sure, there's a plan.
But we haven't raised the money yet.
Construction is five years off at best.
One day it will be built... and the shooter is going to find his victim in that that wing.
I saw it.
You can get rid of the metal detectors, the security, all of it.
There's more than enough time to find this kid and help him... before he hurts anyone.
Even if you're right... now that's in place, this extra security is necessary in the future.
Your students are terrified.
Your school is a fortress.
Every kid who passes through the doors of my school could be the gunman.
- Or worse, one of his victims.
- Right.
I can't take the chance.
Especially now.
Everyone in Cleaves Mills knows that you...
Johnny Smith, the psychic who is never wrong warned me.
Mr Rowin.
Your security measures are causing more trouble than they're stopping.
Do you understand?
If you don't deal with the root cause of this violence, all the metal detectors in the world won't stop this kind of thing from happening.
Give me the name of the kid who's going to shoot up my school in the future that's a root cause I can do something about.
Even if I saw his face, he won't look anything like the shooter I saw.
He's a little kid now.
- He'd be what, nine or ten now?
- J.J.'s nine.
I'm not suggesting J.J.
There's lots of elementary kids at that show.
The vision might have come from one of them.
huh, fourth graders.
Mr. Smith would like to have a word with you.
Rest of class just take five.
I've got to tell you guys.
- That sounds is excellent.
- Thanks, Mr. Smith.
Now I'll call this huddle... because I wanna see how you guys feels about something.
I was wondering if you guys want a little miniature golf this weekend?
- Sure
- Awesome
- Really?
You have to ask your parents first.
And also to keep it real quiet.
- Thanks!
- Give me one.
Upper.
Down low.
Get out.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Get out.
You're never going to hurt anyone else again.
Johnny?
What's the matter?
I want you to go with Rebecca.
C'mon let's go to the library.
You can get any book you want.
What about the rest of rehearsal?
Mr. Talbot gets mad if we miss out.
You know what Zeke?
I'll talk to Mr. Talbot, ok?
Don't you worry about anything.
Now, "get out of here"!
Walt?
It's John.
I need you to check out a name for me.
No, it's not a student, it's a teacher.
It must be Mr.Talbot.
I guess there's some things even a metal detector can't keep out.
I just thought if I could start over some place new... some place where they didn't know what I'd done... it would be different.
You know, I could keep it under control.
You can change your name but not who you are.
I haven't done anything here
That's all my past.
You did a lot of awful things in Minnesota.
That's not going to happen here.
You're on a plane anyway to stand trial.
If you've done with him,
I want him out of here, away from our kids and behind bars, where he belongs.
Come on!
Let's go !
We just hired him last semester.
Did he...?
No.
- We were lucky.
- Yeah.
It looks like your shooting isn't going to happen after all.
So who was going to shoot up my school?
I'm not going to tell you that.
The kid deserves to have a normal childhood.
- Hello..
- Derek.
- Yeah.
- It's John.
- Ho, Hey!
- How's going my man?
- Staying out of trouble?
- Ate all your food, went through your drawers and set the house on fire.
Now I'm just doing some homeworks.
What's up?
I have just told to Principal Rowin, there's not going to be a shooting.
You're kidding.
Did they get the guy?
There is no guy.
Anymore.
- It's a long story.
- What about me?
Am I still public enemy number one?
I think you should come down and should talk to the Principal together.
If you take responsibility for what you did and apologize, I think I can get you back in class.
- That's all I wanted in the first place.
- Meet me in the principal's office... and put out the fire before you lock up.
You think I can just let these things slide?
- He assaulted a security guard...
- No!
He was defending a fellow student from a security guard who was using excessive force...
He triggered a false alarm.
A fake bomb is not a joke.
- He thouht he was making a statement.
- Look at this kid's file... he's a trouble maker.
Hey.
You!
Stop where you are.
Turn around.
NOW!
That's him.
That's the kid that blindsided me.
Look, Starsky and Hutch,
- I'm just here to talk to Principal Rowin....
- Ok, let's go.
- Get your hands off me...
- Watch him, he might be the shooter...
- Look, you don't believe me, call...
- Gun!
- Something wrong John?
- He's gonna shoot him.
The guards are going to shoot Derek.
Oh my god...
Unit one.
They aren't answering.
We've got to stop them.
Look, Starsky and Hutch,
- I'm just here to talk to Principal Rowin....
- Ok, let's go.
- Get your hands off me...
- Watch him, he might be the shooter...
- Look, you don't believe me, call...
- Gun!
Wait a minute, stop!
Guard!
Don't shoot.
Derek!
No!
- Derek
- He had a gun!
He shot me?
It was just a phone.
Call 911.
They responding?
It was just a phone!
Hang on Derek.
It gonna be OK.

Once upon a time...
My name is Yuki.
I was born amidst a riot.
That was the day my destiny was decided.
Help, please help me!
Hey, try not to cause a big commotion, eh?
What the hell?
Freeze!
Hey... hey!
SAMURAI CHICKS
Hello.
That'll be 924 yen.
Here's your change of 76 yen.
Thank you very much.
Yuki?
Hey, it is Yuki.
I didn't know you were out here in Tokyo.
You don't remember me, huh?
I'm Nakamura.
I used to live behind you...
How have you been doing?
- Man, you're all so grown up now.
- You've got the wrong person.
- Man, you're all so grown up now.
I was born on an island in the south.
It was once a great trading port a kingdom of peace.
One year ago I was still a normal student at the Orion Dancers' Academy.
They specialized in raising future stars.
Put your back into it.
All right, girls.
Stop there for a bit.
My name is Abe and I am an instructor from the expert program.
Step forward when I call your name.
Yuki Nakata!
Yes.
Step forward.
Your normal program is done as of today.
Due to your outstanding performance you've been chosen to be one of the four selected.
We'll start the expert program tomorrow.
Be prepared.
Yes, sir.
That is all.
Congratulations, Yuki!
Congratulations!
Thanks.
Ready...
- Let me join, too.
- Sure.
From this part, then.
Did practice start already?
Oh, but the instructor's not here yet.
I'm safe, right.
Phew, that was close.
Hey!
Saki!
You got picked, too!
Congrats!
Thanks!
You too, Mickey!
Honestly I wasn't too sure for a while there.
We're the four chosen ones, huh.
So who's who?
Oh yeah...
You're such a spazz.
I'm Aki.
I'm Mickey and this bimbo here is Saki.
What's your name?
Oh yes, I'm Yuki.
Come on, no formal talk.
We're gonna be hanging out from now on.
Nice to meet'ya.
Nice to meet'ya.
- Pleased to meet you all.
- You're doing it again.
It's Miss Cocoe!
It's totally Miss Cocoe!
What are you doing here, Miss Cocoe?
Are you sure these are the four?
That'll be the last smile you get.
You'll be in the expert program starting today.
You will abandon all emotion from now on.
K-ing-dom.
K-ing-dom.
K-ing-dom.
K-ing-dom.
K-ing-dom.
K-ing-dom.
The Orion Dancers' Academy's expert program was a program to train spies.
Spies were developed so the Kingdom could gain independence from Japan.
I told you to abandon all emotion.
Instructor Abe I will be greeting the principal and returning to Tokyo.
We're counting on you.
Okay.
We shall begin your lessons.
Yes, sir.
That was the day we threw everything away in order to become the greatest spies ever.
In-
In-de-
In-de-pen-
In-de-pen-dence.
Encryption.
Weaponry.
Martial arts.
Camouflage.
These were some of the special classes we had everyday.
Your dancing is our propaganda!
- Tri-bal self-determination.
- Tri-bal self-determination.
- To be like Cocoe.
That was what kept us going through the vigorous training.
They all pass...
Yuki...
Aki...
Saki...
Mickey.
The growth you four have shown this past year is incredible.
You have shown the results that Abe has expected.
Therefore, you will be debuting earlier than the other students.
Go to Tokyo and help Cocoe with her duties.
But don't let your guard down.
The real battlefield is far more intense than this.
The duty you hold is an important part of the plan, too gain the Kingdom's independence.
Ignorance is sin.
Take a good hard look at history.
That way, you will be forced to remember the bitter and hard suffering of the past.
And we headed out to Tokyo.
Head-to-Roppongi-tunnel
Kintaro Migihara, head of national security. 173cm tall, 66kg, blood type B an Aquarius.
He's the target of this mission.
Well?
Yes, it still feels a little strange, but...
I'm not talking about your arm.
I'm talking about those damn terrorists.
Yes, pardon me, sir.
Are you getting anywhere?
Yes, well, I have been in the hospital the last 6 months, too, and...
I don't want any excuses.
I'm tired of them.
What did I pass that anti-subversive activities act for?
I made it easier for you to do your stuff.
Use that new law the new citizen's log or whatever it was to find all of the supporters of the Kingdom in Tokyo.
Yes, sir.
In the name of justice, we can't let those terrorists continue to do what they want.
Yes sir.
We have already started a plan to take care of that as well...
We've got to make that entire area a specially appointed zone expand the base's territory and have the American army keep a close watch over them.
Absolutely, sir.
Kuroiwa...
Take a look around.
It's like we're in Europe or the U.S.
Absolutely, sir.
We've gotta start cleaning this area up, too.
Absolutely, sir.
Anything unclean is bad for society.
Absolutely, sir.
You!
National Security
Just you wait...
You freaks!
One deer down!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom, listen!
I was accepted into the academy!
I got into the academy in first place!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom?
When I was 12 part of an army plane hit my mother and killed her.
Be-hind you
Our mole inside the government obtained this film.
Long live the Kingdom!
They say Saki died without saying a thing, no matter what they did to her.
...and?
Did you come all the way to tell us that?
Well I will be returning to the Kingdom.
I smell something fishy going around at the academy.
I was wondering if you all would like to return with me.
- Who will take over our duties in Tokyo?
- You need not worry about that.
Is this because we've failed?
No.
You are all competent.
The president and Cocoe both have acknowledged your abilities.
We are hoping you will take part in developing the new generation.
We're still in the middle of a mission.
Can you do it with just the 3 of you?
We can.
Not by force, but I wanted to confirm your feelings.
I don't want to retire yet.
I can continue even if I lose an arm or a leg.
You're right.
You will be the only ones left to protect Cocoe.
Yes, sir.
And hang onto this until I return.
'Use all instruments as weapons'.
Right?
Here's your change of 76 yen.
Thank you very much.
Hey, you!
Um I'm part of a dance team.
There's an event we're going to be a part of.
You can come if you like.
You're a dancer too, right?
You should come.
...according to reports, there have been no sign of fire.
It's believed to have been caused by an accidental spark igniting the gas within the building.
The body identified as Orion Dancers' Academy president Shoukichi Ohta as well as a dozen other instructors and students have been found.
The police are still identifying them.
Please stand by.
Aki.
What are we gonna do?
We just wait for the next order.
There's no order coming.
That's an unusually wimpy thing for you to say.
Maybe we should go back to the Kingdom.
We can't leave Cocoe alone.
But...
We don't even know if Cocoe...
We're still in the middle of a mission.
Don't forget that.
Even if the academy is really gone there's going to be a second, and a third academy.
I don't want Saki's death to go to waste.
...you're right.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I didn't know what I was saying...
Careful!
Yuki!
Yuki, they're coming.
Hurry.
Hurry.
Run.
Follow them.
They've run into the tunnel.
Consider them like wounded wolf bitches... be careful.
Let's go, Yuki.
Yuki!
Yuki, can you get up?
Are you all right?
Mickey, take care of her.
Hurry, go!
Over there!
Mickey.
We should be okay out here.
Let's wait it out a while.
Please... go...
Just go...
No.
I don't want to leave any more of my friends.
Saki... and Aki...
Don't worry.
I'll think of something.
Mom...
I'm gonna die, aren't I?
Hey Namba, it's closing time already.
- Oh, yeah.
- Thanks guys.
Come on, they're closing.
Let's go.
Thanks for the food.
Thanks.
Hey, be careful, eh?
- Come again.
Thanks!
- See ya.
Ms. Toyo?
What's wrong?
Is she hurt?
Oh man, I'll call an ambulance.
You don't want me to, eh...
Now I get why she tried to pretend she was someone else that other day.
When I sold the family farm to the army base and used that money to make this restaurant out in Tokyo...
I guess I forgot about those dreams I had when I was younger.
No...
I bet I was trying to forget about it.
I had given up, thinking that it was something I couldn't do.
The adults didn't do anything about it... but these kids...
How about it, Ms. Toyo, you want to join me?
Hmm.
Maybe she went to the bathroom.
You were hanging in there, eh, kid?
Ignorance is a sin!
Take a good hard look at history.
That's right.
Ms. Toyo is already...
Here... some new bandages.
And some coca cola?
You used to love these, Yuki.
Have a drink.
And...
This...
I'll be getting stuff ready downstairs so holler if you need anything.
Cocoe's sudden retirement!
She goes into hiding without a press conference!
Because of marriage or illness?
- Is she?
- Yes.
She's a tough one.
A normal person would have died of insanity by now.
They were pretty insane to begin with, I guess.
Let me out!
Who the hell?
We'll never give up!
He was still alive?
Pretty tough.
But it's the end for all these guys.
Is Cocoe still alive?
I understand.
So that's where they're being held...
Hiya.
Hey, sorry about that.
We're unusually packed tonight.
Sorry, eh?
Come again.
Here you go, your tomatoes.
And here's that special pork dish.
What are you doing?
Yuki!
Run!
She's gone.
The back!
Go around to the back!
Over there!
There she is!
In-
In-de-
In-de-pen-dence.
In-
In-de-
In-de-pen-dence.
Uh, everyone.
The Head of National Security, Mr. Migihara, has taken time from his busy schedule to watch our work.
Please continue the great work that you do.
Mr. Migihara, it's almost time.
They've caused us a lot of trouble but they settle down once they're locked up in cages.
Must be a trait of the Kingdom, too.
Absolutely, sir.
It's here.
It's here.
They day of independence is near.
Hmph.
The mixing of people causes the country to deteriorate.
We must eliminate them once and for all.
Absolutely, sir.
What's happening?
I'm not sure.
Maybe there's not enough electricity.
What's going on?
An intruder has opened the holding cells and has started a fire.
What's going on, Kuroiwa?
Yes, it seems that someone has pulled a trick on us...
Kuroiwa!
You said those bastards from the academy were all killed!
Yes, sir.
Idiot!
I'm firing you already!
Sir, we must get to safety first.
What is this?
Is there a fire?
Yes, apparently someone has started a fire.
Why didn't you say that in the first place?
This way, sir!
Dirty creeps!
How dare you let this happen to me?
You're going to pay for this when we get back, Kuroiwa!
Sir, the exit is that way!
I think it's this way.
Absolutely, sir.
Let me go, you monster!
Let me go!
Let me go, monster!
Hey!
Someone!
ANYBODY?
Stop!
Monster!
Let me go!
Go away!
Let me go!
Help me!
Yuki!
Instructor Abe.
Kill!
Yuki!
Kill!
Yuki!
Kill!
- Kill!
Yuki!
- Please help me!
No!
Kill, Yuki!
Please save me!
I'm sorry.
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Good.
Let's go.
Over there!
Cocoe, I promise to follow you.
Wait for me in the Kingdom.
I was born amidst a riot.
That was the day my destiny was decided.
I cannot die.
I will not die.
For the independence of the Kingdom!
Aki...
Saki...
Mickey...
Instructor Abe...
Mom...
Uncle Nakamura...
Watch over me...
Yuki...
That was the last I saw of Yuki.
But I know that somewhere out there Yuki is alive, watched over by everyone...
What do you say?
Want to join the academy too?
Yuki, me, and you all...
let us all fight for independence!
SAMURAI CHICKS
- Previously on The O.C.:
- Guess who's back.
- Aunt Hailey.
- Did she say why she was here?
- She's out of money.
- You can't keep living like this.
So I can grow up to be like you?
- He's really not my type.
- What's your type?
Seth Cohen?
I didn't want you to be alone on New Year's.
- I'm having a party.
- We're not going.
I'm not drinking.
Doesn't mean you can't.
- Clean and sober, 11 months.
- Your girlfriend's at a party, alone?
- Not alone, with a guy named Oliver.
- You broke up.
We're just not spending New Year's together.
I think it's just us tonight.
- She's eating us out of house and home.
- It's just a bagel.
No.
No, no, it's never just a bagel.
As someone who's basically been a shut-in for the last 17 years I can say with great authority that she never leaves the house.
- She's got nowhere else to go.
- Because her friends want to kick her ass.
- Sorry about the language.
- Why?
I'd like to kick her ass.
- Kirsten.
- Coming.
There's no more coffee.
Will you make some?
- The French roast, not the harvest blend.
- No, no, no.
I'll talk to her.
So I'll have to survive on English muffins.
Marissa?
Marissa?
Hello.
She's gotta be here somewhere.
- Hilarious.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Listen to me.
Hailey is always in the living room.
Marissa's always here.
I'm lost.
What happened to Seth-Ryan time?
That was quality time.
- Okay.
I know I've been a little bit...
- Whipped?
I'm not whipped.
- I'm free to talk now.
What's up?
- Squeezing me in before school?
Nice.
But actually, I'll take it.
Okay, here's the thing:
Anna and I are gonna take it to the next level.
I need advice.
- You're gonna have sex?
- No.
That's a good idea, though.
We're gonna tell Summer that we're dating.
As much as I fear Summer hurting me, with the rage blackouts and all I'm actually more scared about hurting her feelings.
We've become friends now, and I feel like I don't want to...
- You guys ready to go?
- Yeah.
We were just talking.
Really?
About what?
Guy stuff.
Hunting and shaving and shoes.
Actually, the cleats for the sports.
Okay, well, come on.
Hey, later, can we finish this chat?
Put in a little Seth-Ryan time?
Yes.
Absolutely, just gotta check with...
Oh, you forgot your balls.
- You and me.
Tonight.
- Come on.
- Are we one of those couples?
- Who lose all their friends?
And can't do anything without each other?
I don't think so.
You think so?
- That'd be good, a night apart.
- Yeah, plus, I'm kind of sick of you.
I'm sick of me too.
- I gotta go.
- Yeah.
And I got the...
- Walk me?
- I'll walk you.
- Don't make me.
- Don't make you what?
- Hurt you.
- Watch this.
Stop it.
- What's up?
- Hey.
What is up?
- I was talking to her.
- That's cool.
- Do you have plans this weekend?
- Nothing.
What Anna's trying to say is, she's not gonna do anything.
We're both not.
That's what we're both doing.
We're doing nothing.
But doing that by ourselves.
Thank you, Cohen.
You just reminded me that I need my bio textbook because we're studying monkeys.
Ouch.
I hate liars, and now I'm one of them.
I thought you were gonna talk to her.
I am gonna talk to her.
I don't know how.
- I'll tell her then.
- No.
I have to do it.
Tonight me and Ryan are gonna have a strategy meeting.
We're gonna figure out the whole thing.
- That makes me feel better.
- Then we'll be free to do this.
- Seth.
I have to study.
- And this.
I started my own business right out of college.
And now I'm a father of two and I've got one line on my r Ásum Á.
- Did you ever mow your lawn as a kid?
- Yeah.
Great. "Jimmy Cooper Landscaping," your first job.
- Now you're an entrepreneur.
- I don't even have references.
Sure you do, your clients whose money you stole.
Right.
- Is that Jimmy Cooper?
- Hey, Hailey!
You look fantastic.
How you doing?
She's got no jobs, no friends and no prospects.
- And I say that with love.
- Sounds like we got a lot in common.
- So did you guys have the talk?
- Yes.
We almost did.
We were having fun.
And all we've done is fight for so long.
It was nice to just hang out and be sisters.
- I'll find out if she has a plan.
- You know what her plan is.
She'll stay here and mooch off us until she can make a withdrawal from the Bank of Dad.
Then she'll take off again for a few years.
- She said she wasn't gonna do that.
- She's gonna mooch off us forever?
- She's not mooching.
- Oh, really?
Then how'd she get all those new clothes?
From the salary she doesn't make?
From the trust fund she drained?
- I bought you bagels.
- That fixes everything?
- Yes, it does.
- Sesame.
That's a start.
I'm gonna hide them.
So yeah.
Now I'm broke and sleeping at my sister's.
I'm broke and my wife is sleeping with your father.
Fantastic.
We've done well for ourselves.
Who knew back when Kirsten and I were babysitting you and you were watching Silver Spoons that we'd both turn out to be so...?
- Complicated.
- And it was Golden Girls.
- That's right.
You loved Golden Girls.
It's impressive that I was 10 and relating to the lives of 70-year-old women.
Blanche was 70?
She aged really well.
I'd love to hang, hear how you made such a mess of your life.
Same.
Although I bet your story doesn't involve a fistfight at cotillion.
No.
But I bet yours doesn't contain half a pound of hash and a border guard in Budapest.
No.
It's nice that you and Jimmy are friends again.
I guess I can't blame a guy for wanting to kiss my wife.
It feels like we never have any time alone anymore.
That's not true.
We have moments.
I want more moments.
- God, they're so whipped.
- I gotta go pick up Marissa.
- Sandy, thank you.
- Anytime.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yes.
Jimmy and I are gonna hang out tomorrow night, catch up.
- Hang out, like "out"?
- I bet you have a lot to catch up on.
- Tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow night.
Hey, man.
How's it going?
Got a flat tire.
You ran over a nail?
Somebody slashed it.
Want some help?
Thanks.
I got a spare in the back.
Hey, Luke, why doesn't your dad help you with that tire?
I'm sure he'd like to bend over.
- New Year's resolution.
Punch people less.
- I had the same one.
You think I'm getting what I deserve after years of being a jackass?
Definitely.
Hey, why don't we just get out of here.
The tire can wait.
Yeah, that sounds good.
Go.
Go, go, go.
Break that tackle.
Go.
Yeah!
Who plays PlayStation for the sports games?
Listen to me.
You said Seth-Ryan time.
This isn't Seth-Ryan time.
This is Seth-Luke-Ryan time, and you know what?
Guess what.
- There's no such thing.
- Maybe Luke will have some good advice.
What does that guy know about juggling women?
Come on.
Okay, quite a bit.
But he wasn't good at it.
He's having a bad day.
I'm having a bad day, okay?
I'm having a bad week.
Some kids at school slashed his tires.
Damn it.
What do you think he wants on his pizza?
Hey, Cohen.
Check out the replay on this tackle.
I broke this bitch in half.
Luke has a gay dad.
Luke has a gay dad.
Can't wait to see it, buddy.
- Hello?
- Hey.
I'm at Oliver's, and he just ordered way too much food.
I know you wanted to spend tonight apart but he asked if you would come by.
- You're at Oliver's?
- Summer had plans.
I saw Oliver at therapy.
He said if I wanted...
- That's so good.
- It's Moroccan.
- What's Moroccan?
- The food.
Just come.
Okay?
See you soon.
How do you guys feel about Moroccan?
I think I really hurt that guy.
- Hey, where's the silverware?
- Moroccan you eat with your hands.
No wonder Luke seems to be enjoying it so much.
- How good is the couscous?
- Amazing.
- It's pretty good.
- No, that's the kefta.
Couscous is the other thing.
I can't believe you live in a penthouse.
This place is "ridonculous."
It's always been my fantasy to live in a hotel.
Like Eloise.
Yeah, well, I guess.
But with my parents traveling so much it can get a little lonely.
- Lf you ever need any company...
- Thanks.
They might be gone a while, opening a new hotel in Paris.
I love Paris.
I could spend all day walking the Champs Elys Áes.
I like Paris.
I love baguettes.
Dude, French chicks don't even shave their armpits.
- Have you ever been to Paris, Ryan?
- No, not yet.
- I hear the Louvre's cool.
- Do not go near it.
Totally overrated.
The Mona Lisa's the size of a postage stamp.
Now, the Rodin Museum and the Mus Áe Picasso...
But you know where my family's been spending most of their time?
Switzerland.
- Snowboarding the Alps is unreal.
- You boarded the Alps?
The closest I've ever come is Whistler.
We have a place in Big Bear.
We should go one weekend.
- Could you teach Ryan to board?
- Lf you can get him on a chair lift.
First two days, you'll be on your ass, but we'll get you there.
- I really like this song.
- You know, they're playing tomorrow.
- Yeah, but it's all sold out.
- Do you wanna go?
Yeah, but it's all sold out.
I'll call their manager tomorrow.
They're amazing live.
- You know Rooney?
- That would be awesome.
I've never heard of them, but I got nothing.
I'll go.
Ryan?
- Come on, we'll all get to hang out.
- It'll be fun.
- Cool.
- All right, then it's settled.
We're going.
- Groovy.
- Hey, nice.
This is gonna be great.
So now you're eating with silverware?
Next thing, I'll see you at the Louvre.
No, you won't, because, like Oliver said, it's lame.
Can we please focus on the crisis at hand for one second?
Okay?
Summer.
The way I figure it, I have many options.
Like the truth.
That's a good one.
Hey, no argument there, buddy but I'm talking about my messenger of truth.
My delivery system of honesty.
The way I tell her.
- Now, listen.
I could call her.
That's one.
- Okay.
It is okay, but just okay.
It lacks any real spark or imagination.
But it's effective.
Your voice on one end, hers on the other.
- "I'm dating Anna." She'll hear you.
- But the phone is a blunt instrument, no?
What about text messaging?
I could Blackberry her.
That feels very hip, it feels edgy, it feels 21 st century.
- Kind of cold.
- Mittens required, yes.
A carrier pigeon.
How cool would that be?
Think about it.
A little message in his cute little talons.
Summer's a pigeon fan.
- You're a coward.
- Am I?
Or am I just too sensitive to the feelings of others?
Coward, definitely.
Fine, I'll tell her Monday.
Actually, I think Tuesday.
I might give it till Friday.
That way she'll have the weekend to let it marinate...
- You could do it today.
- No.
Today will soon be tonight.
And tonight will be Rooney.
And Rooney will be awesome.
Rooney.
I saw them open for The Vines in L.A. Last year.
- Big whoop.
We're seeing them tonight.
- I thought it was sold out.
It happens they are.
But I also happen to be dialed in.
I got the hookups.
Or at least Oliver does.
And I'm gonna ride his coattails.
Oliver?
As in Oliver, the guy who wanted to kiss your girlfriend on New Year's?
- Morning, Hailey.
- It's not like that.
He's got a girlfriend.
Wait.
If he has a girlfriend, why is he always hanging out with yours?
- Couldn't tell you, but thanks.
- The guy seems cool, right?
I don't know.
We don't seem to have a lot in common.
- Besides your girlfriend.
- Keep twisting the knife.
Feels good.
Whatever.
He got us backstage passes.
Good enough for me.
Backstage?
So now you have to worry about your girl with Oliver and rock stars?
Mind if I finish cornflakes?
Hey, at least she asked.
It's a start.
Well, at least she's leaving the house.
It's a start.
- We'll have the place to ourselves.
- Yes.
We can eat bagels.
- And I can wear my robe.
- Or not.
I can have the remote back.
She's crammed that TiVo full of every E!
True Hollywood special.
- I think she's looking for tips.
- That's nice.
I'm just saying, she's cluttering up the TiVo.
And a clear TiVo equals a clear mind.
Are we okay with the kids going to that concert?
- Yeah.
- What if Rooney is, like death-metal Satan-worshipping speed freaks?
Honey, that went out in the late '90s.
I saw it on a special on E!
I'll run Rooney up my proverbial flagpole, but you have got to speak to Hailey.
So?
- Yeah, it's my first time hearing it, so...
- That's why we're doing a run-through.
- So you'll have heard it all before tonight.
- Right.
- So we're going tonight?
- No.
It's your first concert.
We have free tickets, backstage passes.
You're right, we should skip it.
- That's not what I'm saying.
- What are you saying?
- Have you met Natalie?
- No, but I hear she's great.
- And Oliver is...?
I mean...
- Is someone jealous?
This song is good.
Turn it up.
Really, really loud.
Oliver will be with Natalie.
Rooney is a really good band.
- And tonight we're gonna have fun.
- I know.
- There won't be dancing, right?
- I'll dance.
You can watch.
Works for me.
- I think that's enough.
- What?
There was almost a knee bend.
You were about to find the beat.
- And?
- Remember cousin Jeffery's bar mitzvah?
You almost wiped out a dozen kids on the dance floor.
That "Y.M.C.A." song requires a lot of movement.
- I'm just trying to spare casualties.
- So anyone gonna be doing drugs?
I hope so, otherwise it's a lame-ass concert.
Anyone named Seth gonna be doing any drugs?
No.
Nobody named Seth Cohen.
I promise.
Gotta stay sharp.
It's my first date with Anna.
It is?
So you and Summer finally had the talk?
Oh, yes, almost several times.
- Seth.
- Father.
The sooner you tell her, the better you'll feel about everything.
See, I don't really believe that.
I'm feeling like the longer I wait to tell her, the longer I'll feel great.
The best advice I can give you is this.
It's from Steven Seagal in his classic film Hard to Kill.
"The anticipation of death is far worse than death itself."
Great.
So then we both agree that Summer's gonna kill me.
Look, if you're old enough to go to a concert alone if you're old enough to embark on a real relationship you are old enough to be a man.
Well, she's not gonna be there tonight so I'll tell her Monday.
- Good.
Now, get going.
Your mother and I want some time alone.
There's a visual that I don't want to take with me tonight.
Well, son, your mom's a hottie, and I got her.
- I don't see him.
- Maybe he's inside.
- Excuse me, are you on the list?
- Yeah, we're with Oliver Trask.
- Who's Oliver Trask?
- You don't have his name?
No, I don't have his name.
I've never heard it.
That's why I'm asking.
- Thanks, you've been very helpful.
- I'll call him and see where he is.
- A lot of freaks here, huh, Cohen?
- Yeah.
Good job, Luke.
That should help make us a lot of friends.
- Damn it.
- What?
Well, dude, they're gonna go on soon.
If Oliver's late, we'll miss the first song.
They only have one album.
Factor in your standard cover, that's 12 songs.
Oh, no.
But, hey.
I mean, come on.
If we don't get in, we're still gonna have fun tonight.
- Right?
- What are we gonna do?
I hope you guys aren't waiting for me.
- Summer.
- Cohen.
- Hey, Anna.
- Summer.
- Who are you talking to?
- It just goes straight to voice mail.
Dude, look at that freak.
Hey, I drove alone.
Will you ride with me?
You want to give up so early?
Maybe I can grease a few palms.
Hey.
- There you are.
- What's up, man?
- Hi.
- I thought you were a no-show.
- What happened?
I said back door.
- No, you didn't.
- Load in here, guys.
- The band's here.
- It's all happening.
- What up, guys?
Robert, how's it going?
Good to see you.
Looking forward to the show.
- Thank you.
- I guess we're on time.
- Which one's Rooney?
- They're all Rooney.
- Hey, man, this is my posse.
- This is crazy.
- Hey.
So where's Natalie?
- Yeah, we had another fight.
This whole long-distance thing's tough.
Looks like I'm dateless tonight.
Hey, no!
No way.
We'll be your date, right?
Yeah, right.
- So should we fire up the hot tub?
- Interesting.
Open a bottle of wine.
Oh, I like it.
First, TiVo.
I'm gonna erase Hailey's programs.
- Hot pizza?
- Hailey.
Hey, guys.
You're just in time.
Doctor.
Doctor.
- James.
- What's up?
I just thought that you were going out tonight.
We were.
But then I found out there's a Golden Girls marathon on Lifetime.
And I decided to dig up all my favorite board games.
We're having a throwback to the old babysitting days.
- Why don't you guys join us?
- Great.
That would be great.
Oh, I love this episode.
This is the one where Rose adopts the pig.
She adopted the pig?
- Do you play?
- A little.
- Here, man.
- All access?
Sweet.
- Hey, it's cool?
- It's cool.
- Hey, check it out.
- Seriously?
Yeah.
Awesome.
I just got a few songs that I wrote.
Okay, I'm just gonna...
Seth, you have to tell her tonight.
- No, I don't.
- Hey.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- So, Luke, he's...
- Yeah, we don't let him out much.
Yeah.
But you guys are cool, having fun?
- Everything's awesome.
- Glad to hear it.
Yeah.
Everything is not awesome.
If I don't tell Summer tonight, then later, when I do tell her she'll remember the fun she had at Rooney.
That will cheer her up.
There's never gonna be a good time to tell her.
Tonight's not a bad night.
There's a lot of guys here.
Cute guys, older guys.
A lot of musicians.
Girls like musicians.
Maybe you're right.
Am I flattering myself to even think that Summer'll care?
I mean, me compared to that dude or that guy.
- Right.
- Are you checking out dudes again?
No.
But there are plenty here tonight, aren't there?
A lot of musicians.
In fact, I think I'm gonna go find some myself.
Why don't you and Seth talk.
You know, about anything.
- Cohen, you and Anna...?
- Me and Anna what?
What?
Will you guys stand with me at the concert?
Marissa's on a date, and I'm all alone tonight, so...
Okay, that would be nice.
Yeah.
Hey, man.
I thought your boy was supposed to be here an hour ago.
No.
Okay, no excuses.
I don't care who you send.
Just make sure it's good and it gets here quick.
All right.
I can't see.
I'm stuck behind a row of giants.
Come with me.
Okay, lead the way.
Sorry.
Hey.
Did you tell her?
What did she say?
Did she leave?
No.
Summer is bringing refreshments for her friends.
- Seth said you were thirsty.
- Yeah.
You are thirsty, aren't you?
- You suck.
- I'm sorry.
- I gotta pee.
You gotta pee?
- I'll come with you.
I'm telling her.
You know the night that Mom and Dad came home early from Palm Springs?
And we flushed all that beer down the toilet.
- A lot of good that did.
- I know.
Dad caught you throwing out the empty bottles.
- I thought you were sleeping.
- Face it, sister.
Everything I know, I learned from you.
You were a bad influence back in the day.
How do you think I learned to piss off Dad?
- The student becomes the master.
- And the master becomes Dad's slave.
Helping to turn paradise into a parking lot, or at least a three-car garage.
Hey, Connect Four!
Congratulations.
Next Saturday, Yahtzee.
No, wait.
Stay.
Battleship?
Uno?
You know, Sandy's right.
It's late.
And, besides, I have a show home waiting for me in the morning.
Just what Orange County needs.
Another show home.
Airlifted from the McMansion factory and dropped from the sky...
The one on the bluff, that's a great house.
If by "great" you mean overbuilt, overpriced and exactly like this one.
- Oh, nice.
Hailey, nice.
- I was kidding.
- I'm laughing on the inside.
- I'm not.
You're living in our home.
You're insulting my wife.
You're driving my whole family crazy.
- Is this true?
- Yeah.
And we all know what you're doing here.
She didn't mean anything.
It's just sisters.
No, all this talk about plans, about growing up, it's shtick.
It's a routine.
And it's tired.
You know who's tired?
Me.
So why don't we stop.
No, stop protecting her.
You're not even nice to Kirsten.
She's the only reason we put up with you.
Well, you won't have to put up with me for much longer, okay?
- Sorry?
- It's not your fault, Jimmy.
No, I meant the board game.
- You like The Golden Girls?
- Yes.
There's a marathon on.
I can't get the song out of my head.
I love The Golden Girls.
It's not Rose's fault.
She just is that way.
You're Rose?
I'm Blanche.
It's kind of weird that I relate to a 70-year-old, but...
How good was the episode when there was a blackout?
How about when Rose adopts the pig?
Then Sophia loses her glasses and thinks the pig is a baby.
It's so funny.
Jimmy, wait.
Sorry about that in there.
My little tantrum.
Oh, listen, it's complicated between you and your sister.
It always has been.
You gotta go, like, right now?
Yeah, I don't know if I ever told you, but I'm an extremely important person.
And so I have to...
Yeah.
No, Marissa's at a concert.
Yep, nothing but time.
Didn't tonight feel like the good old days?
No.
It was more like two kind of pathetic people grasping for the old days.
- Right.
That too.
- Yeah.
Look, the good old days.
They're exactly that.
Would you really want to be back in high school?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I would too.
- And you think I'm pathetic?
- Yes, I do.
It's sad, really.
I always had a crush on you.
You know that?
No.
You were 8 when I went away to college.
So I wasn't...
You're Kirsten's sister.
So I've heard all my life.
Look, we don't want to make a complicated situation even more complicated, right?
The last thing we need is having Sandy or Kirsten catching us.
Unless that's what you're hoping for.
Look, your sister is amazing and Sandy is such a great guy.
I think you're lucky to have them looking out for you.
I know that I am.
I'm gonna go.
Okay.
- Hi.
I'm gonna...
- Hey, this is great, right?
Perfect.
Come here a second.
- What are we doing?
- This is better.
Wait.
But we're missing the concert.
We can't ditch Oliver.
- Oliver's fine.
He's friends with the band.
- And with us.
I thought you said you wanted us to hang out with friends.
You've known him two weeks.
How good a friend can he be?
Look.
He's in recovery, trying to stay clean.
We can talk about stuff.
He tells me things.
What he's going through.
- Unlike me, right?
- I didn't say that.
I know you didn't want to come here tonight so, I mean, I guess if you want to leave...
Right.
Later.
Hey, Luke.
- You know who sings this song?
- Rooney.
- Rooney!
- We should keep it that way.
Yeah, Rooney!
What the hell, man?
!
Get off me!
- Hey, get off him!
- I'm a cop.
- What?
There's gotta be some mistake.
- Yeah.
His.
He just tried to buy 3 grams of coke from me.
Ryan, go back inside.
Don't tell anybody.
Excuse me, barkeep, sir.
- Hey.
- What can I get you?
How did you do that?
The usual.
- Mountain Dew.
- How many?
Unfortunately, three.
So Anna's telling Summer that we're a couple.
When they get back, I will officially be in a relationship with Anna.
Unless Summer kills me, in which case, you've been like a brother.
Good, because I need your keys and phone.
- Yeah, you okay?
- I'm fine.
It's Oliver.
- What?
What's going on?
- Tell you later?
All right.
You'll miss a hell of a show, though.
Rooney's not bad, either.
- Is Jimmy gone?
- Yeah.
Is she all right?
I knocked.
She didn't answer.
Maybe she's giving us the house back.
Or maybe she's packing and she'll be gone in the morning.
And frankly I'd rather have her here, where I can keep an eye on her, than anywhere else.
You can't keep her here forever.
It's no good for her and it's no good for us.
Hello?
Hey, what's wrong?
Where are you?
I'll be right there.
Ryan's at the police station.
Thank you, Newport Beach.
Good night, everybody.
- Seth.
- Hey.
- Where have you been?
- At the bar.
How was it?
It was amazing.
They played the whole album.
Not with Rooney, how did it go with Summer?
Did you tell her?
Tell me what?
So you're a couple?
- No.
- Yes.
We wanted to tell you first before we became a couple, which now we are.
- So you chose Anna?
- No.
Kind of, yeah.
She came over on New Year's Eve.
You were with me on New Year's Eve.
Technically, you were with that guy Allan, remember?
And you kept insisting that I go find someone to kiss, so I did.
I was taking out the garbage, she was in the driveway.
You know how it goes.
Okay, well, congrats.
You're not mad?
Good, because I didn't want this to affect our relationship in any way.
Well, Anna, I have to say that Rose would've never pulled that New Year's stunt on Blanche.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Although Blanche would've done it to Rose, so...
So can we still all hang out?
Will you be cool with that?
We'd both really like that if we could hang out.
Sure.
You guys, we can totally hang out.
I mean, in fact, what are you guys doing right now?
So they're gonna let him go.
- Really?
How'd you do that?
- I'm just that good.
- I used to play poker with these guys.
- Thanks for doing this.
- You didn't have to, really.
- Is this kid a friend of yours?
He's a friend of Marissa's.
They met in therapy.
He said he's been clean a while, but...
They busted him trying to buy coke.
Then he said his parents are away for a month.
Can you believe that?
A parent leaves a kid like that on his own.
Yeah, imagine that.
- I'll never understand it.
- I hope not.
- I'm glad you called me.
- Me too.
I'm gonna finish up your paperwork.
You sit tight.
I'll be right back.
So thanks.
Seth's dad seems cool.
He is.
So why'd you do this for me?
I mean, you don't even like me, man.
I don't really know you.
Well, if it's any consolation, I don't like myself very much right now, either.
- So, what happened?
- I don't know.
Natalie didn't show.
And then I saw you and Marissa.
Your friends.
Then it hit me.
I have no one.
My parents are gone.
My friends, if you can even call them that they all disappeared when I got clean.
Now I...
There's Marissa.
Seth likes your taste in music.
And Luke pretty much likes everybody at this point.
And what about you?
I mean, you must like me a little to get me out of jail.
No, that was Sandy.
Marissa.
You gonna tell her?
No.
You are.
Hey.
Yeah, it's Oliver.
Hey, whoa, hey, hey, hey!
- I can't have half?
- There are other bagels.
- Not salt bagels.
- You ate them all.
And several sesame.
I haven't been the best guest, I know.
- And what you said tonight...
- Hey, Connect Four was happening.
It gets my blood up.
Well, you were right.
So, what's the plan?
Hit Caleb up for more cash.
And then what?
- Europe this time?
Iceland?
Boca?
- I don't know.
You know, I see how happy you guys are, and I think, "Why can't I have that?"
- Because you don't want it.
- How do you know?
I don't even know what I want.
You could stay here.
I mean, not here exactly but, you know, get a home.
- A job.
Settle down.
- No.
See, that's the thing.
All I know is what I don't want.
Well, that's not entirely true.
And the rest you'll figure out.
Good night.
Good night.
- Hey.
- Hey.
No, wait, don't get up.
Thanks.
He's not a bad guy, Oliver.
He's...
This may come as a shock to you but right now, I don't want to talk about Oliver.
Oh, hey, wow, kissing.
Sorry about that.
We're gonna hang out inside, but you guys are obviously alone together so do that.
- Ryan, what happened to you?
- Luke, please, you're shouting.
- Someone stood too close to the speaker.
- Dude, that concert did not suck at all.
- We PlayStationing it, or what?
- Yeah.
Any time you want to join us.
Let's go before he wakes up your parents.
Think we can teach him to fetch?
I don't want to be the third wheel or watch you guys make out, so enjoy.
- Well, we could stay here.
- Yeah, but maybe we should...
Race you?
Cohen, you've played this game before?
See the way I ripped that guy's spine out?
Sitting right here, buddy.
I am so glad we all could hang out together like this, aren't you guys?
- Yeah.
- Damn it.
- Ryan, you're up.
- You're up, Ryan.
We'll make it best of five.
- Previously on The O.C.:
- Guess who's back.
- Aunt Hailey.
- Did she say why she was here?
- She's out of money.
- You can't keep living like this.
So I can grow up to be like you?
- He's really not my type.
- What's your type?
Seth Cohen?
I didn't want you to be alone on New Year's.
- I'm having a party.
- We're not going.
I'm not drinking.
Doesn't mean you can't.
- Clean and sober, 11 months.
- Your girlfriend's at a party, alone?
- Not alone, with a guy named Oliver.
- You broke up.
We're just not spending New Year's together.
I think it's just us tonight.
- She's eating us out of house and home.
- It's just a bagel.
No.
No, no, it's never just a bagel.
As someone who's basically been a shut-in for the last 17 years I can say with great authority that she never leaves the house.
- She's got nowhere else to go.
- Because her friends want to kick her ass.
- Sorry about the language.
- Why?
I'd like to kick her ass.
- Kirsten.
- Coming.
There's no more coffee.
Will you make some?
- The French roast, not the harvest blend.
- No, no, no.
I'll talk to her.
So I'll have to survive on English muffins.
Marissa?
Marissa?
Hello.
She's gotta be here somewhere.
- Hilarious.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Listen to me.
Hailey is always in the living room.
Marissa's always here.
I'm lost.
What happened to Seth-Ryan time?
That was quality time.
- Okay.
I know I've been a little bit...
- Whipped?
I'm not whipped.
- I'm free to talk now.
What's up?
- Squeezing me in before school?
Nice.
But actually, I'll take it.
Okay, here's the thing:
Anna and I are gonna take it to the next level.
I need advice.
- You're gonna have sex?
- No.
That's a good idea, though.
We're gonna tell Summer that we're dating.
As much as I fear Summer hurting me, with the rage blackouts and all I'm actually more scared about hurting her feelings.
We've become friends now, and I feel like I don't want to...
- You guys ready to go?
- Yeah.
We were just talking.
Really?
About what?
Guy stuff.
Hunting and shaving and shoes.
Actually, the cleats for the sports.
Okay, well, come on.
Hey, later, can we finish this chat?
Put in a little Seth-Ryan time?
Yes.
Absolutely, just gotta check with...
Oh, you forgot your balls.
- You and me.
Tonight.
- Come on.
- Are we one of those couples?
- Who lose all their friends?
And can't do anything without each other?
I don't think so.
You think so?
- That'd be good, a night apart.
- Yeah, plus, I'm kind of sick of you.
I'm sick of me too.
- I gotta go.
- Yeah.
And I got the...
- Walk me?
- I'll walk you.
- Don't make me.
- Don't make you what?
- Hurt you.
- Watch this.
Stop it.
- What's up?
- Hey.
What is up?
- I was talking to her.
- That's cool.
- Do you have plans this weekend?
- Nothing.
What Anna's trying to say is, she's not gonna do anything.
We're both not.
That's what we're both doing.
We're doing nothing.
But doing that by ourselves.
Thank you, Cohen.
You just reminded me that I need my bio textbook because we're studying monkeys.
Ouch.
I hate liars, and now I'm one of them.
I thought you were gonna talk to her.
I am gonna talk to her.
I don't know how.
- I'll tell her then.
- No.
I have to do it.
Tonight me and Ryan are gonna have a strategy meeting.
We're gonna figure out the whole thing.
- That makes me feel better.
- Then we'll be free to do this.
- Seth.
I have to study.
- And this.
I started my own business right out of college.
And now I'm a father of two and I've got one line on my r Ásum Á.
- Did you ever mow your lawn as a kid?
- Yeah.
Great. "Jimmy Cooper Landscaping," your first job.
- Now you're an entrepreneur.
- I don't even have references.
Sure you do, your clients whose money you stole.
Right.
- Is that Jimmy Cooper?
- Hey, Hailey!
You look fantastic.
How you doing?
She's got no jobs, no friends and no prospects.
- And I say that with love.
- Sounds like we got a lot in common.
- So did you guys have the talk?
- Yes.
We almost did.
We were having fun.
And all we've done is fight for so long.
It was nice to just hang out and be sisters.
- I'll find out if she has a plan.
- You know what her plan is.
She'll stay here and mooch off us until she can make a withdrawal from the Bank of Dad.
Then she'll take off again for a few years.
- She said she wasn't gonna do that.
- She's gonna mooch off us forever?
- She's not mooching.
- Oh, really?
Then how'd she get all those new clothes?
From the salary she doesn't make?
From the trust fund she drained?
- I bought you bagels.
- That fixes everything?
- Yes, it does.
- Sesame.
That's a start.
I'm gonna hide them.
So yeah.
Now I'm broke and sleeping at my sister's.
I'm broke and my wife is sleeping with your father.
Fantastic.
We've done well for ourselves.
Who knew back when Kirsten and I were babysitting you and you were watching Silver Spoons that we'd both turn out to be so...?
- Complicated.
- And it was Golden Girls.
- That's right.
You loved Golden Girls.
It's impressive that I was 10 and relating to the lives of 70-year-old women.
Blanche was 70?
She aged really well.
I'd love to hang, hear how you made such a mess of your life.
Same.
Although I bet your story doesn't involve a fistfight at cotillion.
No.
But I bet yours doesn't contain half a pound of hash and a border guard in Budapest.
No.
It's nice that you and Jimmy are friends again.
I guess I can't blame a guy for wanting to kiss my wife.
It feels like we never have any time alone anymore.
That's not true.
We have moments.
I want more moments.
- God, they're so whipped.
- I gotta go pick up Marissa.
- Sandy, thank you.
- Anytime.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yes.
Jimmy and I are gonna hang out tomorrow night, catch up.
- Hang out, like "out"?
- I bet you have a lot to catch up on.
- Tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow night.
Hey, man.
How's it going?
Got a flat tire.
You ran over a nail?
Somebody slashed it.
Want some help?
Thanks.
I got a spare in the back.
Hey, Luke, why doesn't your dad help you with that tire?
I'm sure he'd like to bend over.
- New Year's resolution.
Punch people less.
- I had the same one.
You think I'm getting what I deserve after years of being a jackass?
Definitely.
Hey, why don't we just get out of here.
The tire can wait.
Yeah, that sounds good.
Go.
Go, go, go.
Break that tackle.
Go.
Yeah!
Who plays PlayStation for the sports games?
Listen to me.
You said Seth-Ryan time.
This isn't Seth-Ryan time.
This is Seth-Luke-Ryan time, and you know what?
Guess what.
- There's no such thing.
- Maybe Luke will have some good advice.
What does that guy know about juggling women?
Come on.
Okay, quite a bit.
But he wasn't good at it.
He's having a bad day.
I'm having a bad day, okay?
I'm having a bad week.
Some kids at school slashed his tires.
Damn it.
What do you think he wants on his pizza?
Hey, Cohen.
Check out the replay on this tackle.
I broke this bitch in half.
Luke has a gay dad.
Luke has a gay dad.
Can't wait to see it, buddy.
- Hello?
- Hey.
I'm at Oliver's, and he just ordered way too much food.
I know you wanted to spend tonight apart but he asked if you would come by.
- You're at Oliver's?
- Summer had plans.
I saw Oliver at therapy.
He said if I wanted...
- That's so good.
- It's Moroccan.
- What's Moroccan?
- The food.
Just come.
Okay?
See you soon.
How do you guys feel about Moroccan?
I think I really hurt that guy.
- Hey, where's the silverware?
- Moroccan you eat with your hands.
No wonder Luke seems to be enjoying it so much.
- How good is the couscous?
- Amazing.
- It's pretty good.
- No, that's the kefta.
Couscous is the other thing.
I can't believe you live in a penthouse.
This place is "ridonculous."
It's always been my fantasy to live in a hotel.
Like Eloise.
Yeah, well, I guess.
But with my parents traveling so much it can get a little lonely.
- Lf you ever need any company...
- Thanks.
They might be gone a while, opening a new hotel in Paris.
I love Paris.
I could spend all day walking the Champs Elys Áes.
I like Paris.
I love baguettes.
Dude, French chicks don't even shave their armpits.
- Have you ever been to Paris, Ryan?
- No, not yet.
- I hear the Louvre's cool.
- Do not go near it.
Totally overrated.
The Mona Lisa's the size of a postage stamp.
Now, the Rodin Museum and the Mus Áe Picasso...
But you know where my family's been spending most of their time?
Switzerland.
- Snowboarding the Alps is unreal.
- You boarded the Alps?
The closest I've ever come is Whistler.
We have a place in Big Bear.
We should go one weekend.
- Could you teach Ryan to board?
- Lf you can get him on a chair lift.
First two days, you'll be on your ass, but we'll get you there.
- I really like this song.
- You know, they're playing tomorrow.
- Yeah, but it's all sold out.
- Do you wanna go?
Yeah, but it's all sold out.
I'll call their manager tomorrow.
They're amazing live.
- You know Rooney?
- That would be awesome.
I've never heard of them, but I got nothing.
I'll go.
Ryan?
- Come on, we'll all get to hang out.
- It'll be fun.
- Cool.
- All right, then it's settled.
We're going.
- Groovy.
- Hey, nice.
This is gonna be great.
So now you're eating with silverware?
Next thing, I'll see you at the Louvre.
No, you won't, because, like Oliver said, it's lame.
Can we please focus on the crisis at hand for one second?
Okay?
Summer.
The way I figure it, I have many options.
Like the truth.
That's a good one.
Hey, no argument there, buddy but I'm talking about my messenger of truth.
My delivery system of honesty.
The way I tell her.
- Now, listen.
I could call her.
That's one.
- Okay.
It is okay, but just okay.
It lacks any real spark or imagination.
But it's effective.
Your voice on one end, hers on the other.
- "I'm dating Anna." She'll hear you.
- But the phone is a blunt instrument, no?
What about text messaging?
I could Blackberry her.
That feels very hip, it feels edgy, it feels 21 st century.
- Kind of cold.
- Mittens required, yes.
A carrier pigeon.
How cool would that be?
Think about it.
A little message in his cute little talons.
Summer's a pigeon fan.
- You're a coward.
- Am I?
Or am I just too sensitive to the feelings of others?
Coward, definitely.
Fine, I'll tell her Monday.
Actually, I think Tuesday.
I might give it till Friday.
That way she'll have the weekend to let it marinate...
- You could do it today.
- No.
Today will soon be tonight.
And tonight will be Rooney.
And Rooney will be awesome.
Rooney.
I saw them open for The Vines in L.A. Last year.
- Big whoop.
We're seeing them tonight.
- I thought it was sold out.
It happens they are.
But I also happen to be dialed in.
I got the hookups.
Or at least Oliver does.
And I'm gonna ride his coattails.
Oliver?
As in Oliver, the guy who wanted to kiss your girlfriend on New Year's?
- Morning, Hailey.
- It's not like that.
He's got a girlfriend.
Wait.
If he has a girlfriend, why is he always hanging out with yours?
- Couldn't tell you, but thanks.
- The guy seems cool, right?
I don't know.
We don't seem to have a lot in common.
- Besides your girlfriend.
- Keep twisting the knife.
Feels good.
Whatever.
He got us backstage passes.
Good enough for me.
Backstage?
So now you have to worry about your girl with Oliver and rock stars?
Mind if I finish cornflakes?
Hey, at least she asked.
It's a start.
Well, at least she's leaving the house.
It's a start.
- We'll have the place to ourselves.
- Yes.
We can eat bagels.
- And I can wear my robe.
- Or not.
I can have the remote back.
She's crammed that TiVo full of every E!
True Hollywood special.
- I think she's looking for tips.
- That's nice.
I'm just saying, she's cluttering up the TiVo.
And a clear TiVo equals a clear mind.
Are we okay with the kids going to that concert?
- Yeah.
- What if Rooney is, like death-metal Satan-worshipping speed freaks?
Honey, that went out in the late '90s.
I saw it on a special on E!
I'll run Rooney up my proverbial flagpole, but you have got to speak to Hailey.
So?
- Yeah, it's my first time hearing it, so...
- That's why we're doing a run-through.
- So you'll have heard it all before tonight.
- Right.
- So we're going tonight?
- No.
It's your first concert.
We have free tickets, backstage passes.
You're right, we should skip it.
- That's not what I'm saying.
- What are you saying?
- Have you met Natalie?
- No, but I hear she's great.
- And Oliver is...?
I mean...
- Is someone jealous?
This song is good.
Turn it up.
Really, really loud.
Oliver will be with Natalie.
Rooney is a really good band.
- And tonight we're gonna have fun.
- I know.
- There won't be dancing, right?
- I'll dance.
You can watch.
Works for me.
- I think that's enough.
- What?
There was almost a knee bend.
You were about to find the beat.
- And?
- Remember cousin Jeffery's bar mitzvah?
You almost wiped out a dozen kids on the dance floor.
That "Y.M.C.A." song requires a lot of movement.
- I'm just trying to spare casualties.
- So anyone gonna be doing drugs?
I hope so, otherwise it's a lame-ass concert.
Anyone named Seth gonna be doing any drugs?
No.
Nobody named Seth Cohen.
I promise.
Gotta stay sharp.
It's my first date with Anna.
It is?
So you and Summer finally had the talk?
Oh, yes, almost several times.
- Seth.
- Father.
The sooner you tell her, the better you'll feel about everything.
See, I don't really believe that.
I'm feeling like the longer I wait to tell her, the longer I'll feel great.
The best advice I can give you is this.
It's from Steven Seagal in his classic film Hard to Kill.
"The anticipation of death is far worse than death itself."
Great.
So then we both agree that Summer's gonna kill me.
Look, if you're old enough to go to a concert alone if you're old enough to embark on a real relationship you are old enough to be a man.
Well, she's not gonna be there tonight so I'll tell her Monday.
- Good.
Now, get going.
Your mother and I want some time alone.
There's a visual that I don't want to take with me tonight.
Well, son, your mom's a hottie, and I got her.
- I don't see him.
- Maybe he's inside.
- Excuse me, are you on the list?
- Yeah, we're with Oliver Trask.
- Who's Oliver Trask?
- You don't have his name?
No, I don't have his name.
I've never heard it.
That's why I'm asking.
- Thanks, you've been very helpful.
- I'll call him and see where he is.
- A lot of freaks here, huh, Cohen?
- Yeah.
Good job, Luke.
That should help make us a lot of friends.
- Damn it.
- What?
Well, dude, they're gonna go on soon.
If Oliver's late, we'll miss the first song.
They only have one album.
Factor in your standard cover, that's 12 songs.
Oh, no.
But, hey.
I mean, come on.
If we don't get in, we're still gonna have fun tonight.
- Right?
- What are we gonna do?
I hope you guys aren't waiting for me.
- Summer.
- Cohen.
- Hey, Anna.
- Summer.
- Who are you talking to?
- It just goes straight to voice mail.
Dude, look at that freak.
Hey, I drove alone.
Will you ride with me?
You want to give up so early?
Maybe I can grease a few palms.
Hey.
- There you are.
- What's up, man?
- Hi.
- I thought you were a no-show.
- What happened?
I said back door.
- No, you didn't.
- Load in here, guys.
- The band's here.
- It's all happening.
- What up, guys?
Robert, how's it going?
Good to see you.
Looking forward to the show.
- Thank you.
- I guess we're on time.
- Which one's Rooney?
- They're all Rooney.
- Hey, man, this is my posse.
- This is crazy.
- Hey.
So where's Natalie?
- Yeah, we had another fight.
This whole long-distance thing's tough.
Looks like I'm dateless tonight.
Hey, no!
No way.
We'll be your date, right?
Yeah, right.
- So should we fire up the hot tub?
- Interesting.
Open a bottle of wine.
Oh, I like it.
First, TiVo.
I'm gonna erase Hailey's programs.
- Hot pizza?
- Hailey.
Hey, guys.
You're just in time.
Doctor.
Doctor.
- James.
- What's up?
I just thought that you were going out tonight.
We were.
But then I found out there's a Golden Girls marathon on Lifetime.
And I decided to dig up all my favorite board games.
We're having a throwback to the old babysitting days.
- Why don't you guys join us?
- Great.
That would be great.
Oh, I love this episode.
This is the one where Rose adopts the pig.
She adopted the pig?
- Do you play?
- A little.
- Here, man.
- All access?
Sweet.
- Hey, it's cool?
- It's cool.
- Hey, check it out.
- Seriously?
Yeah.
Awesome.
I just got a few songs that I wrote.
Okay, I'm just gonna...
Seth, you have to tell her tonight.
- No, I don't.
- Hey.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- So, Luke, he's...
- Yeah, we don't let him out much.
Yeah.
But you guys are cool, having fun?
- Everything's awesome.
- Glad to hear it.
Yeah.
Everything is not awesome.
If I don't tell Summer tonight, then later, when I do tell her she'll remember the fun she had at Rooney.
That will cheer her up.
There's never gonna be a good time to tell her.
Tonight's not a bad night.
There's a lot of guys here.
Cute guys, older guys.
A lot of musicians.
Girls like musicians.
Maybe you're right.
Am I flattering myself to even think that Summer'll care?
I mean, me compared to that dude or that guy.
- Right.
- Are you checking out dudes again?
No.
But there are plenty here tonight, aren't there?
A lot of musicians.
In fact, I think I'm gonna go find some myself.
Why don't you and Seth talk.
You know, about anything.
- Cohen, you and Anna...?
- Me and Anna what?
What?
Will you guys stand with me at the concert?
Marissa's on a date, and I'm all alone tonight, so...
Okay, that would be nice.
Yeah.
Hey, man.
I thought your boy was supposed to be here an hour ago.
No.
Okay, no excuses.
I don't care who you send.
Just make sure it's good and it gets here quick.
All right.
I can't see.
I'm stuck behind a row of giants.
Come with me.
Okay, lead the way.
Sorry.
Hey.
Did you tell her?
What did she say?
Did she leave?
No.
Summer is bringing refreshments for her friends.
- Seth said you were thirsty.
- Yeah.
You are thirsty, aren't you?
- You suck.
- I'm sorry.
- I gotta pee.
You gotta pee?
- I'll come with you.
I'm telling her.
You know the night that Mom and Dad came home early from Palm Springs?
And we flushed all that beer down the toilet.
- A lot of good that did.
- I know.
Dad caught you throwing out the empty bottles.
- I thought you were sleeping.
- Face it, sister.
Everything I know, I learned from you.
You were a bad influence back in the day.
How do you think I learned to piss off Dad?
- The student becomes the master.
- And the master becomes Dad's slave.
Helping to turn paradise into a parking lot, or at least a three-car garage.
Hey, Connect Four!
Congratulations.
Next Saturday, Yahtzee.
No, wait.
Stay.
Battleship?
Uno?
You know, Sandy's right.
It's late.
And, besides, I have a show home waiting for me in the morning.
Just what Orange County needs.
Another show home.
Airlifted from the McMansion factory and dropped from the sky...
The one on the bluff, that's a great house.
If by "great" you mean overbuilt, overpriced and exactly like this one.
- Oh, nice.
Hailey, nice.
- I was kidding.
- I'm laughing on the inside.
- I'm not.
You're living in our home.
You're insulting my wife.
You're driving my whole family crazy.
- Is this true?
- Yeah.
And we all know what you're doing here.
She didn't mean anything.
It's just sisters.
No, all this talk about plans, about growing up, it's shtick.
It's a routine.
And it's tired.
You know who's tired?
Me.
So why don't we stop.
No, stop protecting her.
You're not even nice to Kirsten.
She's the only reason we put up with you.
Well, you won't have to put up with me for much longer, okay?
- Sorry?
- It's not your fault, Jimmy.
No, I meant the board game.
- You like The Golden Girls?
- Yes.
There's a marathon on.
I can't get the song out of my head.
I love The Golden Girls.
It's not Rose's fault.
She just is that way.
You're Rose?
I'm Blanche.
It's kind of weird that I relate to a 70-year-old, but...
How good was the episode when there was a blackout?
How about when Rose adopts the pig?
Then Sophia loses her glasses and thinks the pig is a baby.
It's so funny.
Jimmy, wait.
Sorry about that in there.
My little tantrum.
Oh, listen, it's complicated between you and your sister.
It always has been.
You gotta go, like, right now?
Yeah, I don't know if I ever told you, but I'm an extremely important person.
And so I have to...
Yeah.
No, Marissa's at a concert.
Yep, nothing but time.
Didn't tonight feel like the good old days?
No.
It was more like two kind of pathetic people grasping for the old days.
- Right.
That too.
- Yeah.
Look, the good old days.
They're exactly that.
Would you really want to be back in high school?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I would too.
- And you think I'm pathetic?
- Yes, I do.
It's sad, really.
I always had a crush on you.
You know that?
No.
You were 8 when I went away to college.
So I wasn't...
You're Kirsten's sister.
So I've heard all my life.
Look, we don't want to make a complicated situation even more complicated, right?
The last thing we need is having Sandy or Kirsten catching us.
Unless that's what you're hoping for.
Look, your sister is amazing and Sandy is such a great guy.
I think you're lucky to have them looking out for you.
I know that I am.
I'm gonna go.
Okay.
- Hi.
I'm gonna...
- Hey, this is great, right?
Perfect.
Come here a second.
- What are we doing?
- This is better.
Wait.
But we're missing the concert.
We can't ditch Oliver.
- Oliver's fine.
He's friends with the band.
- And with us.
I thought you said you wanted us to hang out with friends.
You've known him two weeks.
How good a friend can he be?
Look.
He's in recovery, trying to stay clean.
We can talk about stuff.
He tells me things.
What he's going through.
- Unlike me, right?
- I didn't say that.
I know you didn't want to come here tonight so, I mean, I guess if you want to leave...
Right.
Later.
Hey, Luke.
- You know who sings this song?
- Rooney.
- Rooney!
- We should keep it that way.
Yeah, Rooney!
What the hell, man?
!
Get off me!
- Hey, get off him!
- I'm a cop.
- What?
There's gotta be some mistake.
- Yeah.
His.
He just tried to buy 3 grams of coke from me.
Ryan, go back inside.
Don't tell anybody.
Excuse me, barkeep, sir.
- Hey.
- What can I get you?
How did you do that?
The usual.
- Mountain Dew.
- How many?
Unfortunately, three.
So Anna's telling Summer that we're a couple.
When they get back, I will officially be in a relationship with Anna.
Unless Summer kills me, in which case, you've been like a brother.
Good, because I need your keys and phone.
- Yeah, you okay?
- I'm fine.
It's Oliver.
- What?
What's going on?
- Tell you later?
All right.
You'll miss a hell of a show, though.
Rooney's not bad, either.
- Is Jimmy gone?
- Yeah.
Is she all right?
I knocked.
She didn't answer.
Maybe she's giving us the house back.
Or maybe she's packing and she'll be gone in the morning.
And frankly I'd rather have her here, where I can keep an eye on her, than anywhere else.
You can't keep her here forever.
It's no good for her and it's no good for us.
Hello?
Hey, what's wrong?
Where are you?
I'll be right there.
Ryan's at the police station.
Thank you, Newport Beach.
Good night, everybody.
- Seth.
- Hey.
- Where have you been?
- At the bar.
How was it?
It was amazing.
They played the whole album.
Not with Rooney, how did it go with Summer?
Did you tell her?
Tell me what?
So you're a couple?
- No.
- Yes.
We wanted to tell you first before we became a couple, which now we are.
- So you chose Anna?
- No.
Kind of, yeah.
She came over on New Year's Eve.
You were with me on New Year's Eve.
Technically, you were with that guy Allan, remember?
And you kept insisting that I go find someone to kiss, so I did.
I was taking out the garbage, she was in the driveway.
You know how it goes.
Okay, well, congrats.
You're not mad?
Good, because I didn't want this to affect our relationship in any way.
Well, Anna, I have to say that Rose would've never pulled that New Year's stunt on Blanche.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Although Blanche would've done it to Rose, so...
So can we still all hang out?
Will you be cool with that?
We'd both really like that if we could hang out.
Sure.
You guys, we can totally hang out.
I mean, in fact, what are you guys doing right now?
So they're gonna let him go.
- Really?
How'd you do that?
- I'm just that good.
- I used to play poker with these guys.
- Thanks for doing this.
- You didn't have to, really.
- Is this kid a friend of yours?
He's a friend of Marissa's.
They met in therapy.
He said he's been clean a while, but...
They busted him trying to buy coke.
Then he said his parents are away for a month.
Can you believe that?
A parent leaves a kid like that on his own.
Yeah, imagine that.
- I'll never understand it.
- I hope not.
- I'm glad you called me.
- Me too.
I'm gonna finish up your paperwork.
You sit tight.
I'll be right back.
So thanks.
Seth's dad seems cool.
He is.
So why'd you do this for me?
I mean, you don't even like me, man.
I don't really know you.
Well, if it's any consolation, I don't like myself very much right now, either.
- So, what happened?
- I don't know.
Natalie didn't show.
And then I saw you and Marissa.
Your friends.
Then it hit me.
I have no one.
My parents are gone.
My friends, if you can even call them that they all disappeared when I got clean.
Now I...
There's Marissa.
Seth likes your taste in music.
And Luke pretty much likes everybody at this point.
And what about you?
I mean, you must like me a little to get me out of jail.
No, that was Sandy.
Marissa.
You gonna tell her?
No.
You are.
Hey.
Yeah, it's Oliver.
Hey, whoa, hey, hey, hey!
- I can't have half?
- There are other bagels.
- Not salt bagels.
- You ate them all.
And several sesame.
I haven't been the best guest, I know.
- And what you said tonight...
- Hey, Connect Four was happening.
It gets my blood up.
Well, you were right.
So, what's the plan?
Hit Caleb up for more cash.
And then what?
- Europe this time?
Iceland?
Boca?
- I don't know.
You know, I see how happy you guys are, and I think, "Why can't I have that?"
- Because you don't want it.
- How do you know?
I don't even know what I want.
You could stay here.
I mean, not here exactly but, you know, get a home.
- A job.
Settle down.
- No.
See, that's the thing.
All I know is what I don't want.
Well, that's not entirely true.
And the rest you'll figure out.
Good night.
Good night.
- Hey.
- Hey.
No, wait, don't get up.
Thanks.
He's not a bad guy, Oliver.
He's...
This may come as a shock to you but right now, I don't want to talk about Oliver.
Oh, hey, wow, kissing.
Sorry about that.
We're gonna hang out inside, but you guys are obviously alone together so do that.
- Ryan, what happened to you?
- Luke, please, you're shouting.
- Someone stood too close to the speaker.
- Dude, that concert did not suck at all.
- We PlayStationing it, or what?
- Yeah.
Any time you want to join us.
Let's go before he wakes up your parents.
Think we can teach him to fetch?
I don't want to be the third wheel or watch you guys make out, so enjoy.
- Well, we could stay here.
- Yeah, but maybe we should...
Race you?
Cohen, you've played this game before?
See the way I ripped that guy's spine out?
Sitting right here, buddy.
I am so glad we all could hang out together like this, aren't you guys?
- Yeah.
- Damn it.
- Ryan, you're up.
- You're up, Ryan.
We'll make it best of five.
- Previously on The O.C.:
- Guess who's back.
- Aunt Hailey.
- Did she say why she was here?
- She's out of money.
- You can't keep living like this.
So I can grow up to be like you?
- He's really not my type.
- What's your type?
Seth Cohen?
I didn't want you to be alone on New Year's.
- I'm having a party.
- We're not going.
I'm not drinking.
Doesn't mean you can't.
- Clean and sober, 11 months.
- Your girlfriend's at a party, alone?
- Not alone, with a guy named Oliver.
- You broke up.
We're just not spending New Year's together.
I think it's just us tonight.
- She's eating us out of house and home.
- It's just a bagel.
No.
No, no, it's never just a bagel.
As someone who's basically been a shut-in for the last 17 years I can say with great authority that she never leaves the house.
- She's got nowhere else to go.
- Because her friends want to kick her ass.
- Sorry about the language.
- Why?
I'd like to kick her ass.
- Kirsten.
- Coming.
There's no more coffee.
Will you make some?
- The French roast, not the harvest blend.
- No, no, no.
I'll talk to her.
So I'll have to survive on English muffins.
Marissa?
Marissa?
Hello.
She's gotta be here somewhere.
- Hilarious.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Listen to me.
Hailey is always in the living room.
Marissa's always here.
I'm lost.
What happened to Seth-Ryan time?
That was quality time.
- Okay.
I know I've been a little bit...
- Whipped?
I'm not whipped.
- I'm free to talk now.
What's up?
- Squeezing me in before school?
Nice.
But actually, I'll take it.
Okay, here's the thing:
Anna and I are gonna take it to the next level.
I need advice.
- You're gonna have sex?
- No.
That's a good idea, though.
We're gonna tell Summer that we're dating.
As much as I fear Summer hurting me, with the rage blackouts and all I'm actually more scared about hurting her feelings.
We've become friends now, and I feel like I don't want to...
- You guys ready to go?
- Yeah.
We were just talking.
Really?
About what?
Guy stuff.
Hunting and shaving and shoes.
Actually, the cleats for the sports.
Okay, well, come on.
Hey, later, can we finish this chat?
Put in a little Seth-Ryan time?
Yes.
Absolutely, just gotta check with...
Oh, you forgot your balls.
- You and me.
Tonight.
- Come on.
- Are we one of those couples?
- Who lose all their friends?
And can't do anything without each other?
I don't think so.
You think so?
- That'd be good, a night apart.
- Yeah, plus, I'm kind of sick of you.
I'm sick of me too.
- I gotta go.
- Yeah.
And I got the...
- Walk me?
- I'll walk you.
- Don't make me.
- Don't make you what?
- Hurt you.
- Watch this.
Stop it.
- What's up?
- Hey.
What is up?
- I was talking to her.
- That's cool.
- Do you have plans this weekend?
- Nothing.
What Anna's trying to say is, she's not gonna do anything.
We're both not.
That's what we're both doing.
We're doing nothing.
But doing that by ourselves.
Thank you, Cohen.
You just reminded me that I need my bio textbook because we're studying monkeys.
Ouch.
I hate liars, and now I'm one of them.
I thought you were gonna talk to her.
I am gonna talk to her.
I don't know how.
- I'll tell her then.
- No.
I have to do it.
Tonight me and Ryan are gonna have a strategy meeting.
We're gonna figure out the whole thing.
- That makes me feel better.
- Then we'll be free to do this.
- Seth.
I have to study.
- And this.
I started my own business right out of college.
And now I'm a father of two and I've got one line on my r Ásum Á.
- Did you ever mow your lawn as a kid?
- Yeah.
Great. "Jimmy Cooper Landscaping," your first job.
- Now you're an entrepreneur.
- I don't even have references.
Sure you do, your clients whose money you stole.
Right.
- Is that Jimmy Cooper?
- Hey, Hailey!
You look fantastic.
How you doing?
She's got no jobs, no friends and no prospects.
- And I say that with love.
- Sounds like we got a lot in common.
- So did you guys have the talk?
- Yes.
We almost did.
We were having fun.
And all we've done is fight for so long.
It was nice to just hang out and be sisters.
- I'll find out if she has a plan.
- You know what her plan is.
She'll stay here and mooch off us until she can make a withdrawal from the Bank of Dad.
Then she'll take off again for a few years.
- She said she wasn't gonna do that.
- She's gonna mooch off us forever?
- She's not mooching.
- Oh, really?
Then how'd she get all those new clothes?
From the salary she doesn't make?
From the trust fund she drained?
- I bought you bagels.
- That fixes everything?
- Yes, it does.
- Sesame.
That's a start.
I'm gonna hide them.
So yeah.
Now I'm broke and sleeping at my sister's.
I'm broke and my wife is sleeping with your father.
Fantastic.
We've done well for ourselves.
Who knew back when Kirsten and I were babysitting you and you were watching Silver Spoons that we'd both turn out to be so...?
- Complicated.
- And it was Golden Girls.
- That's right.
You loved Golden Girls.
It's impressive that I was 10 and relating to the lives of 70-year-old women.
Blanche was 70?
She aged really well.
I'd love to hang, hear how you made such a mess of your life.
Same.
Although I bet your story doesn't involve a fistfight at cotillion.
No.
But I bet yours doesn't contain half a pound of hash and a border guard in Budapest.
No.
It's nice that you and Jimmy are friends again.
I guess I can't blame a guy for wanting to kiss my wife.
It feels like we never have any time alone anymore.
That's not true.
We have moments.
I want more moments.
- God, they're so whipped.
- I gotta go pick up Marissa.
- Sandy, thank you.
- Anytime.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yes.
Jimmy and I are gonna hang out tomorrow night, catch up.
- Hang out, like "out"?
- I bet you have a lot to catch up on.
- Tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow night.
Hey, man.
How's it going?
Got a flat tire.
You ran over a nail?
Somebody slashed it.
Want some help?
Thanks.
I got a spare in the back.
Hey, Luke, why doesn't your dad help you with that tire?
I'm sure he'd like to bend over.
- New Year's resolution.
Punch people less.
- I had the same one.
You think I'm getting what I deserve after years of being a jackass?
Definitely.
Hey, why don't we just get out of here.
The tire can wait.
Yeah, that sounds good.
Go.
Go, go, go.
Break that tackle.
Go.
Yeah!
Who plays PlayStation for the sports games?
Listen to me.
You said Seth-Ryan time.
This isn't Seth-Ryan time.
This is Seth-Luke-Ryan time, and you know what?
Guess what.
- There's no such thing.
- Maybe Luke will have some good advice.
What does that guy know about juggling women?
Come on.
Okay, quite a bit.
But he wasn't good at it.
He's having a bad day.
I'm having a bad day, okay?
I'm having a bad week.
Some kids at school slashed his tires.
Damn it.
What do you think he wants on his pizza?
Hey, Cohen.
Check out the replay on this tackle.
I broke this bitch in half.
Luke has a gay dad.
Luke has a gay dad.
Can't wait to see it, buddy.
- Hello?
- Hey.
I'm at Oliver's, and he just ordered way too much food.
I know you wanted to spend tonight apart but he asked if you would come by.
- You're at Oliver's?
- Summer had plans.
I saw Oliver at therapy.
He said if I wanted...
- That's so good.
- It's Moroccan.
- What's Moroccan?
- The food.
Just come.
Okay?
See you soon.
How do you guys feel about Moroccan?
I think I really hurt that guy.
- Hey, where's the silverware?
- Moroccan you eat with your hands.
No wonder Luke seems to be enjoying it so much.
- How good is the couscous?
- Amazing.
- It's pretty good.
- No, that's the kefta.
Couscous is the other thing.
I can't believe you live in a penthouse.
This place is "ridonculous."
It's always been my fantasy to live in a hotel.
Like Eloise.
Yeah, well, I guess.
But with my parents traveling so much it can get a little lonely.
- Lf you ever need any company...
- Thanks.
They might be gone a while, opening a new hotel in Paris.
I love Paris.
I could spend all day walking the Champs Elys Áes.
I like Paris.
I love baguettes.
Dude, French chicks don't even shave their armpits.
- Have you ever been to Paris, Ryan?
- No, not yet.
- I hear the Louvre's cool.
- Do not go near it.
Totally overrated.
The Mona Lisa's the size of a postage stamp.
Now, the Rodin Museum and the Mus Áe Picasso...
But you know where my family's been spending most of their time?
Switzerland.
- Snowboarding the Alps is unreal.
- You boarded the Alps?
The closest I've ever come is Whistler.
We have a place in Big Bear.
We should go one weekend.
- Could you teach Ryan to board?
- Lf you can get him on a chair lift.
First two days, you'll be on your ass, but we'll get you there.
- I really like this song.
- You know, they're playing tomorrow.
- Yeah, but it's all sold out.
- Do you wanna go?
Yeah, but it's all sold out.
I'll call their manager tomorrow.
They're amazing live.
- You know Rooney?
- That would be awesome.
I've never heard of them, but I got nothing.
I'll go.
Ryan?
- Come on, we'll all get to hang out.
- It'll be fun.
- Cool.
- All right, then it's settled.
We're going.
- Groovy.
- Hey, nice.
This is gonna be great.
So now you're eating with silverware?
Next thing, I'll see you at the Louvre.
No, you won't, because, like Oliver said, it's lame.
Can we please focus on the crisis at hand for one second?
Okay?
Summer.
The way I figure it, I have many options.
Like the truth.
That's a good one.
Hey, no argument there, buddy but I'm talking about my messenger of truth.
My delivery system of honesty.
The way I tell her.
- Now, listen.
I could call her.
That's one.
- Okay.
It is okay, but just okay.
It lacks any real spark or imagination.
But it's effective.
Your voice on one end, hers on the other.
- "I'm dating Anna." She'll hear you.
- But the phone is a blunt instrument, no?
What about text messaging?
I could Blackberry her.
That feels very hip, it feels edgy, it feels 21 st century.
- Kind of cold.
- Mittens required, yes.
A carrier pigeon.
How cool would that be?
Think about it.
A little message in his cute little talons.
Summer's a pigeon fan.
- You're a coward.
- Am I?
Or am I just too sensitive to the feelings of others?
Coward, definitely.
Fine, I'll tell her Monday.
Actually, I think Tuesday.
I might give it till Friday.
That way she'll have the weekend to let it marinate...
- You could do it today.
- No.
Today will soon be tonight.
And tonight will be Rooney.
And Rooney will be awesome.
Rooney.
I saw them open for The Vines in L.A. Last year.
- Big whoop.
We're seeing them tonight.
- I thought it was sold out.
It happens they are.
But I also happen to be dialed in.
I got the hookups.
Or at least Oliver does.
And I'm gonna ride his coattails.
Oliver?
As in Oliver, the guy who wanted to kiss your girlfriend on New Year's?
- Morning, Hailey.
- It's not like that.
He's got a girlfriend.
Wait.
If he has a girlfriend, why is he always hanging out with yours?
- Couldn't tell you, but thanks.
- The guy seems cool, right?
I don't know.
We don't seem to have a lot in common.
- Besides your girlfriend.
- Keep twisting the knife.
Feels good.
Whatever.
He got us backstage passes.
Good enough for me.
Backstage?
So now you have to worry about your girl with Oliver and rock stars?
Mind if I finish cornflakes?
Hey, at least she asked.
It's a start.
Well, at least she's leaving the house.
It's a start.
- We'll have the place to ourselves.
- Yes.
We can eat bagels.
- And I can wear my robe.
- Or not.
I can have the remote back.
She's crammed that TiVo full of every E!
True Hollywood special.
- I think she's looking for tips.
- That's nice.
I'm just saying, she's cluttering up the TiVo.
And a clear TiVo equals a clear mind.
Are we okay with the kids going to that concert?
- Yeah.
- What if Rooney is, like death-metal Satan-worshipping speed freaks?
Honey, that went out in the late '90s.
I saw it on a special on E!
I'll run Rooney up my proverbial flagpole, but you have got to speak to Hailey.
So?
- Yeah, it's my first time hearing it, so...
- That's why we're doing a run-through.
- So you'll have heard it all before tonight.
- Right.
- So we're going tonight?
- No.
It's your first concert.
We have free tickets, backstage passes.
You're right, we should skip it.
- That's not what I'm saying.
- What are you saying?
- Have you met Natalie?
- No, but I hear she's great.
- And Oliver is...?
I mean...
- Is someone jealous?
This song is good.
Turn it up.
Really, really loud.
Oliver will be with Natalie.
Rooney is a really good band.
- And tonight we're gonna have fun.
- I know.
- There won't be dancing, right?
- I'll dance.
You can watch.
Works for me.
- I think that's enough.
- What?
There was almost a knee bend.
You were about to find the beat.
- And?
- Remember cousin Jeffery's bar mitzvah?
You almost wiped out a dozen kids on the dance floor.
That "Y.M.C.A." song requires a lot of movement.
- I'm just trying to spare casualties.
- So anyone gonna be doing drugs?
I hope so, otherwise it's a lame-ass concert.
Anyone named Seth gonna be doing any drugs?
No.
Nobody named Seth Cohen.
I promise.
Gotta stay sharp.
It's my first date with Anna.
It is?
So you and Summer finally had the talk?
Oh, yes, almost several times.
- Seth.
- Father.
The sooner you tell her, the better you'll feel about everything.
See, I don't really believe that.
I'm feeling like the longer I wait to tell her, the longer I'll feel great.
The best advice I can give you is this.
It's from Steven Seagal in his classic film Hard to Kill.
"The anticipation of death is far worse than death itself."
Great.
So then we both agree that Summer's gonna kill me.
Look, if you're old enough to go to a concert alone if you're old enough to embark on a real relationship you are old enough to be a man.
Well, she's not gonna be there tonight so I'll tell her Monday.
- Good.
Now, get going.
Your mother and I want some time alone.
There's a visual that I don't want to take with me tonight.
Well, son, your mom's a hottie, and I got her.
- I don't see him.
- Maybe he's inside.
- Excuse me, are you on the list?
- Yeah, we're with Oliver Trask.
- Who's Oliver Trask?
- You don't have his name?
No, I don't have his name.
I've never heard it.
That's why I'm asking.
- Thanks, you've been very helpful.
- I'll call him and see where he is.
- A lot of freaks here, huh, Cohen?
- Yeah.
Good job, Luke.
That should help make us a lot of friends.
- Damn it.
- What?
Well, dude, they're gonna go on soon.
If Oliver's late, we'll miss the first song.
They only have one album.
Factor in your standard cover, that's 12 songs.
Oh, no.
But, hey.
I mean, come on.
If we don't get in, we're still gonna have fun tonight.
- Right?
- What are we gonna do?
I hope you guys aren't waiting for me.
- Summer.
- Cohen.
- Hey, Anna.
- Summer.
- Who are you talking to?
- It just goes straight to voice mail.
Dude, look at that freak.
Hey, I drove alone.
Will you ride with me?
You want to give up so early?
Maybe I can grease a few palms.
Hey.
- There you are.
- What's up, man?
- Hi.
- I thought you were a no-show.
- What happened?
I said back door.
- No, you didn't.
- Load in here, guys.
- The band's here.
- It's all happening.
- What up, guys?
Robert, how's it going?
Good to see you.
Looking forward to the show.
- Thank you.
- I guess we're on time.
- Which one's Rooney?
- They're all Rooney.
- Hey, man, this is my posse.
- This is crazy.
- Hey.
So where's Natalie?
- Yeah, we had another fight.
This whole long-distance thing's tough.
Looks like I'm dateless tonight.
Hey, no!
No way.
We'll be your date, right?
Yeah, right.
- So should we fire up the hot tub?
- Interesting.
Open a bottle of wine.
Oh, I like it.
First, TiVo.
I'm gonna erase Hailey's programs.
- Hot pizza?
- Hailey.
Hey, guys.
You're just in time.
Doctor.
Doctor.
- James.
- What's up?
I just thought that you were going out tonight.
We were.
But then I found out there's a Golden Girls marathon on Lifetime.
And I decided to dig up all my favorite board games.
We're having a throwback to the old babysitting days.
- Why don't you guys join us?
- Great.
That would be great.
Oh, I love this episode.
This is the one where Rose adopts the pig.
She adopted the pig?
- Do you play?
- A little.
- Here, man.
- All access?
Sweet.
- Hey, it's cool?
- It's cool.
- Hey, check it out.
- Seriously?
Yeah.
Awesome.
I just got a few songs that I wrote.
Okay, I'm just gonna...
Seth, you have to tell her tonight.
- No, I don't.
- Hey.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- So, Luke, he's...
- Yeah, we don't let him out much.
Yeah.
But you guys are cool, having fun?
- Everything's awesome.
- Glad to hear it.
Yeah.
Everything is not awesome.
If I don't tell Summer tonight, then later, when I do tell her she'll remember the fun she had at Rooney.
That will cheer her up.
There's never gonna be a good time to tell her.
Tonight's not a bad night.
There's a lot of guys here.
Cute guys, older guys.
A lot of musicians.
Girls like musicians.
Maybe you're right.
Am I flattering myself to even think that Summer'll care?
I mean, me compared to that dude or that guy.
- Right.
- Are you checking out dudes again?
No.
But there are plenty here tonight, aren't there?
A lot of musicians.
In fact, I think I'm gonna go find some myself.
Why don't you and Seth talk.
You know, about anything.
- Cohen, you and Anna...?
- Me and Anna what?
What?
Will you guys stand with me at the concert?
Marissa's on a date, and I'm all alone tonight, so...
Okay, that would be nice.
Yeah.
Hey, man.
I thought your boy was supposed to be here an hour ago.
No.
Okay, no excuses.
I don't care who you send.
Just make sure it's good and it gets here quick.
All right.
I can't see.
I'm stuck behind a row of giants.
Come with me.
Okay, lead the way.
Sorry.
Hey.
Did you tell her?
What did she say?
Did she leave?
No.
Summer is bringing refreshments for her friends.
- Seth said you were thirsty.
- Yeah.
You are thirsty, aren't you?
- You suck.
- I'm sorry.
- I gotta pee.
You gotta pee?
- I'll come with you.
I'm telling her.
You know the night that Mom and Dad came home early from Palm Springs?
And we flushed all that beer down the toilet.
- A lot of good that did.
- I know.
Dad caught you throwing out the empty bottles.
- I thought you were sleeping.
- Face it, sister.
Everything I know, I learned from you.
You were a bad influence back in the day.
How do you think I learned to piss off Dad?
- The student becomes the master.
- And the master becomes Dad's slave.
Helping to turn paradise into a parking lot, or at least a three-car garage.
Hey, Connect Four!
Congratulations.
Next Saturday, Yahtzee.
No, wait.
Stay.
Battleship?
Uno?
You know, Sandy's right.
It's late.
And, besides, I have a show home waiting for me in the morning.
Just what Orange County needs.
Another show home.
Airlifted from the McMansion factory and dropped from the sky...
The one on the bluff, that's a great house.
If by "great" you mean overbuilt, overpriced and exactly like this one.
- Oh, nice.
Hailey, nice.
- I was kidding.
- I'm laughing on the inside.
- I'm not.
You're living in our home.
You're insulting my wife.
You're driving my whole family crazy.
- Is this true?
- Yeah.
And we all know what you're doing here.
She didn't mean anything.
It's just sisters.
No, all this talk about plans, about growing up, it's shtick.
It's a routine.
And it's tired.
You know who's tired?
Me.
So why don't we stop.
No, stop protecting her.
You're not even nice to Kirsten.
She's the only reason we put up with you.
Well, you won't have to put up with me for much longer, okay?
- Sorry?
- It's not your fault, Jimmy.
No, I meant the board game.
- You like The Golden Girls?
- Yes.
There's a marathon on.
I can't get the song out of my head.
I love The Golden Girls.
It's not Rose's fault.
She just is that way.
You're Rose?
I'm Blanche.
It's kind of weird that I relate to a 70-year-old, but...
How good was the episode when there was a blackout?
How about when Rose adopts the pig?
Then Sophia loses her glasses and thinks the pig is a baby.
It's so funny.
Jimmy, wait.
Sorry about that in there.
My little tantrum.
Oh, listen, it's complicated between you and your sister.
It always has been.
You gotta go, like, right now?
Yeah, I don't know if I ever told you, but I'm an extremely important person.
And so I have to...
Yeah.
No, Marissa's at a concert.
Yep, nothing but time.
Didn't tonight feel like the good old days?
No.
It was more like two kind of pathetic people grasping for the old days.
- Right.
That too.
- Yeah.
Look, the good old days.
They're exactly that.
Would you really want to be back in high school?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I would too.
- And you think I'm pathetic?
- Yes, I do.
It's sad, really.
I always had a crush on you.
You know that?
No.
You were 8 when I went away to college.
So I wasn't...
You're Kirsten's sister.
So I've heard all my life.
Look, we don't want to make a complicated situation even more complicated, right?
The last thing we need is having Sandy or Kirsten catching us.
Unless that's what you're hoping for.
Look, your sister is amazing and Sandy is such a great guy.
I think you're lucky to have them looking out for you.
I know that I am.
I'm gonna go.
Okay.
- Hi.
I'm gonna...
- Hey, this is great, right?
Perfect.
Come here a second.
- What are we doing?
- This is better.
Wait.
But we're missing the concert.
We can't ditch Oliver.
- Oliver's fine.
He's friends with the band.
- And with us.
I thought you said you wanted us to hang out with friends.
You've known him two weeks.
How good a friend can he be?
Look.
He's in recovery, trying to stay clean.
We can talk about stuff.
He tells me things.
What he's going through.
- Unlike me, right?
- I didn't say that.
I know you didn't want to come here tonight so, I mean, I guess if you want to leave...
Right.
Later.
Hey, Luke.
- You know who sings this song?
- Rooney.
- Rooney!
- We should keep it that way.
Yeah, Rooney!
What the hell, man?
!
Get off me!
- Hey, get off him!
- I'm a cop.
- What?
There's gotta be some mistake.
- Yeah.
His.
He just tried to buy 3 grams of coke from me.
Ryan, go back inside.
Don't tell anybody.
Excuse me, barkeep, sir.
- Hey.
- What can I get you?
How did you do that?
The usual.
- Mountain Dew.
- How many?
Unfortunately, three.
So Anna's telling Summer that we're a couple.
When they get back, I will officially be in a relationship with Anna.
Unless Summer kills me, in which case, you've been like a brother.
Good, because I need your keys and phone.
- Yeah, you okay?
- I'm fine.
It's Oliver.
- What?
What's going on?
- Tell you later?
All right.
You'll miss a hell of a show, though.
Rooney's not bad, either.
- Is Jimmy gone?
- Yeah.
Is she all right?
I knocked.
She didn't answer.
Maybe she's giving us the house back.
Or maybe she's packing and she'll be gone in the morning.
And frankly I'd rather have her here, where I can keep an eye on her, than anywhere else.
You can't keep her here forever.
It's no good for her and it's no good for us.
Hello?
Hey, what's wrong?
Where are you?
I'll be right there.
Ryan's at the police station.
Thank you, Newport Beach.
Good night, everybody.
- Seth.
- Hey.
- Where have you been?
- At the bar.
How was it?
It was amazing.
They played the whole album.
Not with Rooney, how did it go with Summer?
Did you tell her?
Tell me what?
So you're a couple?
- No.
- Yes.
We wanted to tell you first before we became a couple, which now we are.
- So you chose Anna?
- No.
Kind of, yeah.
She came over on New Year's Eve.
You were with me on New Year's Eve.
Technically, you were with that guy Allan, remember?
And you kept insisting that I go find someone to kiss, so I did.
I was taking out the garbage, she was in the driveway.
You know how it goes.
Okay, well, congrats.
You're not mad?
Good, because I didn't want this to affect our relationship in any way.
Well, Anna, I have to say that Rose would've never pulled that New Year's stunt on Blanche.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Although Blanche would've done it to Rose, so...
So can we still all hang out?
Will you be cool with that?
We'd both really like that if we could hang out.
Sure.
You guys, we can totally hang out.
I mean, in fact, what are you guys doing right now?
So they're gonna let him go.
- Really?
How'd you do that?
- I'm just that good.
- I used to play poker with these guys.
- Thanks for doing this.
- You didn't have to, really.
- Is this kid a friend of yours?
He's a friend of Marissa's.
They met in therapy.
He said he's been clean a while, but...
They busted him trying to buy coke.
Then he said his parents are away for a month.
Can you believe that?
A parent leaves a kid like that on his own.
Yeah, imagine that.
- I'll never understand it.
- I hope not.
- I'm glad you called me.
- Me too.
I'm gonna finish up your paperwork.
You sit tight.
I'll be right back.
So thanks.
Seth's dad seems cool.
He is.
So why'd you do this for me?
I mean, you don't even like me, man.
I don't really know you.
Well, if it's any consolation, I don't like myself very much right now, either.
- So, what happened?
- I don't know.
Natalie didn't show.
And then I saw you and Marissa.
Your friends.
Then it hit me.
I have no one.
My parents are gone.
My friends, if you can even call them that they all disappeared when I got clean.
Now I...
There's Marissa.
Seth likes your taste in music.
And Luke pretty much likes everybody at this point.
And what about you?
I mean, you must like me a little to get me out of jail.
No, that was Sandy.
Marissa.
You gonna tell her?
No.
You are.
Hey.
Yeah, it's Oliver.
Hey, whoa, hey, hey, hey!
- I can't have half?
- There are other bagels.
- Not salt bagels.
- You ate them all.
And several sesame.
I haven't been the best guest, I know.
- And what you said tonight...
- Hey, Connect Four was happening.
It gets my blood up.
Well, you were right.
So, what's the plan?
Hit Caleb up for more cash.
And then what?
- Europe this time?
Iceland?
Boca?
- I don't know.
You know, I see how happy you guys are, and I think, "Why can't I have that?"
- Because you don't want it.
- How do you know?
I don't even know what I want.
You could stay here.
I mean, not here exactly but, you know, get a home.
- A job.
Settle down.
- No.
See, that's the thing.
All I know is what I don't want.
Well, that's not entirely true.
And the rest you'll figure out.
Good night.
Good night.
- Hey.
- Hey.
No, wait, don't get up.
Thanks.
He's not a bad guy, Oliver.
He's...
This may come as a shock to you but right now, I don't want to talk about Oliver.
Oh, hey, wow, kissing.
Sorry about that.
We're gonna hang out inside, but you guys are obviously alone together so do that.
- Ryan, what happened to you?
- Luke, please, you're shouting.
- Someone stood too close to the speaker.
- Dude, that concert did not suck at all.
- We PlayStationing it, or what?
- Yeah.
Any time you want to join us.
Let's go before he wakes up your parents.
Think we can teach him to fetch?
I don't want to be the third wheel or watch you guys make out, so enjoy.
- Well, we could stay here.
- Yeah, but maybe we should...
Race you?
Cohen, you've played this game before?
See the way I ripped that guy's spine out?
Sitting right here, buddy.
I am so glad we all could hang out together like this, aren't you guys?
- Yeah.
- Damn it.
- Ryan, you're up.
- You're up, Ryan.
We'll make it best of five.
- Previously on The O.C.:
- Guess who's back.
- Aunt Hailey.
- Did she say why she was here?
- She's out of money.
- You can't keep living like this.
So I can grow up to be like you?
- He's really not my type.
- What's your type?
Seth Cohen?
I didn't want you to be alone on New Year's.
- I'm having a party.
- We're not going.
I'm not drinking.
Doesn't mean you can't.
- Clean and sober, 11 months.
- Your girlfriend's at a party, alone?
- Not alone, with a guy named Oliver.
- You broke up.
We're just not spending New Year's together.
I think it's just us tonight.
- She's eating us out of house and home.
- It's just a bagel.
No.
No, no, it's never just a bagel.
As someone who's basically been a shut-in for the last 17 years I can say with great authority that she never leaves the house.
- She's got nowhere else to go.
- Because her friends want to kick her ass.
- Sorry about the language.
- Why?
I'd like to kick her ass.
- Kirsten.
- Coming.
There's no more coffee.
Will you make some?
- The French roast, not the harvest blend.
- No, no, no.
I'll talk to her.
So I'll have to survive on English muffins.
Marissa?
Marissa?
Hello.
She's gotta be here somewhere.
- Hilarious.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Listen to me.
Hailey is always in the living room.
Marissa's always here.
I'm lost.
What happened to Seth-Ryan time?
That was quality time.
- Okay.
I know I've been a little bit...
- Whipped?
I'm not whipped.
- I'm free to talk now.
What's up?
- Squeezing me in before school?
Nice.
But actually, I'll take it.
Okay, here's the thing:
Anna and I are gonna take it to the next level.
I need advice.
- You're gonna have sex?
- No.
That's a good idea, though.
We're gonna tell Summer that we're dating.
As much as I fear Summer hurting me, with the rage blackouts and all I'm actually more scared about hurting her feelings.
We've become friends now, and I feel like I don't want to...
- You guys ready to go?
- Yeah.
We were just talking.
Really?
About what?
Guy stuff.
Hunting and shaving and shoes.
Actually, the cleats for the sports.
Okay, well, come on.
Hey, later, can we finish this chat?
Put in a little Seth-Ryan time?
Yes.
Absolutely, just gotta check with...
Oh, you forgot your balls.
- You and me.
Tonight.
- Come on.
- Are we one of those couples?
- Who lose all their friends?
And can't do anything without each other?
I don't think so.
You think so?
- That'd be good, a night apart.
- Yeah, plus, I'm kind of sick of you.
I'm sick of me too.
- I gotta go.
- Yeah.
And I got the...
- Walk me?
- I'll walk you.
- Don't make me.
- Don't make you what?
- Hurt you.
- Watch this.
Stop it.
- What's up?
- Hey.
What is up?
- I was talking to her.
- That's cool.
- Do you have plans this weekend?
- Nothing.
What Anna's trying to say is, she's not gonna do anything.
We're both not.
That's what we're both doing.
We're doing nothing.
But doing that by ourselves.
Thank you, Cohen.
You just reminded me that I need my bio textbook because we're studying monkeys.
Ouch.
I hate liars, and now I'm one of them.
I thought you were gonna talk to her.
I am gonna talk to her.
I don't know how.
- I'll tell her then.
- No.
I have to do it.
Tonight me and Ryan are gonna have a strategy meeting.
We're gonna figure out the whole thing.
- That makes me feel better.
- Then we'll be free to do this.
- Seth.
I have to study.
- And this.
I started my own business right out of college.
And now I'm a father of two and I've got one line on my r Ásum Á.
- Did you ever mow your lawn as a kid?
- Yeah.
Great. "Jimmy Cooper Landscaping," your first job.
- Now you're an entrepreneur.
- I don't even have references.
Sure you do, your clients whose money you stole.
Right.
- Is that Jimmy Cooper?
- Hey, Hailey!
You look fantastic.
How you doing?
She's got no jobs, no friends and no prospects.
- And I say that with love.
- Sounds like we got a lot in common.
- So did you guys have the talk?
- Yes.
We almost did.
We were having fun.
And all we've done is fight for so long.
It was nice to just hang out and be sisters.
- I'll find out if she has a plan.
- You know what her plan is.
She'll stay here and mooch off us until she can make a withdrawal from the Bank of Dad.
Then she'll take off again for a few years.
- She said she wasn't gonna do that.
- She's gonna mooch off us forever?
- She's not mooching.
- Oh, really?
Then how'd she get all those new clothes?
From the salary she doesn't make?
From the trust fund she drained?
- I bought you bagels.
- That fixes everything?
- Yes, it does.
- Sesame.
That's a start.
I'm gonna hide them.
So yeah.
Now I'm broke and sleeping at my sister's.
I'm broke and my wife is sleeping with your father.
Fantastic.
We've done well for ourselves.
Who knew back when Kirsten and I were babysitting you and you were watching Silver Spoons that we'd both turn out to be so...?
- Complicated.
- And it was Golden Girls.
- That's right.
You loved Golden Girls.
It's impressive that I was 10 and relating to the lives of 70-year-old women.
Blanche was 70?
She aged really well.
I'd love to hang, hear how you made such a mess of your life.
Same.
Although I bet your story doesn't involve a fistfight at cotillion.
No.
But I bet yours doesn't contain half a pound of hash and a border guard in Budapest.
No.
It's nice that you and Jimmy are friends again.
I guess I can't blame a guy for wanting to kiss my wife.
It feels like we never have any time alone anymore.
That's not true.
We have moments.
I want more moments.
- God, they're so whipped.
- I gotta go pick up Marissa.
- Sandy, thank you.
- Anytime.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yes.
Jimmy and I are gonna hang out tomorrow night, catch up.
- Hang out, like "out"?
- I bet you have a lot to catch up on.
- Tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow night.
Hey, man.
How's it going?
Got a flat tire.
You ran over a nail?
Somebody slashed it.
Want some help?
Thanks.
I got a spare in the back.
Hey, Luke, why doesn't your dad help you with that tire?
I'm sure he'd like to bend over.
- New Year's resolution.
Punch people less.
- I had the same one.
You think I'm getting what I deserve after years of being a jackass?
Definitely.
Hey, why don't we just get out of here.
The tire can wait.
Yeah, that sounds good.
Go.
Go, go, go.
Break that tackle.
Go.
Yeah!
Who plays PlayStation for the sports games?
Listen to me.
You said Seth-Ryan time.
This isn't Seth-Ryan time.
This is Seth-Luke-Ryan time, and you know what?
Guess what.
- There's no such thing.
- Maybe Luke will have some good advice.
What does that guy know about juggling women?
Come on.
Okay, quite a bit.
But he wasn't good at it.
He's having a bad day.
I'm having a bad day, okay?
I'm having a bad week.
Some kids at school slashed his tires.
Damn it.
What do you think he wants on his pizza?
Hey, Cohen.
Check out the replay on this tackle.
I broke this bitch in half.
Luke has a gay dad.
Luke has a gay dad.
Can't wait to see it, buddy.
- Hello?
- Hey.
I'm at Oliver's, and he just ordered way too much food.
I know you wanted to spend tonight apart but he asked if you would come by.
- You're at Oliver's?
- Summer had plans.
I saw Oliver at therapy.
He said if I wanted...
- That's so good.
- It's Moroccan.
- What's Moroccan?
- The food.
Just come.
Okay?
See you soon.
How do you guys feel about Moroccan?
I think I really hurt that guy.
- Hey, where's the silverware?
- Moroccan you eat with your hands.
No wonder Luke seems to be enjoying it so much.
- How good is the couscous?
- Amazing.
- It's pretty good.
- No, that's the kefta.
Couscous is the other thing.
I can't believe you live in a penthouse.
This place is "ridonculous."
It's always been my fantasy to live in a hotel.
Like Eloise.
Yeah, well, I guess.
But with my parents traveling so much it can get a little lonely.
- Lf you ever need any company...
- Thanks.
They might be gone a while, opening a new hotel in Paris.
I love Paris.
I could spend all day walking the Champs Elys Áes.
I like Paris.
I love baguettes.
Dude, French chicks don't even shave their armpits.
- Have you ever been to Paris, Ryan?
- No, not yet.
- I hear the Louvre's cool.
- Do not go near it.
Totally overrated.
The Mona Lisa's the size of a postage stamp.
Now, the Rodin Museum and the Mus Áe Picasso...
But you know where my family's been spending most of their time?
Switzerland.
- Snowboarding the Alps is unreal.
- You boarded the Alps?
The closest I've ever come is Whistler.
We have a place in Big Bear.
We should go one weekend.
- Could you teach Ryan to board?
- Lf you can get him on a chair lift.
First two days, you'll be on your ass, but we'll get you there.
- I really like this song.
- You know, they're playing tomorrow.
- Yeah, but it's all sold out.
- Do you wanna go?
Yeah, but it's all sold out.
I'll call their manager tomorrow.
They're amazing live.
- You know Rooney?
- That would be awesome.
I've never heard of them, but I got nothing.
I'll go.
Ryan?
- Come on, we'll all get to hang out.
- It'll be fun.
- Cool.
- All right, then it's settled.
We're going.
- Groovy.
- Hey, nice.
This is gonna be great.
So now you're eating with silverware?
Next thing, I'll see you at the Louvre.
No, you won't, because, like Oliver said, it's lame.
Can we please focus on the crisis at hand for one second?
Okay?
Summer.
The way I figure it, I have many options.
Like the truth.
That's a good one.
Hey, no argument there, buddy but I'm talking about my messenger of truth.
My delivery system of honesty.
The way I tell her.
- Now, listen.
I could call her.
That's one.
- Okay.
It is okay, but just okay.
It lacks any real spark or imagination.
But it's effective.
Your voice on one end, hers on the other.
- "I'm dating Anna." She'll hear you.
- But the phone is a blunt instrument, no?
What about text messaging?
I could Blackberry her.
That feels very hip, it feels edgy, it feels 21 st century.
- Kind of cold.
- Mittens required, yes.
A carrier pigeon.
How cool would that be?
Think about it.
A little message in his cute little talons.
Summer's a pigeon fan.
- You're a coward.
- Am I?
Or am I just too sensitive to the feelings of others?
Coward, definitely.
Fine, I'll tell her Monday.
Actually, I think Tuesday.
I might give it till Friday.
That way she'll have the weekend to let it marinate...
- You could do it today.
- No.
Today will soon be tonight.
And tonight will be Rooney.
And Rooney will be awesome.
Rooney.
I saw them open for The Vines in L.A. Last year.
- Big whoop.
We're seeing them tonight.
- I thought it was sold out.
It happens they are.
But I also happen to be dialed in.
I got the hookups.
Or at least Oliver does.
And I'm gonna ride his coattails.
Oliver?
As in Oliver, the guy who wanted to kiss your girlfriend on New Year's?
- Morning, Hailey.
- It's not like that.
He's got a girlfriend.
Wait.
If he has a girlfriend, why is he always hanging out with yours?
- Couldn't tell you, but thanks.
- The guy seems cool, right?
I don't know.
We don't seem to have a lot in common.
- Besides your girlfriend.
- Keep twisting the knife.
Feels good.
Whatever.
He got us backstage passes.
Good enough for me.
Backstage?
So now you have to worry about your girl with Oliver and rock stars?
Mind if I finish cornflakes?
Hey, at least she asked.
It's a start.
Well, at least she's leaving the house.
It's a start.
- We'll have the place to ourselves.
- Yes.
We can eat bagels.
- And I can wear my robe.
- Or not.
I can have the remote back.
She's crammed that TiVo full of every E!
True Hollywood special.
- I think she's looking for tips.
- That's nice.
I'm just saying, she's cluttering up the TiVo.
And a clear TiVo equals a clear mind.
Are we okay with the kids going to that concert?
- Yeah.
- What if Rooney is, like death-metal Satan-worshipping speed freaks?
Honey, that went out in the late '90s.
I saw it on a special on E!
I'll run Rooney up my proverbial flagpole, but you have got to speak to Hailey.
So?
- Yeah, it's my first time hearing it, so...
- That's why we're doing a run-through.
- So you'll have heard it all before tonight.
- Right.
- So we're going tonight?
- No.
It's your first concert.
We have free tickets, backstage passes.
You're right, we should skip it.
- That's not what I'm saying.
- What are you saying?
- Have you met Natalie?
- No, but I hear she's great.
- And Oliver is...?
I mean...
- Is someone jealous?
This song is good.
Turn it up.
Really, really loud.
Oliver will be with Natalie.
Rooney is a really good band.
- And tonight we're gonna have fun.
- I know.
- There won't be dancing, right?
- I'll dance.
You can watch.
Works for me.
- I think that's enough.
- What?
There was almost a knee bend.
You were about to find the beat.
- And?
- Remember cousin Jeffery's bar mitzvah?
You almost wiped out a dozen kids on the dance floor.
That "Y.M.C.A." song requires a lot of movement.
- I'm just trying to spare casualties.
- So anyone gonna be doing drugs?
I hope so, otherwise it's a lame-ass concert.
Anyone named Seth gonna be doing any drugs?
No.
Nobody named Seth Cohen.
I promise.
Gotta stay sharp.
It's my first date with Anna.
It is?
So you and Summer finally had the talk?
Oh, yes, almost several times.
- Seth.
- Father.
The sooner you tell her, the better you'll feel about everything.
See, I don't really believe that.
I'm feeling like the longer I wait to tell her, the longer I'll feel great.
The best advice I can give you is this.
It's from Steven Seagal in his classic film Hard to Kill.
"The anticipation of death is far worse than death itself."
Great.
So then we both agree that Summer's gonna kill me.
Look, if you're old enough to go to a concert alone if you're old enough to embark on a real relationship you are old enough to be a man.
Well, she's not gonna be there tonight so I'll tell her Monday.
- Good.
Now, get going.
Your mother and I want some time alone.
There's a visual that I don't want to take with me tonight.
Well, son, your mom's a hottie, and I got her.
- I don't see him.
- Maybe he's inside.
- Excuse me, are you on the list?
- Yeah, we're with Oliver Trask.
- Who's Oliver Trask?
- You don't have his name?
No, I don't have his name.
I've never heard it.
That's why I'm asking.
- Thanks, you've been very helpful.
- I'll call him and see where he is.
- A lot of freaks here, huh, Cohen?
- Yeah.
Good job, Luke.
That should help make us a lot of friends.
- Damn it.
- What?
Well, dude, they're gonna go on soon.
If Oliver's late, we'll miss the first song.
They only have one album.
Factor in your standard cover, that's 12 songs.
Oh, no.
But, hey.
I mean, come on.
If we don't get in, we're still gonna have fun tonight.
- Right?
- What are we gonna do?
I hope you guys aren't waiting for me.
- Summer.
- Cohen.
- Hey, Anna.
- Summer.
- Who are you talking to?
- It just goes straight to voice mail.
Dude, look at that freak.
Hey, I drove alone.
Will you ride with me?
You want to give up so early?
Maybe I can grease a few palms.
Hey.
- There you are.
- What's up, man?
- Hi.
- I thought you were a no-show.
- What happened?
I said back door.
- No, you didn't.
- Load in here, guys.
- The band's here.
- It's all happening.
- What up, guys?
Robert, how's it going?
Good to see you.
Looking forward to the show.
- Thank you.
- I guess we're on time.
- Which one's Rooney?
- They're all Rooney.
- Hey, man, this is my posse.
- This is crazy.
- Hey.
So where's Natalie?
- Yeah, we had another fight.
This whole long-distance thing's tough.
Looks like I'm dateless tonight.
Hey, no!
No way.
We'll be your date, right?
Yeah, right.
- So should we fire up the hot tub?
- Interesting.
Open a bottle of wine.
Oh, I like it.
First, TiVo.
I'm gonna erase Hailey's programs.
- Hot pizza?
- Hailey.
Hey, guys.
You're just in time.
Doctor.
Doctor.
- James.
- What's up?
I just thought that you were going out tonight.
We were.
But then I found out there's a Golden Girls marathon on Lifetime.
And I decided to dig up all my favorite board games.
We're having a throwback to the old babysitting days.
- Why don't you guys join us?
- Great.
That would be great.
Oh, I love this episode.
This is the one where Rose adopts the pig.
She adopted the pig?
- Do you play?
- A little.
- Here, man.
- All access?
Sweet.
- Hey, it's cool?
- It's cool.
- Hey, check it out.
- Seriously?
Yeah.
Awesome.
I just got a few songs that I wrote.
Okay, I'm just gonna...
Seth, you have to tell her tonight.
- No, I don't.
- Hey.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- So, Luke, he's...
- Yeah, we don't let him out much.
Yeah.
But you guys are cool, having fun?
- Everything's awesome.
- Glad to hear it.
Yeah.
Everything is not awesome.
If I don't tell Summer tonight, then later, when I do tell her she'll remember the fun she had at Rooney.
That will cheer her up.
There's never gonna be a good time to tell her.
Tonight's not a bad night.
There's a lot of guys here.
Cute guys, older guys.
A lot of musicians.
Girls like musicians.
Maybe you're right.
Am I flattering myself to even think that Summer'll care?
I mean, me compared to that dude or that guy.
- Right.
- Are you checking out dudes again?
No.
But there are plenty here tonight, aren't there?
A lot of musicians.
In fact, I think I'm gonna go find some myself.
Why don't you and Seth talk.
You know, about anything.
- Cohen, you and Anna...?
- Me and Anna what?
What?
Will you guys stand with me at the concert?
Marissa's on a date, and I'm all alone tonight, so...
Okay, that would be nice.
Yeah.
Hey, man.
I thought your boy was supposed to be here an hour ago.
No.
Okay, no excuses.
I don't care who you send.
Just make sure it's good and it gets here quick.
All right.
I can't see.
I'm stuck behind a row of giants.
Come with me.
Okay, lead the way.
Sorry.
Hey.
Did you tell her?
What did she say?
Did she leave?
No.
Summer is bringing refreshments for her friends.
- Seth said you were thirsty.
- Yeah.
You are thirsty, aren't you?
- You suck.
- I'm sorry.
- I gotta pee.
You gotta pee?
- I'll come with you.
I'm telling her.
You know the night that Mom and Dad came home early from Palm Springs?
And we flushed all that beer down the toilet.
- A lot of good that did.
- I know.
Dad caught you throwing out the empty bottles.
- I thought you were sleeping.
- Face it, sister.
Everything I know, I learned from you.
You were a bad influence back in the day.
How do you think I learned to piss off Dad?
- The student becomes the master.
- And the master becomes Dad's slave.
Helping to turn paradise into a parking lot, or at least a three-car garage.
Hey, Connect Four!
Congratulations.
Next Saturday, Yahtzee.
No, wait.
Stay.
Battleship?
Uno?
You know, Sandy's right.
It's late.
And, besides, I have a show home waiting for me in the morning.
Just what Orange County needs.
Another show home.
Airlifted from the McMansion factory and dropped from the sky...
The one on the bluff, that's a great house.
If by "great" you mean overbuilt, overpriced and exactly like this one.
- Oh, nice.
Hailey, nice.
- I was kidding.
- I'm laughing on the inside.
- I'm not.
You're living in our home.
You're insulting my wife.
You're driving my whole family crazy.
- Is this true?
- Yeah.
And we all know what you're doing here.
She didn't mean anything.
It's just sisters.
No, all this talk about plans, about growing up, it's shtick.
It's a routine.
And it's tired.
You know who's tired?
Me.
So why don't we stop.
No, stop protecting her.
You're not even nice to Kirsten.
She's the only reason we put up with you.
Well, you won't have to put up with me for much longer, okay?
- Sorry?
- It's not your fault, Jimmy.
No, I meant the board game.
- You like The Golden Girls?
- Yes.
There's a marathon on.
I can't get the song out of my head.
I love The Golden Girls.
It's not Rose's fault.
She just is that way.
You're Rose?
I'm Blanche.
It's kind of weird that I relate to a 70-year-old, but...
How good was the episode when there was a blackout?
How about when Rose adopts the pig?
Then Sophia loses her glasses and thinks the pig is a baby.
It's so funny.
Jimmy, wait.
Sorry about that in there.
My little tantrum.
Oh, listen, it's complicated between you and your sister.
It always has been.
You gotta go, like, right now?
Yeah, I don't know if I ever told you, but I'm an extremely important person.
And so I have to...
Yeah.
No, Marissa's at a concert.
Yep, nothing but time.
Didn't tonight feel like the good old days?
No.
It was more like two kind of pathetic people grasping for the old days.
- Right.
That too.
- Yeah.
Look, the good old days.
They're exactly that.
Would you really want to be back in high school?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I would too.
- And you think I'm pathetic?
- Yes, I do.
It's sad, really.
I always had a crush on you.
You know that?
No.
You were 8 when I went away to college.
So I wasn't...
You're Kirsten's sister.
So I've heard all my life.
Look, we don't want to make a complicated situation even more complicated, right?
The last thing we need is having Sandy or Kirsten catching us.
Unless that's what you're hoping for.
Look, your sister is amazing and Sandy is such a great guy.
I think you're lucky to have them looking out for you.
I know that I am.
I'm gonna go.
Okay.
- Hi.
I'm gonna...
- Hey, this is great, right?
Perfect.
Come here a second.
- What are we doing?
- This is better.
Wait.
But we're missing the concert.
We can't ditch Oliver.
- Oliver's fine.
He's friends with the band.
- And with us.
I thought you said you wanted us to hang out with friends.
You've known him two weeks.
How good a friend can he be?
Look.
He's in recovery, trying to stay clean.
We can talk about stuff.
He tells me things.
What he's going through.
- Unlike me, right?
- I didn't say that.
I know you didn't want to come here tonight so, I mean, I guess if you want to leave...
Right.
Later.
Hey, Luke.
- You know who sings this song?
- Rooney.
- Rooney!
- We should keep it that way.
Yeah, Rooney!
What the hell, man?
!
Get off me!
- Hey, get off him!
- I'm a cop.
- What?
There's gotta be some mistake.
- Yeah.
His.
He just tried to buy 3 grams of coke from me.
Ryan, go back inside.
Don't tell anybody.
Excuse me, barkeep, sir.
- Hey.
- What can I get you?
How did you do that?
The usual.
- Mountain Dew.
- How many?
Unfortunately, three.
So Anna's telling Summer that we're a couple.
When they get back, I will officially be in a relationship with Anna.
Unless Summer kills me, in which case, you've been like a brother.
Good, because I need your keys and phone.
- Yeah, you okay?
- I'm fine.
It's Oliver.
- What?
What's going on?
- Tell you later?
All right.
You'll miss a hell of a show, though.
Rooney's not bad, either.
- Is Jimmy gone?
- Yeah.
Is she all right?
I knocked.
She didn't answer.
Maybe she's giving us the house back.
Or maybe she's packing and she'll be gone in the morning.
And frankly I'd rather have her here, where I can keep an eye on her, than anywhere else.
You can't keep her here forever.
It's no good for her and it's no good for us.
Hello?
Hey, what's wrong?
Where are you?
I'll be right there.
Ryan's at the police station.
Thank you, Newport Beach.
Good night, everybody.
- Seth.
- Hey.
- Where have you been?
- At the bar.
How was it?
It was amazing.
They played the whole album.
Not with Rooney, how did it go with Summer?
Did you tell her?
Tell me what?
So you're a couple?
- No.
- Yes.
We wanted to tell you first before we became a couple, which now we are.
- So you chose Anna?
- No.
Kind of, yeah.
She came over on New Year's Eve.
You were with me on New Year's Eve.
Technically, you were with that guy Allan, remember?
And you kept insisting that I go find someone to kiss, so I did.
I was taking out the garbage, she was in the driveway.
You know how it goes.
Okay, well, congrats.
You're not mad?
Good, because I didn't want this to affect our relationship in any way.
Well, Anna, I have to say that Rose would've never pulled that New Year's stunt on Blanche.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Although Blanche would've done it to Rose, so...
So can we still all hang out?
Will you be cool with that?
We'd both really like that if we could hang out.
Sure.
You guys, we can totally hang out.
I mean, in fact, what are you guys doing right now?
So they're gonna let him go.
- Really?
How'd you do that?
- I'm just that good.
- I used to play poker with these guys.
- Thanks for doing this.
- You didn't have to, really.
- Is this kid a friend of yours?
He's a friend of Marissa's.
They met in therapy.
He said he's been clean a while, but...
They busted him trying to buy coke.
Then he said his parents are away for a month.
Can you believe that?
A parent leaves a kid like that on his own.
Yeah, imagine that.
- I'll never understand it.
- I hope not.
- I'm glad you called me.
- Me too.
I'm gonna finish up your paperwork.
You sit tight.
I'll be right back.
So thanks.
Seth's dad seems cool.
He is.
So why'd you do this for me?
I mean, you don't even like me, man.
I don't really know you.
Well, if it's any consolation, I don't like myself very much right now, either.
- So, what happened?
- I don't know.
Natalie didn't show.
And then I saw you and Marissa.
Your friends.
Then it hit me.
I have no one.
My parents are gone.
My friends, if you can even call them that they all disappeared when I got clean.
Now I...
There's Marissa.
Seth likes your taste in music.
And Luke pretty much likes everybody at this point.
And what about you?
I mean, you must like me a little to get me out of jail.
No, that was Sandy.
Marissa.
You gonna tell her?
No.
You are.
Hey.
Yeah, it's Oliver.
Hey, whoa, hey, hey, hey!
- I can't have half?
- There are other bagels.
- Not salt bagels.
- You ate them all.
And several sesame.
I haven't been the best guest, I know.
- And what you said tonight...
- Hey, Connect Four was happening.
It gets my blood up.
Well, you were right.
So, what's the plan?
Hit Caleb up for more cash.
And then what?
- Europe this time?
Iceland?
Boca?
- I don't know.
You know, I see how happy you guys are, and I think, "Why can't I have that?"
- Because you don't want it.
- How do you know?
I don't even know what I want.
You could stay here.
I mean, not here exactly but, you know, get a home.
- A job.
Settle down.
- No.
See, that's the thing.
All I know is what I don't want.
Well, that's not entirely true.
And the rest you'll figure out.
Good night.
Good night.
- Hey.
- Hey.
No, wait, don't get up.
Thanks.
He's not a bad guy, Oliver.
He's...
This may come as a shock to you but right now, I don't want to talk about Oliver.
Oh, hey, wow, kissing.
Sorry about that.
We're gonna hang out inside, but you guys are obviously alone together so do that.
- Ryan, what happened to you?
- Luke, please, you're shouting.
- Someone stood too close to the speaker.
- Dude, that concert did not suck at all.
- We PlayStationing it, or what?
- Yeah.
Any time you want to join us.
Let's go before he wakes up your parents.
Think we can teach him to fetch?
I don't want to be the third wheel or watch you guys make out, so enjoy.
- Well, we could stay here.
- Yeah, but maybe we should...
Race you?
Cohen, you've played this game before?
See the way I ripped that guy's spine out?
Sitting right here, buddy.
I am so glad we all could hang out together like this, aren't you guys?
- Yeah.
- Damn it.
- Ryan, you're up.
- You're up, Ryan.
We'll make it best of five.
- She's eating us out of house and home.
- It's just a bagel.
No.
No, no, it's never just a bagel.
As someone who's basically been a shut-in for the last 17 years I can say with great authority that she never leaves the house.
- She's got nowhere else to go.
- Because her friends want to kick her ass.
- Sorry about the language.
- Why?
I'd like to kick her ass.
- Kirsten.
- Coming.
There's no more coffee.
Will you make some?
- The French roast, not the harvest blend.
- No, no, no.
I'll talk to her.
So I'll have to survive on English muffins.
Marissa?
Marissa?
Hello.
She's gotta be here somewhere.
- Hilarious.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Listen to me.
Hailey is always in the living room.
Marissa's always here.
I'm lost.
What happened to Seth-Ryan time?
That was quality time.
- Okay.
I know I've been a little bit...
- Whipped?
I'm not whipped.
- I'm free to talk now.
What's up?
- Squeezing me in before school?
Nice.
But actually, I'll take it.
Okay, here's the thing:
Anna and I are gonna take it to the next level.
I need advice.
- You're gonna have sex?
- No.
That's a good idea, though.
We're gonna tell Summer that we're dating.
As much as I fear Summer hurting me, with the rage blackouts and all I'm actually more scared about hurting her feelings.
We've become friends now, and I feel like I don't want to...
- You guys ready to go?
- Yeah.
We were just talking.
Really?
About what?
Guy stuff.
Hunting and shaving and shoes.
Actually, the cleats for the sports.
Okay, well, come on.
Hey, later, can we finish this chat?
Put in a little Seth-Ryan time?
Yes.
Absolutely, just gotta check with...
Oh, you forgot your balls.
- You and me.
Tonight.
- Come on.
- Are we one of those couples?
- Who lose all their friends?
And can't do anything without each other?
I don't think so.
You think so?
- That'd be good, a night apart.
- Yeah, plus, I'm kind of sick of you.
I'm sick of me too.
- I gotta go.
- Yeah.
And I got the...
- Walk me?
- I'll walk you.
- Don't make me.
- Don't make you what?
- Hurt you.
- Watch this.
Stop it.
- What's up?
- Hey.
What is up?
- I was talking to her.
- That's cool.
- Do you have plans this weekend?
- Nothing.
What Anna's trying to say is, she's not gonna do anything.
We're both not.
That's what we're both doing.
We're doing nothing.
But doing that by ourselves.
Thank you, Cohen.
You just reminded me that I need my bio textbook because we're studying monkeys.
Ouch.
I hate liars, and now I'm one of them.
I thought you were gonna talk to her.
I am gonna talk to her.
I don't know how.
- I'll tell her then.
- No.
I have to do it.
Tonight me and Ryan are gonna have a strategy meeting.
We're gonna figure out the whole thing.
- That makes me feel better.
- Then we'll be free to do this.
- Seth.
I have to study.
- And this.
I started my own business right out of college.
And now I'm a father of two and I've got one line on my r Ásum Á.
- Did you ever mow your lawn as a kid?
- Yeah.
Great. "Jimmy Cooper Landscaping," your first job.
- Now you're an entrepreneur.
- I don't even have references.
Sure you do, your clients whose money you stole.
Right.
- Is that Jimmy Cooper?
- Hey, Hailey!
You look fantastic.
How you doing?
She's got no jobs, no friends and no prospects.
- And I say that with love.
- Sounds like we got a lot in common.
- So did you guys have the talk?
- Yes.
We almost did.
We were having fun.
And all we've done is fight for so long.
It was nice to just hang out and be sisters.
- I'll find out if she has a plan.
- You know what her plan is.
She'll stay here and mooch off us until she can make a withdrawal from the Bank of Dad.
Then she'll take off again for a few years.
- She said she wasn't gonna do that.
- She's gonna mooch off us forever?
- She's not mooching.
- Oh, really?
Then how'd she get all those new clothes?
From the salary she doesn't make?
From the trust fund she drained?
- I bought you bagels.
- That fixes everything?
- Yes, it does.
- Sesame.
That's a start.
I'm gonna hide them.
So yeah.
Now I'm broke and sleeping at my sister's.
I'm broke and my wife is sleeping with your father.
Fantastic.
We've done well for ourselves.
Who knew back when Kirsten and I were babysitting you and you were watching Silver Spoons that we'd both turn out to be so...?
- Complicated.
- And it was Golden Girls.
- That's right.
You loved Golden Girls.
It's impressive that I was 10 and relating to the lives of 70-year-old women.
Blanche was 70?
She aged really well.
I'd love to hang, hear how you made such a mess of your life.
Same.
Although I bet your story doesn't involve a fistfight at cotillion.
No.
But I bet yours doesn't contain half a pound of hash and a border guard in Budapest.
No.
It's nice that you and Jimmy are friends again.
I guess I can't blame a guy for wanting to kiss my wife.
It feels like we never have any time alone anymore.
That's not true.
We have moments.
I want more moments.
- God, they're so whipped.
- I gotta go pick up Marissa.
- Sandy, thank you.
- Anytime.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yes.
Jimmy and I are gonna hang out tomorrow night, catch up.
- Hang out, like "out"?
- I bet you have a lot to catch up on.
- Tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow night.
Hey, man.
How's it going?
Got a flat tire.
You ran over a nail?
Somebody slashed it.
Want some help?
Thanks.
I got a spare in the back.
Hey, Luke, why doesn't your dad help you with that tire?
I'm sure he'd like to bend over.
- New Year's resolution.
Punch people less.
- I had the same one.
You think I'm getting what I deserve after years of being a jackass?
Definitely.
Hey, why don't we just get out of here.
The tire can wait.
Yeah, that sounds good.
Go.
Go, go, go.
Break that tackle.
Go.
Yeah!
Who plays PlayStation for the sports games?
Listen to me.
You said Seth-Ryan time.
This isn't Seth-Ryan time.
This is Seth-Luke-Ryan time, and you know what?
Guess what.
- There's no such thing.
- Maybe Luke will have some good advice.
What does that guy know about juggling women?
Come on.
Okay, quite a bit.
But he wasn't good at it.
He's having a bad day.
I'm having a bad day, okay?
I'm having a bad week.
Some kids at school slashed his tires.
Damn it.
What do you think he wants on his pizza?
Hey, Cohen.
Check out the replay on this tackle.
I broke this bitch in half.
Luke has a gay dad.
Luke has a gay dad.
Can't wait to see it, buddy.
- Hello?
- Hey.
I'm at Oliver's, and he just ordered way too much food.
I know you wanted to spend tonight apart but he asked if you would come by.
- You're at Oliver's?
- Summer had plans.
I saw Oliver at therapy.
He said if I wanted...
- That's so good.
- It's Moroccan.
- What's Moroccan?
- The food.
Just come.
Okay?
See you soon.
How do you guys feel about Moroccan?
I think I really hurt that guy.
- Hey, where's the silverware?
- Moroccan you eat with your hands.
No wonder Luke seems to be enjoying it so much.
- How good is the couscous?
- Amazing.
- It's pretty good.
- No, that's the kefta.
Couscous is the other thing.
I can't believe you live in a penthouse.
This place is "ridonculous."
It's always been my fantasy to live in a hotel.
Like Eloise.
Yeah, well, I guess.
But with my parents traveling so much it can get a little lonely.
- Lf you ever need any company...
- Thanks.
They might be gone a while, opening a new hotel in Paris.
I love Paris.
I could spend all day walking the Champs Elys Áes.
I like Paris.
I love baguettes.
Dude, French chicks don't even shave their armpits.
- Have you ever been to Paris, Ryan?
- No, not yet.
- I hear the Louvre's cool.
- Do not go near it.
Totally overrated.
The Mona Lisa's the size of a postage stamp.
Now, the Rodin Museum and the Mus Áe Picasso...
But you know where my family's been spending most of their time?
Switzerland.
- Snowboarding the Alps is unreal.
- You boarded the Alps?
The closest I've ever come is Whistler.
We have a place in Big Bear.
We should go one weekend.
- Could you teach Ryan to board?
- Lf you can get him on a chair lift.
First two days, you'll be on your ass, but we'll get you there.
- I really like this song.
- You know, they're playing tomorrow.
- Yeah, but it's all sold out.
- Do you wanna go?
Yeah, but it's all sold out.
I'll call their manager tomorrow.
They're amazing live.
- You know Rooney?
- That would be awesome.
I've never heard of them, but I got nothing.
I'll go.
Ryan?
- Come on, we'll all get to hang out.
- It'll be fun.
- Cool.
- All right, then it's settled.
We're going.
- Groovy.
- Hey, nice.
This is gonna be great.
So now you're eating with silverware?
Next thing, I'll see you at the Louvre.
No, you won't, because, like Oliver said, it's lame.
Can we please focus on the crisis at hand for one second?
Okay?
Summer.
The way I figure it, I have many options.
Like the truth.
That's a good one.
Hey, no argument there, buddy but I'm talking about my messenger of truth.
My delivery system of honesty.
The way I tell her.
- Now, listen.
I could call her.
That's one.
- Okay.
It is okay, but just okay.
It lacks any real spark or imagination.
But it's effective.
Your voice on one end, hers on the other.
- "I'm dating Anna." She'll hear you.
- But the phone is a blunt instrument, no?
What about text messaging?
I could Blackberry her.
That feels very hip, it feels edgy, it feels 21 st century.
- Kind of cold.
- Mittens required, yes.
A carrier pigeon.
How cool would that be?
Think about it.
A little message in his cute little talons.
Summer's a pigeon fan.
- You're a coward.
- Am I?
Or am I just too sensitive to the feelings of others?
Coward, definitely.
Fine, I'll tell her Monday.
Actually, I think Tuesday.
I might give it till Friday.
That way she'll have the weekend to let it marinate...
- You could do it today.
- No.
Today will soon be tonight.
And tonight will be Rooney.
And Rooney will be awesome.
Rooney.
I saw them open for The Vines in L.A. Last year.
- Big whoop.
We're seeing them tonight.
- I thought it was sold out.
It happens they are.
But I also happen to be dialed in.
I got the hookups.
Or at least Oliver does.
And I'm gonna ride his coattails.
Oliver?
As in Oliver, the guy who wanted to kiss your girlfriend on New Year's?
- Morning, Hailey.
- It's not like that.
He's got a girlfriend.
Wait.
If he has a girlfriend, why is he always hanging out with yours?
- Couldn't tell you, but thanks.
- The guy seems cool, right?
I don't know.
We don't seem to have a lot in common.
- Besides your girlfriend.
- Keep twisting the knife.
Feels good.
Whatever.
He got us backstage passes.
Good enough for me.
Backstage?
So now you have to worry about your girl with Oliver and rock stars?
Mind if I finish cornflakes?
Hey, at least she asked.
It's a start.
Well, at least she's leaving the house.
It's a start.
- We'll have the place to ourselves.
- Yes.
We can eat bagels.
- And I can wear my robe.
- Or not.
I can have the remote back.
She's crammed that TiVo full of every E!
True Hollywood special.
- I think she's looking for tips.
- That's nice.
I'm just saying, she's cluttering up the TiVo.
And a clear TiVo equals a clear mind.
Are we okay with the kids going to that concert?
- Yeah.
- What if Rooney is, like death-metal Satan-worshipping speed freaks?
Honey, that went out in the late '90s.
I saw it on a special on E!
I'll run Rooney up my proverbial flagpole, but you have got to speak to Hailey.
So?
- Yeah, it's my first time hearing it, so...
- That's why we're doing a run-through.
- So you'll have heard it all before tonight.
- Right.
- So we're going tonight?
- No.
It's your first concert.
We have free tickets, backstage passes.
You're right, we should skip it.
- That's not what I'm saying.
- What are you saying?
- Have you met Natalie?
- No, but I hear she's great.
- And Oliver is...?
I mean...
- Is someone jealous?
This song is good.
Turn it up.
Really, really loud.
Oliver will be with Natalie.
Rooney is a really good band.
- And tonight we're gonna have fun.
- I know.
- There won't be dancing, right?
- I'll dance.
You can watch.
Works for me.
- I think that's enough.
- What?
There was almost a knee bend.
You were about to find the beat.
- And?
- Remember cousin Jeffery's bar mitzvah?
You almost wiped out a dozen kids on the dance floor.
That "Y.M.C.A." song requires a lot of movement.
- I'm just trying to spare casualties.
- So anyone gonna be doing drugs?
I hope so, otherwise it's a lame-ass concert.
Anyone named Seth gonna be doing any drugs?
No.
Nobody named Seth Cohen.
I promise.
Gotta stay sharp.
It's my first date with Anna.
It is?
So you and Summer finally had the talk?
Oh, yes, almost several times.
- Seth.
- Father.
The sooner you tell her, the better you'll feel about everything.
See, I don't really believe that.
I'm feeling like the longer I wait to tell her, the longer I'll feel great.
The best advice I can give you is this.
It's from Steven Seagal in his classic film Hard to Kill.
"The anticipation of death is far worse than death itself."
Great.
So then we both agree that Summer's gonna kill me.
Look, if you're old enough to go to a concert alone if you're old enough to embark on a real relationship you are old enough to be a man.
Well, she's not gonna be there tonight so I'll tell her Monday.
- Good.
Now, get going.
Your mother and I want some time alone.
There's a visual that I don't want to take with me tonight.
Well, son, your mom's a hottie, and I got her.
- I don't see him.
- Maybe he's inside.
- Excuse me, are you on the list?
- Yeah, we're with Oliver Trask.
- Who's Oliver Trask?
- You don't have his name?
No, I don't have his name.
I've never heard it.
That's why I'm asking.
- Thanks, you've been very helpful.
- I'll call him and see where he is.
- A lot of freaks here, huh, Cohen?
- Yeah.
Good job, Luke.
That should help make us a lot of friends.
- Damn it.
- What?
Well, dude, they're gonna go on soon.
If Oliver's late, we'll miss the first song.
They only have one album.
Factor in your standard cover, that's 12 songs.
Oh, no.
But, hey.
I mean, come on.
If we don't get in, we're still gonna have fun tonight.
- Right?
- What are we gonna do?
I hope you guys aren't waiting for me.
- Summer.
- Cohen.
- Hey, Anna.
- Summer.
- Who are you talking to?
- It just goes straight to voice mail.
Dude, look at that freak.
Hey, I drove alone.
Will you ride with me?
You want to give up so early?
Maybe I can grease a few palms.
Hey.
- There you are.
- What's up, man?
- Hi.
- I thought you were a no-show.
- What happened?
I said back door.
- No, you didn't.
- Load in here, guys.
- The band's here.
- It's all happening.
- What up, guys?
Robert, how's it going?
Good to see you.
Looking forward to the show.
- Thank you.
- I guess we're on time.
- Which one's Rooney?
- They're all Rooney.
- Hey, man, this is my posse.
- This is crazy.
- Hey.
So where's Natalie?
- Yeah, we had another fight.
This whole long-distance thing's tough.
Looks like I'm dateless tonight.
Hey, no!
No way.
We'll be your date, right?
Yeah, right.
- So should we fire up the hot tub?
- Interesting.
Open a bottle of wine.
Oh, I like it.
First, TiVo.
I'm gonna erase Hailey's programs.
- Hot pizza?
- Hailey.
Hey, guys.
You're just in time.
Doctor.
Doctor.
- James.
- What's up?
I just thought that you were going out tonight.
We were.
But then I found out there's a Golden Girls marathon on Lifetime.
And I decided to dig up all my favorite board games.
We're having a throwback to the old babysitting days.
- Why don't you guys join us?
- Great.
That would be great.
Oh, I love this episode.
This is the one where Rose adopts the pig.
She adopted the pig?
- Do you play?
- A little.
- Here, man.
- All access?
Sweet.
- Hey, it's cool?
- It's cool.
- Hey, check it out.
- Seriously?
Yeah.
Awesome.
I just got a few songs that I wrote.
Okay, I'm just gonna...
Seth, you have to tell her tonight.
- No, I don't.
- Hey.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- So, Luke, he's...
- Yeah, we don't let him out much.
Yeah.
But you guys are cool, having fun?
- Everything's awesome.
- Glad to hear it.
Yeah.
Everything is not awesome.
If I don't tell Summer tonight, then later, when I do tell her she'll remember the fun she had at Rooney.
That will cheer her up.
There's never gonna be a good time to tell her.
Tonight's not a bad night.
There's a lot of guys here.
Cute guys, older guys.
A lot of musicians.
Girls like musicians.
Maybe you're right.
Am I flattering myself to even think that Summer'll care?
I mean, me compared to that dude or that guy.
- Right.
- Are you checking out dudes again?
No.
But there are plenty here tonight, aren't there?
A lot of musicians.
In fact, I think I'm gonna go find some myself.
Why don't you and Seth talk.
You know, about anything.
- Cohen, you and Anna...?
- Me and Anna what?
What?
Will you guys stand with me at the concert?
Marissa's on a date, and I'm all alone tonight, so...
Okay, that would be nice.
Yeah.
Hey, man.
I thought your boy was supposed to be here an hour ago.
No.
Okay, no excuses.
I don't care who you send.
Just make sure it's good and it gets here quick.
All right.
I can't see.
I'm stuck behind a row of giants.
Come with me.
Okay, lead the way.
Sorry.
Hey.
Did you tell her?
What did she say?
Did she leave?
No.
Summer is bringing refreshments for her friends.
- Seth said you were thirsty.
- Yeah.
You are thirsty, aren't you?
- You suck.
- I'm sorry.
- I gotta pee.
You gotta pee?
- I'll come with you.
I'm telling her.
You know the night that Mom and Dad came home early from Palm Springs?
And we flushed all that beer down the toilet.
- A lot of good that did.
- I know.
Dad caught you throwing out the empty bottles.
- I thought you were sleeping.
- Face it, sister.
Everything I know, I learned from you.
You were a bad influence back in the day.
How do you think I learned to piss off Dad?
- The student becomes the master.
- And the master becomes Dad's slave.
Helping to turn paradise into a parking lot, or at least a three-car garage.
Hey, Connect Four!
Congratulations.
Next Saturday, Yahtzee.
No, wait.
Stay.
Battleship?
Uno?
You know, Sandy's right.
It's late.
And, besides, I have a show home waiting for me in the morning.
Just what Orange County needs.
Another show home.
Airlifted from the McMansion factory and dropped from the sky...
The one on the bluff, that's a great house.
If by "great" you mean overbuilt, overpriced and exactly like this one.
- Oh, nice.
Hailey, nice.
- I was kidding.
- I'm laughing on the inside.
- I'm not.
You're living in our home.
You're insulting my wife.
You're driving my whole family crazy.
- Is this true?
- Yeah.
And we all know what you're doing here.
She didn't mean anything.
It's just sisters.
No, all this talk about plans, about growing up, it's shtick.
It's a routine.
And it's tired.
You know who's tired?
Me.
So why don't we stop.
No, stop protecting her.
You're not even nice to Kirsten.
She's the only reason we put up with you.
Well, you won't have to put up with me for much longer, okay?
- Sorry?
- It's not your fault, Jimmy.
No, I meant the board game.
- You like The Golden Girls?
- Yes.
There's a marathon on.
I can't get the song out of my head.
I love The Golden Girls.
It's not Rose's fault.
She just is that way.
You're Rose?
I'm Blanche.
It's kind of weird that I relate to a 70-year-old, but...
How good was the episode when there was a blackout?
How about when Rose adopts the pig?
Then Sophia loses her glasses and thinks the pig is a baby.
It's so funny.
Jimmy, wait.
Sorry about that in there.
My little tantrum.
Oh, listen, it's complicated between you and your sister.
It always has been.
You gotta go, like, right now?
Yeah, I don't know if I ever told you, but I'm an extremely important person.
And so I have to...
Yeah.
No, Marissa's at a concert.
Yep, nothing but time.
Didn't tonight feel like the good old days?
No.
It was more like two kind of pathetic people grasping for the old days.
- Right.
That too.
- Yeah.
Look, the good old days.
They're exactly that.
Would you really want to be back in high school?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I would too.
- And you think I'm pathetic?
- Yes, I do.
It's sad, really.
I always had a crush on you.
You know that?
No.
You were 8 when I went away to college.
So I wasn't...
You're Kirsten's sister.
So I've heard all my life.
Look, we don't want to make a complicated situation even more complicated, right?
The last thing we need is having Sandy or Kirsten catching us.
Unless that's what you're hoping for.
Look, your sister is amazing and Sandy is such a great guy.
I think you're lucky to have them looking out for you.
I know that I am.
I'm gonna go.
Okay.
- Hi.
I'm gonna...
- Hey, this is great, right?
Perfect.
Come here a second.
- What are we doing?
- This is better.
Wait.
But we're missing the concert.
We can't ditch Oliver.
- Oliver's fine.
He's friends with the band.
- And with us.
I thought you said you wanted us to hang out with friends.
You've known him two weeks.
How good a friend can he be?
Look.
He's in recovery, trying to stay clean.
We can talk about stuff.
He tells me things.
What he's going through.
- Unlike me, right?
- I didn't say that.
I know you didn't want to come here tonight so, I mean, I guess if you want to leave...
Right.
Later.
Hey, Luke.
- You know who sings this song?
- Rooney.
- Rooney!
- We should keep it that way.
Yeah, Rooney!
What the hell, man?
!
Get off me!
- Hey, get off him!
- I'm a cop.
- What?
There's gotta be some mistake.
- Yeah.
His.
He just tried to buy 3 grams of coke from me.
Ryan, go back inside.
Don't tell anybody.
Excuse me, barkeep, sir.
- Hey.
- What can I get you?
How did you do that?
The usual.
- Mountain Dew.
- How many?
Unfortunately, three.
So Anna's telling Summer that we're a couple.
When they get back, I will officially be in a relationship with Anna.
Unless Summer kills me, in which case, you've been like a brother.
Good, because I need your keys and phone.
- Yeah, you okay?
- I'm fine.
It's Oliver.
- What?
What's going on?
- Tell you later?
All right.
You'll miss a hell of a show, though.
Rooney's not bad, either.
- Is Jimmy gone?
- Yeah.
Is she all right?
I knocked.
She didn't answer.
Maybe she's giving us the house back.
Or maybe she's packing and she'll be gone in the morning.
And frankly I'd rather have her here, where I can keep an eye on her, than anywhere else.
You can't keep her here forever.
It's no good for her and it's no good for us.
Hello?
Hey, what's wrong?
Where are you?
I'll be right there.
Ryan's at the police station.
Thank you, Newport Beach.
Good night, everybody.
- Seth.
- Hey.
- Where have you been?
- At the bar.
How was it?
It was amazing.
They played the whole album.
Not with Rooney, how did it go with Summer?
Did you tell her?
Tell me what?
So you're a couple?
- No.
- Yes.
We wanted to tell you first before we became a couple, which now we are.
- So you chose Anna?
- No.
Kind of, yeah.
She came over on New Year's Eve.
You were with me on New Year's Eve.
Technically, you were with that guy Allan, remember?
And you kept insisting that I go find someone to kiss, so I did.
I was taking out the garbage, she was in the driveway.
You know how it goes.
Okay, well, congrats.
You're not mad?
Good, because I didn't want this to affect our relationship in any way.
Well, Anna, I have to say that Rose would've never pulled that New Year's stunt on Blanche.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Although Blanche would've done it to Rose, so...
So can we still all hang out?
Will you be cool with that?
We'd both really like that if we could hang out.
Sure.
You guys, we can totally hang out.
I mean, in fact, what are you guys doing right now?
So they're gonna let him go.
- Really?
How'd you do that?
- I'm just that good.
- I used to play poker with these guys.
- Thanks for doing this.
- You didn't have to, really.
- Is this kid a friend of yours?
He's a friend of Marissa's.
They met in therapy.
He said he's been clean a while, but...
They busted him trying to buy coke.
Then he said his parents are away for a month.
Can you believe that?
A parent leaves a kid like that on his own.
Yeah, imagine that.
- I'll never understand it.
- I hope not.
- I'm glad you called me.
- Me too.
I'm gonna finish up your paperwork.
You sit tight.
I'll be right back.
So thanks.
Seth's dad seems cool.
He is.
So why'd you do this for me?
I mean, you don't even like me, man.
I don't really know you.
Well, if it's any consolation, I don't like myself very much right now, either.
- So, what happened?
- I don't know.
Natalie didn't show.
And then I saw you and Marissa.
Your friends.
Then it hit me.
I have no one.
My parents are gone.
My friends, if you can even call them that they all disappeared when I got clean.
Now I...
There's Marissa.
Seth likes your taste in music.
And Luke pretty much likes everybody at this point.
And what about you?
I mean, you must like me a little to get me out of jail.
No, that was Sandy.
Marissa.
You gonna tell her?
No.
You are.
Hey.
Yeah, it's Oliver.
Hey, whoa, hey, hey, hey!
- I can't have half?
- There are other bagels.
- Not salt bagels.
- You ate them all.
And several sesame.
I haven't been the best guest, I know.
- And what you said tonight...
- Hey, Connect Four was happening.
It gets my blood up.
Well, you were right.
So, what's the plan?
Hit Caleb up for more cash.
And then what?
- Europe this time?
Iceland?
Boca?
- I don't know.
You know, I see how happy you guys are, and I think, "Why can't I have that?"
- Because you don't want it.
- How do you know?
I don't even know what I want.
You could stay here.
I mean, not here exactly but, you know, get a home.
- A job.
Settle down.
- No.
See, that's the thing.
All I know is what I don't want.
Well, that's not entirely true.
And the rest you'll figure out.
Good night.
Good night.
- Hey.
- Hey.
No, wait, don't get up.
Thanks.
He's not a bad guy, Oliver.
He's...
This may come as a shock to you but right now, I don't want to talk about Oliver.
Oh, hey, wow, kissing.
Sorry about that.
We're gonna hang out inside, but you guys are obviously alone together so do that.
- Ryan, what happened to you?
- Luke, please, you're shouting.
- Someone stood too close to the speaker.
- Dude, that concert did not suck at all.
- We PlayStationing it, or what?
- Yeah.
Any time you want to join us.
Let's go before he wakes up your parents.
Think we can teach him to fetch?
I don't want to be the third wheel or watch you guys make out, so enjoy.
- Well, we could stay here.
- Yeah, but maybe we should...
Race you?
Cohen, you've played this game before?
See the way I ripped that guy's spine out?
Sitting right here, buddy.
I am so glad we all could hang out together like this, aren't you guys?
- Yeah.
- Damn it.
- Ryan, you're up.
- You're up, Ryan.
We'll make it best of five.
MAN:
Here you go.
WOMAN:
Thanks, man.
See you tomorrow.
How you doing?
Okay.
- When did the mill close?
- Three years ago this August.
If you're looking for work, you may want to try Aberdeen.
That's about the closest mill work you'll find.
- Too bad.
- It's just simple economics.
You know, we have a really nice casino, the Wild Cherry.
Want to make some money, maybe you ought to go on down and try your luck at the blackjack tables.
No, I don't think so.
Thanks.
You're Chris Vaughn?
Well, hell.
I know all about you, Chris.
I know your folks.
I'm Sheriff Stan Watkins.
- How you doing?
- Ralston, get out of the car!
You're looking at a real soldier here.
Pay some respects.
- Welcome home, soldier.
- Thanks.
Well, hell, Chris.
- I'll give you a ride up to your folks'.
- No, I'm fine.
Thank you.
- I insist.
- I'll walk.
- It's my pleasure.
- It's okay.
I won't take no for an answer.
Get in the car.
- Did I scare you with that one?
- Little bit.
I scared him.
WATKINS:
You were gone a while, huh?
Eight years.
Harstad was sheriff back then.
Aaron Harstad, yeah.
Sad story.
About five months back, he fell asleep at the wheel and hit a tree.
Car folded up like an accordion.
He was a good man.
A good man and a good sheriff.
All right.
- Thank you very much for the ride.
- Welcome home, Chris.
It's election month.
I'm your man.
Okay.
Say hey to your old man.
Let's go.
Can I help you?
Little brother.
You come over here and give me a hug.
- You look great.
- What is this?
I couldn't let you be the only one looking good in uniform.
Hey, Ma.
Chris is here.
- Whose tent?
- That's for Pete.
- Watch out, now.
- Chris.
- Look at you.
- Mom, how you doing?
How long's your leave?
How long do we have you?
For good.
I'm home.
- Really?
You're not kidding?
- No.
- Hey, Dad.
- Welcome back.
MRS. VAUGHN:
I wish you had told us exactly when you were coming.
I'd have cooked.
- This is fine, Mom.
- MICHELLE:
We love Chinese.
- No, this is great.
- So what are you going to do now?
I was planning to work at the mill, but you never mentioned it closed.
We didn't want to bother you when your father got laid off.
I got my business.
You saw the furniture outside.
And I substitute at the elementary school.
Michelle pitches in, we try to keep things simple.
MICHELLE:
Pete.
- This is your Uncle Chris.
- Hey, Pete.
Sit down.
Say hello.
Last time he saw you, you were barely walking.
- And now I'm camping.
- I said you could sleep on the couch.
It was Chris' room first.
Your tent's going to take on water.
I can show you how to rig it.
Doesn't look like it's going to rain to me, Colonel.
Sit down.
Eat something.
First of all, I was a sergeant.
I worked for a living.
A grunt.
- Did you ever smoke anybody?
- ALL:
Pete!
Poppa's still got your gun locked up in the garage.
- Would you teach me how to shoot?
- I figured that'd be scrap metal by now.
No.
I'm still hoping you'll melt that thing down on your own.
- Sorry, Pete.
- Whatever.
- I'm out of here, Mom.
- Be back by 10:00.
- 10:30.
- 10:00.
Remind you of anyone?
Okay, it rained.
Happy?
No.
Why don't you crash on the floor?
Okay.
I'll crash on the floor.
You crash on the bed.
Huh-uh.
CHRIS:
Pete.
Keep you dry.
Did you really kill people?
- Ray-Ray.
- Hello, pudding.
- What's up, man?
- Good to see you, man.
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.
What is that?
- That's the Love Machine.
- Girls actually get in there?
- How you been?
- Good.
- Clean living?
- Please.
You want a beer?
No.
Believe it or not, I quit drinking.
I'd take a soda, though.
Okay.
Here.
Thanks, man.
Like that?
When you left town, it gave me the idea I should do something with my life, too.
So I went down to Seattle, got a guitar, and became all about music.
And then, pretty soon, I was about music and drugs, and pretty soon I was basically just about drugs and ended up doing two years for B and E.
I'm sorry.
Look at me now, though, right?
I've been clean and sober 14 months.
Doing construction and renewing those supportive and healthy friendships from my past.
Matter of fact, I talked to the bastards, told them you were back, and they asked me to politely remind you that it is Saturday.
- As in...
- As in, kick-off's in 20 minutes.
- Like old times.
- You guys still doing it.
We're still doing it.
- Playing ball?
- Absolutely.
Let's go, superstar!
- Just like the old days.
Go deep.
- Come on.
When did that happen?
RAY:
Jay Hamilton Field.
His parents hadn't left him the mill for more than two minutes
- before he shut it down.
- CHRIS:
Why?
JAY:
Heads up!
Because I opened my casino.
Still got a gun, huh, Jay?
Still got your reflexes.
What?
Did you get tired of being all that you could be?
- No.
I'm still all I can be.
- Really?
- I'll just have to see about that.
- Yeah.
- What brings you home?
- I just want to relax.
Catch my breath.
- You?
Relax?
- Yeah.
Not today.
I got it.
Let's go.
Come on!
Is that how it's going to be?
That's how it is.
- CHRIS:
Full contact, huh?
- That's two-hand touch.
Too rough?
Sorry, ladies.
Pick up the outside!
- Fumble!
- Set!
How's that for touch?
- That was pretty, wasn't it?
- Want to go get your pads?
- That the best you got?
- What?
- Here, take a walk...
- And knock a long loose?
- Touchdown.
- First and your last.
- You want to go?
- Nobody's going.
We're not going to go.
You almost caught it.
- JAY:
We stop them here, we win, right?
- Right, boys, last play.
- You know how I like winning.
- We need to put this to rest.
- I will take care of Ray.
- You two cross.
You stay in and block.
Booth?
Isolate on Vaughn.
- You two cross...
- Just give me the ball.
- Go low.
Left knee.
- All right, man.
You got it?
On the first hut.
Ready?
Break!
Be strong.
All right, Chris Vaughn.
Last chance.
- Black-nineteen!
Black!
- Watch the outside!
I'm open!
That's game.
Sorry about that.
Cool, man.
MAN 1:
Nice game, ladies.
MAN 2:
What the hell was that?
That was a great game, wasn't it?
Is that the bad one?
- Yeah, it was good.
- Hey, welcome home.
Good to be back.
See you around.
If you're not doing anything later on, want to come by the casino?
Introduce you to some nice girls.
Drinks are on me.
What do you say?
- See you tonight.
- Cool.
I'll see you later on.
Be good.
Hey, Sarge.
Good game.
Maybe next time.
Hold up.
Maybe next time I won't see you in the bleachers, smoking weed.
Welcome home, buddy.
CHRIS:
I thought you had to be Native American to own a casino.
RAY:
Hamilton's one-sixteenth Blackfoot now.
KEITH:
Put it on his application.
RAY:
And what he slid under the table convinced the powers that be it was true.
MAN 2:
It's ours for the taking tonight.
JIMMY:
Let's pick some cherries, boys.
- Here we go.
- I'm feeling lucky.
Just so you guys know, I'm done after I triple my money.
That's what you said last time.
You wound up selling your body for bus fare.
He had to walk.
Nobody's going to have any problems finding this place.
It's the subtle attention to aesthetics that I find most impressive.
Blends in with the mountain so nicely.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
How you doing?
- See?
Not bad, huh?
- It's not bad.
A lot of pretty girls.
I'm getting chips.
Let's gamble.
We'll see you at the Shower Tower, okay?
RAY:
Isn't it wonderful?
All your gambling needs under one great, big roof.
You got your ATM machines, tellers to cash your paycheck, and when you're here, you don't got to worry about things, like child support, rent, laws of mathematical probability.
Gentlemen, Mr. Hamilton would like to invite you to the VIP lounge.
- The dream team.
You all healed up?
- Nice place.
Welcome to my world.
Tonight all the drinks are on the house.
If you need a line of credit, say how much.
If you need a little female companionship, done.
All right?
- Get inside.
Have a good time.
- Where you going?
Don't you worry about me.
I got a few things to do.
Enjoy.
Just remember, nothing in here is free.
Ma'am.
WAITRESS:
Cherry shot?
CHRIS:
Ray, be nice.
RAY:
Come on, this place is nothing but fake boobs and real assholes, if you ask me.
Just water for me.
JIMMY:
Drink up.
We got money to win and girls just waiting.
MAN 1:
We are VIPs.
RAY:
Here's to you, Chris.
KEITH:
Welcome home.
ALL:
Cheers.
Let's play, boys.
Go right ahead.
Already lost $1...
Good night.
Okay.
Don't say we never did nothing for you.
Don't worry, buddy, everybody's scared their first time.
- Come on.
- Get in there, Chris.
Okay, just sit back and enjoy it.
- This'll get you started.
- Lf you're not back by morning we'll send a search party.
- Have fun.
- Stop drinking.
You from here, or are you just visiting?
A little of both.
I grew up here.
So you're seeing all the old faces.
You could say that.
Your voice sounds very familiar.
Chris.
Deni.
- Look who's back.
- So, good surprise?
I told you it was better than gambling.
You met Candi?
- CANDl:
Hello.
- Hey, Candi.
Let's go.
Six, easy six.
Looking for a six to win.
We can do a six.
Can we do a six?
I think I can do a six, right?
We got liftoff!
Whack it, boys.
Whack it.
Blue or pink, what do you think?
Who's up for two out of three?
I'm getting killed.
Let me have a C-note to put $200 on a bet.
- No.
- Come on.
Hell, no.
Look at them.
He's hot.
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Give me a hard six.
- $5, hard six?
- Yes.
- I'm in.
- Hard six. $5 on hard six.
There's another $100.
Boom.
Give me some dice.
Looking for a six.
All right.
Oh, please.
Please.
Thank you.
And you.
- Jimmy, don't roll.
Give me the dice.
- No, I got it.
Hard six, six.
Looking for a six.
Seven out.
Line in, the dark side wins.
Last come'll get you some.
- You're good.
But I saw it.
- Saw what?
I saw the switch.
This is a clean game, asshole.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Let's see about that.
Bet you I'll roll a seven.
It's not your roll, sir.
Sir, it's not your roll.
Will you call security?
Put your bets down on the passline.
- These dice are coming up seven.
- Why don't we just let it go?
No.
We're going to let it ride, Jimmy.
The dice are coming up seven.
- It's not your roll, sir.
- MAN:
Come on, baby.
- What a surprise.
- No, folks.
No payouts.
- Wait a minute.
- Calm down.
Just take care of that bet, then we're even.
I would, but it wasn't a legitimate bet.
You're not the shooter.
- Security.
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Is there a problem?
- The problem is your dice are loaded.
Does your boss know about this?
Just give me my money.
Come on.
Let's go.
What now, bitch?
Come on!
Special Forces.
Wow.
I'll take that.
What are you doing?
Special Forces.
Special treatment.
This guy knows Hamilton.
You just hold him down.
Come on, Burke.
Folks.
He's pretty banged up, inside and out.
Whoever did this left him for dead.
A lesser man wouldn't have survived.
- I need a statement from him, Doctor.
- He's in no condition to give you one...
I'll also need a copy of your write-up, with toxicology
- and blood-alcohol level.
- What are you talking about?
I'm just trying to get some facts.
You need to be arresting whoever tried to kill my brother, not testing his blood.
I'm just doing my job, Michelle.
Okay?
I understand how you feel.
But we still don't know who started all this.
- It wasn't Chris.
- Just find out who did this to him, Stan.
I'll do my best, Mr. Vaughn.
I really will.
In the meantime I have to file a full report.
Will you let me know when I can talk to him?
Thank you.
- He's going to be fine, Michelle.
- Thanks.
- Beautiful flowers.
- Thank you.
They're for my best friend.
Hey, Sarge.
So much for our VIP status.
Don't they teach you any basic fighting skills in the Army?
How did you do?
Not good.
But I tell you, that guy was feeling me this morning.
- You okay?
- That was a hell of a homecoming party.
Chris, I don't know if you noticed, but this ain't exactly home anymore.
Hang on.
Let me help you.
Come on.
I'm good, Mom.
I got it.
- Need some help?
- No.
I'm just milking it.
There's some old crutches in the garage.
CONNIE:
Thanks, Pete.
CHRIS:
Crutches.
That's nice.
Did you see the hole?
- Mind if I watch TV?
- No, that's cool.
CHRIS:
Ray.
- Somebody's feeling better.
- Little bit.
You make this?
Need anything?
- Something wrong?
- No, it's good, man.
It's good.
No, I'm good, Dad.
Thanks.
- Changed the plugs a while back.
- I appreciate that, Dad.
I might've had serious issues with your career choice, but it just didn't seem fair to take it out on an innocent truck.
Where you headed?
I was going into town to get supplies.
Want to come?
Let's go.
Your whole life, all you wanted to do was get out of here.
What made you come back now?
You're going to think I'm crazy.
I would think about the mill.
When I was a kid going to visit you at work, the smell of that fresh-cut cedar...
You remember that smell.
I remember a lot of nice things before the mill closed.
CHRIS:
When did they go out of business?
MR. VAUGHN:
Closed about six months ago.
There's a Home Depot about 15 minutes up the road.
And that?
Don't ask.
First of all, I just want to say thanks.
- For what?
- For making that stickman.
He's been fired and his gaming permit's been pulled.
I just have no idea why my security cameras didn't catch that.
They miss a lot in your place, don't they, Jay?
- Look, Chris, I hate seeing you like this.
- Your boys did it.
Wait a second.
So they got a little rough.
They're a bit edgy.
Understandably.
You don't know what kind of assholes they have to put up with on a daily basis.
Look, they've been reprimanded.
But they say you went nuts, man.
I'm sorry.
Insensitive.
I know the proper term that vets use is post-traumatic stress...
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Whatever.
You tore my place apart, and it wasn't easy to get my guys to agree not to press charges.
Chris, if you had a problem, shouldn't you have come to me?
I want to bring you inside.
I want to make you head of security.
- What do you say?
- No.
I guess you probably need time to think about it.
I figured as much.
This is for you.
It's a little something to help you get, you know...
Come on, man, don't be like that.
I came all the way out here to your house, just to see you get back on your feet.
I'm going to the sheriff.
I'm really sorry you feel that way.
I'll see you around, Chris.
I know, it was a good time, wasn't it?
Excuse me.
I got to call you back.
Hey, Chris.
It's good to see you up and about.
You're looking spiffy.
I'm here to press charges.
This isn't about that incident at the casino a while back?
Yeah.
It is.
Because that matter's closed.
You're lucky you weren't brought in on charges.
I mean...
Did you even look into it?
They did an internal investigation.
That's good enough for me.
An internal investigation?
I know you're familiar with the term no-fly zone.
Because that's what the casino is.
Since the mill closed down, that casino is the main source of revenue in this town.
So case closed, basically.
We'll see you.
- I'm not going to let this stand.
- Excuse me?
- What did you say to me?
- I said I'm not going to let this stand.
You're lucky to be alive right now.
That's all you need to be concentrating on.
This is my town.
Okay?
I'm the sheriff here.
I'll tell you what will stand.
Not the other way around.
Now please get out of my building.
Hi.
Hey.
- Come in.
- Thanks.
This belongs to you.
I appreciate that.
I thought this was history.
- Could have left it in the trash, but I...
- Deni?
- Nice to see you, dear.
- Hi, Mrs. Vaughn.
Can I talk to you outside for a second?
Quick walk.
Mom, I'll be right back.
- How you been?
- Been better.
Talk to the sheriff yet?
I went down to the police station.
I talked to somebody with a badge.
He sure as hell didn't seem like much of a sheriff.
He's up for reelection, you know.
- Maybe you could take his job.
- Somebody ought to.
How about you?
Nothing but sunshine and pine trees.
Been reading these books.
Teach you how to cultivate your happiness.
Focus on the future.
- Go with the flow, that sort of thing.
- Is it working?
I have my moments.
So, the casino, huh?
Yeah.
Been there almost a year.
- Treating you good?
- A lot better than it treated you.
I like that.
Jay Hamilton's done well for himself, hasn't he?
He's a real go-getter, that one.
He must be.
I heard he got you.
That lasted about eight minutes.
It was a long time ago.
You still work for him, though.
Rent's got to be paid, Chris.
I suppose so.
- Hope to see you around.
- Do you?
Thanks for the jacket.
And where is he?
It's okay, Mom.
He's stabilized.
It was close.
Crystal meth.
I'm sorry.
I never did it before.
It's true.
We might've kind of pushed him into it.
- Where'd you get the drugs?
- I'm not really sure...
Stop.
Where?
From the security guys working at the casino.
Chris, wait.
Call the police.
No.
It won't do any good.
- Is Pete okay?
- He'll be fine.
What are you doing?
No, Chris.
Not like this.
Listen to me.
If you go out of here with that gun, they're going to nail...
I've been looking for you.
Guess that changes our relationship a bit, huh?
You should not have come looking for trouble.
Keep your hands up.
Get out of the vehicle now, Chris.
Now!
- POLICEMAN:
Step back, please.
- Just move toward the front of the car.
Put your hands on the hood.
CROWE:
I advise you to give this offer more than a little serious thought.
If you go to trial, you stand to do 18 years.
Now, this is a sweetheart plea.
Normally they wouldn't even put it on the table, but your military record can't be ignored.
Three months home arrest, some community service,
- pretty generous offer, Chris.
- But I'd have to plead guilty.
Look at it from the other side.
There's over a dozen witnesses, none of whom will paint a flattering picture.
- He started busting up the machines.
- There was a gunshot.
- He just went crazy.
- A complete psychopath.
They're only offering me this deal just to keep me quiet.
I still say you should take it.
I wasn't wrong.
And I won't say I was.
BOOTH:
Our job is to keep order.
There was no chance of that once he came in.
Me and my men, we were just trying to control him.
He's highly trained, violent.
A very dangerous person.
So violent, so dangerous, so highly trained, that he dispatched six of the casino security staff single-handedly.
Six men, single-handedly.
His weapon of choice, a simple piece of cedar, which, in his hands, became a devastating force with one aim.
To hurt people and destroy property.
He went directly for everything.
He just came in and took over the place.
You said he broke your arm.
BURKE:
Yeah, that's correct.
My right forearm.
Both bones with a single shot.
It was crazy.
Toss a couple of drunks now and then.
Guys try to grope the girls.
But nothing with this sort of violence.
PROSECUTOR:
Did he give you any kind of advance warning, a chance to defend yourself?
We tussled, but he's a big guy.
He was on a mission.
Besides, he seemed to be too busy enjoying himself from what I could see.
So from what you saw, he seemed to have some kind of purpose?
He had a point to prove.
I was emptying machines when he came in and started swinging.
- I was trying to get out of there.
- MAN 1:
He was a menace.
MAN 2:
A very dangerous person.
MAN 3:
Military-trained.
WOMAN 1:
He seemed like a complete psychopath.
MAN 4:
Nothing close to this.
MAN 5:
I didn't know what he'd do.
WOMAN 2:
I was frightened.
MAN 6:
He came for us.
PROSECUTOR:
No doubt in your mind?
MAN 7:
No doubt.
I have no further questions.
JUDGE:
Mr. Crowe, you may present your client's case.
You're fired.
Your Honor, I'd like to plead my own case.
Order!
If you choose to represent yourself, and not be represented by legal counsel, you realize that you can't then claim a mistrial on that basis?
- Yes, I do.
- Very well, Mr. Vaughn.
I don't deny anything that was said here today.
Does that mean you're changing your plea to guilty?
I'm not guilty of anything, except standing up for myself when the law wouldn't.
Objection.
He's trying to introduce prior events.
Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, stay on point.
I grew up in this town.
People used to walk tall in this town.
They wouldn't have traded the mill for a crooked casino.
We're not here to listen to civic speeches...
And they wouldn't have stood around while drugs were sold to kids.
- Objection!
- Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, you're close to being held in contempt.
I was justified in what I did.
And if you acquit me of these charges, then I'm gonna run for sheriff.
- Mr. Vaughn.
- And if elected, I'm gonna fix this town.
JUDGE:
Order.
Please take your seat.
Mr. Vaughn, you are now charged with contempt.
And I will make sure that this...
- Objection.
- Sustained.
...never happens to anyone again without punishing those who did it.
I'm ordering the jury to ignore what they've just seen.
Mr. Vaughn, take your seat.
Order.
Or you're all charged with contempt!
JUDGE:
Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
Defendant, please rise.
We find the defendant, Chris Vaughn, not guilty.
This is mine.
ALL:
Sheriff Vaughn!
- Sheriff.
- Watkins.
You won the election.
Congratulations.
But we do have a tradition of professional courtesy up here.
And I can personally vouch for each and every one of these men.
They're good deputies.
You're all fired.
- JAY:
Hey, Chris.
- License and registration, please.
You're joking, right?
License and registration.
What's the problem, Sheriff?
You.
And the drugs you're peddling out of your casino.
The only thing that's going on in my casino is construction.
You took care of that.
That's right.
And I plan on taking care of everything else, too.
If you can, try to think this through.
A casino is a license to print money.
Why would I jeopardize that by selling drugs?
Because you owned the town, Jay.
That's changed now.
Really?
The only thing I think has changed around here is that you get to wake up every morning and put on that nifty little badge.
But underneath it is the same guy who couldn't make it playing college football, and apparently couldn't make it in the Army, and not really ever gonna make it as a cop.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
And if you push too hard, you're going to be a man who never gets to see 40.
License, please.
Thanks, Sheriff.
Sir, get your taillights fixed.
It's your last warning.
What's wrong with my taillights?
They're broken.
- RAY:
Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning, Deputy.
No.
Come on, man.
You know I hate cops.
You've been sheriff for about two minutes, and I'm already starting to hate you.
- I'm a convicted felon.
- I've got pull around here.
Now you're a crooked cop doing favors for friends.
That's how it starts.
Next thing you know you'll be taking bribes, setting up roadblocks,
- frisking dudes' crotches.
- Are you done?
- Ray, I need your help.
- Don't do that.
I need you to take me to drug school.
I get to wear a uniform?
RAY:
The stuff in this town is five-star, factory pure.
CHRIS:
So let's go get the factory.
RAY:
Easier said than done.
CHRIS:
We know Hamilton's boys are selling that shit down at the casino.
RAY:
Yeah, but 99% of the time they're clean.
So we got to play follow-the-money, starting with the tweakers.
That'll give us the suppliers.
These guys are real edgy, so delicacy is the key.
Then we put the squeeze on them till they spit out the location of the next buy.
- Where'd you learn that, Ray?
- Cops.
That's a good show.
Phase three, we strike.
CHRIS:
I thought you said delicacy was the key.
RAY:
That's right.
Delicacy and precision.
MAN:
Hey, what's up?
CHRIS:
Get out of here.
- You're sure you're not carrying anything?
- I don't have shit.
- Officer.
- Yeah.
Search him.
This is going to be a switch.
Spread your legs.
Arms down.
You been working out?
Nothing there.
Somebody needs a bath.
Now you read me my rights, then you take me in, and I call my lawyer.
Okay.
But I have a hunch there may be something else in here.
Could be.
Go to it, Deputy.
Have a good time.
Oops.
- He ain't talking.
- I know.
Handles pretty good.
He's clean.
Guess we got to go with Plan B.
Screw you both.
I do have a bit of information for you.
It's not just me, actually.
There's a whole lot of people in this one.
Spit it out.
You're gonna get hurt.
What an idiot.
Why does it always have to be your fight?
- You might need this.
- No.
- I put my guns down a long time ago.
- Come on.
You're just being stubborn.
You and me both, boy.
Chris, listen.
You be careful.
I will.
Please step away from the vehicle!
Mr. Booth, are you still upset over that body-cavity search?
I forgot, you got no vehicle.
Please disperse!
There is nothing to...
Can I talk to you?
- Sure.
- Over here?
I'm gonna stay here with him tonight.
I need you to look after my parents' place.
Think they're gonna take it that far?
- I'm with you, man.
I'll check in later.
- Okay.
COMMENTATOR ON TV:
A drive to right field.
It's dropping for a single.
BOOTH:
You making house calls?
- Don't shoot.
- Hey.
How's the food around here?
Nice.
I brought you special treats.
Salad, fried chicken, potato salad.
- Do you have glasses?
- Yeah.
- Do you have to work tonight?
- I quit.
I figured you were making some changes around here,
I could make a few myself.
Salt and pepper?
- Who is that?
- Pete.
- Want something to eat?
- No.
I'm good, man.
I got to get a bigger bed.
No, you don't.
Do it.
I'm hungry.
We've got leftovers.
I want pancakes.
And eggs.
And bacon.
I told you, Vaughn.
Stay here.
Who needs to step away from the vehicle now, Vaughn?
BOOTH:
Truck for a truck, baby!
That's right!
Truck for a truck!
Get down!
Tear it up, boys!
Pete, something's burning.
Take this.
Get in there.
Good morning, honey.
Get out of here.
Sheriff, are you home?
I told you someone was going to get hurt!
Come here.
When I say now, start shooting!
Over there!
Stay low.
Vaughn!
You got to get me out of here.
Move it.
Go!
Move it, old man.
- Where's Pete?
- I don't know.
Sit down.
- I know who you are.
- Oh, yeah?
- Burke?
- Son of a bitch.
Check it out.
Come on!
Get me out of here, man!
- What's it worth to you?
Where's the lab?
- Screw you!
Hamilton's operation is at the mill, okay?
Now get me out of here!
Drop it.
Stay down!
Stay down.
You okay?
Shit.
I thought I warned you, Chris.
I didn't want this to happen.
I'm going in!
Right there, punk!
Come on, Chris!
Come on!
Deni, now!
Deni.
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Where is everybody?
- Pete ran outside.
You stabbed me with a potato peeler.
You gonna be okay?
Hey, Chris.
Get up, Jay.
Just a second.
Remember when we used to play hide-and-seek up here?
- That was my favorite sound.
- Get up!
Look, Chris...
You want to know what my new favorite sound's gonna be?
The sound of you screaming like a little bitch.
Bet you wish you took that job offer now?
But, no!
You had to be Mr. Hero Boy!
You forgot this, this is my town!
Yes!
You're nothing.
You're right, Jay.
This does change our relationship.
This is my town.
You're under arrest.
That ought to do it.
What are you doing?
Getting some souvenirs.
I'm gonna miss the place.
That's how it starts.
Next you'll be accepting bribes and setting speed traps all over town.
Cutting up trucks.
You know how you are.
Not to mention the cavity searches.
You're gonna like that.
RAY:
Speaking of which, do you think Jay's got a casino in the pen?
CHRIS:
Could be.
RAY:
Running the Shower Tower with the fellas?
He's probably blowing on somebody's dice right now.
RAY:
That's lunch.
CHRIS:
Let's go pick up my old man, grab something to eat.
I'm with you, buddy.

- (man) There you go, Rox.
- Thanks, Ben.
See you tomorrow.
(car drives up)
How you doin"?
OK.
- When did the mill close?
- Three years ago this August.
If you"re looking for work, try Aberdeen.
That"s the closest mill.
- That"s too bad.
- lt"s simple economics.
We have a really nice casino here, the Wild Cherry.
You wanna make some money, try your luck at the blackjack tables.
I don"t think so.
Thanks.
You"re Chris Vaughn?
Well, hell:
I know all about you, Chris.
I know your folks.
I"m Sheriff Stan Watkins.
- How you doin"?
- Ralston, get out of the car.
He"s a real soldier.
Pay some respects.
- Welcome home, soldier.
- Thanks.
- Here. I"ll give you a ride to your folks.
- No, I"m fine, thank you.
- l insist.
- l"ll walk.
It"s my pleasure.
I won"t take no for an answer.
Hey:
Get in the car.
(Watkins laughs)
- Did I scare you with that one?
- A little bit.
I scared him:
- You were gone a while, huh?
- Eight years.
- Harstad was sheriff back then.
- Aaron Harstad, yeah.
Sad story.
About five months back, he fell asleep at the wheel and... hit a tree.
Car folded up like an accordion.
He was a good man.
A good man and a good sheriff.
All right.
- Thank you for the ride.
- Welcome home.
Hey, Chris?
It"s election month. I"m your man, huh?
Good.
Say hey to your old man.
Can I help you?
Little brother:
You come over here and give me a hug.
(both laugh)
You look great.
- What is this?
- Not only you can look good in a uniform.
Hey, Ma:
Chris is here:
- Whose tent?
- lt"s for Pete.
- Watch out, man.
- You"re weak.
- Look at you:
- Mom.
How you doin"?
- How long is your leave?
- For good. I"m home.
- Really?
You"re not kidding?
- No.
- Hey, Dad.
- Welcome back.
(laughter)
(mother) I wish you had told us exactly when you were coming. I"d have cooked.
- No, this is great.
- What"ll you do now that you"re home?
I planned to work at the mill.
You never wrote it was closed.
Not to worry you when your dad got laid off.
- l got my business.
The furniture.
- l substitute at the elementary school.
Michelle pitches in.
We try to keep things simple.
(Michelle) Pete:
This is your Uncle Chris.
- Hey, Pete.
- Sit down.
Say hello.
- Last time he saw you, you couldn"t walk.
- Now I"m camping.
I said you could sleep on the couch.
It was Chris"s room first.
- Your tent will leak. I could fix it.
- Doesn"t look like rain, Colonel.
Pete:
Sit down, have something to eat.
- l was a sergeant. I worked for a living.
- Oh, a grunt.
- Did you ever smoke anybody?
- Pete:
Poppie still has your gun locked up in the garage.
Can you teach me how to shoot?
- l figured that"d be scrap metal by now.
- No. I"m still hoping you'll melt it down.
- Sorry, Pete.
- Whatever.
- l"m outta here, Mom.
- Hey.
Be back by ten.
- Ten thirty.
- Ten:
- Remind you of anyone?
- (Michelle chuckles)
(thunderclap)
(footsteps)
OK, it rained.
Happy?
No.
Why don"t you crash on the floor?
OK. I"ll crash on the floor.
You crash on the bed.
Uh-uh.
- Pete.
- (thunder)
Keep you dry.
Did you really kill people?

- That"s the Love Machine.

- Please.
Want a beer?
No.
Believe it or not, I quit drinking.
I"ll take a soda, though.
- Here.
- Thanks, man.
- Whoa.
- Like that?
When you left town, it gave me the idea I should do something with my life too.
So I went down to Seattle, got a guitar and became all about music.
Then pretty soon I was about music and drugs.
And pretty soon I was just about drugs and ended up doing two years for B and E.
- l"m sorry.
- Nah...
Look at me now, though, right?
I been clean and sober 1 4 months.
Doing construction and renewing those supportive and healthy friendships from my past.
Matter of fact, I told the bastards you were back and they asked me to remind you that it is Saturday.
- As in...?
- As in kickoff"s in 20 minutes.
- You guys still doin" it.
- Still doin" it.
- Are we playing ball?
- Absolutely.
- Like the old days.
- Ray, go deep, go deep.
Come on:
- When did that happen?
- ""Jay Hamilton Field.""
His parents left him the mill.
In two minutes he shut it down.
- Why?
- (groans)
Heads up:
Cos I opened my casino.
- Still got a gun, huh, Jay?
- Still got your reflexes.
- Get tired of being all that you could be?
- No, I"m still all I can be.
- l"ll just have to see about that.
- Yeah.
- What brings you home?
- l just want to relax.
- You?
Relax?
- Yeah.
Not today.
I got it, I got it.
is that how it"s gonna be?
- (Chris) A little contact, huh?
- Was it too rough?
Sorry, ladies.
Pick up the outside.
Fumble:
How"s that for touch?
- That was pretty.
- Wanna get your pads?

- Did I knock a lung loose?
- Touchdown.

Nah, man.
- You wanna go?
- Nobody"s going.
- Get it out.
- You almost caught it.
- We stop "em here, we win this game.

- Let"s put this to rest.

You stay in and block.

That"s game:
Sorry about that.
Cool, man.

- What the hell was that?
That was a great game, wasn"t it?
is that the bad one?
- Yeah, it was good.
- Hey, welcome home.
- Good to be back.
- See you around.
Hey, if you wanna come by the casino later, I"ll introduce you to some nice girls.
The drinks are on me.
What do you say?
- See you tonight.
- Cool. I"ll see you later on.
Be good.
Hey, sarge.
Good game.
Maybe next time.
Hold up.
Maybe next time I won"t see you in the bleachers smoking weed.

It blends in with the mountains so nicely.
Hi, there.
Hi.

Not bad, huh?
- Not bad.
Pretty girls.
I"m getting chips.
Let"s gamble.
We"ll see you at the Shower Tower.
Here we go. lsn"t it wonderful?

You got your ATM machines, tellers to cash your paycheck.

Just remember, nothing in here is free.
Ma"am.

Don"t say we never did nothing for you.
Don"t worry, buddy.
Everybody"s scared their first time.

- Jimmy, don"t roll.
Give me the dice.
- l got it.
Six.
Lookin" for a six.
Oh:
Seven out.
Line in, the dark side wins.
Last come"ll get you some.
You"re good.
But I saw it.
- Saw what?
- l saw the switch.
- This is a clean game, asshole.
- Yeah?
Let"s see about that.
Bet you I roll a seven.
It"s not your roll, sir.
- Sir, it"s not your roll.
Call security.
- Security:
Put your bets down on the pass line.
These dice"ll come up seven.
- Chris, can"t we just let it go?
- No:
We"re gonna let it ride, Jimmy.
The dice are comin" up seven.
It"s not your roll, sir.
- What a surprise(:)
- No, folks, no.
No payout.
- Just take care of that bet and we"re even.
- lt wasn"t a legitimate bet.
You"re not the shooter. lt"s not your roll:
is there a problem?
The problem is your dice are loaded.
Does your boss know about this?
Just give me my money.
Come on, let"s go.
Let"s go:
- Sweet.
- Hey, Ray.
- What now, bitch?
- Come on:
Ray?
Are you all right?
Ray:
""Special Forces"".
Wow. I"ll take that.
What are you doin"?
Special Forces, special treatment.
This guy knows Hamilton.
(growls)
You just hold him down.
Come on, Burke:
(Chris groans)
(truck honks)
Folks.
He"s pretty banged up, inside and out.
Whoever did this left him for dead.
A lesser man wouldn"t have survived.
- l need a statement from him, Doctor.
- He"s in no condition.
And a copy of your write-up, and toxicology and blood alcohol level.
- What are you saying, Stan?
- Just getting some facts.
You need to arrest whoever tried to kill my brother, not test his blood.
I"m just doing my job.
I understand how you feel.
- But we don"t know yet who started it.
- lt wasn"t Chris.
- Just find out who did this to him, Stan.
- l"ll do my best, Mr Vaughn. I really will.
In the meantime I have to file a full report.
Will you let me know when I can talk to him?
Thank you.
- He"s gonna be fine, Michelle.
- Thanks.
- Beautiful flowers:
- Thank you.
They"re for my best friend.
Hey, sarge.
So much for our vip... status.
Doesn"t the army teach you any basic fighting skills?
- (hoarsely) How did you do?
- Not good.
But I tell you, that guy was feelin" me this morning.
(Chris coughs)
- You OK?
- That was a hell of a homecoming party.
I don"t know if you noticed, but this ain"t exactly home any more.
Hang on.
- Mom.
- Let me help you.
Come on.
I"m good, Mom.
- Need some help?
- Nah. I"m just milking" it.
- There"s some old crutches in the garage.
- (Chris chuckles)
- (mother) Thanks, Pete(:) - (Chris) Crutches.
That"s nice.
(TV on)
(laughs raucously)
Did you see the hole?
- Mind if I watch TV?
- No, that"s cool.
Ray.
- Well, somebody"s feelin" better.
- A little bit.
Did you make this?
- Need anything?
- What"s wrong?
No, it"s good, man. lt"s good.
I"m good, Dad.
Thanks.
(starts engine)
- Changed the plugs a while back.
- l appreciate that, Dad.
I might have had serious issues with your career choice, but it just didn"t seem fair to take it out on an innocent truck.
- Where are you headed?
- into town for some supplies.
- Wanna come?
- Let"s go.
Your whole life, all you wanted to do was to get out of here.
What made you come back now?
You"re gonna think I"m crazy.
I would think about the mill.
When I was a kid going to visit you at work, the smell of that fresh-cut cedar...
You remember that smell.
Mm. I remember a lot of nice things before the mill closed.
- (Chris) When"d they go out of business?
- Closed about six months ago.
There"s a Home Depot about 1 5 minutes up the road.
And that?
Don"t ask.
Hey.
First of all, I just wanna say thanks.
- For what?
- For making that stickman.
He"s been fired and his gaming permit"s been pulled.
I have no idea why my security cameras didn"t catch that.
They miss a lot in your place, don"t they, Jay?
Chris, I hate seeing you like this.
- Your boys did it.
- Now, wait a second.
Wait, wait.
So they got a little rough.
They"re a bit edgy, understandably.
They have to put up with assholes on a daily basis.
Look, they"ve been reprimanded.
But they say you went nuts.
No, I"m sorry. insensitive.
- l know vets call it post-traumatic stress.
- What the fuck are you talking about?
You tore my place apart and it wasn"t easy to keep my guys from pressing charges.
Look, Chris, if you had a problem, shouldn"t you have come to me?
Look, I want to bring you inside.
I want to make you head of security.
What do you say?
No.
I guess you probably need time to think about it. I figured as much.
This is for you.
Just a little something to help you get, you know...
Come on, man, don"t be like that.
I came all the way out here to your house just to see you get back on your feet.
I"m going to the sheriff.
I"m really sorry you feel that way.
I"ll see you around, Chris.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I gotta go.
Hey, Chris. lt"s good to see you up and about.
You"re lookin" spiffy.
I"m here to press charges.
Not about that incident at the casino a while back, is it?
- Yeah, it is.
- Because that matter"s closed.
You"re lucky you weren"t brought in on charges.
Did you even look into it?
They did an internal investigation.
That"s good enough for me.
An internal investigation.
Chris, I know you"re familiar with the term ""no-fly zone"", hm?
Because that"s what the casino is.
Since the mill closed down, that casino is the main source of revenue in this town.
So... case closed, basically.
We"ll see you.
I"m not gonna let this stand.
Excuse me?
- What did you say to me?
- l said, I"m not gonna let this stand.
You"re lucky to be alive right now.
That"s all you need to concentrate on.
This is my town, OK?
I"m the sheriff here.
I"ll tell you what"ll stand.
Not the other way around.
Now please get out of my building.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Come in.
- Thanks.
This belongs to you.
I appreciate that.
I thought this was history.
- Could"ve left it in the trash, but I...
- Deni?
Nice to see you, dear.
Hi, Mrs Vaughn.
- Can I talk to you outside?
Quick walk.
- Yeah.
- Mom, I"ll be right back.
- Chris...
- How you been?
- Been better.
Talk to the sheriff yet?
I went to the police station and talked to somebody with a badge.
But he sure as hell didn"t seem like much of a sheriff.
He"s up for re-election, you know.
Maybe you could take his job.
- Somebody ought to.
- (giggles)
- And how about you?
- Nothing but sunshine and pine trees.
I"ve been reading books about how to cultivate happiness.
Focus on the future, go with the flow, that sort of thing.
- ls it working?
- l have my moments.
- So, the casino, huh?
- Yep. I"ve been there almost a year.
- Treating you good?
- A lot better than it treated you.
Mmm:
I like that.
- Jay Hamilton"s done well for himself.
- Yeah.
He"s a real go-getter, that one.
He must be. I heard he got you.
That lasted about eight minutes a long, long time ago.
You still work for him, though.
Rent"s gotta be paid, Chris.
I suppose so.
- Hope to see you around.
- Do you?
- Thanks for the jacket.
- (honks horn)
And where is he?
OK.
It"s OK, Mom.
He"s stabilised.
It was close.
Crystal meth.
- l"m sorry. I never did it before.
- lt"s true.
We kind of pushed him into it.
- Where"d you get the drugs?
- l"m not sure...
Stop.
Where?
From the security guys working at the casino.
Chris, wait.
Call the police.
No. lt won"t do any good.
- ls Pete OK?
- He"ll be fine.
What are you doing?
Oh, no, Chris.
Not like this.
Chris, listen to me. lf you go out of here with that gun, they"re gonna nail...
Chris:
Chris:
I"ve been lookin" for you.
(yell)
Hey:
I guess that changes our relationship a bit, huh?
(sirens)
You should not have come looking for trouble.
Keep your hands up, get out of the vehicle now, Chris.
Now:
Move towards the front of the car and put your hands on the hood.
(lawyer) I advise you to give this offer serious thought.
If you go to trial, you stand to do 18 years.
This is a sweetheart plea.
Normally it wouldn"t even be on the table, but your military record can"t be ignored.
Three months" home arrest, community service.
A pretty generous offer, Chris.
- But I"d have to plead guilty.
- Look at it from the other side.
There"s a dozen witnesses.
None are gonna paint a flattering picture.
- He busted the machines.
- There was a shot.
- He just went crazy.
- Complete psychopath.
They"re offering this deal to keep me quiet.
I still say you should take it.
I wasn"t wrong, and I won"t say I was.
(Booth) Our job is to keep order.
But there was no chance of that once he came in.
Me and my men, we were just trying to control him.
He"s highly trained, violent, a very dangerous person.
So violent, so dangerous, so highly trained, that he dispatched six of the casino"s security staff single-handedly.
Six men, single-handedly.
His weapon of choice:
a simple piece of cedar, which, in his hands, became a devastating force with one aim - to hurt people and destroy property.
(witness) He went directly for everything.
He just came in and took over the place.
- You said he broke your arm.
- That"s correct.
My right forearm.
Both bones with a single shot.
He was crazy.
We toss a couple of drunks now and then.
Guys grope the girls.
But nothing with this sort of violence.
Did he give you any kind of advance warning?
A chance to defend yourself?
We tussled, but... he"s a big guy.
He was on a mission.
Besides, he seemed to be too busy enjoying himself.
- So he seemed to have some purpose?
- l think he had a point to prove, yeah.
I was emptying machines when Mr Vaughn came in swinging.
- l tried to get out.
- (man) He was a menace.
- Very dangerous.
- Military-trained.
- (woman) Like a psychopath.
- Nothing like this.
- l didn"t know what he"d do.
- Frightened.
- He came for us.
No doubt about it.
- (prosecutor) No further questions.
(judge) Mr Crowe, you may present your client"s case.
You"re fired.
Your Honour,
- l"d like to plead my own case.
- (spectators murmur)
Order.
Order:
(judge pounds gavel)
Mr Vaughn, if you choose to represent yourself and not be represented by legal counsel, you realise that you can"t then claim a mistrial on that basis?
- Yes, I do.
- Very well, Mr Vaughn.
- l don"t deny anything that was said here.
- Are you changing your plea to guilty?
I"m guilty of nothing except standing up for myself when the law wouldn"t.
Objection.
He"s trying to introduce prior events.
Sustained.
Mr Vaughn, stay on point.
I grew up in this town.
People used to walk tall in this town.
They wouldn"t trade the mill for a crooked casino.
- (judge) No civic speeches.
- They wouldn"t let drugs be sold to kids.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
Mr Vaughn, you"re close to being held in contempt.
I was justified in what I did.
And if you acquit me of these charges, I"ll run for sheriff.
- Mr Vaughn...
- lf elected, I"ll fix this town.
- (murmurs)
- Order.
Order:
(judge pounds gavel) Please take your seat:
Mr Vaughn, you are charged with contempt.
And I will make sure that this... never happens to anyone else again without punishing those who did it.
I order the jury to ignore what they"ve just seen.
Mr Vaughn, take your seat.
- (gasps) - (judge pounds gavel)
Order:
Order:
Or you"re all charged with contempt:
Mr Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?
- We have, Your Honour.
- Defendant, please rise.
We find the defendant, Chris Vaughn, not guilty.
This is mine.
(crowd chant) Sheriff Vaughn:
Sheriff Vaughn:
Sheriff Vaughn:
- Sheriff.
- Watkins.
You won the election.
Congratulations.
But we do have a tradition of professional courtesy here.
I can personally vouch for every one of these men.
They"re good deputies.
You"re all fired.
(police siren)
- (Jay) Hey, Chris.
- Licence and registration, please.
- You"re joking, right?
- Licence and registration.
Huh.
What"s the problem...
Sheriff?
You, and the drugs you"re peddling out of your casino.
Only thing going on in my casino now is construction.
You saw to that.
And I plan on taking care of everything else too.
If you can, try to think this through.
A casino is a licence to print money.
Why jeopardise that by selling drugs?
Because you owned the town, Jay.
That"s changed now.
Really?
The only thing I think has changed around here is that you get to wake up every morning and put on that nifty badge.
But you"re the same guy who couldn"t make it in college football, apparently couldn"t make it in the army, and is not gonna make it as a cop.
- ls that right?
- Yeah.
And if you push too hard, you"re gonna be a man who never gets to see 40.
Licence, please.
Thanks, Sheriff.
Sir, get your taillights fixed.
It"s your last warning.
What"s wrong with my taillights?
They"re broken.

- Mornin", Deputy.
No.
No.
No.
Come on, man.
You know I hate cops.
You"ve been sheriff two minutes and I"m already starting to hate you.
- l"m a convicted felon.
- l got pull around here.
Now you"re a crooked cop doing favours for friends.
That"s how it starts.
Next you"ll be taking bribes, setting" up roadblocks, frisking" dudes" crotches.
Are you done?
- Ray, I need your help.
- Aw, don"t do that.
I need you to take me to drug school.
I get to wear a uniform?
(Ray) The stuff in town is five-star, factory pure.
- (Chris) Let's get the factory.
- Easier said than done.
(Chris) Hamilton's boys sell that shit at the casino.
(Ray) But 99% of the time they're clean.
We gotta follow the money, starting' with the tweekers.
They'll give us the suppliers.
These guys are real edgy, so delicacy is the key.
Then we squeeze 'em until they spit out the location of the next buy.
- Where"d you learn that, Ray?
- Cops.
That"s a good show.
- (Ray) Phase three.: we strike.
- l thought you said delicacy was the key.
(Ray) That's right.
Delicacy and precision.
- (Ray) Hey, what"s up?
- (Booth) Get out of here.
(punching and crashing)
My nose:
You"re sure you"re not carrying anything?
I don"t have shit.
- Officer?
- Yeah.
- Search him.
- Oh.
This is gonna be a switch.
Spread your legs.
Arms down.
You been workin" out?
Nothin" there.
Whoo:
Somebody needs a bath.
Mm-hm:
Now you read me my rights.
Then you take me in.
Then I call my lawyer.
OK.
But I have a hunch there may be something else in here.
Could be.
Go to it, Deputy.
Have a good time.
Oops.
- He ain"t talkin".
- l know.
Handles pretty good.
(grunts with effort)
He"s clean.
Guess we gotta go to plan B.
Screw you both.
I do have a bit of information for you.
It"s not just me.
- There"s a whole lot of people on this one.
- Spit it out.
(whispers) You"re gonna get hurt.
Hurt:
What an idiot:
Why does it always have to be your fight?
- You might need this.
- No. I put my guns down a long time ago.
Come on.
You"re just being stubborn.
You and me both, boy.
Chris, listen.
You be careful.
I will.
Please step away from the vehicle.
Are you still upset over that body-cavity search?
I forgot.
You got no vehicle.
(sounds siren)
Please disperse.
There is nothing to s...
- Can I talk to you?
Over here?
- Yeah.
I"ll stay here with him tonight.
You look after my parents" place.
Think they"re gonna take it that far?
I"m with you, man.
- l"ll check in later.
- OK.
(Booth) Deni:
You making house calls?
Don"t shoot.
- Hey.
- Hi.
How"s the food around here?
Mm.
Nice.
I brought you special treats.
Salad.
Fried chicken.
Potato salad.
- Do you have glasses?
- Yeah.
- Do you have to work tonight?
- l quit.
I figured if you were making some changes here, I could make a few myself.
Salt and pepper?

- Huh?
Who"s that?
- Pete.
- Want something" to eat?
- No, I"m good, man.
(groans)
I gotta get a bigger bed.
No.
No, you don"t.
(speed-dials on cellphone)
Do it.
I"m hungry.
- We"ve got leftovers.
- Mm-mm.
- l want pancakes.
- Hm.
- And eggs.
- Mm-hm?
And bacon.
(screams)
(yells)
I told you, Vaughn:
- Stay here.
- (Booth) Uh-oh:
Who needs to step away from the vehicle now?
.
A truck for a truck, baby:
That"s right:
A truck for a truck:
(Booth whoops)
(machine-gun fire)
Get down:
(Booth) Tear it up, boys:
Tear it up:
(yells)
(whooping)
Pete, something"s burning.
Pete?
- (gunfire) - (Booth whoops)
Take this:
Get in there:
Pete?
Good morning, honey.
Pete, get outta here:
Sheriff, are you home?
I told you someone was gonna get hurt:
Hey:
(yells)
Come here:
When I say ""now"", start shooting.
Over there:
Agh:
Stay low.
Vaughn:
You gotta get me outta here:
Move it.
Go:
Move it, old man.
- Where"s Pete?
- l don"t know.
Sit down:
- l know who you are.
- Oh, yeah?
(glass smashes)
Burke?
Son of a bitch.
Check it out.
(Booth) Come on:
Get me outta here, man:
- What"s it worth to you?
Where"s the lab?
- Screw you:
OK:
Hamilton"s operation is at the mill, OK?
It"s at the mill:
Now get me out of here:
Drop it.
Stay down:
- Pete:
- Stay down:
Hey.
You OK?
I thought I warned you, Chris:
I didn"t want this to happen:
I"m goin" in:
(Watkins) Whoo-hoo:
Right there, punk:
Come on, Chris:
(yells)
Come on, Chris Vaughn:
Whoo-hoo:
Deni, now:
(clicks)
Deni.
(clicking)
Deni.
(panting)
Ow:
I"m sorry.
I"m sorry.
- Where is everybody?
- Pete ran outside.
Agh:
You stabbed me with a potato peeler?
(gunshot)
You gonna be OK?
(hollow knock)
(hollow knock)
(hollow knock)
(hollow knock)
(choked cough)
- (sniffs) Ugh.
- (hollow knock)
Hey, Chris.
- Get up, Jay.
- Just a second.
Remember when we used to play hide-and-seek up here?
(hollow sound)
- That was my favourite sound.
- Get up:
Look, Chris, just...
Wanna know what my new favourite sound"s gonna be?
The sound of you screamin" like a little bitch.
Bet you wish you took that job offer now.
But no, you had to be Mr Hero Boy:
But you forgot this: this is my town.
(both scream)
Argh:
- (bone cracks) - (groans with pain)
(yells)
You"re nothin". (spits)
Argh:
You"re right, Jay.
This does change our relationship.
This is my town.
You"re under arrest.
That oughta do it.
What are you doing?
Gettin" some souvenirs.
I"m gonna miss the place.
That"s how it starts.
Next you"ll be accepting bribes, setting speed traps, cutting" up trucks.
You know how you are.
Not to mention the cavity searches.
You"ll like that.
- (Ray) Think Jay has a casino in the pen?
- Could be.
(Ray) Runnin" the Shower Tower with the fellas?
Bet he"s blowin" on somebody"s dice now.
(both laugh wickedly)
- (mill whistle) - (Ray) That"s lunch.
- (Chris) Let"s pick up my old man and eat.
- l"m with you, buddy.

Doreen Trenerry
- Here you go.
- Thanks, man.
See you tomorrow.
How you doing?
Okay.
- When did the mill close?
- Three years ago this August.
If you're looking for work, you may want to try Aberdeen.
That's about the closest mill work you'll find.
- Too bad.
- It's just simple economics.
You know, we have a really nice casino, the Wild Cherry.
Want to make some money, maybe you ought to go on down... and try your luck at the blackjack tables.
No, I don't think so.
Thanks.
You're Chris Vaughn?
Well, hell.
I know all about you, Chris.
I know your folks.
I'm Sheriff Stan Watkins.
- How you doing?
- Ralston, get out of the car!
You're looking at a real soldier here.
Pay some respects.
- Welcome home, soldier.
- Thanks.
Well, hell, Chris.
- I'll give you a ride up to your folks'.
- No, I'm fine.
Thank you.
- I insist.
- I'll walk.
- It's my pleasure.
- It's okay.
I won't take no for an answer.
Get in the car.
- Did I scare you with that one?
- Little bit.
I scared him.
You were gone a while, huh?
Eight years.
Harstad was sheriff back then.
Aaron Harstad, yeah.
Sad story.
About five months back, he fell asleep at the wheel and hit a tree.
Car folded up like an accordion.
He was a good man.
A good man and a good sheriff.
All right.
- Thank you very much for the ride.
- Welcome home, Chris.
It's election month.
I'm your man.
Okay.
Say hey to your old man.
Let's go.
Can I help you?
Little brother.
You come over here and give me a hug.
- You look great.
- What is this?
I couldn't let you be the only one looking good in uniform.
Hey, Ma.
Chris is here.
- Whose tent?
- That's for Pete.
- Watch out, now.
- Chris.
- Look at you.
- Mom, how you doing?
How long's your leave?
How long do we have you?
For good.
I'm home.
- Really?
You're not kidding?
- No.
- Hey, Dad.
- Welcome back.
I wish you had told us exactly when you were coming.
I'd have cooked.
- This is fine, Mom.
- We love Chinese.
- No, this is great.
- So what are you going to do now?
I was planning to work at the mill, but you never mentioned it closed.
We didn't want to bother you when your father got laid off.
I got my business.
You saw the furniture outside.
And I substitute at the elementary school.
Michelle pitches in... we try to keep things simple.
Pete.
- This is your Uncle Chris.
- Hey, Pete.
Sit down.
Say hello.
Last time he saw you, you were barely walking.
- And now I'm camping.
- I said you could sleep on the couch.
It was Chris' room first.
Your tent's going to take on water.
I can show you how to rig it.
Doesn't look like it's going to rain to me, Colonel.
Sit down.
Eat something.
First of all, I was a sergeant.
I worked for a living.
A grunt.
- Did you ever smoke anybody?
- Pete!
Poppa's still got your gun locked up in the garage.
- Would you teach me how to shoot?
- I figured that'd be scrap metal by now.
No.
I'm still hoping you'll melt that thing down on your own.
- Sorry, Pete.
- Whatever.
- I'm out of here, Mom.
- Be back by 10:00.
- 10:30.
- 10:00.
Remind you of anyone?
Okay, it rained.
Happy?
No.
Why don't you crash on the floor?
Okay.
I'll crash on the floor.
You crash on the bed.
Keep you dry.
Did you really kill people?
- Ray-Ray.
- Hello, pudding.
- What's up, man?
- Good to see you, man.
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.
What is that?
- That's the Love Machine.
- Girls actually get in there?
- How you been?
- Good.
- Clean living?
- Please.
You want a beer?
No.
Believe it or not, I quit drinking.
I'd take a soda, though.
Okay.
Here.
Thanks, man.
Like that?
When you left town... it gave me the idea I should do something with my life, too.
So I went down to Seattle, got a guitar, and became all about music.
And then, pretty soon, I was about music and drugs... and pretty soon I was basically just about drugs... and ended up doing two years for B and E.
I'm sorry.
Look at me now, though, right?
I've been clean and sober 14 months.
Doing construction and renewing those supportive and healthy friendships... from my past.
Matter of fact, I talked to the bastards, told them you were back... and they asked me to politely remind you that it is Saturday.
- As in...
- As in, kick-off's in 20 minutes.
- Like old times.
- You guys still doing it.
We're still doing it.
- Playing ball?
- Absolutely.
Let's go, superstar!
- Just like the old days.
Go deep.
- Come on.
When did that happen?
Jay Hamilton Field.
His parents hadn't left him the mill for more than two minutes...
- before he shut it down.
- Why?
Heads up!
Because I opened my casino.
Still got a gun, huh, Jay?
Still got your reflexes.
What?
Did you get tired of being all that you could be?
- No.
I'm still all I can be.
- Really?
- I'll just have to see about that.
- Yeah.
- What brings you home?
- I just want to relax.
Catch my breath.
- You?
Relax?
- Yeah.
Not today.
I got it.
Let's go.
Come on!
Is that how it's going to be?
That's how it is.
- Full contact, huh?
- That's two-hand touch.
Too rough?
Sorry, ladies.
Pick up the outside!
- Fumble!
- Set!
How's that for touch?
- That was pretty, wasn't it?
- Want to go get your pads?
- That the best you got?
- What?
- Here, take a walk...
- And knock a long loose?
- Touchdown.
- First and your last.
- You want to go?
- Nobody's going.
We're not going to go.
You almost caught it.
- We stop them here, we win, right?
- Right, boys, last play.
- You know how I like winning.
- We need to put this to rest.
- I will take care of Ray.
- You two cross.
You stay in and block.
Booth?
Isolate on Vaughn.
- You two cross...
- Just give me the ball.
- Go low.
Left knee.
- All right, man.
You got it?
On the first hut.
Ready?
Break!
Be strong.
All right, Chris Vaughn.
Last chance.
- Black-nineteen!
Black!
- Watch the outside!
I'm open!
That's game.
Sorry about that.
Cool, man.
Nice game, ladies.
What the hell was that?
That was a great game, wasn't it?
Is that the bad one?
- Yeah, it was good.
- Hey, welcome home.
Good to be back.
See you around.
If you're not doing anything later on, want to come by the casino?
Introduce you to some nice girls.
Drinks are on me.
What do you say?
- See you tonight.
- Cool.
I'll see you later on.
Be good.
Hey, Sarge.
Good game.
Maybe next time.
Hold up.
Maybe next time I won't see you in the bleachers, smoking weed.
Welcome home, buddy.
I thought you had to be Native American to own a casino.
- Hamilton's one-sixteenth Blackfoot now.
- Put it on his application.
And what he slid under the table convinced the powers that be it was true.
- It's ours for the taking tonight.
- Let's pick some cherries, boys.
- Here we go.
- I'm feeling lucky.
Just so you guys know, I'm done after I triple my money.
That's what you said last time.
You wound up selling your body for bus fare.
He had to walk.
Nobody's going to have any problems finding this place.
It's the subtle attention to aesthetics that I find most impressive.
Blends in with the mountain so nicely.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
How you doing?
- See?
Not bad, huh?
- It's not bad.
A lot of pretty girls.
I'm getting chips.
Let's gamble.
We'll see you at the Shower Tower, okay?
Isn't it wonderful?
All your gambling needs under one great, big roof.
You got your ATM machines, tellers to cash your paycheck... and when you're here, you don't got to worry about things... like child support, rent, laws of mathematical probability.
Gentlemen, Mr. Hamilton would like to invite you to the VIP lounge.
- The dream team.
You all healed up?
- Nice place.
Welcome to my world.
Tonight all the drinks are on the house.
If you need a line of credit, say how much.
If you need a little female companionship, done.
All right?
- Get inside.
Have a good time.
- Where you going?
Don't you worry about me.
I got a few things to do.
Enjoy.
Just remember, nothing in here is free.
Ma'am.
- Cherry shot?
- Ray, be nice.
Come on, this place is nothing but fake boobs... and real assholes, if you ask me.
Just water for me.
Drink up.
We got money to win and girls just waiting.
- We are VIPs.
- Here's to you, Chris.
- Welcome home.
- Cheers.
Let's play, boys.
Go right ahead.
Already lost $1...
Good night.
Okay.
Don't say we never did nothing for you.
Don't worry, buddy, everybody's scared their first time.
- Come on.
- Get in there, Chris.
Okay, just sit back and enjoy it.
- This'll get you started.
- Lf you're not back by morning... we'll send a search party.
- Have fun.
- Stop drinking.
You from here, or are you just visiting?
A little of both.
I grew up here.
So you're seeing all the old faces.
You could say that.
Your voice sounds very familiar.
Chris.
Deni.
- Look who's back.
- So, good surprise?
I told you it was better than gambling.
You met Candi?
- Hello.
- Hey, Candi.
Let's go.
Six, easy six.
Looking for a six to win.
We can do a six.
Can we do a six?
I think I can do a six, right?
We got liftoff!
Whack it, boys.
Whack it.
Blue or pink, what do you think?
Who's up for two out of three?
I'm getting killed.
Let me have a C-note to put $200 on a bet.
- No.
- Come on.
Hell, no.
Look at them.
He's hot.
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Give me a hard six.
- $5, hard six?
- Yes.
- I'm in.
- Hard six. $5 on hard six.
There's another $100.
Boom.
Give me some dice.
Looking for a six.
All right.
Oh, please.
Please.
Thank you.
And you.
- Jimmy, don't roll.
Give me the dice.
- No, I got it.
Hard six, six.
Looking for a six.
Seven out.
Line in, the dark side wins.
Last come'll get you some.
- You're good.
But I saw it.
- Saw what?
I saw the switch.
This is a clean game, asshole.
Let's see about that.
Bet you'll roll a seven.
It's not your roll, sir.
Sir, it's not your roll.
Will you call security?
Put your bets down on the passline.
- These dice are coming up seven.
- Why don't we just let it go?
No.
We're going to let it ride, Jimmy.
The dice are coming up seven.
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Come on, baby.
- What a surprise.
- No, folks.
No payouts.
- Wait a minute.
- Calm down.
Just take care of that bet, then we're even.
I would, but it wasn't a legitimate bet.
You're not the shooter.
- Security.
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Is there a problem?
- The problem is your dice are loaded.
Does your boss know about this?
Just give me my money.
Come on.
Let's go.
What now, bitch?
Come on!
Special Forces.
Wow.
I'll take that.
What are you doing?
Special Forces.
Special treatment.
This guy knows Hamilton.
You just hold him down.
Come on, Burke.
Folks.
He's pretty banged up, inside and out.
Whoever did this left him for dead.
A lesser man wouldn't have survived.
- I need a statement from him, Doctor.
- He's in no condition to give you one...
I'll also need a copy of your write-up, with toxicology...
- and blood-alcohol level.
- What are you talking about?
I'm just trying to get some facts.
You need to be arresting whoever tried to kill my brother, not testing his blood.
I'm just doing my job, Michelle.
Okay?
I understand how you feel.
But we still don't know who started all this.
- It wasn't Chris.
- Just find out who did this to him, Stan.
I'll do my best, Mr. Vaughn.
I really will.
In the meantime I have to file a full report.
Will you let me know when I can talk to him?
Thank you.
- He's going to be fine, Michelle.
- Thanks.
- Beautiful flowers.
- Thank you.
They're for my best friend.
Hey, Sarge.
So much for our VIP status.
Don't they teach you any basic fighting skills in the Army?
How did you do?
Not good.
But I tell you, that guy was feeling me this morning.
- You okay?
- That was a hell of a homecoming party.
Chris, I don't know if you noticed, but this ain't exactly home anymore.
Hang on.
Let me help you.
Come on.
I'm good, Mom.
I got it.
- Need some help?
- No.
I'm just milking it.
There's some old crutches in the garage.
- Thanks, Pete.
- Crutches.
That's nice.
Did you see the hole?
- Mind if I watch TV?
- No, that's cool.
- Somebody's feeling better.
- Little bit.
You make this?
Need anything?
- Something wrong?
- No, it's good, man.
It's good.
No, I'm good, Dad.
Thanks.
- Changed the plugs a while back.
- I appreciate that, Dad.
I might've had serious issues with your career choice... but it just didn't seem fair to take it out on an innocent truck.
Where you headed?
I was going into town to get supplies.
Want to come?
Let's go.
Your whole life, all you wanted to do was get out of here.
What made you come back now?
You're going to think I'm crazy.
I would think about the mill.
When I was a kid going to visit you at work, the smell of that fresh-cut cedar...
You remember that smell.
I remember a lot of nice things before the mill closed.
When did they go out of business?
Closed about six months ago.
There's a Home Depot about 15 minutes up the road.
And that?
Don't ask.
First of all, I just want to say thanks.
- For what?
- For making that stickman.
He's been fired and his gaming permit's been pulled.
I just have no idea why my security cameras didn't catch that.
They miss a lot in your place, don't they, Jay?
- Look, Chris, I hate seeing you like this.
- Your boys did it.
Wait a second.
So they got a little rough.
They're a bit edgy.
Understandably.
You don't know what kind of assholes they have to put up with on a daily basis.
Look, they've been reprimanded.
But they say you went nuts, man.
I'm sorry.
Insensitive.
I know the proper term that vets use is post-traumatic stress...
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Whatever.
You tore my place apart... and it wasn't easy to get my guys to agree not to press charges.
Chris, if you had a problem, shouldn't you have come to me?
I want to bring you inside.
I want to make you head of security.
- What do you say?
- No.
I guess you probably need time to think about it.
I figured as much.
This is for you.
It's a little something to help you get, you know...
Come on, man, don't be like that.
I came all the way out here to your house, just to see you get back on your feet.
I'm going to the sheriff.
I'm really sorry you feel that way.
I'll see you around, Chris.
I know, it was a good time, wasn't it?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I got to call you back.
Hey, Chris.
It's good to see you up and about.
You're looking spiffy.
I'm here to press charges.
This isn't about that incident at the casino a while back?
Yeah.
It is.
Because that matter's closed.
You're lucky you weren't brought in on charges.
I mean...
Did you even look into it?
They did an internal investigation.
That's good enough for me.
An internal investigation?
I know you're familiar with the term no-fly zone.
Because that's what the casino is.
Since the mill closed down... that casino is the main source of revenue in this town.
So case closed, basically.
We'll see you.
- I'm not going to let this stand.
- Excuse me?
- What did you say to me?
- I said I'm not going to let this stand.
You're lucky to be alive right now.
That's all you need to be concentrating on.
This is my town.
Okay?
I'm the sheriff here.
I'll tell you what will stand.
Not the other way around.
Now please get out of my building.
- Come in.
- Thanks.
This belongs to you.
I appreciate that.
I thought this was history.
- Could have left it in the trash, but I...
- Deni?
- Nice to see you, dear.
- Hi, Mrs. Vaughn.
Can I talk to you outside for a second?
Quick walk.
Mom, I'll be right back.
- How you been?
- Been better.
Talk to the sheriff yet?
I went down to the police station.
I talked to somebody with a badge.
He sure as hell didn't seem like much of a sheriff.
He's up for reelection, you know.
- Maybe you could take his job.
- Somebody ought to.
How about you?
Nothing but sunshine and pine trees.
Been reading these books.
Teach you how to cultivate your happiness.
Focus on the future.
- Go with the flow, that sort of thing.
- Is it working?
I have my moments.
So, the casino, huh?
Yeah.
Been there almost a year.
- Treating you good?
- A lot better than it treated you.
I like that.
Jay Hamilton's done well for himself, hasn't he?
He's a real go-getter, that one.
He must be.
I heard he got you.
That lasted about eight minutes.
It was a long time ago.
You still work for him, though.
Rent's got to be paid, Chris.
I suppose so.
- Hope to see you around.
- Do you?
Thanks for the jacket.
And where is he?
It's okay, Mom.
He's stabilized.
It was close.
Crystal meth.
I'm sorry.
I never did it before.
It's true.
We might've kind of pushed him into it.
- Where'd you get the drugs?
- I'm not really sure...
Stop.
Where?
From the security guys working at the casino.
Chris, wait.
Call the police.
No.
It won't do any good.
- Is Pete okay?
- He'll be fine.
What are you doing?
No, Chris.
Not like this.
Listen to me.
If you go out of here with that gun, they're going to nail...
I've been looking for you.
Guess that changes our relationship a bit, huh?
You should not have come looking for trouble.
Keep your hands up.
Get out of the vehicle now, Chris.
Now!
- Step back, please.
- Just move toward the front of the car.
Put your hands on the hood.
I advise you to give this offer more than a little serious thought.
If you go to trial, you stand to do 18 years.
Now, this is a sweetheart plea.
Normally they wouldn't even put it on the table... but your military record can't be ignored.
Three months home arrest, some community service...
- pretty generous offer, Chris.
- But I'd have to plead guilty.
Look at it from the other side.
There's over a dozen witnesses, none of whom will paint a flattering picture.
- He started busting up the machines.
- There was a gunshot.
- He just went crazy.
- A complete psychopath.
They're only offering me this deal just to keep me quiet.
I still say you should take it.
I wasn't wrong.
And I won't say I was.
Our job is to keep order.
There was no chance of that once he came in.
Me and my men, we were just trying to control him.
He's highly trained, violent.
A very dangerous person.
So violent, so dangerous, so highly trained... that he dispatched six of the casino security staff single-handedly.
Six men, single-handedly.
His weapon of choice, a simple piece of cedar... which, in his hands, became a devastating force with one aim:
To hurt people and destroy property.
He went directly for everything.
He just came in and took over the place.
- You said he broke your arm.
- Yeah, that's correct.
My right forearm.
Both bones with a single shot.
It was crazy.
Toss a couple of drunks now and then.
Guys try to grope the girls.
But nothing with this sort of violence.
Did he give you any kind of advance warning... a chance to defend yourself?
We tussled, but he's a big guy.
He was on a mission.
Besides, he seemed to be too busy enjoying himself from what I could see.
So from what you saw, he seemed to have some kind of purpose?
He had a point to prove.
I was emptying machines when he came in and started swinging.
- I was trying to get out of there.
- He was a menace.
- A very dangerous person.
- Military-trained.
He seemed like a complete psychopath.
- Nothing close to this.
- I didn't know what he'd do.
- I was frightened.
- He came for us.
- No doubt in your mind?
- No doubt.
I have no further questions.
Mr. Crowe, you may present your client's case.
You're fired.
Your Honor, I'd like to plead my own case.
Order!
If you choose to represent yourself, and not be represented by legal counsel... you realize that you can't then claim a mistrial on that basis?
- Yes, I do.
- Very well, Mr. Vaughn.
I don't deny anything that was said here today.
Does that mean you're changing your plea to guilty?
I'm not guilty of anything... except standing up for myself when the law wouldn't.
Objection.
He's trying to introduce prior events.
Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, stay on point.
I grew up in this town.
People used to walk tall in this town.
They wouldn't have traded the mill for a crooked casino.
We're not here to listen to civic speeches...
And they wouldn't have stood around while drugs were sold to kids.
- Objection!
- Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, you're close to being held in contempt.
I was justified in what I did.
And if you acquit me of these charges, then I'm gonna run for sheriff.
- Mr. Vaughn.
- And if elected, I'm gonna fix this town.
Order.
Please take your seat.
Mr. Vaughn, you are now charged with contempt.
And I will make sure that this...
- Objection.
- Sustained.
...never happens to anyone again without punishing those who did it.
I'm ordering the jury to ignore what they've just seen.
Mr. Vaughn, take your seat.
Order.
Or you're all charged with contempt!
Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
Defendant, please rise.
We find the defendant, Chris Vaughn, not guilty.
This is mine.
Sheriff Vaughn!
You won the election.
Congratulations.
But we do have a tradition of professional courtesy up here.
And I can personally vouch for each and every one of these men.
They're good deputies.
You're all fired.
- Hey, Chris.
- License and registration, please.
You're joking, right?
License and registration.
What's the problem, Sheriff?
You.
And the drugs you're peddling out of your casino.
The only thing that's going on in my casino is construction.
You took care of that.
That's right.
And I plan on taking care of everything else, too.
If you can, try to think this through:
A casino is a license to print money.
Why would I jeopardize that by selling drugs?
Because you owned the town, Jay.
That's changed now.
Really?
The only thing I think has changed around here... is that you get to wake up every morning and put on that nifty little badge.
But underneath it is the same guy who couldn't make it playing college football... and apparently couldn't make it in the Army... and not really ever gonna make it as a cop.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
And if you push too hard, you're going to be a man who never gets to see 40.
License, please.
Thanks, Sheriff.
Sir, get your taillights fixed.
It's your last warning.
What's wrong with my taillights?
They're broken.
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning, Deputy.
No.
Come on, man.
You know I hate cops.
You've been sheriff for about two minutes, and I'm already starting to hate you.
- I'm a convicted felon.
- I've got pull around here.
Now you're a crooked cop doing favors for friends.
That's how it starts.
Next thing you know you'll be taking bribes, setting up roadblocks...
- frisking dudes' crotches.
- Are you done?
- Ray, I need your help.
- Don't do that.
I need you to take me to drug school.
I get to wear a uniform?
The stuff in this town is five-star, factory pure.
- So let's go get the factory.
- Easier said than done.
We know Hamilton's boys are selling that shit down at the casino.
Yeah, but 99% of the time they're clean.
So we got to play follow-the-money, starting with the tweakers.
That'll give us the suppliers.
These guys are real edgy, so delicacy is the key.
Then we put the squeeze on them... till they spit out the location of the next buy.
- Where'd you learn that, Ray?
- Cops.
That's a good show.
Phase three:
We strike.
- I thought you said delicacy was the key.
- That's right.
Delicacy and precision.
- Hey, what's up?
- Get out of here.
- You're sure you're not carrying anything?
- I don't have shit.
- Officer.
- Yeah.
Search him.
This is going to be a switch.
Spread your legs.
Arms down.
You been working out?
Nothing there.
Somebody needs a bath.
Now you read me my rights, then you take me in... and I call my lawyer.
Okay.
But I have a hunch there may be something else in here.
Could be.
Go to it, Deputy.
Have a good time.
- He ain't talking.
- I know.
Handles pretty good.
He's clean.
Guess we got to go with Plan B.
Screw you both.
I do have a bit of information for you.
It's not just me, actually.
There's a whole lot of people in this one.
Spit it out.
You're gonna get hurt.
What an idiot.
Why does it always have to be your fight?
- You might need this.
- No.
- I put my guns down a long time ago.
- Come on.
You're just being stubborn.
You and me both, boy.
Chris, listen.
You be careful.
I will.
Please step away from the vehicle!
Mr. Booth, are you still upset over that body-cavity search?
I forgot, you got no vehicle.
Please disperse!
There is nothing to...
Can I talk to you?
- Sure.
- Over here?
I'm gonna stay here with him tonight.
I need you to look after my parents' place.
Think they're gonna take it that far?
- I'm with you, man.
I'll check in later.
- Okay.
A drive to right field.
It's dropping for a single.
You making house calls?
- Don't shoot.
- Hey.
How's the food around here?
Nice.
I brought you special treats:
Salad, fried chicken... potato salad.
- Do you have glasses?
- Yeah.
- Do you have to work tonight?
- I quit.
I figured you were making some changes around here...
I could make a few myself.
Salt and pepper?
- Who is that?
- Pete.
- Want something to eat?
- No.
I'm good, man.
I got to get a bigger bed.
No, you don't.
Do it.
I'm hungry.
We've got leftovers.
I want pancakes.
And eggs.
And bacon.
I told you, Vaughn.
Stay here.
Who needs to step away from the vehicle now, Vaughn?
Truck for a truck, baby!
That's right!
Truck for a truck!
Get down!
Tear it up, boys!
Pete, something's burning.
Take this.
Get in there.
Good morning, honey.
Get out of here.
Sheriff, are you home?
I told you someone was going to get hurt!
Come here.
When I say now, start shooting!
Over there!
Stay low.
Vaughn!
You got to get me out of here.
Move it.
Go!
Move it, old man.
- Where's Pete?
- I don't know.
Sit down.
- I know who you are.
- Oh, yeah?
- Burke?
- Son of a bitch.
Check it out.
Come on!
Get me out of here, man!
- What's it worth to you?
Where's the lab?
- Screw you!
Hamilton's operation is at the mill, okay?
Now get me out of here!
Drop it.
Stay down!
Stay down.
You okay?
Shit.
I thought I warned you, Chris.
I didn't want this to happen.
I'm going in!
Right there, punk!
Come on, Chris!
Come on!
Deni, now!
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Where is everybody?
- Pete ran outside.
You stabbed me with a potato peeler.
You gonna be okay?
Hey, Chris.
Get up, Jay.
Just a second.
Remember when we used to play hide-and-seek up here?
- That was my favorite sound.
- Get up!
Look, Chris...
You want to know what my new favorite sound's gonna be?
The sound of you screaming like a little bitch.
Bet you wish you took that job offer now?
But, no!
You had to be Mr. Hero Boy!
You forgot this:
This is my town!
Yes!
You're nothing.
You're right, Jay.
This does change our relationship.
This is my town.
You're under arrest.
That ought to do it.
What are you doing?
Getting some souvenirs.
I'm gonna miss the place.
That's how it starts.
Next you'll be accepting bribes and setting speed traps all over town.
Cutting up trucks.
You know how you are.
Not to mention the cavity searches.
You're gonna like that.
Speaking of which, do you think Jay's got a casino in the pen?
- Could be.
- Running the Shower Tower with the fellas?
He's probably blowing on somebody's dice right now.
That's lunch.
Let's go pick up my old man, grab something to eat.
I'm with you, buddy.
Subtitles By Rajanee
- Here you go.
- Thanks, man.
See you tomorrow.
How you doing?
Okay.
- When did the mill close?
- Three years ago this August.
If you're looking for work, you may want to try Aberdeen.
That's about the closest mill work you'll find.
- Too bad.
- It's just simple economics.
You know, we have a really nice casino, the Wild Cherry.
Want to make some money, maybe you ought to go on down... and try your luck at the blackjack tables.
No, I don't think so.
Thanks.
You're Chris Vaughn?
Well, hell.
I know all about you, Chris.
I know your folks.
I'm Sheriff Stan Watkins.
- How you doing?
- Ralston, get out of the car!
You're looking at a real soldier here.
Pay some respects.
- Welcome home, soldier.
- Thanks.
Well, hell, Chris.
- I'll give you a ride up to your folks'.
- No, I'm fine.
Thank you.
- I insist.
- I'll walk.
- It's my pleasure.
- It's okay.
I won't take no for an answer.
Get in the car.
- Did I scare you with that one?
- Little bit.
I scared him.
You were gone a while, huh?
Eight years.
Harstad was sheriff back then.
Aaron Harstad, yeah.
Sad story.
About five months back, he fell asleep at the wheel and hit a tree.
Car folded up like an accordion.
He was a good man.
A good man and a good sheriff.
All right.
- Thank you very much for the ride.
- Welcome home, Chris.
It's election month.
I'm your man.
Okay.
Say hey to your old man.
Let's go.
Can I help you?
Little brother.
You come over here and give me a hug.
- You look great.
- What is this?
I couldn't let you be the only one looking good in uniform.
Hey, Ma.
Chris is here.
- Whose tent?
- That's for Pete.
- Watch out, now.
- Chris.
- Look at you.
- Mom, how you doing?
How long's your leave?
How long do we have you?
For good.
I'm home.
- Really?
You're not kidding?
- No.
- Hey, Dad.
- Welcome back.
I wish you had told us exactly when you were coming.
I'd have cooked.
- This is fine, Mom.
- We love Chinese.
- No, this is great.
- So what are you going to do now?
I was planning to work at the mill, but you never mentioned it closed.
We didn't want to bother you when your father got laid off.
I got my business.
You saw the furniture outside.
And I substitute at the elementary school.
Michelle pitches in... we try to keep things simple.
Pete.
- This is your Uncle Chris.
- Hey, Pete.
Sit down.
Say hello.
Last time he saw you, you were barely walking.
- And now I'm camping.
- I said you could sleep on the couch.
It was Chris' room first.
Your tent's going to take on water.
I can show you how to rig it.
Doesn't look like it's going to rain to me, Colonel.
Sit down.
Eat something.
First of all, I was a sergeant.
I worked for a living.
A grunt.
- Did you ever smoke anybody?
- Pete!
Poppa's still got your gun locked up in the garage.
- Would you teach me how to shoot?
- I figured that'd be scrap metal by now.
No.
I'm still hoping you'll melt that thing down on your own.
- Sorry, Pete.
- Whatever.
- I'm out of here, Mom.
- Be back by 10:00.
- 10:30.
- 10:00.
Remind you of anyone?
Okay, it rained.
Happy?
No.
Why don't you crash on the floor?
Okay.
I'll crash on the floor.
You crash on the bed.
Keep you dry.
Did you really kill people?
- Ray-Ray.
- Hello, pudding.
- What's up, man?
- Good to see you, man.
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.
What is that?
- That's the Love Machine.
- Girls actually get in there?
- How you been?
- Good.
- Clean living?
- Please.
You want a beer?
No.
Believe it or not, I quit drinking.
I'd take a soda, though.
Okay.
Here.
Thanks, man.
Like that?
When you left town... it gave me the idea I should do something with my life, too.
So I went down to Seattle, got a guitar, and became all about music.
And then, pretty soon, I was about music and drugs... and pretty soon I was basically just about drugs... and ended up doing two years for B and E.
I'm sorry.
Look at me now, though, right?
I've been clean and sober 14 months.
Doing construction and renewing those supportive and healthy friendships... from my past.
Matter of fact, I talked to the bastards, told them you were back... and they asked me to politely remind you that it is Saturday.
- As in...
- As in, kick-off's in 20 minutes.
- Like old times.
- You guys still doing it.
We're still doing it.
- Playing ball?
- Absolutely.
Let's go, superstar!
- Just like the old days.
Go deep.
- Come on.
When did that happen?
Jay Hamilton Field.
His parents hadn't left him the mill for more than two minutes...
- before he shut it down.
- Why?
Heads up!
Because I opened my casino.
Still got a gun, huh, Jay?
Still got your reflexes.
What?
Did you get tired of being all that you could be?
- No.
I'm still all I can be.
- Really?
- I'll just have to see about that.
- Yeah.
- What brings you home?
- I just want to relax.
Catch my breath.
- You?
Relax?
- Yeah.
Not today.
I got it.
Let's go.
Come on!
Is that how it's going to be?
That's how it is.
- Full contact, huh?
- That's two-hand touch.
Too rough?
Sorry, ladies.
Pick up the outside!
- Fumble!
- Set!
How's that for touch?
- That was pretty, wasn't it?
- Want to go get your pads?
- That the best you got?
- What?
- Here, take a walk...
- And knock a long loose?
- Touchdown.
- First and your last.
- You want to go?
- Nobody's going.
We're not going to go.
You almost caught it.
- We stop them here, we win, right?
- Right, boys, last play.
- You know how I like winning.
- We need to put this to rest.
- I will take care of Ray.
- You two cross.
You stay in and block.
Booth?
Isolate on Vaughn.
- You two cross...
- Just give me the ball.
- Go low.
Left knee.
- All right, man.
You got it?
On the first hut.
Ready?
Break!
Be strong.
All right, Chris Vaughn.
Last chance.
- Black-nineteen!
Black!
- Watch the outside!
I'm open!
That's game.
Sorry about that.
Cool, man.
Nice game, ladies.
What the hell was that?
That was a great game, wasn't it?
Is that the bad one?
- Yeah, it was good.
- Hey, welcome home.
Good to be back.
See you around.
If you're not doing anything later on, want to come by the casino?
Introduce you to some nice girls.
Drinks are on me.
What do you say?
- See you tonight.
- Cool.
I'll see you later on.
Be good.
Hey, Sarge.
Good game.
Maybe next time.
Hold up.
Maybe next time I won't see you in the bleachers, smoking weed.
Welcome home, buddy.
I thought you had to be Native American to own a casino.
- Hamilton's one-sixteenth Blackfoot now.
- Put it on his application.
And what he slid under the table convinced the powers that be it was true.
- It's ours for the taking tonight.
- Let's pick some cherries, boys.
- Here we go.
- I'm feeling lucky.
Just so you guys know, I'm done after I triple my money.
That's what you said last time.
You wound up selling your body for bus fare.
He had to walk.
Nobody's going to have any problems finding this place.
It's the subtle attention to aesthetics that I find most impressive.
Blends in with the mountain so nicely.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
How you doing?
- See?
Not bad, huh?
- It's not bad.
A lot of pretty girls.
I'm getting chips.
Let's gamble.
We'll see you at the Shower Tower, okay?
Isn't it wonderful?
All your gambling needs under one great, big roof.
You got your ATM machines, tellers to cash your paycheck... and when you're here, you don't got to worry about things... like child support, rent, laws of mathematical probability.
Gentlemen, Mr. Hamilton would like to invite you to the VIP lounge.
- The dream team.
You all healed up?
- Nice place.
Welcome to my world.
Tonight all the drinks are on the house.
If you need a line of credit, say how much.
If you need a little female companionship, done.
All right?
- Get inside.
Have a good time.
- Where you going?
Don't you worry about me.
I got a few things to do.
Enjoy.
Just remember, nothing in here is free.
Ma'am.
- Cherry shot?
- Ray, be nice.
Come on, this place is nothing but fake boobs... and real assholes, if you ask me.
Just water for me.
Drink up.
We got money to win and girls just waiting.
- We are VIPs.
- Here's to you, Chris.
- Welcome home.
- Cheers.
Let's play, boys.
Go right ahead.
Already lost $1...
Good night.
Okay.
Don't say we never did nothing for you.
Don't worry, buddy, everybody's scared their first time.
- Come on.
- Get in there, Chris.
Okay, just sit back and enjoy it.
- This'll get you started.
- lf you're not back by morning... we'll send a search party.
- Have fun.
- Stop drinking.
You from here, or are you just visiting?
A little of both.
I grew up here.
So you're seeing all the old faces.
You could say that.
Your voice sounds very familiar.
Chris.
Deni.
- Look who's back.
- So, good surprise?
I told you it was better than gambling.
You met Candi?
- Hello.
- Hey, Candi.
Let's go.
Six, easy six.
Looking for a six to win.
We can do a six.
Can we do a six?
I think I can do a six, right?
We got liftoff!
Whack it, boys.
Whack it.
Blue or pink, what do you think?
Who's up for two out of three?
I'm getting killed.
Let me have a C-note to put $200 on a bet.
- No.
- Come on.
Hell, no.
Look at them.
He's hot.
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Give me a hard six.
- $5, hard six?
- Yes.
- I'm in.
- Hard six. $5 on hard six.
There's another $100.
Boom.
Give me some dice.
Looking for a six.
All right.
Oh, please.
Please.
Thank you.
And you.
- Jimmy, don't roll.
Give me the dice.
- No, I got it.
Hard six, six.
Looking for a six.
Seven out.
Line in, the dark side wins.
Last come'll get you some.
- You're good.
But I saw it.
- Saw what?
I saw the switch.
This is a clean game, asshole.
Let's see about that.
Bet you'll roll a seven.
It's not your roll, sir.
Sir, it's not your roll.
Will you call security?
Put your bets down on the passline.
- These dice are coming up seven.
- Why don't we just let it go?
No.
We're going to let it ride, Jimmy.
The dice are coming up seven.
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Come on, baby.
- What a surprise.
- No, folks.
No payouts.
- Wait a minute.
- Calm down.
Just take care of that bet, then we're even.
I would, but it wasn't a legitimate bet.
You're not the shooter.
- Security.
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Is there a problem?
- The problem is your dice are loaded.
Does your boss know about this?
Just give me my money.
Come on.
Let's go.
What now, bitch?
Come on!
Special Forces.
Wow.
I'll take that.
What are you doing?
Special Forces.
Special treatment.
This guy knows Hamilton.
You just hold him down.
Come on, Burke.
Folks.
He's pretty banged up, inside and out.
Whoever did this left him for dead.
A lesser man wouldn't have survived.
- I need a statement from him, Doctor.
- He's in no condition to give you one...
I'll also need a copy of your write-up, with toxicology...
- and blood-alcohol level.
- What are you talking about?
I'm just trying to get some facts.
You need to be arresting whoever tried to kill my brother, not testing his blood.
I'm just doing my job, Michelle.
Okay?
I understand how you feel.
But we still don't know who started all this.
- It wasn't Chris.
- Just find out who did this to him, Stan.
I'll do my best, Mr. Vaughn.
I really will.
In the meantime I have to file a full report.
Will you let me know when I can talk to him?
Thank you.
- He's going to be fine, Michelle.
- Thanks.
- Beautiful flowers.
- Thank you.
They're for my best friend.
Hey, Sarge.
So much for our VIP status.
Don't they teach you any basic fighting skills in the Army?
How did you do?
Not good.
But I tell you, that guy was feeling me this morning.
- You okay?
- That was a hell of a homecoming party.
Chris, I don't know if you noticed, but this ain't exactly home anymore.
Hang on.
Let me help you.
Come on.
I'm good, Mom.
I got it.
- Need some help?
- No.
I'm just milking it.
There's some old crutches in the garage.
- Thanks, Pete.
- Crutches.
That's nice.
Did you see the hole?
- Mind if I watch TV?
- No, that's cool.
- Somebody's feeling better.
- Little bit.
You make this?
Need anything?
- Something wrong?
- No, it's good, man.
It's good.
No, I'm good, Dad.
Thanks.
- Changed the plugs a while back.
- I appreciate that, Dad.
I might've had serious issues with your career choice... but it just didn't seem fair to take it out on an innocent truck.
Where you headed?
I was going into town to get supplies.
Want to come?
Let's go.
Your whole life, all you wanted to do was get out of here.
What made you come back now?
You're going to think I'm crazy.
I would think about the mill.
When I was a kid going to visit you at work, the smell of that fresh-cut cedar...
You remember that smell.
I remember a lot of nice things before the mill closed.
When did they go out of business?
Closed about six months ago.
There's a Home Depot about 15 minutes up the road.
And that?
Don't ask.
First of all, I just want to say thanks.
- For what?
- For making that stickman.
He's been fired and his gaming permit's been pulled.
I just have no idea why my security cameras didn't catch that.
They miss a lot in your place, don't they, Jay?
- Look, Chris, I hate seeing you like this.
- Your boys did it.
Wait a second.
So they got a little rough.
They're a bit edgy.
Understandably.
You don't know what kind of assholes they have to put up with on a daily basis.
Look, they've been reprimanded.
But they say you went nuts, man.
I'm sorry.
Insensitive.
I know the proper term that vets use is post-traumatic stress...
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Whatever.
You tore my place apart... and it wasn't easy to get my guys to agree not to press charges.
Chris, if you had a problem, shouldn't you have come to me?
I want to bring you inside.
I want to make you head of security.
- What do you say?
- No.
I guess you probably need time to think about it.
I figured as much.
This is for you.
It's a little something to help you get, you know...
Come on, man, don't be like that.
I came all the way out here to your house, just to see you get back on your feet.
I'm going to the sheriff.
I'm really sorry you feel that way.
I'll see you around, Chris.
I know, it was a good time, wasn't it?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I got to call you back.
Hey, Chris.
It's good to see you up and about.
You're looking spiffy.
I'm here to press charges.
This isn't about that incident at the casino a while back?
Yeah.
It is.
Because that matter's closed.
You're lucky you weren't brought in on charges.
I mean...
Did you even look into it?
They did an internal investigation.
That's good enough for me.
An internal investigation?
I know you're familiar with the term no-fly zone.
Because that's what the casino is.
Since the mill closed down... that casino is the main source of revenue in this town.
So case closed, basically.
We'll see you.
- I'm not going to let this stand.
- Excuse me?
- What did you say to me?
- I said I'm not going to let this stand.
You're lucky to be alive right now.
That's all you need to be concentrating on.
This is my town.
Okay?
I'm the sheriff here.
I'll tell you what will stand.
Not the other way around.
Now please get out of my building.
- Come in.
- Thanks.
This belongs to you.
I appreciate that.
I thought this was history.
- Could have left it in the trash, but I...
- Deni?
- Nice to see you, dear.
- Hi, Mrs. Vaughn.
Can I talk to you outside for a second?
Quick walk.
Mom, I'll be right back.
- How you been?
- Been better.
Talk to the sheriff yet?
I went down to the police station.
I talked to somebody with a badge.
He sure as hell didn't seem like much of a sheriff.
He's up for reelection, you know.
- Maybe you could take his job.
- Somebody ought to.
How about you?
Nothing but sunshine and pine trees.
Been reading these books.
Teach you how to cultivate your happiness.
Focus on the future.
- Go with the flow, that sort of thing.
- Is it working?
I have my moments.
So, the casino, huh?
Yeah.
Been there almost a year.
- Treating you good?
- A lot better than it treated you.
I like that.
Jay Hamilton's done well for himself, hasn't he?
He's a real go-getter, that one.
He must be.
I heard he got you.
That lasted about eight minutes.
It was a long time ago.
You still work for him, though.
Rent's got to be paid, Chris.
I suppose so.
- Hope to see you around.
- Do you?
Thanks for the jacket.
And where is he?
It's okay, Mom.
He's stabilized.
It was close.
Crystal meth.
I'm sorry.
I never did it before.
It's true.
We might've kind of pushed him into it.
- Where'd you get the drugs?
- I'm not really sure...
Stop.
Where?
From the security guys working at the casino.
Chris, wait.
Call the police.
No.
It won't do any good.
- Is Pete okay?
- He'll be fine.
What are you doing?
No, Chris.
Not like this.
Listen to me.
If you go out of here with that gun, they're going to nail...
I've been looking for you.
Guess that changes our relationship a bit, huh?
You should not have come looking for trouble.
Keep your hands up.
Get out of the vehicle now, Chris.
Now!
- Step back, please.
- Just move toward the front of the car.
Put your hands on the hood.
I advise you to give this offer more than a little serious thought.
If you go to trial, you stand to do 18 years.
Now, this is a sweetheart plea.
Normally they wouldn't even put it on the table... but your military record can't be ignored.
Three months home arrest, some community service...
- pretty generous offer, Chris.
- But I'd have to plead guilty.
Look at it from the other side.
There's over a dozen witnesses, none of whom will paint a flattering picture.
- He started busting up the machines.
- There was a gunshot.
- He just went crazy.
- A complete psychopath.
They're only offering me this deal just to keep me quiet.
I still say you should take it.
I wasn't wrong.
And I won't say I was.
Our job is to keep order.
There was no chance of that once he came in.
Me and my men, we were just trying to control him.
He's highly trained, violent.
A very dangerous person.
So violent, so dangerous, so highly trained... that he dispatched six of the casino security staff single-handedly.
Six men, single-handedly.
His weapon of choice, a simple piece of cedar... which, in his hands, became a devastating force with one aim:
To hurt people and destroy property.
He went directly for everything.
He just came in and took over the place.
- You said he broke your arm.
- Yeah, that's correct.
My right forearm.
Both bones with a single shot.
It was crazy.
Toss a couple of drunks now and then.
Guys try to grope the girls.
But nothing with this sort of violence.
Did he give you any kind of advance warning... a chance to defend yourself?
We tussled, but he's a big guy.
He was on a mission.
Besides, he seemed to be too busy enjoying himself from what I could see.
So from what you saw, he seemed to have some kind of purpose?
He had a point to prove.
I was emptying machines when he came in and started swinging.
- I was trying to get out of there.
- He was a menace.
- A very dangerous person.
- Military-trained.
He seemed like a complete psychopath.
- Nothing close to this.
- I didn't know what he'd do.
- I was frightened.
- He came for us.
- No doubt in your mind?
- No doubt.
I have no further questions.
Mr. Crowe, you may present your client's case.
You're fired.
Your Honor, I'd like to plead my own case.
Order!
If you choose to represent yourself, and not be represented by legal counsel... you realize that you can't then claim a mistrial on that basis?
- Yes, I do.
- Very well, Mr. Vaughn.
I don't deny anything that was said here today.
Does that mean you're changing your plea to guilty?
I'm not guilty of anything... except standing up for myself when the law wouldn't.
Objection.
He's trying to introduce prior events.
Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, stay on point.
I grew up in this town.
People used to walk tall in this town.
They wouldn't have traded the mill for a crooked casino.
We're not here to listen to civic speeches...
And they wouldn't have stood around while drugs were sold to kids.
- Objection!
- Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, you're close to being held in contempt.
I was justified in what I did.
And if you acquit me of these charges, then I'm gonna run for sheriff.
- Mr. Vaughn.
- And if elected, I'm gonna fix this town.
Order.
Please take your seat.
Mr. Vaughn, you are now charged with contempt.
And I will make sure that this...
- Objection.
- Sustained.
...never happens to anyone again without punishing those who did it.
I'm ordering the jury to ignore what they've just seen.
Mr. Vaughn, take your seat.
Order.
Or you're all charged with contempt!
Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
Defendant, please rise.
We find the defendant, Chris Vaughn, not guilty.
This is mine.
Sheriff Vaughn!
You won the election.
Congratulations.
But we do have a tradition of professional courtesy up here.
And I can personally vouch for each and every one of these men.
They're good deputies.
You're all fired.
- Hey, Chris.
- License and registration, please.
You're joking, right?
License and registration.
What's the problem, Sheriff?
You.
And the drugs you're peddling out of your casino.
The only thing that's going on in my casino is construction.
You took care of that.
That's right.
And I plan on taking care of everything else, too.
If you can, try to think this through:
A casino is a license to print money.
Why would I jeopardize that by selling drugs?
Because you owned the town, Jay.
That's changed now.
Really?
The only thing I think has changed around here... is that you get to wake up every morning and put on that nifty little badge.
But underneath it is the same guy who couldn't make it playing college football... and apparently couldn't make it in the Army... and not really ever gonna make it as a cop.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
And if you push too hard, you're going to be a man who never gets to see 40.
License, please.
Thanks, Sheriff.
Sir, get your taillights fixed.
It's your last warning.
What's wrong with my taillights?
They're broken.
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning, Deputy.
No.
Come on, man.
You know I hate cops.
You've been sheriff for about two minutes, and I'm already starting to hate you.
- I'm a convicted felon.
- I've got pull around here.
Now you're a crooked cop doing favors for friends.
That's how it starts.
Next thing you know you'll be taking bribes, setting up roadblocks...
- frisking dudes' crotches.
- Are you done?
- Ray, I need your help.
- Don't do that.
I need you to take me to drug school.
I get to wear a uniform?
The stuff in this town is five-star, factory pure.
- So let's go get the factory.
- Easier said than done.
We know Hamilton's boys are selling that shit down at the casino.
Yeah, but 99% of the time they're clean.
So we got to play follow-the-money, starting with the tweakers.
That'll give us the suppliers.
These guys are real edgy, so delicacy is the key.
Then we put the squeeze on them... till they spit out the location of the next buy.
- Where'd you learn that, Ray?
- Cops.
That's a good show.
Phase three: we strike.
- I thought you said delicacy was the key.
- That's right.
Delicacy and precision.
- Hey, what's up?
- Get out of here.
- You're sure you're not carrying anything?
- I don't have shit.
- Officer.
- Yeah.
Search him.
This is going to be a switch.
Spread your legs.
Arms down.
You been working out?
Nothing there.
Somebody needs a bath.
Now you read me my rights, then you take me in... and I call my lawyer.
Okay.
But I have a hunch there may be something else in here.
Could be.
Go to it, Deputy.
Have a good time.
- He ain't talking.
- I know.
Handles pretty good.
He's clean.
Guess we got to go with Plan B.
Screw you both.
I do have a bit of information for you.
It's not just me, actually.
There's a whole lot of people in this one.
Spit it out.
You're gonna get hurt.
What an idiot.
Why does it always have to be your fight?
- You might need this.
- No.
- I put my guns down a long time ago.
- Come on.
You're just being stubborn.
You and me both, boy.
Chris, listen.
You be careful.
I will.
Please step away from the vehicle!
Mr. Booth, are you still upset over that body-cavity search?
I forgot, you got no vehicle.
Please disperse!
There is nothing to...
Can I talk to you?
- Sure.
- Over here?
I'm gonna stay here with him tonight.
I need you to look after my parents' place.
Think they're gonna take it that far?
- I'm with you, man.
I'll check in later.
- Okay.
A drive to right field.
It's dropping for a single.
You making house calls?
- Don't shoot.
- Hey.
How's the food around here?
Nice.
I brought you special treats:
Salad, fried chicken... potato salad.
- Do you have glasses?
- Yeah.
- Do you have to work tonight?
- I quit.
I figured you were making some changes around here...
I could make a few myself.
Salt and pepper?
- Who is that?
- Pete.
- Want something to eat?
- No.
I'm good, man.
I got to get a bigger bed.
No, you don't.
Do it.
I'm hungry.
We've got leftovers.
I want pancakes.
And eggs.
And bacon.
I told you, Vaughn.
Stay here.
Who needs to step away from the vehicle now, Vaughn?
Truck for a truck, baby!
That's right!
Truck for a truck!
Get down!
Tear it up, boys!
Pete, something's burning.
Take this.
Get in there.
Good morning, honey.
Get out of here.
Sheriff, are you home?
I told you someone was going to get hurt!
Come here.
When I say now, start shooting!
Over there!
Stay low.
Vaughn!
You got to get me out of here.
Move it.
Go!
Move it, old man.
- Where's Pete?
- I don't know.
Sit down.
- I know who you are.
- Oh, yeah?
- Burke?
- Son of a bitch.
Check it out.
Come on!
Get me out of here, man!
- What's it worth to you?
Where's the lab?
- Screw you!
Hamilton's operation is at the mill, okay?
Now get me out of here!
Drop it.
Stay down!
Stay down.
You okay?
Shit.
I thought I warned you, Chris.
I didn't want this to happen.
I'm going in!
Right there, punk!
Come on, Chris!
Come on!
Deni, now!
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Where is everybody?
- Pete ran outside.
You stabbed me with a potato peeler.
You gonna be okay?
Hey, Chris.
Get up, Jay.
Just a second.
Remember when we used to play hide-and-seek up here?
- That was my favorite sound.
- Get up!
Look, Chris...
You want to know what my new favorite sound's gonna be?
The sound of you screaming like a little bitch.
Bet you wish you took that job offer now?
But, no!
You had to be Mr. Hero Boy!
You forgot this: this is my town!
Yes!
You're nothing.
You're right, Jay.
This does change our relationship.
This is my town.
You're under arrest.
That ought to do it.
What are you doing?
Getting some souvenirs.
I'm gonna miss the place.
That's how it starts.
Next you'll be accepting bribes and setting speed traps all over town.
Cutting up trucks.
You know how you are.
Not to mention the cavity searches.
You're gonna like that.
Speaking of which, do you think Jay's got a casino in the pen?
- Could be.
- Running the Shower Tower with the fellas?
He's probably blowing on somebody's dice right now.
That's lunch.
Let's go pick up my old man, grab something to eat.
I'm with you, buddy.
Subtitles By Rajanee
- Here you go.
- Thanks, man.
See you tomorrow.
How you doing?
Okay.
- When did the mill close?
- Three years ago this August.
If you're looking for work, you may want to try Aberdeen.
That's about the closest mill work you'll find.
- Too bad.
- It's just simple economics.
You know, we have a really nice casino, the Wild Cherry.
Want to make some money, maybe you ought to go on down... and try your luck at the blackjack tables.
No, I don't think so.
Thanks.
You're Chris Vaughn?
Well, hell.
I know all about you, Chris.
I know your folks.
I'm Sheriff Stan Watkins.
- How you doing?
- Ralston, get out of the car!
You're looking at a real soldier here.
Pay some respects.
- Welcome home, soldier.
- Thanks.
Well, hell, Chris.
- I'll give you a ride up to your folks'.
- No, I'm fine.
Thank you.
- I insist.
- I'll walk.
- It's my pleasure.
- It's okay.
I won't take no for an answer.
Get in the car.
- Did I scare you with that one?
- Little bit.
I scared him.
You were gone a while, huh?
Eight years.
Harstad was sheriff back then.
Aaron Harstad, yeah.
Sad story.
About five months back, he fell asleep at the wheel and hit a tree.
Car folded up like an accordion.
He was a good man.
A good man and a good sheriff.
All right.
- Thank you very much for the ride.
- Welcome home, Chris.
It's election month.
I'm your man.
Okay.
Say hey to your old man.
Let's go.
Can I help you?
Little brother.
You come over here and give me a hug.
- You look great.
- What is this?
I couldn't let you be the only one looking good in uniform.
Hey, Ma.
Chris is here.
- Whose tent?
- That's for Pete.
- Watch out, now.
- Chris.
- Look at you.
- Mom, how you doing?
How long's your leave?
How long do we have you?
For good.
I'm home.
- Really?
You're not kidding?
- No.
- Hey, Dad.
- Welcome back.
I wish you had told us exactly when you were coming.
I'd have cooked.
- This is fine, Mom.
- We love Chinese.
- No, this is great.
- So what are you going to do now?
I was planning to work at the mill, but you never mentioned it closed.
We didn't want to bother you when your father got laid off.
I got my business.
You saw the furniture outside.
And I substitute at the elementary school.
Michelle pitches in... we try to keep things simple.
Pete.
- This is your Uncle Chris.
- Hey, Pete.
Sit down.
Say hello.
Last time he saw you, you were barely walking.
- And now I'm camping.
- I said you could sleep on the couch.
It was Chris' room first.
Your tent's going to take on water.
I can show you how to rig it.
Doesn't look like it's going to rain to me, Colonel.
Sit down.
Eat something.
First of all, I was a sergeant.
I worked for a living.
A grunt.
- Did you ever smoke anybody?
- Pete!
Poppa's still got your gun locked up in the garage.
- Would you teach me how to shoot?
- I figured that'd be scrap metal by now.
No.
I'm still hoping you'll melt that thing down on your own.
- Sorry, Pete.
- Whatever.
- I'm out of here, Mom.
- Be back by 10:00.
- 10:30.
- 10:00.
Remind you of anyone?
Okay, it rained.
Happy?
No.
Why don't you crash on the floor?
Okay.
I'll crash on the floor.
You crash on the bed.
Keep you dry.
Did you really kill people?
- Ray-Ray.
- Hello, pudding.
- What's up, man?
- Good to see you, man.
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.
What is that?
- That's the Love Machine.
- Girls actually get in there?
- How you been?
- Good.
- Clean living?
- Please.
You want a beer?
No.
Believe it or not, I quit drinking.
I'd take a soda, though.
Okay.
Here.
Thanks, man.
Like that?
When you left town... it gave me the idea I should do something with my life, too.
So I went down to Seattle, got a guitar, and became all about music.
And then, pretty soon, I was about music and drugs... and pretty soon I was basically just about drugs... and ended up doing two years for B and E.
I'm sorry.
Look at me now, though, right?
I've been clean and sober 14 months.
Doing construction and renewing those supportive and healthy friendships... from my past.
Matter of fact, I talked to the bastards, told them you were back... and they asked me to politely remind you that it is Saturday.
- As in...
- As in, kick-off's in 20 minutes.
- Like old times.
- You guys still doing it.
We're still doing it.
- Playing ball?
- Absolutely.
Let's go, superstar!
- Just like the old days.
Go deep.
- Come on.
When did that happen?
Jay Hamilton Field.
His parents hadn't left him the mill for more than two minutes...
- before he shut it down.
- Why?
Heads up!
Because I opened my casino.
Still got a gun, huh, Jay?
Still got your reflexes.
What?
Did you get tired of being all that you could be?
- No.
I'm still all I can be.
- Really?
- I'll just have to see about that.
- Yeah.
- What brings you home?
- I just want to relax.
Catch my breath.
- You?
Relax?
- Yeah.
Not today.
I got it.
Let's go.
Come on!
Is that how it's going to be?
That's how it is.
- Full contact, huh?
- That's two-hand touch.
Too rough?
Sorry, ladies.
Pick up the outside!
- Fumble!
- Set!
How's that for touch?
- That was pretty, wasn't it?
- Want to go get your pads?
- That the best you got?
- What?
- Here, take a walk...
- And knock a long loose?
- Touchdown.
- First and your last.
- You want to go?
- Nobody's going.
We're not going to go.
You almost caught it.
- We stop them here, we win, right?
- Right, boys, last play.
- You know how I like winning.
- We need to put this to rest.
- I will take care of Ray.
- You two cross.
You stay in and block.
Booth?
Isolate on Vaughn.
- You two cross...
- Just give me the ball.
- Go low.
Left knee.
- All right, man.
You got it?
On the first hut.
Ready?
Break!
Be strong.
All right, Chris Vaughn.
Last chance.
- Black-nineteen!
Black!
- Watch the outside!
I'm open!
That's game.
Sorry about that.
Cool, man.
Nice game, ladies.
What the hell was that?
That was a great game, wasn't it?
Is that the bad one?
- Yeah, it was good.
- Hey, welcome home.
Good to be back.
See you around.
If you're not doing anything later on, want to come by the casino?
Introduce you to some nice girls.
Drinks are on me.
What do you say?
- See you tonight.
- Cool.
I'll see you later on.
Be good.
Hey, Sarge.
Good game.
Maybe next time.
Hold up.
Maybe next time I won't see you in the bleachers, smoking weed.
Welcome home, buddy.
I thought you had to be Native American to own a casino.
- Hamilton's one-sixteenth Blackfoot now.
- Put it on his application.
And what he slid under the table convinced the powers that be it was true.
- It's ours for the taking tonight.
- Let's pick some cherries, boys.
- Here we go.
- I'm feeling lucky.
Just so you guys know, I'm done after I triple my money.
That's what you said last time.
You wound up selling your body for bus fare.
He had to walk.
Nobody's going to have any problems finding this place.
It's the subtle attention to aesthetics that I find most impressive.
Blends in with the mountain so nicely.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
How you doing?
- See?
Not bad, huh?
- It's not bad.
A lot of pretty girls.
I'm getting chips.
Let's gamble.
We'll see you at the Shower Tower, okay?
Isn't it wonderful?
All your gambling needs under one great, big roof.
You got your ATM machines, tellers to cash your paycheck... and when you're here, you don't got to worry about things... like child support, rent, laws of mathematical probability.
Gentlemen, Mr. Hamilton would like to invite you to the VIP lounge.
- The dream team.
You all healed up?
- Nice place.
Welcome to my world.
Tonight all the drinks are on the house.
If you need a line of credit, say how much.
If you need a little female companionship, done.
All right?
- Get inside.
Have a good time.
- Where you going?
Don't you worry about me.
I got a few things to do.
Enjoy.
Just remember, nothing in here is free.
Ma'am.
- Cherry shot?
- Ray, be nice.
Come on, this place is nothing but fake boobs... and real assholes, if you ask me.
Just water for me.
Drink up.
We got money to win and girls just waiting.
- We are VIPs.
- Here's to you, Chris.
- Welcome home.
- Cheers.
Let's play, boys.
Go right ahead.
Already lost $1...
Good night.
Okay.
Don't say we never did nothing for you.
Don't worry, buddy, everybody's scared their first time.
- Come on.
- Get in there, Chris.
Okay, just sit back and enjoy it.
- This'll get you started.
- lf you're not back by morning... we'll send a search party.
- Have fun.
- Stop drinking.
You from here, or are you just visiting?
A little of both.
I grew up here.
So you're seeing all the old faces.
You could say that.
Your voice sounds very familiar.
Chris.
Deni.
- Look who's back.
- So, good surprise?
I told you it was better than gambling.
You met Candi?
- Hello.
- Hey, Candi.
Let's go.
Six, easy six.
Looking for a six to win.
We can do a six.
Can we do a six?
I think I can do a six, right?
We got liftoff!
Whack it, boys.
Whack it.
Blue or pink, what do you think?
Who's up for two out of three?
I'm getting killed.
Let me have a C-note to put $200 on a bet.
- No.
- Come on.
Hell, no.
Look at them.
He's hot.
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Give me a hard six.
- $5, hard six?
- Yes.
- I'm in.
- Hard six. $5 on hard six.
There's another $100.
Boom.
Give me some dice.
Looking for a six.
All right.
Oh, please.
Please.
Thank you.
And you.
- Jimmy, don't roll.
Give me the dice.
- No, I got it.
Hard six, six.
Looking for a six.
Seven out.
Line in, the dark side wins.
Last come'll get you some.
- You're good.
But I saw it.
- Saw what?
I saw the switch.
This is a clean game, asshole.
Let's see about that.
Bet you'll roll a seven.
It's not your roll, sir.
Sir, it's not your roll.
Will you call security?
Put your bets down on the passline.
- These dice are coming up seven.
- Why don't we just let it go?
No.
We're going to let it ride, Jimmy.
The dice are coming up seven.
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Come on, baby.
- What a surprise.
- No, folks.
No payouts.
- Wait a minute.
- Calm down.
Just take care of that bet, then we're even.
I would, but it wasn't a legitimate bet.
You're not the shooter.
- Security.
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Is there a problem?
- The problem is your dice are loaded.
Does your boss know about this?
Just give me my money.
Come on.
Let's go.
What now, bitch?
Come on!
Special Forces.
Wow.
I'll take that.
What are you doing?
Special Forces.
Special treatment.
This guy knows Hamilton.
You just hold him down.
Come on, Burke.
Folks.
He's pretty banged up, inside and out.
Whoever did this left him for dead.
A lesser man wouldn't have survived.
- I need a statement from him, Doctor.
- He's in no condition to give you one...
I'll also need a copy of your write-up, with toxicology...
- and blood-alcohol level.
- What are you talking about?
I'm just trying to get some facts.
You need to be arresting whoever tried to kill my brother, not testing his blood.
I'm just doing my job, Michelle.
Okay?
I understand how you feel.
But we still don't know who started all this.
- It wasn't Chris.
- Just find out who did this to him, Stan.
I'll do my best, Mr. Vaughn.
I really will.
In the meantime I have to file a full report.
Will you let me know when I can talk to him?
Thank you.
- He's going to be fine, Michelle.
- Thanks.
- Beautiful flowers.
- Thank you.
They're for my best friend.
Hey, Sarge.
So much for our VIP status.
Don't they teach you any basic fighting skills in the Army?
How did you do?
Not good.
But I tell you, that guy was feeling me this morning.
- You okay?
- That was a hell of a homecoming party.
Chris, I don't know if you noticed, but this ain't exactly home anymore.
Hang on.
Let me help you.
Come on.
I'm good, Mom.
I got it.
- Need some help?
- No.
I'm just milking it.
There's some old crutches in the garage.
- Thanks, Pete.
- Crutches.
That's nice.
Did you see the hole?
- Mind if I watch TV?
- No, that's cool.
- Somebody's feeling better.
- Little bit.
You make this?
Need anything?
- Something wrong?
- No, it's good, man.
It's good.
No, I'm good, Dad.
Thanks.
- Changed the plugs a while back.
- I appreciate that, Dad.
I might've had serious issues with your career choice... but it just didn't seem fair to take it out on an innocent truck.
Where you headed?
I was going into town to get supplies.
Want to come?
Let's go.
Your whole life, all you wanted to do was get out of here.
What made you come back now?
You're going to think I'm crazy.
I would think about the mill.
When I was a kid going to visit you at work, the smell of that fresh-cut cedar...
You remember that smell.
I remember a lot of nice things before the mill closed.
When did they go out of business?
Closed about six months ago.
There's a Home Depot about 15 minutes up the road.
And that?
Don't ask.
First of all, I just want to say thanks.
- For what?
- For making that stickman.
He's been fired and his gaming permit's been pulled.
I just have no idea why my security cameras didn't catch that.
They miss a lot in your place, don't they, Jay?
- Look, Chris, I hate seeing you like this.
- Your boys did it.
Wait a second.
So they got a little rough.
They're a bit edgy.
Understandably.
You don't know what kind of assholes they have to put up with on a daily basis.
Look, they've been reprimanded.
But they say you went nuts, man.
I'm sorry.
Insensitive.
I know the proper term that vets use is post-traumatic stress...
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Whatever.
You tore my place apart... and it wasn't easy to get my guys to agree not to press charges.
Chris, if you had a problem, shouldn't you have come to me?
I want to bring you inside.
I want to make you head of security.
- What do you say?
- No.
I guess you probably need time to think about it.
I figured as much.
This is for you.
It's a little something to help you get, you know...
Come on, man, don't be like that.
I came all the way out here to your house, just to see you get back on your feet.
I'm going to the sheriff.
I'm really sorry you feel that way.
I'll see you around, Chris.
I know, it was a good time, wasn't it?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I got to call you back.
Hey, Chris.
It's good to see you up and about.
You're looking spiffy.
I'm here to press charges.
This isn't about that incident at the casino a while back?
Yeah.
It is.
Because that matter's closed.
You're lucky you weren't brought in on charges.
I mean...
Did you even look into it?
They did an internal investigation.
That's good enough for me.
An internal investigation?
I know you're familiar with the term no-fly zone.
Because that's what the casino is.
Since the mill closed down... that casino is the main source of revenue in this town.
So case closed, basically.
We'll see you.
- I'm not going to let this stand.
- Excuse me?
- What did you say to me?
- I said I'm not going to let this stand.
You're lucky to be alive right now.
That's all you need to be concentrating on.
This is my town.
Okay?
I'm the sheriff here.
I'll tell you what will stand.
Not the other way around.
Now please get out of my building.
- Come in.
- Thanks.
This belongs to you.
I appreciate that.
I thought this was history.
- Could have left it in the trash, but I...
- Deni?
- Nice to see you, dear.
- Hi, Mrs. Vaughn.
Can I talk to you outside for a second?
Quick walk.
Mom, I'll be right back.
- How you been?
- Been better.
Talk to the sheriff yet?
I went down to the police station.
I talked to somebody with a badge.
He sure as hell didn't seem like much of a sheriff.
He's up for reelection, you know.
- Maybe you could take his job.
- Somebody ought to.
How about you?
Nothing but sunshine and pine trees.
Been reading these books.
Teach you how to cultivate your happiness.
Focus on the future.
- Go with the flow, that sort of thing.
- Is it working?
I have my moments.
So, the casino, huh?
Yeah.
Been there almost a year.
- Treating you good?
- A lot better than it treated you.
I like that.
Jay Hamilton's done well for himself, hasn't he?
He's a real go-getter, that one.
He must be.
I heard he got you.
That lasted about eight minutes.
It was a long time ago.
You still work for him, though.
Rent's got to be paid, Chris.
I suppose so.
- Hope to see you around.
- Do you?
Thanks for the jacket.
And where is he?
It's okay, Mom.
He's stabilized.
It was close.
Crystal meth.
I'm sorry.
I never did it before.
It's true.
We might've kind of pushed him into it.
- Where'd you get the drugs?
- I'm not really sure...
Stop.
Where?
From the security guys working at the casino.
Chris, wait.
Call the police.
No.
It won't do any good.
- Is Pete okay?
- He'll be fine.
What are you doing?
No, Chris.
Not like this.
Listen to me.
If you go out of here with that gun, they're going to nail...
I've been looking for you.
Guess that changes our relationship a bit, huh?
You should not have come looking for trouble.
Keep your hands up.
Get out of the vehicle now, Chris.
Now!
- Step back, please.
- Just move toward the front of the car.
Put your hands on the hood.
I advise you to give this offer more than a little serious thought.
If you go to trial, you stand to do 18 years.
Now, this is a sweetheart plea.
Normally they wouldn't even put it on the table... but your military record can't be ignored.
Three months home arrest, some community service...
- pretty generous offer, Chris.
- But I'd have to plead guilty.
Look at it from the other side.
There's over a dozen witnesses, none of whom will paint a flattering picture.
- He started busting up the machines.
- There was a gunshot.
- He just went crazy.
- A complete psychopath.
They're only offering me this deal just to keep me quiet.
I still say you should take it.
I wasn't wrong.
And I won't say I was.
Our job is to keep order.
There was no chance of that once he came in.
Me and my men, we were just trying to control him.
He's highly trained, violent.
A very dangerous person.
So violent, so dangerous, so highly trained... that he dispatched six of the casino security staff single-handedly.
Six men, single-handedly.
His weapon of choice, a simple piece of cedar... which, in his hands, became a devastating force with one aim:
To hurt people and destroy property.
He went directly for everything.
He just came in and took over the place.
- You said he broke your arm.
- Yeah, that's correct.
My right forearm.
Both bones with a single shot.
It was crazy.
Toss a couple of drunks now and then.
Guys try to grope the girls.
But nothing with this sort of violence.
Did he give you any kind of advance warning... a chance to defend yourself?
We tussled, but he's a big guy.
He was on a mission.
Besides, he seemed to be too busy enjoying himself from what I could see.
So from what you saw, he seemed to have some kind of purpose?
He had a point to prove.
I was emptying machines when he came in and started swinging.
- I was trying to get out of there.
- He was a menace.
- A very dangerous person.
- Military-trained.
He seemed like a complete psychopath.
- Nothing close to this.
- I didn't know what he'd do.
- I was frightened.
- He came for us.
- No doubt in your mind?
- No doubt.
I have no further questions.
Mr. Crowe, you may present your client's case.
You're fired.
Your Honor, I'd like to plead my own case.
Order!
If you choose to represent yourself, and not be represented by legal counsel... you realize that you can't then claim a mistrial on that basis?
- Yes, I do.
- Very well, Mr. Vaughn.
I don't deny anything that was said here today.
Does that mean you're changing your plea to guilty?
I'm not guilty of anything... except standing up for myself when the law wouldn't.
Objection.
He's trying to introduce prior events.
Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, stay on point.
I grew up in this town.
People used to walk tall in this town.
They wouldn't have traded the mill for a crooked casino.
We're not here to listen to civic speeches...
And they wouldn't have stood around while drugs were sold to kids.
- Objection!
- Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, you're close to being held in contempt.
I was justified in what I did.
And if you acquit me of these charges, then I'm gonna run for sheriff.
- Mr. Vaughn.
- And if elected, I'm gonna fix this town.
Order.
Please take your seat.
Mr. Vaughn, you are now charged with contempt.
And I will make sure that this...
- Objection.
- Sustained.
...never happens to anyone again without punishing those who did it.
I'm ordering the jury to ignore what they've just seen.
Mr. Vaughn, take your seat.
Order.
Or you're all charged with contempt!
Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
Defendant, please rise.
We find the defendant, Chris Vaughn, not guilty.
This is mine.
Sheriff Vaughn!
You won the election.
Congratulations.
But we do have a tradition of professional courtesy up here.
And I can personally vouch for each and every one of these men.
They're good deputies.
You're all fired.
- Hey, Chris.
- License and registration, please.
You're joking, right?
License and registration.
What's the problem, Sheriff?
You.
And the drugs you're peddling out of your casino.
The only thing that's going on in my casino is construction.
You took care of that.
That's right.
And I plan on taking care of everything else, too.
If you can, try to think this through:
A casino is a license to print money.
Why would I jeopardize that by selling drugs?
Because you owned the town, Jay.
That's changed now.
Really?
The only thing I think has changed around here... is that you get to wake up every morning and put on that nifty little badge.
But underneath it is the same guy who couldn't make it playing college football... and apparently couldn't make it in the Army... and not really ever gonna make it as a cop.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
And if you push too hard, you're going to be a man who never gets to see 40.
License, please.
Thanks, Sheriff.
Sir, get your taillights fixed.
It's your last warning.
What's wrong with my taillights?
They're broken.
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning, Deputy.
No.
Come on, man.
You know I hate cops.
You've been sheriff for about two minutes, and I'm already starting to hate you.
- I'm a convicted felon.
- I've got pull around here.
Now you're a crooked cop doing favors for friends.
That's how it starts.
Next thing you know you'll be taking bribes, setting up roadblocks...
- frisking dudes' crotches.
- Are you done?
- Ray, I need your help.
- Don't do that.
I need you to take me to drug school.
I get to wear a uniform?
The stuff in this town is five-star, factory pure.
- So let's go get the factory.
- Easier said than done.
We know Hamilton's boys are selling that shit down at the casino.
Yeah, but 99% of the time they're clean.
So we got to play follow-the-money, starting with the tweakers.
That'll give us the suppliers.
These guys are real edgy, so delicacy is the key.
Then we put the squeeze on them... till they spit out the location of the next buy.
- Where'd you learn that, Ray?
- Cops.
That's a good show.
Phase three: we strike.
- I thought you said delicacy was the key.
- That's right.
Delicacy and precision.
- Hey, what's up?
- Get out of here.
- You're sure you're not carrying anything?
- I don't have shit.
- Officer.
- Yeah.
Search him.
This is going to be a switch.
Spread your legs.
Arms down.
You been working out?
Nothing there.
Somebody needs a bath.
Now you read me my rights, then you take me in... and I call my lawyer.
Okay.
But I have a hunch there may be something else in here.
Could be.
Go to it, Deputy.
Have a good time.
- He ain't talking.
- I know.
Handles pretty good.
He's clean.
Guess we got to go with Plan B.
Screw you both.
I do have a bit of information for you.
It's not just me, actually.
There's a whole lot of people in this one.
Spit it out.
You're gonna get hurt.
What an idiot.
Why does it always have to be your fight?
- You might need this.
- No.
- I put my guns down a long time ago.
- Come on.
You're just being stubborn.
You and me both, boy.
Chris, listen.
You be careful.
I will.
Please step away from the vehicle!
Mr. Booth, are you still upset over that body-cavity search?
I forgot, you got no vehicle.
Please disperse!
There is nothing to...
Can I talk to you?
- Sure.
- Over here?
I'm gonna stay here with him tonight.
I need you to look after my parents' place.
Think they're gonna take it that far?
- I'm with you, man.
I'll check in later.
- Okay.
A drive to right field.
It's dropping for a single.
You making house calls?
- Don't shoot.
- Hey.
How's the food around here?
Nice.
I brought you special treats:
Salad, fried chicken... potato salad.
- Do you have glasses?
- Yeah.
- Do you have to work tonight?
- I quit.
I figured you were making some changes around here...
I could make a few myself.
Salt and pepper?
- Who is that?
- Pete.
- Want something to eat?
- No.
I'm good, man.
I got to get a bigger bed.
No, you don't.
Do it.
I'm hungry.
We've got leftovers.
I want pancakes.
And eggs.
And bacon.
I told you, Vaughn.
Stay here.
Who needs to step away from the vehicle now, Vaughn?
Truck for a truck, baby!
That's right!
Truck for a truck!
Get down!
Tear it up, boys!
Pete, something's burning.
Take this.
Get in there.
Good morning, honey.
Get out of here.
Sheriff, are you home?
I told you someone was going to get hurt!
Come here.
When I say now, start shooting!
Over there!
Stay low.
Vaughn!
You got to get me out of here.
Move it.
Go!
Move it, old man.
- Where's Pete?
- I don't know.
Sit down.
- I know who you are.
- Oh, yeah?
- Burke?
- Son of a bitch.
Check it out.
Come on!
Get me out of here, man!
- What's it worth to you?
Where's the lab?
- Screw you!
Hamilton's operation is at the mill, okay?
Now get me out of here!
Drop it.
Stay down!
Stay down.
You okay?
Shit.
I thought I warned you, Chris.
I didn't want this to happen.
I'm going in!
Right there, punk!
Come on, Chris!
Come on!
Deni, now!
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Where is everybody?
- Pete ran outside.
You stabbed me with a potato peeler.
You gonna be okay?
Hey, Chris.
Get up, Jay.
Just a second.
Remember when we used to play hide-and-seek up here?
- That was my favorite sound.
- Get up!
Look, Chris...
You want to know what my new favorite sound's gonna be?
The sound of you screaming like a little bitch.
Bet you wish you took that job offer now?
But, no!
You had to be Mr. Hero Boy!
You forgot this: this is my town!
Yes!
You're nothing.
You're right, Jay.
This does change our relationship.
This is my town.
You're under arrest.
That ought to do it.
What are you doing?
Getting some souvenirs.
I'm gonna miss the place.
That's how it starts.
Next you'll be accepting bribes and setting speed traps all over town.
Cutting up trucks.
You know how you are.
Not to mention the cavity searches.
You're gonna like that.
Speaking of which, do you think Jay's got a casino in the pen?
- Could be.
- Running the Shower Tower with the fellas?
He's probably blowing on somebody's dice right now.
That's lunch.
Let's go pick up my old man, grab something to eat.
I'm with you, buddy.
Subtitles By Rajanee
- Here you go.
- Thanks, man.
See you tomorrow.
How you doing?
Okay.
- When did the mill close?
- Three years ago this August.
If you're looking for work, you may want to try Aberdeen.
That's about the closest mill work you'll find.
- Too bad.
- It's just simple economics.
You know, we have a really nice casino, the Wild Cherry.
Want to make some money, maybe you ought to go on down... and try your luck at the blackjack tables.
No, I don't think so.
Thanks.
You're Chris Vaughn?
Well, hell.
I know all about you, Chris.
I know your folks.
I'm Sheriff Stan Watkins.
- How you doing?
- Ralston, get out of the car!
You're looking at a real soldier here.
Pay some respects.
- Welcome home, soldier.
- Thanks.
Well, hell, Chris.
- I'll give you a ride up to your folks'.
- No, I'm fine.
Thank you.
- I insist.
- I'll walk.
- It's my pleasure.
- It's okay.
I won't take no for an answer.
Get in the car.
- Did I scare you with that one?
- Little bit.
I scared him.
You were gone a while, huh?
Eight years.
Harstad was sheriff back then.
Aaron Harstad, yeah.
Sad story.
About five months back, he fell asleep at the wheel and hit a tree.
Car folded up like an accordion.
He was a good man.
A good man and a good sheriff.
All right.
- Thank you very much for the ride.
- Welcome home, Chris.
It's election month.
I'm your man.
Okay.
Say hey to your old man.
Let's go.
Can I help you?
Little brother.
You come over here and give me a hug.
- You look great.
- What is this?
I couldn't let you be the only one looking good in uniform.
Hey, Ma.
Chris is here.
- Whose tent?
- That's for Pete.
- Watch out, now.
- Chris.
- Look at you.
- Mom, how you doing?
How long's your leave?
How long do we have you?
For good.
I'm home.
- Really?
You're not kidding?
- No.
- Hey, Dad.
- Welcome back.
I wish you had told us exactly when you were coming.
I'd have cooked.
- This is fine, Mom.
- We love Chinese.
- No, this is great.
- So what are you going to do now?
I was planning to work at the mill, but you never mentioned it closed.
We didn't want to bother you when your father got laid off.
I got my business.
You saw the furniture outside.
And I substitute at the elementary school.
Michelle pitches in... we try to keep things simple.
Pete.
- This is your Uncle Chris.
- Hey, Pete.
Sit down.
Say hello.
Last time he saw you, you were barely walking.
- And now I'm camping.
- I said you could sleep on the couch.
It was Chris' room first.
Your tent's going to take on water.
I can show you how to rig it.
Doesn't look like it's going to rain to me, Colonel.
Sit down.
Eat something.
First of all, I was a sergeant.
I worked for a living.
A grunt.
- Did you ever smoke anybody?
- Pete!
Poppa's still got your gun locked up in the garage.
- Would you teach me how to shoot?
- I figured that'd be scrap metal by now.
No.
I'm still hoping you'll melt that thing down on your own.
- Sorry, Pete.
- Whatever.
- I'm out of here, Mom.
- Be back by 10:00.
- 10:30.
- 10:00.
Remind you of anyone?
Okay, it rained.
Happy?
No.
Why don't you crash on the floor?
Okay.
I'll crash on the floor.
You crash on the bed.
Keep you dry.
Did you really kill people?
- Ray-Ray.
- Hello, pudding.
- What's up, man?
- Good to see you, man.
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.
What is that?
- That's the Love Machine.
- Girls actually get in there?
- How you been?
- Good.
- Clean living?
- Please.
You want a beer?
No.
Believe it or not, I quit drinking.
I'd take a soda, though.
Okay.
Here.
Thanks, man.
Like that?
When you left town... it gave me the idea I should do something with my life, too.
So I went down to Seattle, got a guitar, and became all about music.
And then, pretty soon, I was about music and drugs... and pretty soon I was basically just about drugs... and ended up doing two years for B and E.
I'm sorry.
Look at me now, though, right?
I've been clean and sober 14 months.
Doing construction and renewing those supportive and healthy friendships... from my past.
Matter of fact, I talked to the bastards, told them you were back... and they asked me to politely remind you that it is Saturday.
- As in...
- As in, kick-off's in 20 minutes.
- Like old times.
- You guys still doing it.
We're still doing it.
- Playing ball?
- Absolutely.
Let's go, superstar!
- Just like the old days.
Go deep.
- Come on.
When did that happen?
Jay Hamilton Field.
His parents hadn't left him the mill for more than two minutes...
- before he shut it down.
- Why?
Heads up!
Because I opened my casino.
Still got a gun, huh, Jay?
Still got your reflexes.
What?
Did you get tired of being all that you could be?
- No.
I'm still all I can be.
- Really?
- I'll just have to see about that.
- Yeah.
- What brings you home?
- I just want to relax.
Catch my breath.
- You?
Relax?
- Yeah.
Not today.
I got it.
Let's go.
Come on!
Is that how it's going to be?
That's how it is.
- Full contact, huh?
- That's two-hand touch.
Too rough?
Sorry, ladies.
Pick up the outside!
- Fumble!
- Set!
How's that for touch?
- That was pretty, wasn't it?
- Want to go get your pads?
- That the best you got?
- What?
- Here, take a walk...
- And knock a long loose?
- Touchdown.
- First and your last.
- You want to go?
- Nobody's going.
We're not going to go.
You almost caught it.
- We stop them here, we win, right?
- Right, boys, last play.
- You know how I like winning.
- We need to put this to rest.
- I will take care of Ray.
- You two cross.
You stay in and block.
Booth?
Isolate on Vaughn.
- You two cross...
- Just give me the ball.
- Go low.
Left knee.
- All right, man.
You got it?
On the first hut.
Ready?
Break!
Be strong.
All right, Chris Vaughn.
Last chance.
- Black-nineteen!
Black!
- Watch the outside!
I'm open!
That's game.
Sorry about that.
Cool, man.
Nice game, ladies.
What the hell was that?
That was a great game, wasn't it?
Is that the bad one?
- Yeah, it was good.
- Hey, welcome home.
Good to be back.
See you around.
If you're not doing anything later on, want to come by the casino?
Introduce you to some nice girls.
Drinks are on me.
What do you say?
- See you tonight.
- Cool.
I'll see you later on.
Be good.
Hey, Sarge.
Good game.
Maybe next time.
Hold up.
Maybe next time I won't see you in the bleachers, smoking weed.
Welcome home, buddy.
I thought you had to be Native American to own a casino.
- Hamilton's one-sixteenth Blackfoot now.
- Put it on his application.
And what he slid under the table convinced the powers that be it was true.
- It's ours for the taking tonight.
- Let's pick some cherries, boys.
- Here we go.
- I'm feeling lucky.
Just so you guys know, I'm done after I triple my money.
That's what you said last time.
You wound up selling your body for bus fare.
He had to walk.
Nobody's going to have any problems finding this place.
It's the subtle attention to aesthetics that I find most impressive.
Blends in with the mountain so nicely.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
How you doing?
- See?
Not bad, huh?
- It's not bad.
A lot of pretty girls.
I'm getting chips.
Let's gamble.
We'll see you at the Shower Tower, okay?
Isn't it wonderful?
All your gambling needs under one great, big roof.
You got your ATM machines, tellers to cash your paycheck... and when you're here, you don't got to worry about things... like child support, rent, laws of mathematical probability.
Gentlemen, Mr. Hamilton would like to invite you to the VIP lounge.
- The dream team.
You all healed up?
- Nice place.
Welcome to my world.
Tonight all the drinks are on the house.
If you need a line of credit, say how much.
If you need a little female companionship, done.
All right?
- Get inside.
Have a good time.
- Where you going?
Don't you worry about me.
I got a few things to do.
Enjoy.
Just remember, nothing in here is free.
Ma'am.
- Cherry shot?
- Ray, be nice.
Come on, this place is nothing but fake boobs... and real assholes, if you ask me.
Just water for me.
Drink up.
We got money to win and girls just waiting.
- We are VIPs.
- Here's to you, Chris.
- Welcome home.
- Cheers.
Let's play, boys.
Go right ahead.
Already lost $1...
Good night.
Okay.
Don't say we never did nothing for you.
Don't worry, buddy, everybody's scared their first time.
- Come on.
- Get in there, Chris.
Okay, just sit back and enjoy it.
- This'll get you started.
- lf you're not back by morning... we'll send a search party.
- Have fun.
- Stop drinking.
You from here, or are you just visiting?
A little of both.
I grew up here.
So you're seeing all the old faces.
You could say that.
Your voice sounds very familiar.
Chris.
Deni.
- Look who's back.
- So, good surprise?
I told you it was better than gambling.
You met Candi?
- Hello.
- Hey, Candi.
Let's go.
Six, easy six.
Looking for a six to win.
We can do a six.
Can we do a six?
I think I can do a six, right?
We got liftoff!
Whack it, boys.
Whack it.
Blue or pink, what do you think?
Who's up for two out of three?
I'm getting killed.
Let me have a C-note to put $200 on a bet.
- No.
- Come on.
Hell, no.
Look at them.
He's hot.
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Give me a hard six.
- $5, hard six?
- Yes.
- I'm in.
- Hard six. $5 on hard six.
There's another $100.
Boom.
Give me some dice.
Looking for a six.
All right.
Oh, please.
Please.
Thank you.
And you.
- Jimmy, don't roll.
Give me the dice.
- No, I got it.
Hard six, six.
Looking for a six.
Seven out.
Line in, the dark side wins.
Last come'll get you some.
- You're good.
But I saw it.
- Saw what?
I saw the switch.
This is a clean game, asshole.
Let's see about that.
Bet you'll roll a seven.
It's not your roll, sir.
Sir, it's not your roll.
Will you call security?
Put your bets down on the passline.
- These dice are coming up seven.
- Why don't we just let it go?
No.
We're going to let it ride, Jimmy.
The dice are coming up seven.
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Come on, baby.
- What a surprise.
- No, folks.
No payouts.
- Wait a minute.
- Calm down.
Just take care of that bet, then we're even.
I would, but it wasn't a legitimate bet.
You're not the shooter.
- Security.
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Is there a problem?
- The problem is your dice are loaded.
Does your boss know about this?
Just give me my money.
Come on.
Let's go.
What now, bitch?
Come on!
Special Forces.
Wow.
I'll take that.
What are you doing?
Special Forces.
Special treatment.
This guy knows Hamilton.
You just hold him down.
Come on, Burke.
Folks.
He's pretty banged up, inside and out.
Whoever did this left him for dead.
A lesser man wouldn't have survived.
- I need a statement from him, Doctor.
- He's in no condition to give you one...
I'll also need a copy of your write-up, with toxicology...
- and blood-alcohol level.
- What are you talking about?
I'm just trying to get some facts.
You need to be arresting whoever tried to kill my brother, not testing his blood.
I'm just doing my job, Michelle.
Okay?
I understand how you feel.
But we still don't know who started all this.
- It wasn't Chris.
- Just find out who did this to him, Stan.
I'll do my best, Mr. Vaughn.
I really will.
In the meantime I have to file a full report.
Will you let me know when I can talk to him?
Thank you.
- He's going to be fine, Michelle.
- Thanks.
- Beautiful flowers.
- Thank you.
They're for my best friend.
Hey, Sarge.
So much for our VIP status.
Don't they teach you any basic fighting skills in the Army?
How did you do?
Not good.
But I tell you, that guy was feeling me this morning.
- You okay?
- That was a hell of a homecoming party.
Chris, I don't know if you noticed, but this ain't exactly home anymore.
Hang on.
Let me help you.
Come on.
I'm good, Mom.
I got it.
- Need some help?
- No.
I'm just milking it.
There's some old crutches in the garage.
- Thanks, Pete.
- Crutches.
That's nice.
Did you see the hole?
- Mind if I watch TV?
- No, that's cool.
- Somebody's feeling better.
- Little bit.
You make this?
Need anything?
- Something wrong?
- No, it's good, man.
It's good.
No, I'm good, Dad.
Thanks.
- Changed the plugs a while back.
- I appreciate that, Dad.
I might've had serious issues with your career choice... but it just didn't seem fair to take it out on an innocent truck.
Where you headed?
I was going into town to get supplies.
Want to come?
Let's go.
Your whole life, all you wanted to do was get out of here.
What made you come back now?
You're going to think I'm crazy.
I would think about the mill.
When I was a kid going to visit you at work, the smell of that fresh-cut cedar...
You remember that smell.
I remember a lot of nice things before the mill closed.
When did they go out of business?
Closed about six months ago.
There's a Home Depot about 15 minutes up the road.
And that?
Don't ask.
First of all, I just want to say thanks.
- For what?
- For making that stickman.
He's been fired and his gaming permit's been pulled.
I just have no idea why my security cameras didn't catch that.
They miss a lot in your place, don't they, Jay?
- Look, Chris, I hate seeing you like this.
- Your boys did it.
Wait a second.
So they got a little rough.
They're a bit edgy.
Understandably.
You don't know what kind of assholes they have to put up with on a daily basis.
Look, they've been reprimanded.
But they say you went nuts, man.
I'm sorry.
Insensitive.
I know the proper term that vets use is post-traumatic stress...
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Whatever.
You tore my place apart... and it wasn't easy to get my guys to agree not to press charges.
Chris, if you had a problem, shouldn't you have come to me?
I want to bring you inside.
I want to make you head of security.
- What do you say?
- No.
I guess you probably need time to think about it.
I figured as much.
This is for you.
It's a little something to help you get, you know...
Come on, man, don't be like that.
I came all the way out here to your house, just to see you get back on your feet.
I'm going to the sheriff.
I'm really sorry you feel that way.
I'll see you around, Chris.
I know, it was a good time, wasn't it?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I got to call you back.
Hey, Chris.
It's good to see you up and about.
You're looking spiffy.
I'm here to press charges.
This isn't about that incident at the casino a while back?
Yeah.
It is.
Because that matter's closed.
You're lucky you weren't brought in on charges.
I mean...
Did you even look into it?
They did an internal investigation.
That's good enough for me.
An internal investigation?
I know you're familiar with the term no-fly zone.
Because that's what the casino is.
Since the mill closed down... that casino is the main source of revenue in this town.
So case closed, basically.
We'll see you.
- I'm not going to let this stand.
- Excuse me?
- What did you say to me?
- I said I'm not going to let this stand.
You're lucky to be alive right now.
That's all you need to be concentrating on.
This is my town.
Okay?
I'm the sheriff here.
I'll tell you what will stand.
Not the other way around.
Now please get out of my building.
- Come in.
- Thanks.
This belongs to you.
I appreciate that.
I thought this was history.
- Could have left it in the trash, but I...
- Deni?
- Nice to see you, dear.
- Hi, Mrs. Vaughn.
Can I talk to you outside for a second?
Quick walk.
Mom, I'll be right back.
- How you been?
- Been better.
Talk to the sheriff yet?
I went down to the police station.
I talked to somebody with a badge.
He sure as hell didn't seem like much of a sheriff.
He's up for reelection, you know.
- Maybe you could take his job.
- Somebody ought to.
How about you?
Nothing but sunshine and pine trees.
Been reading these books.
Teach you how to cultivate your happiness.
Focus on the future.
- Go with the flow, that sort of thing.
- Is it working?
I have my moments.
So, the casino, huh?
Yeah.
Been there almost a year.
- Treating you good?
- A lot better than it treated you.
I like that.
Jay Hamilton's done well for himself, hasn't he?
He's a real go-getter, that one.
He must be.
I heard he got you.
That lasted about eight minutes.
It was a long time ago.
You still work for him, though.
Rent's got to be paid, Chris.
I suppose so.
- Hope to see you around.
- Do you?
Thanks for the jacket.
And where is he?
It's okay, Mom.
He's stabilized.
It was close.
Crystal meth.
I'm sorry.
I never did it before.
It's true.
We might've kind of pushed him into it.
- Where'd you get the drugs?
- I'm not really sure...
Stop.
Where?
From the security guys working at the casino.
Chris, wait.
Call the police.
No.
It won't do any good.
- Is Pete okay?
- He'll be fine.
What are you doing?
No, Chris.
Not like this.
Listen to me.
If you go out of here with that gun, they're going to nail...
I've been looking for you.
Guess that changes our relationship a bit, huh?
You should not have come looking for trouble.
Keep your hands up.
Get out of the vehicle now, Chris.
Now!
- Step back, please.
- Just move toward the front of the car.
Put your hands on the hood.
I advise you to give this offer more than a little serious thought.
If you go to trial, you stand to do 18 years.
Now, this is a sweetheart plea.
Normally they wouldn't even put it on the table... but your military record can't be ignored.
Three months home arrest, some community service...
- pretty generous offer, Chris.
- But I'd have to plead guilty.
Look at it from the other side.
There's over a dozen witnesses, none of whom will paint a flattering picture.
- He started busting up the machines.
- There was a gunshot.
- He just went crazy.
- A complete psychopath.
They're only offering me this deal just to keep me quiet.
I still say you should take it.
I wasn't wrong.
And I won't say I was.
Our job is to keep order.
There was no chance of that once he came in.
Me and my men, we were just trying to control him.
He's highly trained, violent.
A very dangerous person.
So violent, so dangerous, so highly trained... that he dispatched six of the casino security staff single-handedly.
Six men, single-handedly.
His weapon of choice, a simple piece of cedar... which, in his hands, became a devastating force with one aim:
To hurt people and destroy property.
He went directly for everything.
He just came in and took over the place.
- You said he broke your arm.
- Yeah, that's correct.
My right forearm.
Both bones with a single shot.
It was crazy.
Toss a couple of drunks now and then.
Guys try to grope the girls.
But nothing with this sort of violence.
Did he give you any kind of advance warning... a chance to defend yourself?
We tussled, but he's a big guy.
He was on a mission.
Besides, he seemed to be too busy enjoying himself from what I could see.
So from what you saw, he seemed to have some kind of purpose?
He had a point to prove.
I was emptying machines when he came in and started swinging.
- I was trying to get out of there.
- He was a menace.
- A very dangerous person.
- Military-trained.
He seemed like a complete psychopath.
- Nothing close to this.
- I didn't know what he'd do.
- I was frightened.
- He came for us.
- No doubt in your mind?
- No doubt.
I have no further questions.
Mr. Crowe, you may present your client's case.
You're fired.
Your Honor, I'd like to plead my own case.
Order!
If you choose to represent yourself, and not be represented by legal counsel... you realize that you can't then claim a mistrial on that basis?
- Yes, I do.
- Very well, Mr. Vaughn.
I don't deny anything that was said here today.
Does that mean you're changing your plea to guilty?
I'm not guilty of anything... except standing up for myself when the law wouldn't.
Objection.
He's trying to introduce prior events.
Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, stay on point.
I grew up in this town.
People used to walk tall in this town.
They wouldn't have traded the mill for a crooked casino.
We're not here to listen to civic speeches...
And they wouldn't have stood around while drugs were sold to kids.
- Objection!
- Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, you're close to being held in contempt.
I was justified in what I did.
And if you acquit me of these charges, then I'm gonna run for sheriff.
- Mr. Vaughn.
- And if elected, I'm gonna fix this town.
Order.
Please take your seat.
Mr. Vaughn, you are now charged with contempt.
And I will make sure that this...
- Objection.
- Sustained.
...never happens to anyone again without punishing those who did it.
I'm ordering the jury to ignore what they've just seen.
Mr. Vaughn, take your seat.
Order.
Or you're all charged with contempt!
Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
Defendant, please rise.
We find the defendant, Chris Vaughn, not guilty.
This is mine.
Sheriff Vaughn!
You won the election.
Congratulations.
But we do have a tradition of professional courtesy up here.
And I can personally vouch for each and every one of these men.
They're good deputies.
You're all fired.
- Hey, Chris.
- License and registration, please.
You're joking, right?
License and registration.
What's the problem, Sheriff?
You.
And the drugs you're peddling out of your casino.
The only thing that's going on in my casino is construction.
You took care of that.
That's right.
And I plan on taking care of everything else, too.
If you can, try to think this through:
A casino is a license to print money.
Why would I jeopardize that by selling drugs?
Because you owned the town, Jay.
That's changed now.
Really?
The only thing I think has changed around here... is that you get to wake up every morning and put on that nifty little badge.
But underneath it is the same guy who couldn't make it playing college football... and apparently couldn't make it in the Army... and not really ever gonna make it as a cop.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
And if you push too hard, you're going to be a man who never gets to see 40.
License, please.
Thanks, Sheriff.
Sir, get your taillights fixed.
It's your last warning.
What's wrong with my taillights?
They're broken.
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning, Deputy.
No.
Come on, man.
You know I hate cops.
You've been sheriff for about two minutes, and I'm already starting to hate you.
- I'm a convicted felon.
- I've got pull around here.
Now you're a crooked cop doing favors for friends.
That's how it starts.
Next thing you know you'll be taking bribes, setting up roadblocks...
- frisking dudes' crotches.
- Are you done?
- Ray, I need your help.
- Don't do that.
I need you to take me to drug school.
I get to wear a uniform?
The stuff in this town is five-star, factory pure.
- So let's go get the factory.
- Easier said than done.
We know Hamilton's boys are selling that shit down at the casino.
Yeah, but 99% of the time they're clean.
So we got to play follow-the-money, starting with the tweakers.
That'll give us the suppliers.
These guys are real edgy, so delicacy is the key.
Then we put the squeeze on them... till they spit out the location of the next buy.
- Where'd you learn that, Ray?
- Cops.
That's a good show.
Phase three: we strike.
- I thought you said delicacy was the key.
- That's right.
Delicacy and precision.
- Hey, what's up?
- Get out of here.
- You're sure you're not carrying anything?
- I don't have shit.
- Officer.
- Yeah.
Search him.
This is going to be a switch.
Spread your legs.
Arms down.
You been working out?
Nothing there.
Somebody needs a bath.
Now you read me my rights, then you take me in... and I call my lawyer.
Okay.
But I have a hunch there may be something else in here.
Could be.
Go to it, Deputy.
Have a good time.
- He ain't talking.
- I know.
Handles pretty good.
He's clean.
Guess we got to go with Plan B.
Screw you both.
I do have a bit of information for you.
It's not just me, actually.
There's a whole lot of people in this one.
Spit it out.
You're gonna get hurt.
What an idiot.
Why does it always have to be your fight?
- You might need this.
- No.
- I put my guns down a long time ago.
- Come on.
You're just being stubborn.
You and me both, boy.
Chris, listen.
You be careful.
I will.
Please step away from the vehicle!
Mr. Booth, are you still upset over that body-cavity search?
I forgot, you got no vehicle.
Please disperse!
There is nothing to...
Can I talk to you?
- Sure.
- Over here?
I'm gonna stay here with him tonight.
I need you to look after my parents' place.
Think they're gonna take it that far?
- I'm with you, man.
I'll check in later.
- Okay.
A drive to right field.
It's dropping for a single.
You making house calls?
- Don't shoot.
- Hey.
How's the food around here?
Nice.
I brought you special treats:
Salad, fried chicken... potato salad.
- Do you have glasses?
- Yeah.
- Do you have to work tonight?
- I quit.
I figured you were making some changes around here...
I could make a few myself.
Salt and pepper?
- Who is that?
- Pete.
- Want something to eat?
- No.
I'm good, man.
I got to get a bigger bed.
No, you don't.
Do it.
I'm hungry.
We've got leftovers.
I want pancakes.
And eggs.
And bacon.
I told you, Vaughn.
Stay here.
Who needs to step away from the vehicle now, Vaughn?
Truck for a truck, baby!
That's right!
Truck for a truck!
Get down!
Tear it up, boys!
Pete, something's burning.
Take this.
Get in there.
Good morning, honey.
Get out of here.
Sheriff, are you home?
I told you someone was going to get hurt!
Come here.
When I say now, start shooting!
Over there!
Stay low.
Vaughn!
You got to get me out of here.
Move it.
Go!
Move it, old man.
- Where's Pete?
- I don't know.
Sit down.
- I know who you are.
- Oh, yeah?
- Burke?
- Son of a bitch.
Check it out.
Come on!
Get me out of here, man!
- What's it worth to you?
Where's the lab?
- Screw you!
Hamilton's operation is at the mill, okay?
Now get me out of here!
Drop it.
Stay down!
Stay down.
You okay?
Shit.
I thought I warned you, Chris.
I didn't want this to happen.
I'm going in!
Right there, punk!
Come on, Chris!
Come on!
Deni, now!
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Where is everybody?
- Pete ran outside.
You stabbed me with a potato peeler.
You gonna be okay?
Hey, Chris.
Get up, Jay.
Just a second.
Remember when we used to play hide-and-seek up here?
- That was my favorite sound.
- Get up!
Look, Chris...
You want to know what my new favorite sound's gonna be?
The sound of you screaming like a little bitch.
Bet you wish you took that job offer now?
But, no!
You had to be Mr. Hero Boy!
You forgot this: this is my town!
Yes!
You're nothing.
You're right, Jay.
This does change our relationship.
This is my town.
You're under arrest.
That ought to do it.
What are you doing?
Getting some souvenirs.
I'm gonna miss the place.
That's how it starts.
Next you'll be accepting bribes and setting speed traps all over town.
Cutting up trucks.
You know how you are.
Not to mention the cavity searches.
You're gonna like that.
Speaking of which, do you think Jay's got a casino in the pen?
- Could be.
- Running the Shower Tower with the fellas?
He's probably blowing on somebody's dice right now.
That's lunch.
Let's go pick up my old man, grab something to eat.
I'm with you, buddy.
(MIDNIGHT RIDER PLAYING)
MAN:
Here you go.
WOMAN:
Thanks, man.
See you tomorrow.
How you doing?
Okay.
- When did the mill close?
-Three years ago this August.
If you're looking for work, you may want to try Aberdeen.
That's about the closest mill work you'll find.
- Too bad.
-it's just simple economics.
You know, we have a really nice casino, the Wild Cherry.
Want to make some money, maybe you ought to go on down and try your luck at the blackjack tables.
No, I don't think so.
Thanks.
You're Chris Vaughn?
Well, hell.
I know all about you, Chris.
I know your folks.
I'm Sheriff Stan Watkins.
- How you doing?
-Ralston, get out of the car!
You're looking at a real soldier here.
Pay some respects.
- Welcome home, soldier.
-Thanks.
Well, hell, Chris.
- I'll give you a ride up to your folks'.
-No, I'm fine.
Thank you.
- I insist.
-I'll walk.
- It's my pleasure.
-it's okay.
I won't take no for an answer.
Get in the car.
(CHUCKUNG)
- Did I scare you with that one?
-Little bit.
I scared him.
WATKINS:
You were gone a while, huh?
Eight years.
Harstad was sheriff back then.
Aaron Harstad, yeah.
Sad story.
About five months back, he fell asleep at the wheel and hit a tree.
Car folded up like an accordion.
He was a good man.
A good man and a good sheriff.
All right.
- Thank you very much for the ride.
-Welcome home, Chris.
It's election month.
I'm your man.
Okay.
Say hey to your old man.
Let's go.
Can I help you?
Little brother.
You come over here and give me a hug.
- You look great.
-What is this?
I couldn't let you be the only one looking good in uniform.
Hey, Ma.
Chris is here.
- Whose tent?
-That's for Pete.
- Watch out, now.
-Chris.
- Look at you.
-Mom, how you doing?
How long's your leave?
How long do we have you?
For good.
I'm home.
- Really?
You're not kidding?
-No.
- Hey, Dad.
-Welcome back.
CONNIE:
I wish you had told us exactly when you were coming.
I'd have cooked.
- This is fine, Mom.
-MICHELLE:
We love Chinese.
- No, this is great.
-So what are you going to do now?
I was planning to work at the mill, but you never mentioned it closed.
We didn't want to bother you when your father got laid off.
I got my business.
You saw the furniture outside.
And I substitute at the elementary school.
Michelle pitches in, we try to keep things simple.
MICHELLE:
Pete.
- This is your Uncle Chris.
-Hey, Pete.
Sit down.
Say hello.
Last time he saw you, you were barely walking.
- And now I'm camping.
-I said you could sleep on the couch.
It was Chris' room first.
Your tent's going to take on water.
I can show you how to rig it.
Doesn't look like it's going to rain to me, Colonel.
Sit down.
Eat something.
First of all, I was a sergeant.
I worked for a living.
A grunt.
- Did you ever smoke anybody?
-ALL:
Pete!
Poppa's still got your gun locked up in the garage.
- Would you teach me how to shoot?
-I figured that'd be scrap metal by now.
No.
I'm still hoping you'll melt that thing down on your own.
- Sorry, Pete.
-Whatever.
- I'm out of here, Mom.
-Be back by 10:00.
40:30.
40100.
Remind you of anyone?
Okay, it rained.
Happy?
No.
Why don't you crash on the floor?
Okay.
I'll crash on the floor.
You crash on the bed.
Huh-uh.
CHRIS:
Pete.
Keep you dry-
Did you really kill people?
(MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR STEREO)
- Ray-Ray.
-Hello, pudding.
- What's up, man?
-Good to see you, man.
- How you doing?
-I'm all right.
What is that?
- That's the Love Machine.
-Girls actually get in there?
- How you been?
-Good.
- Clean living?
-Please.
You want a beer?
No.
Believe it or not, I quit drinking.
I'd take a soda, though.
Okay.
Here.
Thanks, man.
Like that?
When you left town, it gave me the idea I should do something with my life, too.
So I went down to Seattle, got a guitar, and became all about music.
And then, pretty soon, I was about music and drugs, and pretty soon I was basically just about drugs and ended up doing two years for B and E.
I'm sorry.
Look at me now, though, right?
I've been clean and sober 14 months.
Doing construction and renewing those supportive and healthy friendships from my past.
Matter of fact, I talked to the bastards, told them you were back, and they asked me to politely remind you that it is Saturday.
- As in...
-As in, kick-off's in 20 minutes.
- Like old times.
-You guys still doing it.
We're still doing it.
- Playing ball?
-Absolutely.
Let's go, superstar!
- Just like the old days.
Go deep.
-Come on.
When did that happen?
RAY:
Jay Hamilton Field.
His parents hadn't left him the mill for more than two minutes
-before he shut it down.
-CHRIS:
Why?
JAY:
Heads up!
Because I opened my casino.
Still got a gun, huh, Jay?
Still got your reflexes.
What?
Did you get tired of being all that you could be?
- No.
I'm still all I can be.
-Really?
- I'll just have to see about that.
-Yeah.
- What brings you home?
-I just want to relax.
Catch my breath.
- You?
Relax?
-Yeah.
Not today.
I got it.
Let's go.
Come on!
(ALL SHOUTING)
Is that how it's going to be?
That's how it is.
- CHRIS:
Full contact, huh?
-That's two-hand touch.
Too rough?
Sorry, ladies.
Pick up the outside!
- Fumble!
-Set!
How's that for touch?
- That was pretty, wasn't it?
-Want to go get your pads?
- That the best you got?
-What?
- Here, take a walk...
-And knock a long loose?
- Touchdown.
-First and your last.
- You want to go?
-Nobody's going.
We're not going to go.
You almost caught it.
- JAY:
We stop them here, we win, right?
-Right, boys, last play.
- You know how I like winning.
-We need to put this to rest.
- I will take care of Ray.
-You two cross.
You stay in and block.
Booth?
Isolate on Vaughn.
- You two cross...
-Just give me the ball.
- Go low.
Left knee.
-All right, man.
You got it?
On the first hut.
Ready?
Break!
Be strong.
All right, Chris Vaughn.
Last chance.
- Black-nineteen!
Black!
-Watch the outside!
I'm open!
(EXCLAIMS)
That's game.
Sorry about that.
Cool, man.
MAN 1:
Nice game, ladies.
MAN 2:
What the hell was that?
That was a great game, wasn't it?
Is that the bad one?
- Yeah, it was good.
-Hey, welcome home.
Good to be back.
See you around.
If you're not doing anything later on, want to come by the casino?
Introduce you to some nice girls.
Drinks are on me.
What do you say?
- See you tonight.
-Cool.
I'll see you later on.
Be good.
Hey, Sarge.
Good game.
Maybe next time.
Hold up.
Maybe next time I won't see you in the bleachers, smoking weed.
Welcome home, buddy.
CHRIS:
I thought you had to be Native American to own a casino.
RAY:
Hamilton's one-sixteenth Blackfoot now.
KEITH:
Put it on his application.
RAY:
And what he slid under the table convinced the powers that be it was true.
MAN 2:
It's ours for the taking tonight.
JIMMY:
Let's pick some cherries, boys.
- Here we go.
-I'm feeling lucky.
Just so you guys know, I'm done after I triple my money.
That's what you said last time.
You wound up selling your body for bus fare.
He had to walk.
Nobody's going to have any problems finding this place.
It's the subtle attention to aesthetics that I find most impressive.
Blends in with the mountain so nicely.
- Hi there.
-Hi.
How you doing?
- See?
Not bad, huh?
-it's not bad.
A lot of pretty girls.
I'm getting chips.
Let's gamble.
We'll see you at the Shower Tower, okay?
RAY:
Isn't it wonderful?
All your gambling needs under one great, big roof.
You got your ATM machines, tellers to cash your paycheck, and when you're here, you don't got to worry about things, like child support, rent, laws of mathematical probability.
Gentlemen, Mr. Hamilton would like to invite you to the VIP lounge.
- The dream team.
You all healed up?
-Nice place.
Welcome to my world.
Tonight all the drinks are on the house.
If you need a line of credit, say how much.
If you need a little female companionship, done.
All right?
- Get inside.
Have a good time.
-Where you going?
Don't you worry about me.
I got a few things to do.
Enjoy.
Just remember, nothing in here is free.
Ma'am.
WAITRESS:
Cherry shot?
CHRIS:
Ray, be nice.
RAY:
Come on, this place is nothing but fake boobs and real assholes, if you ask me.
Just water for me.
JIMMY:
Drink up.
We got money to win and girls just waiting.
MAN 1:
We are VIPs.
RAY:
Here's to you, Chris.
KEITH:
Welcome home.
ALL:
Cheers.
Let's play, b0315-
Go right ahead.
Already lost $1
Good night.
Okay.
Don't say we never did nothing for you.
Don't worry, buddy, everybody's scared their first time.
- Come on.
-Get in there, Chris.
Okay, just sit back and enjoy it.
- This'll get you started.
-If you're not back by morning we'll send a search party.
- Have fun.
-Stop drinking.
(FIRE PLAYING)
You from here, or are you just visiting?
A little of both.
I grew up here.
So you're seeing all the old faces.
You could say that.
Your voice sounds very familiar.
Chris.
Dem.
- Look who's back.
-So, good surprise?
I told you it was better than gambling.
You met Candi?
- CANDl:
Hello.
-Hey, Candi.
Let's go.
Six, easy six.
Looking for a six to win.
We can do a six.
Can we do a six?
I think I can do a six, right?
We got liftoff!
Whack it, boys.
Whack it.
Blue or pink, what do you think?
Who's up for two out of three?
I'm getting killed.
Let me have a C-note to put $200 on a bet.
- No.
-Come on.
Hell, no.
Look at them.
He's hot.
- That's what I'm talking about.
-Give me a hard six.
-$5, hard six?
-Yes.
- I'm in.
-Hard six. $5 on hard six.
There's another $100.
Boom.
Give me some dice.
Looking for a six.
All right.
Oh, please.
Please.
Thank you.
And you.
- Jimmy, don't roll.
Give me the dice.
-No, I got it.
Hard six, six.
Looking for a six.
Seven out.
Line in, the dark side wins.
Last come'll get you some.
- You're good.
But I saw it.
-Saw what?
I saw the switch.
This is a clean game, asshole.
- Yeah?
-Yeah.
Let's see about that.
Bet you'll roll a seven.
It's not your roll, sir.
Sir, it's not your roll.
Will you call security?
Put your bets down on the passline.
- These dice are coming up seven.
-Why don't we just let it go?
No.
We're going to let it ride, Jimmy.
The dice are coming up seven.
- It's not your roll, sir.
-MAN:
Come on, baby.
- What a surprise.
-No, folks.
No payouts.
- Wait a minute.
-Calm down.
Just take care of that bet, then we're even.
I would, but it wasn't a legitimate bet.
You're not the shooter.
- Security.
-it's not your roll, sir.
- Is there a problem?
-The problem is your dice are loaded.
Does your boss know about this?
Just give me my money.
Come on.
Let's go.
What now, bitch?
Come on!
Special Forces.
WOW.
I'll take that.
What are you doing?
Special Forces.
Special treatment.
This guy knows Hamilton.
You just hold him down.
Come on, Burke.
Folks.
He's pretty banged up, inside and out.
Whoever did this left him for dead.
A lesser man wouldn't have survived.
- I need a statement from him, Doctor.
-He's in no condition to give you one...
I'll also need a copy of your write-up, with toxicology
-and blood-alcohol level.
-What are you talking about?
I'm just trying to get some facts.
You need to be arresting whoever tried to kill my brother, not testing his blood.
I'm just doing my job, Michelle.
Okay?
I understand how you feel.
But we still don't know who started all this.
- It wasn't Chris.
-Just find out who did this to him, Stan.
I'll do my best, Mr. Vaughn.
I really will.
In the meantime I have to file a full report.
Will you let me know when I can talk to him?
Thank you.
- He's going to be fine, Michelle.
-Thanks.
- Beautiful flowers.
-Thank you.
They're for my best friend.
Hey, Sarge.
So much for our VIP status.
Don't they teach you any basic fighting skills in the Army?
How did you do?
Not good.
But I tell you, that guy was feeling me this morning.
- You okay?
-That was a hell of a homecoming party.
Chris, I don't know if you noticed, but this ain't exactly home anymore.
Hang on.
Let me help you.
Come on.
I'm good, Mom.
I got it.
- Need some help?
-No.
I'm just milking it.
There's some old crutches in the garage.
CONNIE:
Thanks, Pete.
CHRIS:
Crutches.
That's nice.
Did you see the hole?
- Mind if I watch TV?
-No, that's cool.
CHRIS:
Ray.
- Somebody's feeling better.
-Little bit.
You make this?
Need anything?
- Something wrong?
-No, it's good, man.
It's good.
No, I'm good, Dad.
Thanks.
- Changed the plugs a while back.
-I appreciate that, Dad.
I might've had serious issues with your career choice, but it just didn't seem fair to take it out on an innocent truck.
Where you headed?
I was going into town to get supplies.
Want to come?
Let's go.
Your whole life, all you wanted to do was get out of here.
What made you come back now?
You're going to think I'm crazy.
I would think about the mill.
When I was a kid going to visit you at work, the smell of that fresh-cut cedar...
You remember that smell.
I remember a lot of nice things before the mill closed.
CHRIS:
When did they go out of business?
MR. VAUGHN:
Closed about six months ago.
There's a Home Depot about 15 minutes up the road.
And that?
Don't ask.
First of all, I just want to say thanks.
- For what?
-For making that stickman.
He's been fired and his gaming permit's been pulled.
I just have no idea why my security cameras didn't catch that.
They miss a lot in your place, don't they, Jay?
- Look, Chris, I hate seeing you like this.
-Your boys did it.
Wait a second.
So they got a little rough.
They're a bit edgy.
Understandably.
You don't know what kind of assholes they have to put up with on a daily basis.
Look, they've been reprimanded.
But they say you went nuts, man.
I'm sorry. insensitive.
I know the proper term that vets use is post-traumatic stress...
- What the fuck you talking about?
-Whatever.
You tore my place apart, and it wasn't easy to get my guys to agree not to press charges.
Chris, if you had a problem, shouldn't you have come to me?
I want to bring you inside.
I want to make you head of security.
- What do you say?
-No.
I guess you probably need time to think about it.
I figured as much.
This is for you.
It's a little something to help you get, you know...
Come on, man, don't be like that.
I came all the way out here to your house, just to see you get back on your feet.
I'm going to the sheriff.
I'm really sorry you feel that way.
I'll see you around, Chris.
I know, it was a good time, wasn't it?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I got to call you back.
Hey, Chris.
It's good to see you up and about.
You're looking spiffy.
I'm here to press charges.
This isn't about that incident at the casino a while back?
Yeah.
It is.
Because that matter's closed.
You're lucky you weren't brought in on charges.
I mean...
Did you even look into it?
They did an internal investigation.
That's good enough for me.
An internal investigation?
I know you're familiar with the term no-fly zone.
Because that's what the casino is.
Since the mill closed down, that casino is the main source of revenue in this town.
So case closed, basically.
We'll see you.
- I'm not going to let this stand.
-Excuse me?
- What did you say to me?
-I said I'm not going to let this stand.
You're lucky to be alive right now.
That's all you need to be concentrating on.
This is my town.
Okay?
I'm the sheriff here.
I'll tell you what will stand.
Not the other way around.
Now please get out of my building.
Hi.
Hey.
- Come in.
-Thanks.
This belongs to you.
I appreciate that.
I thought this was history.
- Could have left it in the trash, but I...
-Deni?
- Nice to see you, dear.
-Hi, Mrs. Vaughn.
Can I talk to you outside for a second?
Quick walk.
Mom, I'll be right back.
- How you been?
-Been better.
Talk to the sheriff yet?
I went down to the police station.
I talked to somebody with a badge.
He sure as hell didn't seem like much of a sheriff.
He's up for reelection, you know.
- Maybe you could take his job.
-Somebody ought to.
How about you?
Nothing but sunshine and pine trees.
Been reading these books.
Teach you how to cultivate your happiness.
Focus on the future.
- Go with the flow, that sort of thing.
-Is it working?
I have my moments.
So, the casino, huh?
Yeah.
Been there almost a year.
- Treating you good?
-A lot better than it treated you.
I like that.
Jay Hamilton's done well for himself, hasn't he?
He's a real go-getter, that one.
He must be.
I heard he got you.
That lasted about eight minutes.
it was a long time ago.
You still work for him, though.
Rent's got to be paid, Chris.
I suppose so.
- Hope to see you around.
-Do you?
Thanks for the jacket.
And where is he?
It's okay, Mom.
He's stabilized.
It was close.
Crystal meth.
I'm sorry.
I never did it before.
It's true.
We might've kind of pushed him into it.
- Where'd you get the drugs?
-I'm not really sure...
Stop.
Where?
From the security guys working at the casino.
Chris, wait.
Call the police.
No. it won't do any good.
- Is Pete okay?
-He'll be fine.
What are you doing?
No, Chris.
Not like this.
Listen to me.
If you go out of here with that gun, they're going to nail...
I've been looking for you.
(GROANING)
Guess that changes our relationship a bit, huh?
(POLICE SIRENS WAILING)
You should not have come looking for trouble.
Keep your hands up.
Get out of the vehicle now, Chris.
Now!
- POLICEMAN:
Step back, please.
-Just move toward the front of the car.
Put your hands on the hood.
CROWE:
I advise you to give this offer more than a little serious thought.
If you go to trial, you stand to do 18 years.
Now, this is a sweetheart plea.
Normally they wouldn't even put it on the table, but your military record can't be ignored.
Three months home arrest, some community service,
-pretty generous offer, Chris.
-But I'd have to plead guilty.
Look at it from the other side.
There's over a dozen witnesses, none of whom will paint a flattering picture.
- He started busting up the machines.
-There was a gunshot.
- He just went crazy.
-A complete psychopath.
They're only offering me this deal just to keep me quiet.
I still say you should take it.
I wasn't wrong.
And I won't say I was.
BOOTH:
Our job is to keep order.
There was no chance of that once he came in.
Me and my men, we were just trying to control him.
He's highly trained, violent.
A very dangerous person.
So violent, so dangerous, so highly trained, that he dispatched six of the casino security staff single-handedly.
Six men, single-handedly.
His weapon of choice, a simple piece of cedar, which, in his hands, became a devastating force with one aim.
To hurt people and destroy property.
He went directly for everything.
He just came in and took over the place.
You said he broke your arm.
BURKE:
Yeah, that's correct.
My right forearm.
Both bones with a single shot. it was crazy.
Toss a couple of drunks now and then.
Guys try to grope the girls.
But nothing with this sort of violence.
PROSECUTOR:
Did he give you any kind of advance warning, a chance to defend yourself?
We tussled, but he's a big guy.
He was on a mission.
Besides, he seemed to be too busy enjoying himself from what I could see.
So from what you saw, he seemed to have some kind of purpose?
He had a point to prove.
I was emptying machines when he came in and started swinging.
- I was trying to get out of there.
-MAN 1:
He was a menace.
MAN 2:
A very dangerous person.
MAN 3:
Military-trained.
WOMAN 1:
He seemed like a complete psychopath.
MAN 4:
Nothing close to this.
MAN 5:
I didn't know what he'd do.
WOMAN 2:
I was frightened.
MAN 6:
He came for us.
PROSECUTOR:
No doubt in your mind?
MAN 7:
No doubt.
I have no further questions.
JUDGE:
Mr. Crowe, you may present your client's case.
You're fired.
Your Honor, I'd like to plead my own case.
(CROWD MURMURING)
Order!
If you choose to represent yourself, and not be represented by legal counsel, you realize that you can't then claim a mistrial on that basis?
- Yes, I do.
-Very well, Mr. Vaughn.
I don't deny anything that was said here today.
Does that mean you're changing your plea to guilty?
I'm not guilty of anything, except standing up for myself when the law wouldn't.
Objection.
He's trying to introduce prior events.
Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, stay on point.
I grew up in this town.
People used to walk tall in this town.
They wouldn't have traded the mill for a crooked casino.
We're not here to listen to civic speeches...
And they wouldn't have stood around while drugs were sold to kids.
- Objection!
-Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, you're close to being held in contempt.
I was justified in what I did.
And if you acquit me of these charges, then I'm gonna run for sheriff.
- Mr. Vaughn.
-And if elected, I'm gonna fix this town.
JUDGE:
Order.
Please take your seat.
Mr. Vaughn, you are now charged with contempt.
And I will make sure that this...
- Objection.
-Sustained.
...never happens to anyone again without punishing those who did it.
I'm ordering the jury to ignore what they've just seen.
Mr. Vaughn, take your seat.
Order.
Or you're all charged with contempt!
JUDGE:
Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
Defendant, please rise.
We find the defendant, Chris Vaughn, not guilty.
(ALL CHEERING)
This is mine.
ALL:
Sheriff Vaughn!
(CROWD CHANTING)
- Sheriff.
-Watkins.
You won the election.
Congratulations.
But we do have a tradition of professional courtesy up here.
And I can personally vouch for each and every one of these men.
They're good deputies.
You're all fired.
(POLICE SIREN WAILING)
- JAY:
Hey, Chris.
-License and registration, please.
You're joking, right?
License and registration.
What's the problem, Sheriff?
You.
And the drugs you're peddling out of your casino.
The only thing that's going on in my casino is construction.
You took care of that.
That's right.
And I plan on taking care of everything else, too.
If you can, try to think this through.
A casino is a license to print money.
Why would I jeopardize that by selling drugs?
Because you owned the town, Jay.
That's changed now.
Really?
The only thing I think has changed around here is that you get to wake up every morning and put on that nifty little badge.
But underneath it is the same guy who couldn't make it playing college football, and apparently couldn't make it in the Army, and not really ever gonna make it as a cop.
- Is that right?
-Yeah.
And if you push too hard, you're going to be a man who never gets to see 40.
License, please.
Thanks, Sheriff.
Sir, get your taillights fixed.
It's your last warning.
What's wrong with my taillights?
They're broken.
(FIVE FEET HIGH AND RISING PLAYING)
- RAY:
Morning, Sheriff.
-Morning, Deputy.
No.
Come on, man.
You know I hate cops.
You've been sheriff for about two minutes, and I'm already starting to hate you.
- I'm a convicted felon.
-I've got pull around here.
Now you're a crooked cop doing favors for friends.
That's how it starts.
Next thing you know you'll be taking bribes, setting up roadblocks,
-frisking dudes' crotches.
-Are you done?
- Ray, I need your help.
-Don't do that.
I need you to take me to drug school.
I get to wear a uniform?
RAY:
The stuff in this town is five-star, factory pure.
CHRIS:
So let's go get the factory.
RAY:
Easier said than done.
CHRIS:
We know Hamilton's boys are selling that shit down at the casino.
RAY:
Yeah, but 99% of the time they're clean.
So we got to play follow-the-money, starting with the tweakers.
That'll give us the suppliers.
These guys are real edgy, so delicacy is the key.
Then we put the squeeze on them till they spit out the location of the next buy.
- Where'd you learn that, Ray?
-Cops.
That's a good show.
Phase three, we strike.
CHRIS:
I thought you said delicacy was the key.
RAY:
That's right.
Delicacy and precision.
MAN:
Hey, what's up?
CHRIS:
Get out of here.
- You're sure you're not carrying anything?
-I don't have shit.
- Officer.
-Yeah.
Search him.
This is going to be a switch.
Spread your legs.
Arms down.
You been working out?
Nothing there.
Somebody needs a bath.
Now you read me my rights, then you take me in, and I call my lawyer.
Okay.
But I have a hunch there may be something else in here.
Could be.
Go to it, Deputy.
Have a good time.
Oops.
- He ain't talking.
-I know.
Handles pretty good.
He's clean.
Guess we got to go with Plan B.
Screw you both.
I do have a bit of information for you.
It's not just me, actually.
There's a whole lot of people in this one.
Spit it out.
You're gonna get hurt.
What an idiot.
Why does it always have to be your fight?
- You might need this.
-No.
- I put my guns down a long time ago.
-Come on.
You're just being stubborn.
You and me both, boy.
Chris, listen.
You be careful.
I will.
Please step away from the vehicle!
Mr. Booth, are you still upset over that body-cavity search?
I forgot, you got no vehicle.
(SIREN WAILING)
Please disperse!
There is nothing to...
Can I talk to you?
- Sure.
-Over here?
I'm gonna stay here with him tonight.
I need you to look after my parents' place.
Think they're gonna take it that far?
- I'm with you, man.
I'll check in later.
-Okay.
COMMENTATOR ON TV:
A drive to right field.
It's dropping for a single.
BOOTH:
You making house calls?
- Don't shoot.
-Hey.
How's the food around here?
Nice.
I brought you special treats.
Salad, fried chicken, potato salad.
- Do you have glasses?
-Yeah.
- Do you have to work tonight?
-I quit.
I figured you were making some changes around here,
I could make a few myself.
Salt and pepper?
(BLUE MONDAY PLAYING)
- Who is that?
-Pete.
- Want something to eat?
-No.
I'm good, man.
I got to get a bigger bed.
No, you don't.
Do it.
I'm hungry-
We've got leftovers.
I want pancakes.
And eggs.
And bacon.
I told you, Vaughn.
Stay here.
Who needs to step away from the vehicle now, Vaughn?
BOOTH:
Truck for a truck, baby!
That's right!
Truck for a truck!
Get down!
Tear it up, boys!
Pete, something's burning.
Take this.
Get in there.
Good morning, honey.
Get out of here.
Sheriff, are you home?
I told you someone was going to get hurt!
Come here.
When I say now, start shooting!
Over there!
Stay low.
Vaughn!
You got to get me out of here.
Move it.
Go!
Move it, old man.
- Where's Pete?
-I don't know.
Sit down.
- I know who you are.
-Oh, yeah?
(GLASS SHATTERING)
- Burke?
-Son of a bitch.
Check it out.
Come on!
Get me out of here, man!
- What's it worth to you?
Where's the lab?
-Screw you!
Hamilton's operation is at the mill, okay?
Now get me out of here!
Drop it.
Stay down!
Stay down.
You Okay?
Shit.
I thought I warned you, Chris.
I didn't want this to happen.
I'm going in!
Right there, punk!
Come on, Chris!
Come on!
Deni, now!
Dem.
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Where is everybody?
-Pete ran outside.
You stabbed me with a potato peeler.
You gonna be okay?
Hey, Chris.
Get up, Jay-
Just a second.
Remember when we used to play hide-and-seek up here?
- That was my favorite sound.
-Get up!
Look, Chris...
You want to know what my new favorite sound's gonna be?
The sound of you screaming like a little bitch.
Bet you wish you took that job offer now?
But, no!
You had to be Mr. Hero Boy!
You forgot this, this is my town!
(JAY SCREAMING)
Yes!
(BOTH GRUNTING)
You're nothing.
You're right, Jay.
This does change our relationship.
This is my town.
You're under arrest.
That ought to do it.
What are you doing?
Getting some souvenirs.
I'm gonna miss the place.
That's how it starts.
Next you'll be accepting bribes and setting speed traps all over town.
Cutting up trucks.
You know how you are.
Not to mention the cavity searches.
You're gonna like that.
RAY:
Speaking of which, do you think Jay's got a casino in the pen?
CHRIS:
Could be.
RAY:
Running the Shower Tower with the fellas?
He's probably blowing on somebody's dice right now.
(BELL RINGING)
RAY:
That's lunch.
CHRIS:
Let's go pick up my old man, grab something to eat.
I'm with you, buddy.
(FEELIN' ALRIGHT PLAYING)
- Here you go.
- Thanks, man.
See you tomorrow.
How you doing?
Okay.
- When did the mill close?
- Three years ago this August.
If you're looking for work, you may want to try Aberdeen.
That's about the closest mill work you'll find.
- Too bad.
- It's just simple economics.
You know, we have a really nice casino, the Wild Cherry.
Want to make some money, maybe you ought to go on down... and try your luck at the blackjack tables.
No, I don't think so.
Thanks.
You're Chris Vaughn?
Well, hell.
I know all about you, Chris.
I know your folks.
I'm Sheriff Stan Watkins.
- How you doing?
- Ralston, get out of the car!
You're looking at a real soldier here.
Pay some respects.
- Welcome home, soldier.
- Thanks.
Well, hell, Chris.
- I'll give you a ride up to your folks'.
- No, I'm fine.
Thank you.
- I insist.
- I'll walk.
- It's my pleasure.
- It's okay.
I won't take no for an answer.
Get in the car.
- Did I scare you with that one?
- Little bit.
I scared him.
You were gone a while, huh?
Eight years.
Harstad was sheriff back then.
Aaron Harstad, yeah.
Sad story.
About five months back, he fell asleep at the wheel and hit a tree.
Car folded up like an accordion.
He was a good man.
A good man and a good sheriff.
All right.
- Thank you very much for the ride.
- Welcome home, Chris.
It's election month.
I'm your man.
Okay.
Say hey to your old man.
Let's go.
Can I help you?
Little brother.
You come over here and give me a hug.
- You look great.
- What is this?
I couldn't let you be the only one looking good in uniform.
Hey, Ma.
Chris is here.
- Whose tent?
- That's for Pete.
- Watch out, now.
- Chris.
- Look at you.
- Mom, how you doing?
How long's your leave?
How long do we have you?
For good.
I'm home.
- Really?
You're not kidding?
- No.
- Hey, Dad.
- Welcome back.
I wish you had told us exactly when you were coming.
I'd have cooked.
- This is fine, Mom.
- We love Chinese.
- No, this is great.
- So what are you going to do now?
I was planning to work at the mill, but you never mentioned it closed.
We didn't want to bother you when your father got laid off.
I got my business.
You saw the furniture outside.
And I substitute at the elementary school.
Michelle pitches in... we try to keep things simple.
Pete.
- This is your Uncle Chris.
- Hey, Pete.
Sit down.
Say hello.
Last time he saw you, you were barely walking.
- And now I'm camping.
- I said you could sleep on the couch.
It was Chris' room first.
Your tent's going to take on water.
I can show you how to rig it.
Doesn't look like it's going to rain to me, Colonel.
Sit down.
Eat something.
First of all, I was a sergeant.
I worked for a living.
A grunt.
- Did you ever smoke anybody?
- Pete!
Poppa's still got your gun locked up in the garage.
- Would you teach me how to shoot?
- I figured that'd be scrap metal by now.
No.
I'm still hoping you'll melt that thing down on your own.
- Sorry, Pete.
- Whatever.
- I'm out of here, Mom.
- Be back by 10:00.
- 10:30.
- 10:00.
Remind you of anyone?
Okay, it rained.
Happy?
No.
Why don't you crash on the floor?
Okay.
I'll crash on the floor.
You crash on the bed.
Keep you dry.
Did you really kill people?
- Ray-Ray.
- Hello, pudding.
- What's up, man?
- Good to see you, man.
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.
What is that?
- That's the Love Machine.
- Girls actually get in there?
- How you been?
- Good.
- Clean living?
- Please.
You want a beer?
No.
Believe it or not, I quit drinking.
I'd take a soda, though.
Okay.
Here.
Thanks, man.
Like that?
When you left town... it gave me the idea I should do something with my life, too.
So I went down to Seattle, got a guitar, and became all about music.
And then, pretty soon, I was about music and drugs... and pretty soon I was basically just about drugs... and ended up doing two years for B and E.
I'm sorry.
Look at me now, though, right?
I've been clean and sober 14 months.
Doing construction and renewing those supportive and healthy friendships... from my past.
Matter of fact, I talked to the bastards, told them you were back... and they asked me to politely remind you that it is Saturday.
- As in...
- As in, kick-off's in 20 minutes.
- Like old times.
- You guys still doing it.
We're still doing it.
- Playing ball?
- Absolutely.
Let's go, superstar!
- Just like the old days.
Go deep.
- Come on.
When did that happen?
Jay Hamilton Field.
His parents hadn't left him the mill for more than two minutes...
- before he shut it down.
- Why?
Heads up!
Because I opened my casino.
Still got a gun, huh, Jay?
Still got your reflexes.
What?
Did you get tired of being all that you could be?
- No.
I'm still all I can be.
- Really?
- I'll just have to see about that.
- Yeah.
- What brings you home?
- I just want to relax.
Catch my breath.
- You?
Relax?
- Yeah.
Not today.
I got it.
Let's go.
Come on!
Is that how it's going to be?
That's how it is.
- Full contact, huh?
- That's two-hand touch.
Too rough?
Sorry, ladies.
Pick up the outside!
- Fumble!
- Set!
How's that for touch?
- That was pretty, wasn't it?
- Want to go get your pads?
- That the best you got?
- What?
- Here, take a walk...
- And knock a long loose?
- Touchdown.
- First and your last.
- You want to go?
- Nobody's going.
We're not going to go.
You almost caught it.
- We stop them here, we win, right?
- Right, boys, last play.
- You know how I like winning.
- We need to put this to rest.
- I will take care of Ray.
- You two cross.
You stay in and block.
Booth?
Isolate on Vaughn.
- You two cross...
- Just give me the ball.
- Go low.
Left knee.
- All right, man.
You got it?
On the first hut.
Ready?
Break!
Be strong.
All right, Chris Vaughn.
Last chance.
- Black-nineteen!
Black!
- Watch the outside!
I'm open!
That's game.
Sorry about that.
Cool, man.
Nice game, ladies.
What the hell was that?
That was a great game, wasn't it?
Is that the bad one?
- Yeah, it was good.
- Hey, welcome home.
Good to be back.
See you around.
If you're not doing anything later on, want to come by the casino?
Introduce you to some nice girls.
Drinks are on me.
What do you say?
- See you tonight.
- Cool.
I'll see you later on.
Be good.
Hey, Sarge.
Good game.
Maybe next time.
Hold up.
Maybe next time I won't see you in the bleachers, smoking weed.
Welcome home, buddy.
I thought you had to be Native American to own a casino.
- Hamilton's one-sixteenth Blackfoot now.
- Put it on his application.
And what he slid under the table convinced the powers that be it was true.
- It's ours for the taking tonight.
- Let's pick some cherries, boys.
- Here we go.
- I'm feeling lucky.
Just so you guys know, I'm done after I triple my money.
That's what you said last time.
You wound up selling your body for bus fare.
He had to walk.
Nobody's going to have any problems finding this place.
It's the subtle attention to aesthetics that I find most impressive.
Blends in with the mountain so nicely.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
How you doing?
- See?
Not bad, huh?
- It's not bad.
A lot of pretty girls.
I'm getting chips.
Let's gamble.
We'll see you at the Shower Tower, okay?
Isn't it wonderful?
All your gambling needs under one great, big roof.
You got your ATM machines, tellers to cash your paycheck... and when you're here, you don't got to worry about things... like child support, rent, laws of mathematical probability.
Gentlemen, Mr. Hamilton would like to invite you to the VIP lounge.
- The dream team.
You all healed up?
- Nice place.
Welcome to my world.
Tonight all the drinks are on the house.
If you need a line of credit, say how much.
If you need a little female companionship, done.
All right?
- Get inside.
Have a good time.
- Where you going?
Don't you worry about me.
I got a few things to do.
Enjoy.
Just remember, nothing in here is free.
Ma'am.
- Cherry shot?
- Ray, be nice.
Come on, this place is nothing but fake boobs... and real assholes, if you ask me.
Just water for me.
Drink up.
We got money to win and girls just waiting.
- We are VIPs.
- Here's to you, Chris.
- Welcome home.
- Cheers.
Let's play, boys.
Go right ahead.
Already lost $1...
Good night.
Okay.
Don't say we never did nothing for you.
Don't worry, buddy, everybody's scared their first time.
- Come on.
- Get in there, Chris.
Okay, just sit back and enjoy it.
- This'll get you started.
- Lf you're not back by morning... we'll send a search party.
- Have fun.
- Stop drinking.
You from here, or are you just visiting?
A little of both.
I grew up here.
So you're seeing all the old faces.
You could say that.
Your voice sounds very familiar.
Chris.
Deni.
- Look who's back.
- So, good surprise?
I told you it was better than gambling.
You met Candi?
- Hello.
- Hey, Candi.
Let's go.
Six, easy six.
Looking for a six to win.
We can do a six.
Can we do a six?
I think I can do a six, right?
We got liftoff!
Whack it, boys.
Whack it.
Blue or pink, what do you think?
Who's up for two out of three?
I'm getting killed.
Let me have a C-note to put $200 on a bet.
- No.
- Come on.
Hell, no.
Look at them.
He's hot.
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Give me a hard six.
- $5, hard six?
- Yes.
- I'm in.
- Hard six. $5 on hard six.
There's another $100.
Boom.
Give me some dice.
Looking for a six.
All right.
Oh, please.
Please.
Thank you.
And you.
- Jimmy, don't roll.
Give me the dice.
- No, I got it.
Hard six, six.
Looking for a six.
Seven out.
Line in, the dark side wins.
Last come'll get you some.
- You're good.
But I saw it.
- Saw what?
I saw the switch.
This is a clean game, asshole.
Let's see about that.
Bet you'll roll a seven.
It's not your roll, sir.
Sir, it's not your roll.
Will you call security?
Put your bets down on the passline.
- These dice are coming up seven.
- Why don't we just let it go?
No.
We're going to let it ride, Jimmy.
The dice are coming up seven.
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Come on, baby.
- What a surprise.
- No, folks.
No payouts.
- Wait a minute.
- Calm down.
Just take care of that bet, then we're even.
I would, but it wasn't a legitimate bet.
You're not the shooter.
- Security.
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Is there a problem?
- The problem is your dice are loaded.
Does your boss know about this?
Just give me my money.
Come on.
Let's go.
What now, bitch?
Come on!
Special Forces.
Wow.
I'll take that.
What are you doing?
Special Forces.
Special treatment.
This guy knows Hamilton.
You just hold him down.
Come on, Burke.
Folks.
He's pretty banged up, inside and out.
Whoever did this left him for dead.
A lesser man wouldn't have survived.
- I need a statement from him, Doctor.
- He's in no condition to give you one...
I'll also need a copy of your write-up, with toxicology...
- and blood-alcohol level.
- What are you talking about?
I'm just trying to get some facts.
You need to be arresting whoever tried to kill my brother, not testing his blood.
I'm just doing my job, Michelle.
Okay?
I understand how you feel.
But we still don't know who started all this.
- It wasn't Chris.
- Just find out who did this to him, Stan.
I'll do my best, Mr. Vaughn.
I really will.
In the meantime I have to file a full report.
Will you let me know when I can talk to him?
Thank you.
- He's going to be fine, Michelle.
- Thanks.
- Beautiful flowers.
- Thank you.
They're for my best friend.
Hey, Sarge.
So much for our VIP status.
Don't they teach you any basic fighting skills in the Army?
How did you do?
Not good.
But I tell you, that guy was feeling me this morning.
- You okay?
- That was a hell of a homecoming party.
Chris, I don't know if you noticed, but this ain't exactly home anymore.
Hang on.
Let me help you.
Come on.
I'm good, Mom.
I got it.
- Need some help?
- No.
I'm just milking it.
There's some old crutches in the garage.
- Thanks, Pete.
- Crutches.
That's nice.
Did you see the hole?
- Mind if I watch TV?
- No, that's cool.
- Somebody's feeling better.
- Little bit.
You make this?
Need anything?
- Something wrong?
- No, it's good, man.
It's good.
No, I'm good, Dad.
Thanks.
- Changed the plugs a while back.
- I appreciate that, Dad.
I might've had serious issues with your career choice... but it just didn't seem fair to take it out on an innocent truck.
Where you headed?
I was going into town to get supplies.
Want to come?
Let's go.
Your whole life, all you wanted to do was get out of here.
What made you come back now?
You're going to think I'm crazy.
I would think about the mill.
When I was a kid going to visit you at work, the smell of that fresh-cut cedar...
You remember that smell.
I remember a lot of nice things before the mill closed.
When did they go out of business?
Closed about six months ago.
There's a Home Depot about 15 minutes up the road.
And that?
Don't ask.
First of all, I just want to say thanks.
- For what?
- For making that stickman.
He's been fired and his gaming permit's been pulled.
I just have no idea why my security cameras didn't catch that.
They miss a lot in your place, don't they, Jay?
- Look, Chris, I hate seeing you like this.
- Your boys did it.
Wait a second.
So they got a little rough.
They're a bit edgy.
Understandably.
You don't know what kind of assholes they have to put up with on a daily basis.
Look, they've been reprimanded.
But they say you went nuts, man.
I'm sorry.
Insensitive.
I know the proper term that vets use is post-traumatic stress...
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Whatever.
You tore my place apart... and it wasn't easy to get my guys to agree not to press charges.
Chris, if you had a problem, shouldn't you have come to me?
I want to bring you inside.
I want to make you head of security.
- What do you say?
- No.
I guess you probably need time to think about it.
I figured as much.
This is for you.
It's a little something to help you get, you know...
Come on, man, don't be like that.
I came all the way out here to your house, just to see you get back on your feet.
I'm going to the sheriff.
I'm really sorry you feel that way.
I'll see you around, Chris.
I know, it was a good time, wasn't it?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I got to call you back.
Hey, Chris.
It's good to see you up and about.
You're looking spiffy.
I'm here to press charges.
This isn't about that incident at the casino a while back?
Yeah.
It is.
Because that matter's closed.
You're lucky you weren't brought in on charges.
I mean...
Did you even look into it?
They did an internal investigation.
That's good enough for me.
An internal investigation?
I know you're familiar with the term no-fly zone.
Because that's what the casino is.
Since the mill closed down... that casino is the main source of revenue in this town.
So case closed, basically.
We'll see you.
- I'm not going to let this stand.
- Excuse me?
- What did you say to me?
- I said I'm not going to let this stand.
You're lucky to be alive right now.
That's all you need to be concentrating on.
This is my town.
Okay?
I'm the sheriff here.
I'll tell you what will stand.
Not the other way around.
Now please get out of my building.
- Come in.
- Thanks.
This belongs to you.
I appreciate that.
I thought this was history.
- Could have left it in the trash, but I...
- Deni?
- Nice to see you, dear.
- Hi, Mrs. Vaughn.
Can I talk to you outside for a second?
Quick walk.
Mom, I'll be right back.
- How you been?
- Been better.
Talk to the sheriff yet?
I went down to the police station.
I talked to somebody with a badge.
He sure as hell didn't seem like much of a sheriff.
He's up for reelection, you know.
- Maybe you could take his job.
- Somebody ought to.
How about you?
Nothing but sunshine and pine trees.
Been reading these books.
Teach you how to cultivate your happiness.
Focus on the future.
- Go with the flow, that sort of thing.
- Is it working?
I have my moments.
So, the casino, huh?
Yeah.
Been there almost a year.
- Treating you good?
- A lot better than it treated you.
I like that.
Jay Hamilton's done well for himself, hasn't he?
He's a real go-getter, that one.
He must be.
I heard he got you.
That lasted about eight minutes.
It was a long time ago.
You still work for him, though.
Rent's got to be paid, Chris.
I suppose so.
- Hope to see you around.
- Do you?
Thanks for the jacket.
And where is he?
It's okay, Mom.
He's stabilized.
It was close.
Crystal meth.
I'm sorry.
I never did it before.
It's true.
We might've kind of pushed him into it.
- Where'd you get the drugs?
- I'm not really sure...
Stop.
Where?
From the security guys working at the casino.
Chris, wait.
Call the police.
No.
It won't do any good.
- Is Pete okay?
- He'll be fine.
What are you doing?
No, Chris.
Not like this.
Listen to me.
If you go out of here with that gun, they're going to nail...
I've been looking for you.
Guess that changes our relationship a bit, huh?
You should not have come looking for trouble.
Keep your hands up.
Get out of the vehicle now, Chris.
Now!
- Step back, please.
- Just move toward the front of the car.
Put your hands on the hood.
I advise you to give this offer more than a little serious thought.
If you go to trial, you stand to do 18 years.
Now, this is a sweetheart plea.
Normally they wouldn't even put it on the table... but your military record can't be ignored.
Three months home arrest, some community service...
- pretty generous offer, Chris.
- But I'd have to plead guilty.
Look at it from the other side.
There's over a dozen witnesses, none of whom will paint a flattering picture.
- He started busting up the machines.
- There was a gunshot.
- He just went crazy.
- A complete psychopath.
They're only offering me this deal just to keep me quiet.
I still say you should take it.
I wasn't wrong.
And I won't say I was.
Our job is to keep order.
There was no chance of that once he came in.
Me and my men, we were just trying to control him.
He's highly trained, violent.
A very dangerous person.
So violent, so dangerous, so highly trained... that he dispatched six of the casino security staff single-handedly.
Six men, single-handedly.
His weapon of choice, a simple piece of cedar... which, in his hands, became a devastating force with one aim:
To hurt people and destroy property.
He went directly for everything.
He just came in and took over the place.
- You said he broke your arm.
- Yeah, that's correct.
My right forearm.
Both bones with a single shot.
It was crazy.
Toss a couple of drunks now and then.
Guys try to grope the girls.
But nothing with this sort of violence.
Did he give you any kind of advance warning... a chance to defend yourself?
We tussled, but he's a big guy.
He was on a mission.
Besides, he seemed to be too busy enjoying himself from what I could see.
So from what you saw, he seemed to have some kind of purpose?
He had a point to prove.
I was emptying machines when he came in and started swinging.
- I was trying to get out of there.
- He was a menace.
- A very dangerous person.
- Military-trained.
He seemed like a complete psychopath.
- Nothing close to this.
- I didn't know what he'd do.
- I was frightened.
- He came for us.
- No doubt in your mind?
- No doubt.
I have no further questions.
Mr. Crowe, you may present your client's case.
You're fired.
Your Honor, I'd like to plead my own case.
Order!
If you choose to represent yourself, and not be represented by legal counsel... you realize that you can't then claim a mistrial on that basis?
- Yes, I do.
- Very well, Mr. Vaughn.
I don't deny anything that was said here today.
Does that mean you're changing your plea to guilty?
I'm not guilty of anything... except standing up for myself when the law wouldn't.
Objection.
He's trying to introduce prior events.
Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, stay on point.
I grew up in this town.
People used to walk tall in this town.
They wouldn't have traded the mill for a crooked casino.
We're not here to listen to civic speeches...
And they wouldn't have stood around while drugs were sold to kids.
- Objection!
- Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, you're close to being held in contempt.
I was justified in what I did.
And if you acquit me of these charges, then I'm gonna run for sheriff.
- Mr. Vaughn.
- And if elected, I'm gonna fix this town.
Order.
Please take your seat.
Mr. Vaughn, you are now charged with contempt.
And I will make sure that this...
- Objection.
- Sustained.
...never happens to anyone again without punishing those who did it.
I'm ordering the jury to ignore what they've just seen.
Mr. Vaughn, take your seat.
Order.
Or you're all charged with contempt!
Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
Defendant, please rise.
We find the defendant, Chris Vaughn, not guilty.
This is mine.
Sheriff Vaughn!
You won the election.
Congratulations.
But we do have a tradition of professional courtesy up here.
And I can personally vouch for each and every one of these men.
They're good deputies.
You're all fired.
- Hey, Chris.
- License and registration, please.
You're joking, right?
License and registration.
What's the problem, Sheriff?
You.
And the drugs you're peddling out of your casino.
The only thing that's going on in my casino is construction.
You took care of that.
That's right.
And I plan on taking care of everything else, too.
If you can, try to think this through:
A casino is a license to print money.
Why would I jeopardize that by selling drugs?
Because you owned the town, Jay.
That's changed now.
Really?
The only thing I think has changed around here... is that you get to wake up every morning and put on that nifty little badge.
But underneath it is the same guy who couldn't make it playing college football... and apparently couldn't make it in the Army... and not really ever gonna make it as a cop.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
And if you push too hard, you're going to be a man who never gets to see 40.
License, please.
Thanks, Sheriff.
Sir, get your taillights fixed.
It's your last warning.
What's wrong with my taillights?
They're broken.
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning, Deputy.
No.
Come on, man.
You know I hate cops.
You've been sheriff for about two minutes, and I'm already starting to hate you.
- I'm a convicted felon.
- I've got pull around here.
Now you're a crooked cop doing favors for friends.
That's how it starts.
Next thing you know you'll be taking bribes, setting up roadblocks...
- frisking dudes' crotches.
- Are you done?
- Ray, I need your help.
- Don't do that.
I need you to take me to drug school.
I get to wear a uniform?
The stuff in this town is five-star, factory pure.
- So let's go get the factory.
- Easier said than done.
We know Hamilton's boys are selling that shit down at the casino.
Yeah, but 99% of the time they're clean.
So we got to play follow-the-money, starting with the tweakers.
That'll give us the suppliers.
These guys are real edgy, so delicacy is the key.
Then we put the squeeze on them... till they spit out the location of the next buy.
- Where'd you learn that, Ray?
- Cops.
That's a good show.
Phase three:
We strike.
- I thought you said delicacy was the key.
- That's right.
Delicacy and precision.
- Hey, what's up?
- Get out of here.
- You're sure you're not carrying anything?
- I don't have shit.
- Officer.
- Yeah.
Search him.
This is going to be a switch.
Spread your legs.
Arms down.
You been working out?
Nothing there.
Somebody needs a bath.
Now you read me my rights, then you take me in... and I call my lawyer.
Okay.
But I have a hunch there may be something else in here.
Could be.
Go to it, Deputy.
Have a good time.
- He ain't talking.
- I know.
Handles pretty good.
He's clean.
Guess we got to go with Plan B.
Screw you both.
I do have a bit of information for you.
It's not just me, actually.
There's a whole lot of people in this one.
Spit it out.
You're gonna get hurt.
What an idiot.
Why does it always have to be your fight?
- You might need this.
- No.
- I put my guns down a long time ago.
- Come on.
You're just being stubborn.
You and me both, boy.
Chris, listen.
You be careful.
I will.
Please step away from the vehicle!
Mr. Booth, are you still upset over that body-cavity search?
I forgot, you got no vehicle.
Please disperse!
There is nothing to...
Can I talk to you?
- Sure.
- Over here?
I'm gonna stay here with him tonight.
I need you to look after my parents' place.
Think they're gonna take it that far?
- I'm with you, man.
I'll check in later.
- Okay.
A drive to right field.
It's dropping for a single.
You making house calls?
- Don't shoot.
- Hey.
How's the food around here?
Nice.
I brought you special treats:
Salad, fried chicken... potato salad.
- Do you have glasses?
- Yeah.
- Do you have to work tonight?
- I quit.
I figured you were making some changes around here...
I could make a few myself.
Salt and pepper?
- Who is that?
- Pete.
- Want something to eat?
- No.
I'm good, man.
I got to get a bigger bed.
No, you don't.
Do it.
I'm hungry.
We've got leftovers.
I want pancakes.
And eggs.
And bacon.
I told you, Vaughn.
Stay here.
Who needs to step away from the vehicle now, Vaughn?
Truck for a truck, baby!
That's right!
Truck for a truck!
Get down!
Tear it up, boys!
Pete, something's burning.
Take this.
Get in there.
Good morning, honey.
Get out of here.
Sheriff, are you home?
I told you someone was going to get hurt!
Come here.
When I say now, start shooting!
Over there!
Stay low.
Vaughn!
You got to get me out of here.
Move it.
Go!
Move it, old man.
- Where's Pete?
- I don't know.
Sit down.
- I know who you are.
- Oh, yeah?
- Burke?
- Son of a bitch.
Check it out.
Come on!
Get me out of here, man!
- What's it worth to you?
Where's the lab?
- Screw you!
Hamilton's operation is at the mill, okay?
Now get me out of here!
Drop it.
Stay down!
Stay down.
You okay?
Shit.
I thought I warned you, Chris.
I didn't want this to happen.
I'm going in!
Right there, punk!
Come on, Chris!
Come on!
Deni, now!
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Where is everybody?
- Pete ran outside.
You stabbed me with a potato peeler.
You gonna be okay?
Hey, Chris.
Get up, Jay.
Just a second.
Remember when we used to play hide-and-seek up here?
- That was my favorite sound.
- Get up!
Look, Chris...
You want to know what my new favorite sound's gonna be?
The sound of you screaming like a little bitch.
Bet you wish you took that job offer now?
But, no!
You had to be Mr. Hero Boy!
You forgot this:
This is my town!
Yes!
You're nothing.
You're right, Jay.
This does change our relationship.
This is my town.
You're under arrest.
That ought to do it.
What are you doing?
Getting some souvenirs.
I'm gonna miss the place.
That's how it starts.
Next you'll be accepting bribes and setting speed traps all over town.
Cutting up trucks.
You know how you are.
Not to mention the cavity searches.
You're gonna like that.
Speaking of which, do you think Jay's got a casino in the pen?
- Could be.
- Running the Shower Tower with the fellas?
He's probably blowing on somebody's dice right now.
That's lunch.
Let's go pick up my old man, grab something to eat.
I'm with you, buddy.
- Here you go.
- Thanks, man.
See you tomorrow.
How you doing?
Okay.
- When did the mill close?
- Three years ago this August.
If you're looking for work, you may want to try Aberdeen.
That's about the closest mill work you'll find.
- Too bad.
- It's just simple economics.
You know, we have a really nice casino, the Wild Cherry.
Want to make some money, maybe you ought to go on down... and try your luck at the blackjack tables.
No, I don't think so.
Thanks.
You're Chris Vaughn?
Well, hell.
I know all about you, Chris.
I know your folks.
I'm Sheriff Stan Watkins.
- How you doing?
- Ralston, get out of the car!
You're looking at a real soldier here.
Pay some respects.
- Welcome home, soldier.
- Thanks.
Well, hell, Chris.
- I'll give you a ride up to your folks'.
- No, I'm fine.
Thank you.
- I insist.
- I'll walk.
- It's my pleasure.
- It's okay.
I won't take no for an answer.
Get in the car.
- Did I scare you with that one?
- Little bit.
I scared him.
You were gone a while, huh?
Eight years.
Harstad was sheriff back then.
Aaron Harstad, yeah.
Sad story.
About five months back, he fell asleep at the wheel and hit a tree.
Car folded up like an accordion.
He was a good man.
A good man and a good sheriff.
All right.
- Thank you very much for the ride.
- Welcome home, Chris.
It's election month.
I'm your man.
Okay.
Say hey to your old man.
Let's go.
Can I help you?
Little brother.
You come over here and give me a hug.
- You look great.
- What is this?
I couldn't let you be the only one looking good in uniform.
Hey, Ma.
Chris is here.
- Whose tent?
- That's for Pete.
- Watch out, now.
- Chris.
- Look at you.
- Mom, how you doing?
How long's your leave?
How long do we have you?
For good.
I'm home.
- Really?
You're not kidding?
- No.
- Hey, Dad.
- Welcome back.
I wish you had told us exactly when you were coming.
I'd have cooked.
- This is fine, Mom.
- We love Chinese.
- No, this is great.
- So what are you going to do now?
I was planning to work at the mill, but you never mentioned it closed.
We didn't want to bother you when your father got laid off.
I got my business.
You saw the furniture outside.
And I substitute at the elementary school.
Michelle pitches in... we try to keep things simple.
Pete.
- This is your Uncle Chris.
- Hey, Pete.
Sit down.
Say hello.
Last time he saw you, you were barely walking.
- And now I'm camping.
- I said you could sleep on the couch.
It was Chris' room first.
Your tent's going to take on water.
I can show you how to rig it.
Doesn't look like it's going to rain to me, Colonel.
Sit down.
Eat something.
First of all, I was a sergeant.
I worked for a living.
A grunt.
- Did you ever smoke anybody?
- Pete!
Poppa's still got your gun locked up in the garage.
- Would you teach me how to shoot?
- I figured that'd be scrap metal by now.
No.
I'm still hoping you'll melt that thing down on your own.
- Sorry, Pete.
- Whatever.
- I'm out of here, Mom.
- Be back by 10:00.
- 10:30.
- 10:00.
Remind you of anyone?
Okay, it rained.
Happy?
No.
Why don't you crash on the floor?
Okay.
I'll crash on the floor.
You crash on the bed.
Keep you dry.
Did you really kill people?
- Ray-Ray.
- Hello, pudding.
- What's up, man?
- Good to see you, man.
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.
What is that?
- That's the Love Machine.
- Girls actually get in there?
- How you been?
- Good.
- Clean living?
- Please.
You want a beer?
No.
Believe it or not, I quit drinking.
I'd take a soda, though.
Okay.
Here.
Thanks, man.
Like that?
When you left town... it gave me the idea I should do something with my life, too.
So I went down to Seattle, got a guitar, and became all about music.
And then, pretty soon, I was about music and drugs... and pretty soon I was basically just about drugs... and ended up doing two years for B and E.
I'm sorry.
Look at me now, though, right?
I've been clean and sober 14 months.
Doing construction and renewing those supportive and healthy friendships... from my past.
Matter of fact, I talked to the bastards, told them you were back... and they asked me to politely remind you that it is Saturday.
- As in...
- As in, kick-off's in 20 minutes.
- Like old times.
- You guys still doing it.
We're still doing it.
- Playing ball?
- Absolutely.
Let's go, superstar!
- Just like the old days.
Go deep.
- Come on.
When did that happen?
Jay Hamilton Field.
His parents hadn't left him the mill for more than two minutes...
- before he shut it down.
- Why?
Heads up!
Because I opened my casino.
Still got a gun, huh, Jay?
Still got your reflexes.
What?
Did you get tired of being all that you could be?
- No.
I'm still all I can be.
- Really?
- I'll just have to see about that.
- Yeah.
- What brings you home?
- I just want to relax.
Catch my breath.
- You?
Relax?
- Yeah.
Not today.
I got it.
Let's go.
Come on!
Is that how it's going to be?
That's how it is.
- Full contact, huh?
- That's two-hand touch.
Too rough?
Sorry, ladies.
Pick up the outside!
- Fumble!
- Set!
How's that for touch?
- That was pretty, wasn't it?
- Want to go get your pads?
- That the best you got?
- What?
- Here, take a walk...
- And knock a long loose?
- Touchdown.
- First and your last.
- You want to go?
- Nobody's going.
We're not going to go.
You almost caught it.
- We stop them here, we win, right?
- Right, boys, last play.
- You know how I like winning.
- We need to put this to rest.
- I will take care of Ray.
- You two cross.
You stay in and block.
Booth?
Isolate on Vaughn.
- You two cross...
- Just give me the ball.
- Go low.
Left knee.
- All right, man.
You got it?
On the first hut.
Ready?
Break!
Be strong.
All right, Chris Vaughn.
Last chance.
- Black-nineteen!
Black!
- Watch the outside!
I'm open!
That's game.
Sorry about that.
Cool, man.
Nice game, ladies.
What the hell was that?
That was a great game, wasn't it?
Is that the bad one?
- Yeah, it was good.
- Hey, welcome home.
Good to be back.
See you around.
If you're not doing anything later on, want to come by the casino?
Introduce you to some nice girls.
Drinks are on me.
What do you say?
- See you tonight.
- Cool.
I'll see you later on.
Be good.
Hey, Sarge.
Good game.
Maybe next time.
Hold up.
Maybe next time I won't see you in the bleachers, smoking weed.
Welcome home, buddy.
I thought you had to be Native American to own a casino.
- Hamilton's one-sixteenth Blackfoot now.
- Put it on his application.
And what he slid under the table convinced the powers that be it was true.
- It's ours for the taking tonight.
- Let's pick some cherries, boys.
- Here we go.
- I'm feeling lucky.
Just so you guys know, I'm done after I triple my money.
That's what you said last time.
You wound up selling your body for bus fare.
He had to walk.
Nobody's going to have any problems finding this place.
It's the subtle attention to aesthetics that I find most impressive.
Blends in with the mountain so nicely.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
How you doing?
- See?
Not bad, huh?
- It's not bad.
A lot of pretty girls.
I'm getting chips.
Let's gamble.
We'll see you at the Shower Tower, okay?
Isn't it wonderful?
All your gambling needs under one great, big roof.
You got your ATM machines, tellers to cash your paycheck... and when you're here, you don't got to worry about things... like child support, rent, laws of mathematical probability.
Gentlemen, Mr. Hamilton would like to invite you to the VIP lounge.
- The dream team.
You all healed up?
- Nice place.
Welcome to my world.
Tonight all the drinks are on the house.
If you need a line of credit, say how much.
If you need a little female companionship, done.
All right?
- Get inside.
Have a good time.
- Where you going?
Don't you worry about me.
I got a few things to do.
Enjoy.
Just remember, nothing in here is free.
Ma'am.
- Cherry shot?
- Ray, be nice.
Come on, this place is nothing but fake boobs... and real assholes, if you ask me.
Just water for me.
Drink up.
We got money to win and girls just waiting.
- We are VIPs.
- Here's to you, Chris.
- Welcome home.
- Cheers.
Let's play, boys.
Go right ahead.
Already lost $1...
Good night.
Okay.
Don't say we never did nothing for you.
Don't worry, buddy, everybody's scared their first time.
- Come on.
- Get in there, Chris.
Okay, just sit back and enjoy it.
- This'll get you started.
- lf you're not back by morning... we'll send a search party.
- Have fun.
- Stop drinking.
You from here, or are you just visiting?
A little of both.
I grew up here.
So you're seeing all the old faces.
You could say that.
Your voice sounds very familiar.
Chris.
Deni.
- Look who's back.
- So, good surprise?
I told you it was better than gambling.
You met Candi?
- Hello.
- Hey, Candi.
Let's go.
Six, easy six.
Looking for a six to win.
We can do a six.
Can we do a six?
I think I can do a six, right?
We got liftoff!
Whack it, boys.
Whack it.
Blue or pink, what do you think?
Who's up for two out of three?
I'm getting killed.
Let me have a C-note to put $200 on a bet.
- No.
- Come on.
Hell, no.
Look at them.
He's hot.
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Give me a hard six.
- $5, hard six?
- Yes.
- I'm in.
- Hard six. $5 on hard six.
There's another $100.
Boom.
Give me some dice.
Looking for a six.
All right.
Oh, please.
Please.
Thank you.
And you.
- Jimmy, don't roll.
Give me the dice.
- No, I got it.
Hard six, six.
Looking for a six.
Seven out.
Line in, the dark side wins.
Last come'll get you some.
- You're good.
But I saw it.
- Saw what?
I saw the switch.
This is a clean game, asshole.
Let's see about that.
Bet you'll roll a seven.
It's not your roll, sir.
Sir, it's not your roll.
Will you call security?
Put your bets down on the passline.
- These dice are coming up seven.
- Why don't we just let it go?
No.
We're going to let it ride, Jimmy.
The dice are coming up seven.
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Come on, baby.
- What a surprise.
- No, folks.
No payouts.
- Wait a minute.
- Calm down.
Just take care of that bet, then we're even.
I would, but it wasn't a legitimate bet.
You're not the shooter.
- Security.
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Is there a problem?
- The problem is your dice are loaded.
Does your boss know about this?
Just give me my money.
Come on.
Let's go.
What now, bitch?
Come on!
Special Forces.
Wow.
I'll take that.
What are you doing?
Special Forces.
Special treatment.
This guy knows Hamilton.
You just hold him down.
Come on, Burke.
Folks.
He's pretty banged up, inside and out.
Whoever did this left him for dead.
A lesser man wouldn't have survived.
- I need a statement from him, Doctor.
- He's in no condition to give you one...
I'll also need a copy of your write-up, with toxicology...
- and blood-alcohol level.
- What are you talking about?
I'm just trying to get some facts.
You need to be arresting whoever tried to kill my brother, not testing his blood.
I'm just doing my job, Michelle.
Okay?
I understand how you feel.
But we still don't know who started all this.
- It wasn't Chris.
- Just find out who did this to him, Stan.
I'll do my best, Mr. Vaughn.
I really will.
In the meantime I have to file a full report.
Will you let me know when I can talk to him?
Thank you.
- He's going to be fine, Michelle.
- Thanks.
- Beautiful flowers.
- Thank you.
They're for my best friend.
Hey, Sarge.
So much for our VIP status.
Don't they teach you any basic fighting skills in the Army?
How did you do?
Not good.
But I tell you, that guy was feeling me this morning.
- You okay?
- That was a hell of a homecoming party.
Chris, I don't know if you noticed, but this ain't exactly home anymore.
Hang on.
Let me help you.
Come on.
I'm good, Mom.
I got it.
- Need some help?
- No.
I'm just milking it.
There's some old crutches in the garage.
- Thanks, Pete.
- Crutches.
That's nice.
Did you see the hole?
- Mind if I watch TV?
- No, that's cool.
- Somebody's feeling better.
- Little bit.
You make this?
Need anything?
- Something wrong?
- No, it's good, man.
It's good.
No, I'm good, Dad.
Thanks.
- Changed the plugs a while back.
- I appreciate that, Dad.
I might've had serious issues with your career choice... but it just didn't seem fair to take it out on an innocent truck.
Where you headed?
I was going into town to get supplies.
Want to come?
Let's go.
Your whole life, all you wanted to do was get out of here.
What made you come back now?
You're going to think I'm crazy.
I would think about the mill.
When I was a kid going to visit you at work, the smell of that fresh-cut cedar...
You remember that smell.
I remember a lot of nice things before the mill closed.
When did they go out of business?
Closed about six months ago.
There's a Home Depot about 15 minutes up the road.
And that?
Don't ask.
First of all, I just want to say thanks.
- For what?
- For making that stickman.
He's been fired and his gaming permit's been pulled.
I just have no idea why my security cameras didn't catch that.
They miss a lot in your place, don't they, Jay?
- Look, Chris, I hate seeing you like this.
- Your boys did it.
Wait a second.
So they got a little rough.
They're a bit edgy.
Understandably.
You don't know what kind of assholes they have to put up with on a daily basis.
Look, they've been reprimanded.
But they say you went nuts, man.
I'm sorry.
Insensitive.
I know the proper term that vets use is post-traumatic stress...
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Whatever.
You tore my place apart... and it wasn't easy to get my guys to agree not to press charges.
Chris, if you had a problem, shouldn't you have come to me?
I want to bring you inside.
I want to make you head of security.
- What do you say?
- No.
I guess you probably need time to think about it.
I figured as much.
This is for you.
It's a little something to help you get, you know...
Come on, man, don't be like that.
I came all the way out here to your house, just to see you get back on your feet.
I'm going to the sheriff.
I'm really sorry you feel that way.
I'll see you around, Chris.
I know, it was a good time, wasn't it?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I got to call you back.
Hey, Chris.
It's good to see you up and about.
You're looking spiffy.
I'm here to press charges.
This isn't about that incident at the casino a while back?
Yeah.
It is.
Because that matter's closed.
You're lucky you weren't brought in on charges.
I mean...
Did you even look into it?
They did an internal investigation.
That's good enough for me.
An internal investigation?
I know you're familiar with the term no-fly zone.
Because that's what the casino is.
Since the mill closed down... that casino is the main source of revenue in this town.
So case closed, basically.
We'll see you.
- I'm not going to let this stand.
- Excuse me?
- What did you say to me?
- I said I'm not going to let this stand.
You're lucky to be alive right now.
That's all you need to be concentrating on.
This is my town.
Okay?
I'm the sheriff here.
I'll tell you what will stand.
Not the other way around.
Now please get out of my building.
- Come in.
- Thanks.
This belongs to you.
I appreciate that.
I thought this was history.
- Could have left it in the trash, but I...
- Deni?
- Nice to see you, dear.
- Hi, Mrs. Vaughn.
Can I talk to you outside for a second?
Quick walk.
Mom, I'll be right back.
- How you been?
- Been better.
Talk to the sheriff yet?
I went down to the police station.
I talked to somebody with a badge.
He sure as hell didn't seem like much of a sheriff.
He's up for reelection, you know.
- Maybe you could take his job.
- Somebody ought to.
How about you?
Nothing but sunshine and pine trees.
Been reading these books.
Teach you how to cultivate your happiness.
Focus on the future.
- Go with the flow, that sort of thing.
- Is it working?
I have my moments.
So, the casino, huh?
Yeah.
Been there almost a year.
- Treating you good?
- A lot better than it treated you.
I like that.
Jay Hamilton's done well for himself, hasn't he?
He's a real go-getter, that one.
He must be.
I heard he got you.
That lasted about eight minutes.
It was a long time ago.
You still work for him, though.
Rent's got to be paid, Chris.
I suppose so.
- Hope to see you around.
- Do you?
Thanks for the jacket.
And where is he?
It's okay, Mom.
He's stabilized.
It was close.
Crystal meth.
I'm sorry.
I never did it before.
It's true.
We might've kind of pushed him into it.
- Where'd you get the drugs?
- I'm not really sure...
Stop.
Where?
From the security guys working at the casino.
Chris, wait.
Call the police.
No.
It won't do any good.
- Is Pete okay?
- He'll be fine.
What are you doing?
No, Chris.
Not like this.
Listen to me.
If you go out of here with that gun, they're going to nail...
I've been looking for you.
Guess that changes our relationship a bit, huh?
You should not have come looking for trouble.
Keep your hands up.
Get out of the vehicle now, Chris.
Now!
- Step back, please.
- Just move toward the front of the car.
Put your hands on the hood.
I advise you to give this offer more than a little serious thought.
If you go to trial, you stand to do 18 years.
Now, this is a sweetheart plea.
Normally they wouldn't even put it on the table... but your military record can't be ignored.
Three months home arrest, some community service...
- pretty generous offer, Chris.
- But I'd have to plead guilty.
Look at it from the other side.
There's over a dozen witnesses, none of whom will paint a flattering picture.
- He started busting up the machines.
- There was a gunshot.
- He just went crazy.
- A complete psychopath.
They're only offering me this deal just to keep me quiet.
I still say you should take it.
I wasn't wrong.
And I won't say I was.
Our job is to keep order.
There was no chance of that once he came in.
Me and my men, we were just trying to control him.
He's highly trained, violent.
A very dangerous person.
So violent, so dangerous, so highly trained... that he dispatched six of the casino security staff single-handedly.
Six men, single-handedly.
His weapon of choice, a simple piece of cedar... which, in his hands, became a devastating force with one aim:
To hurt people and destroy property.
He went directly for everything.
He just came in and took over the place.
- You said he broke your arm.
- Yeah, that's correct.
My right forearm.
Both bones with a single shot.
It was crazy.
Toss a couple of drunks now and then.
Guys try to grope the girls.
But nothing with this sort of violence.
Did he give you any kind of advance warning... a chance to defend yourself?
We tussled, but he's a big guy.
He was on a mission.
Besides, he seemed to be too busy enjoying himself from what I could see.
So from what you saw, he seemed to have some kind of purpose?
He had a point to prove.
I was emptying machines when he came in and started swinging.
- I was trying to get out of there.
- He was a menace.
- A very dangerous person.
- Military-trained.
He seemed like a complete psychopath.
- Nothing close to this.
- I didn't know what he'd do.
- I was frightened.
- He came for us.
- No doubt in your mind?
- No doubt.
I have no further questions.
Mr. Crowe, you may present your client's case.
You're fired.
Your Honor, I'd like to plead my own case.
Order!
If you choose to represent yourself, and not be represented by legal counsel... you realize that you can't then claim a mistrial on that basis?
- Yes, I do.
- Very well, Mr. Vaughn.
I don't deny anything that was said here today.
Does that mean you're changing your plea to guilty?
I'm not guilty of anything... except standing up for myself when the law wouldn't.
Objection.
He's trying to introduce prior events.
Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, stay on point.
I grew up in this town.
People used to walk tall in this town.
They wouldn't have traded the mill for a crooked casino.
We're not here to listen to civic speeches...
And they wouldn't have stood around while drugs were sold to kids.
- Objection!
- Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, you're close to being held in contempt.
I was justified in what I did.
And if you acquit me of these charges, then I'm gonna run for sheriff.
- Mr. Vaughn.
- And if elected, I'm gonna fix this town.
Order.
Please take your seat.
Mr. Vaughn, you are now charged with contempt.
And I will make sure that this...
- Objection.
- Sustained.
...never happens to anyone again without punishing those who did it.
I'm ordering the jury to ignore what they've just seen.
Mr. Vaughn, take your seat.
Order.
Or you're all charged with contempt!
Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
Defendant, please rise.
We find the defendant, Chris Vaughn, not guilty.
This is mine.
Sheriff Vaughn!
You won the election.
Congratulations.
But we do have a tradition of professional courtesy up here.
And I can personally vouch for each and every one of these men.
They're good deputies.
You're all fired.
- Hey, Chris.
- License and registration, please.
You're joking, right?
License and registration.
What's the problem, Sheriff?
You.
And the drugs you're peddling out of your casino.
The only thing that's going on in my casino is construction.
You took care of that.
That's right.
And I plan on taking care of everything else, too.
If you can, try to think this through:
A casino is a license to print money.
Why would I jeopardize that by selling drugs?
Because you owned the town, Jay.
That's changed now.
Really?
The only thing I think has changed around here... is that you get to wake up every morning and put on that nifty little badge.
But underneath it is the same guy who couldn't make it playing college football... and apparently couldn't make it in the Army... and not really ever gonna make it as a cop.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
And if you push too hard, you're going to be a man who never gets to see 40.
License, please.
Thanks, Sheriff.
Sir, get your taillights fixed.
It's your last warning.
What's wrong with my taillights?
They're broken.
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning, Deputy.
No.
Come on, man.
You know I hate cops.
You've been sheriff for about two minutes, and I'm already starting to hate you.
- I'm a convicted felon.
- I've got pull around here.
Now you're a crooked cop doing favors for friends.
That's how it starts.
Next thing you know you'll be taking bribes, setting up roadblocks...
- frisking dudes' crotches.
- Are you done?
- Ray, I need your help.
- Don't do that.
I need you to take me to drug school.
I get to wear a uniform?
The stuff in this town is five-star, factory pure.
- So let's go get the factory.
- Easier said than done.
We know Hamilton's boys are selling that shit down at the casino.
Yeah, but 99% of the time they're clean.
So we got to play follow-the-money, starting with the tweakers.
That'll give us the suppliers.
These guys are real edgy, so delicacy is the key.
Then we put the squeeze on them... till they spit out the location of the next buy.
- Where'd you learn that, Ray?
- Cops.
That's a good show.
Phase three: we strike.
- I thought you said delicacy was the key.
- That's right.
Delicacy and precision.
- Hey, what's up?
- Get out of here.
- You're sure you're not carrying anything?
- I don't have shit.
- Officer.
- Yeah.
Search him.
This is going to be a switch.
Spread your legs.
Arms down.
You been working out?
Nothing there.
Somebody needs a bath.
Now you read me my rights, then you take me in... and I call my lawyer.
Okay.
But I have a hunch there may be something else in here.
Could be.
Go to it, Deputy.
Have a good time.
- He ain't talking.
- I know.
Handles pretty good.
He's clean.
Guess we got to go with Plan B.
Screw you both.
I do have a bit of information for you.
It's not just me, actually.
There's a whole lot of people in this one.
Spit it out.
You're gonna get hurt.
What an idiot.
Why does it always have to be your fight?
- You might need this.
- No.
- I put my guns down a long time ago.
- Come on.
You're just being stubborn.
You and me both, boy.
Chris, listen.
You be careful.
I will.
Please step away from the vehicle!
Mr. Booth, are you still upset over that body-cavity search?
I forgot, you got no vehicle.
Please disperse!
There is nothing to...
Can I talk to you?
- Sure.
- Over here?
I'm gonna stay here with him tonight.
I need you to look after my parents' place.
Think they're gonna take it that far?
- I'm with you, man.
I'll check in later.
- Okay.
A drive to right field.
It's dropping for a single.
You making house calls?
- Don't shoot.
- Hey.
How's the food around here?
Nice.
I brought you special treats:
Salad, fried chicken... potato salad.
- Do you have glasses?
- Yeah.
- Do you have to work tonight?
- I quit.
I figured you were making some changes around here...
I could make a few myself.
Salt and pepper?
- Who is that?
- Pete.
- Want something to eat?
- No.
I'm good, man.
I got to get a bigger bed.
No, you don't.
Do it.
I'm hungry.
We've got leftovers.
I want pancakes.
And eggs.
And bacon.
I told you, Vaughn.
Stay here.
Who needs to step away from the vehicle now, Vaughn?
Truck for a truck, baby!
That's right!
Truck for a truck!
Get down!
Tear it up, boys!
Pete, something's burning.
Take this.
Get in there.
Good morning, honey.
Get out of here.
Sheriff, are you home?
I told you someone was going to get hurt!
Come here.
When I say now, start shooting!
Over there!
Stay low.
Vaughn!
You got to get me out of here.
Move it.
Go!
Move it, old man.
- Where's Pete?
- I don't know.
Sit down.
- I know who you are.
- Oh, yeah?
- Burke?
- Son of a bitch.
Check it out.
Come on!
Get me out of here, man!
- What's it worth to you?
Where's the lab?
- Screw you!
Hamilton's operation is at the mill, okay?
Now get me out of here!
Drop it.
Stay down!
Stay down.
You okay?
Shit.
I thought I warned you, Chris.
I didn't want this to happen.
I'm going in!
Right there, punk!
Come on, Chris!
Come on!
Deni, now!
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Where is everybody?
- Pete ran outside.
You stabbed me with a potato peeler.
You gonna be okay?
Hey, Chris.
Get up, Jay.
Just a second.
Remember when we used to play hide-and-seek up here?
- That was my favorite sound.
- Get up!
Look, Chris...
You want to know what my new favorite sound's gonna be?
The sound of you screaming like a little bitch.
Bet you wish you took that job offer now?
But, no!
You had to be Mr. Hero Boy!
You forgot this: this is my town!
Yes!
You're nothing.
You're right, Jay.
This does change our relationship.
This is my town.
You're under arrest.
That ought to do it.
What are you doing?
Getting some souvenirs.
I'm gonna miss the place.
That's how it starts.
Next you'll be accepting bribes and setting speed traps all over town.
Cutting up trucks.
You know how you are.
Not to mention the cavity searches.
You're gonna like that.
Speaking of which, do you think Jay's got a casino in the pen?
- Could be.
- Running the Shower Tower with the fellas?
He's probably blowing on somebody's dice right now.
That's lunch.
Let's go pick up my old man, grab something to eat.
I'm with you, buddy.
I got to run to keep from hiding"
And I'm bound to keep on ridin"
I've got one more silver dollar
But I'm not gonna let "em catch me, no
Not gonna let "em catch the Midnight Rider
I don't own the clothes I'm wearin"
And the road goes on forever
I got one more silver dollar
But I'm not gonna let "em catch me, no
Not gonna let "em catch the Midnight Rider
No, I'm not gonna let "em catch me, no
Not gonna let "em catch the Midnight Rider
No, no, no, no
- There you go, Rox.
- Thanks, Ben.
See you tomorrow.
How you doin'?
OK.
- When did the mill close?
- Three years ago this August.
If you're looking for work, try Aberdeen.
That's the closest mill.
- That's too bad.
- It's simple economics.
We have a really nice casino here, the Wild Cherry.
You wanna make some money, try your luck at the blackjack tables.
I don't think so.
Thanks.
You're Chris Vaughn?
Well, hell!
I know all about you, Chris.
I know your folks.
I'm Sheriff Stan Watkins.
- How you doin'?
- Ralston, get out of the car.
He's a real soldier.
Pay some respects.
- Welcome home, soldier.
- Thanks.
- Here.
I'll give you a ride to your folks.
- No, I'm fine, thank you.
- I insist.
- I'll walk.
It's my pleasure.
I won't take no for an answer.
Hey!
Get in the car.
- Did I scare you with that one?
- A little bit.
I scared him!
- You were gone a while, huh?
- Eight years.
- Harstad was sheriff back then.
- Aaron Harstad, yeah.
Sad story.
About five months back, he fell asleep at the wheel and... hit a tree.
Car folded up like an accordion.
He was a good man.
A good man and a good sheriff.
All right.
- Thank you for the ride.
- Welcome home.
Hey, Chris?
It's election month.
I'm your man, huh?
Good.
Say hey to your old man.
Can I help you?
Little brother!
You come over here and give me a hug.
You look great.
- What is this?
- Not only you can look good in a uniform.
Hey, Ma!
Chris is here!
- Whose tent?
- It's for Pete.
- Watch out, man.
- You're weak.
- Look at you!
- Mom.
How you doin'?
- How long is your leave?
- For good.
I'm home.
- Really?
You're not kidding?
- No.
- Hey, Dad.
- Welcome back.
I wish you had told us exactly when you were coming.
I'd have cooked.
- No, this is great.
- What'll you do now that you're home?
I planned to work at the mill.
You never wrote it was closed.
Not to worry you when your dad got laid off.
- I got my business.
The furniture.
- I substitute at the elementary school.
Michelle pitches in.
We try to keep things simple.
Pete!
This is your Uncle Chris.
- Hey, Pete.
- Sit down.
Say hello.
- Last time he saw you, you couldn't walk.
- Now I'm camping.
I said you could sleep on the couch.
It was Chris's room first.
- Your tent will leak.
I could fix it.
- Doesn't look like rain, Colonel.
Pete!
Sit down, have something to eat.
- I was a sergeant.
I worked for a living.
- Oh, a grunt.
- Did you ever smoke anybody?
- Pete!
Poppie still has your gun locked up in the garage.
Can you teach me how to shoot?
- I figured that'd be scrap metal by now.
- No.
I'm still hoping you'll melt it down.
- Sorry, Pete.
- Whatever.
- I'm outta here, Mom.
- Hey.
Be back by ten.
- Ten thirty.
- Ten!
Remind you of anyone?
OK, it rained.
Happy?
No.
Why don't you crash on the floor?
OK.
I'll crash on the floor.
You crash on the bed.
Uh-uh.
Pete.
Keep you dry.
Did you really kill people?
It's been three long years
Do you still want me?
If I don't see a yellow...
- Ray-Ray!
- Hello, puddin'!
- What's up, man?
- Good to see you, man.
- How you doin'?
- I'm all right.
- What is that?
- That's the Love Machine.
Girls actually get in there?
- How you been?
- Good.
- Clean livin'.
- Please.
Want a beer?
No.
Believe it or not, I quit drinking.
I'll take a soda, though.
- Here.
- Thanks, man.
- Whoa.
- Like that?
When you left town, it gave me the idea I should do something with my life too.
So I went down to Seattle, got a guitar and became all about music.
Then pretty soon I was about music and drugs.
And pretty soon I was just about drugs and ended up doing two years for B and E.
- I'm sorry.
- Nah...
Look at me now, though, right?
I been clean and sober 14 months.
Doing construction and renewing those supportive and healthy friendships from my past.
Matter of fact, I told the bastards you were back and they asked me to remind you that it is Saturday.
- As in...?
- As in kickoff's in 20 minutes.
- You guys still doin' it.
- Still doin' it.
- Are we playing ball?
- Absolutely.
- Like the old days.
- Ray, go deep, go deep.
Come on!
- When did that happen?
- "Jay Hamilton Field. "
His parents left him the mill.
In two minutes he shut it down.
Why?
Heads up!
Cos I opened my casino.
- Still got a gun, huh, Jay?
- Still got your reflexes.
- Get tired of being all that you could be?
- No, I'm still all I can be.
- I'll just have to see about that.
- Yeah.
- What brings you home?
- I just want to relax.
- You?
Relax?
- Yeah.
Not today.
I got it, I got it.
Is that how it's gonna be?
- A little contact, huh?
- Was it too rough?
Sorry, ladies.
Pick up the outside.
Fumble!
How's that for touch?
- That was pretty.
- Wanna get your pads?
- Is that the best you got?
- Did I knock a lung loose?
- Touchdown.
- Your last.
Nah, man.
- You wanna go?
- Nobody's going.
- Get it out.
- You almost caught it.
- We stop 'em here, we win this game.
- Last play.
- You know how I like winning.
- Let's put this to rest.
- I'll take care of Ray.
- You two cross.
You stay in and block.
Booth, isolate on Vaughn.
- You two...
- Just give me the ball.
- Go lower.
Left knee.
- All right, man.
- Got it?
- Got it.
On the first hut.
Break!
- Break!
- Be strong.
OK, Chris Vaughn.
Last chance.
Hut!
That's game!
Sorry about that.
Cool, man.
- Good game, ladies.
- What the hell was that?
That was a great game, wasn't it?
Is that the bad one?
- Yeah, it was good.
- Hey, welcome home.
- Good to be back.
- See you around.
Hey, if you wanna come by the casino later,
I'll introduce you to some nice girls.
The drinks are on me.
What do you say?
- See you tonight.
- Cool.
I'll see you later on.
Be good.
Hey, sarge.
Good game.
Maybe next time.
Hold up.
Maybe next time I won't see you in the bleachers smoking weed.
Welcome home, buddy.
Can't only Native Americans own a casino?
- Jay's 1/16th Blackfoot now.
- So his application said.
What he slid under the table helped.
- It's ours for the taking tonight.
- Let's pick some cherries, boys.
Just so you guys know, I'm done after I triple my money.
- You said that last time.
- You had to sell your body for bus fare.
He had to walk.
- Nobody'll have trouble finding this place.
- I like the subtle attention to aesthetics.
It blends in with the mountains so nicely.
Hi, there.
Hi.
- See?
Not bad, huh?
- Not bad.
Pretty girls.
I'm getting chips.
Let's gamble.
We'll see you at the Shower Tower.
Here we go.
Isn't it wonderful?
All your gambling needs under one great big roof.
You got your ATM machines, tellers to cash your paycheck.
And when you're here, you don't worry about little things like child support, rent, the laws of mathematical probability.
Gentlemen, Mr. Hamilton invites you to the VIP lounge.
Oh. "Mr. Hamilton. "
Hey!
The dream team!
You all healed up?
- Nice place.
- Welcome to my world.
Tonight all the drinks are on the house.
If you need credit, just say how much.
And if you need a little female companionship, done.
All right?
Get inside.
Have a good time.
- Where are you going?
- I've got a few things to do.
Enjoy.
Just remember, nothing in here is free.
Ma'am.
Whoa.
- Ray, be nice.
- Come on!
This place is nothing but fake boobs and real assholes.
- Just water for me.
- We got money to win and girls waiting.
- And we are VIPs.
- Here's to you, Chris.
- Chris, welcome home.
- Cheers.
- Let's play, boys.
- I got this one.
- Go right ahead.
- I already lost a bundle.
Don't say we never did nothing for you.
Don't worry, buddy.
Everybody's scared their first time.
Get in there, Chris.
Get, get, get.
- OK, just sit back and enjoy it.
- This'll get you started.
We'll send a search party in the morning.
- Have fun.
- Stop drinking.
Fire
Fire
The way you walk and talk
Really sets me off to a fuller love, child
Yes, it does
The way you squeeze and tease
Knocks me to my knees cos I'm smokin", baby, baby
The way you push, push
Lets me know that you're good
You're gonna get your wish
Fire
What I said, child
Fire
Burnin", burnin", burnin", burnin"
So, are you from here or are you just visiting?
A little of both.
- I grew up here.
- Ah.
So you're seeing all the old faces.
You could say that.
Your voice sounds very familiar.
Chris.
Deni.
- Look who's back.
- So, good surprise?
I told you it was better than gambling'.
- You met Candi?
- Oh, wow.
Hi, Candi.
Let's go.
Lookin' for a six to win.
We can do a six.
Can we do a six?
I think I can do a six.
Whack it, boys, whack it!
Who's up for two out of three?
- I'm getting killed here.
Lend me a C-note.
- No.
- Come on.
- Hell, no.
Look at them.
He's hot.
That's what I'm talkin' about!
Yes!
Five, hard six?
I'm in.
Hard six.
Five on hard six.
- Cool.
Give me some dice.
- Lookin' for a six.
Lookin' for a six.
All right, all right.
Please.
Please.
- Jimmy, don't roll.
Give me the dice.
- I got it.
Six.
Lookin' for a six.
Oh!
Seven out.
Line in, the dark side wins.
Last come'll get you some.
You're good.
But I saw it.
- Saw what?
- I saw the switch.
- This is a clean game, asshole.
- Yeah?
Let's see about that.
Bet you I roll a seven.
It's not your roll, sir.
- Sir, it's not your roll.
Call security.
- Security!
Put your bets down on the pass line.
These dice'll come up seven.
- Chris, can't we just let it go?
- No!
We're gonna let it ride, Jimmy.
The dice are comin' up seven.
It's not your roll, sir.
- What a surprise
- No, folks, no.
No payout.
- Just take care of that bet and we're even.
- It wasn't a legitimate bet.
You're not the shooter.
It's not your roll!
Is there a problem?
The problem is your dice are loaded.
Does your boss know about this?
Just give me my money.
Come on, let's go.
Let's go!
- Sweet.
- Hey, Ray.
- What now, bitch?
- Come on!
Ray?
Are you all right?
Ray!
"Special Forces".
Wow.
I'll take that.
What are you doin'?
Special Forces, special treatment.
This guy knows Hamilton.
You just hold him down.
Come on, Burke!
Folks.
He's pretty banged up, inside and out.
Whoever did this left him for dead.
A lesser man wouldn't have survived.
- I need a statement from him, Doctor.
- He's in no condition.
And a copy of your write-up, and toxicology and blood alcohol level.
- What are you saying, Stan?
- Just getting some facts.
You need to arrest whoever tried to kill my brother, not test his blood.
I'm just doing my job.
I understand how you feel.
- But we don't know yet who started it.
- It wasn't Chris.
- Just find out who did this to him, Stan.
- I'll do my best, Mr. Vaughn.
I really will.
In the meantime I have to file a full report.
Will you let me know when I can talk to him?
Thank you.
- He's gonna be fine, Michelle.
- Thanks.
- Beautiful flowers!
- Thank you.
They're for my best friend.
Hey, sarge.
So much for our VIP... status.
Doesn't the army teach you any basic fighting skills?
- How did you do?
- Not good.
But I tell you, that guy was feelin' me this morning.
- You OK?
- That was a hell of a homecoming party.
I don't know if you noticed, but this ain't exactly home any more.
Hang on.
- Mom.
- Let me help you.
Come on.
I'm good, Mom.
- Need some help?
- Nah.
I'm just milking' it.
There's some old crutches in the garage.
- Thanks, Pete
- Crutches.
That's nice.
Did you see the hole?
- Mind if I watch TV?
- No, that's cool.
Ray.
- Well, somebody's feelin' better.
- A little bit.
Did you make this?
- Need anything?
- What's wrong?
No, it's good, man.
It's good.
I'm good, Dad.
Thanks.
- Changed the plugs a while back.
- I appreciate that, Dad.
I might have had serious issues with your career choice, but it just didn't seem fair to take it out on an innocent truck.
- Where are you headed?
- Into town for some supplies.
- Wanna come?
- Let's go.
Your whole life, all you wanted to do was to get out of here.
What made you come back now?
You're gonna think I'm crazy.
I would think about the mill.
When I was a kid going to visit you at work, the smell of that fresh-cut cedar...
You remember that smell.
Mm.
I remember a lot of nice things before the mill closed.
- When'd they go out of business?
- Closed about six months ago.
There's a Home Depot about 15 minutes up the road.
And that?
Don't ask.
Hey.
First of all, I just wanna say thanks.
- For what?
- For making that stickman.
He's been fired and his gaming permit's been pulled.
I have no idea why my security cameras didn't catch that.
They miss a lot in your place, don't they, Jay?
Chris, I hate seeing you like this.
- Your boys did it.
- Now, wait a second.
Wait, wait.
So they got a little rough.
They're a bit edgy, understandably.
They have to put up with assholes on a daily basis.
Look, they've been reprimanded.
But they say you went nuts.
No, I'm sorry.
Insensitive.
- I know vets call it post-traumatic stress.
- What the fuck are you talking about?
You tore my place apart and it wasn't easy to keep my guys from pressing charges.
Look, Chris, if you had a problem, shouldn't you have come to me?
Look, I want to bring you inside.
I want to make you head of security.
What do you say?
No.
I guess you probably need time to think about it.
I figured as much.
This is for you.
Just a little something to help you get, you know...
Come on, man, don't be like that.
I came all the way out here to your house just to see you get back on your feet.
I'm going to the sheriff.
I'm really sorry you feel that way.
I'll see you around, Chris.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I gotta go.
Hey, Chris.
It's good to see you up and about.
You're lookin' spiffy.
I'm here to press charges.
Not about that incident at the casino a while back, is it?
- Yeah, it is.
- Because that matter's closed.
You're lucky you weren't brought in on charges.
Did you even look into it?
They did an internal investigation.
That's good enough for me.
An internal investigation.
Chris, I know you're familiar with the term "no-fly zone", hm?
Because that's what the casino is.
Since the mill closed down, that casino is the main source of revenue in this town.
So... case closed, basically.
We'll see you.
I'm not gonna let this stand.
Excuse me?
- What did you say to me?
- I said, I'm not gonna let this stand.
You're lucky to be alive right now.
That's all you need to concentrate on.
This is my town, OK?
I'm the sheriff here.
I'll tell you what'll stand.
Not the other way around.
Now please get out of my building.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Come in.
- Thanks.
This belongs to you.
I appreciate that.
I thought this was history.
- Could've left it in the trash, but I...
- Deni?
Nice to see you, dear.
Hi, Mrs. Vaughn.
- Can I talk to you outside?
Quick walk.
- Yeah.
- Mom, I'll be right back.
- Chris...
- How you been?
- Been better.
Talk to the sheriff yet?
I went to the police station and talked to somebody with a badge.
But he sure as hell didn't seem like much of a sheriff.
He's up for re-election, you know.
Maybe you could take his job.
Somebody ought to.
- And how about you?
- Nothing but sunshine and pine trees.
I've been reading books about how to cultivate happiness.
Focus on the future, go with the flow, that sort of thing.
- Is it working?
- I have my moments.
- So, the casino, huh?
- Yep.
I've been there almost a year.
- Treating you good?
- A lot better than it treated you.
Mmm!
I like that.
- Jay Hamilton's done well for himself.
- Yeah.
He's a real go-getter, that one.
He must be.
I heard he got you.
That lasted about eight minutes a long, long time ago.
You still work for him, though.
Rent's gotta be paid, Chris.
I suppose so.
- Hope to see you around.
- Do you?
Thanks for the jacket.
And where is he?
OK.
It's OK, Mom.
He's stabilised.
It was close.
Crystal meth.
- I'm sorry.
I never did it before.
- It's true.
We kind of pushed him into it.
- Where'd you get the drugs?
- I'm not sure...
Stop.
Where?
From the security guys working at the casino.
Chris, wait.
Call the police.
No.
It won't do any good.
- Is Pete OK?
- He'll be fine.
What are you doing?
Oh, no, Chris.
Not like this.
Chris, listen to me.
If you go out of here with that gun, they're gonna nail...
Chris!
Chris!
I've been lookin' for you.
Hey!
I guess that changes our relationship a bit, huh?
You should not have come looking for trouble.
Keep your hands up, get out of the vehicle now, Chris.
Now!
Move towards the front of the car and put your hands on the hood.
I advise you to give this offer serious thought.
If you go to trial, you stand to do 18 years.
This is a sweetheart plea.
Normally it wouldn't even be on the table, but your military record can't be ignored.
Three months' home arrest, community service.
A pretty generous offer, Chris.
- But I'd have to plead guilty.
- Look at it from the other side.
There's a dozen witnesses.
None are gonna paint a flattering picture.
- He busted the machines.
- There was a shot.
- He just went crazy.
- Complete psychopath.
They're offering this deal to keep me quiet.
I still say you should take it.
I wasn't wrong, and I won't say I was.
Our job is to keep order.
But there was no chance of that once he came in.
Me and my men, we were just trying to control him.
He's highly trained, violent, a very dangerous person.
So violent, so dangerous, so highly trained, that he dispatched six of the casino's security staff single-handedly.
Six men, single-handedly.
His weapon of choice:
a simple piece of cedar, which, in his hands, became a devastating force with one aim - to hurt people and destroy property.
He went directly for everything.
He just came in and took over the place.
- You said he broke your arm.
- That's correct.
My right forearm.
Both bones with a single shot.
He was crazy.
We toss a couple of drunks now and then.
Guys grope the girls.
But nothing with this sort of violence.
Did he give you any kind of advance warning?
A chance to defend yourself?
We tussled, but... he's a big guy.
He was on a mission.
Besides, he seemed to be too busy enjoying himself.
- So he seemed to have some purpose?
- I think he had a point to prove, yeah.
I was emptying machines when Mr. Vaughn came in swinging.
- I tried to get out.
- He was a menace.
- Very dangerous.
- Military-trained.
- Like a psychopath.
- Nothing like this.
- I didn't know what he'd do.
- Frightened.
- He came for us.
No doubt about it.
- No further questions.
Mr. Crowe, you may present your client's case.
You're fired.
Your Honour,
I'd like to plead my own case.
Order.
Order!
Mr. Vaughn, if you choose to represent yourself and not be represented by legal counsel, you realise that you can't then claim a mistrial on that basis?
- Yes, I do.
- Very well, Mr. Vaughn.
- I don't deny anything that was said here.
- Are you changing your plea to guilty?
I'm guilty of nothing except standing up for myself when the law wouldn't.
Objection.
He's trying to introduce prior events.
Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, stay on point.
I grew up in this town.
People used to walk tall in this town.
They wouldn't trade the mill for a crooked casino.
- No civic speeches.
- They wouldn't let drugs be sold to kids.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, you're close to being held in contempt.
I was justified in what I did.
And if you acquit me of these charges, I'll run for sheriff.
- Mr. Vaughn...
- If elected, I'll fix this town.
Order.
Order!
Please take your seat!
Mr. Vaughn, you are charged with contempt.
And I will make sure that this... never happens to anyone else again without punishing those who did it.
I order the jury to ignore what they've just seen.
Mr. Vaughn, take your seat.
Order!
Order!
Or you're all charged with contempt!
Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?
- We have, Your Honour.
- Defendant, please rise.
We find the defendant, Chris Vaughn, not guilty.
This is mine.
Sheriff Vaughn!
Sheriff Vaughn!
Sheriff Vaughn!
- Sheriff.
- Watkins.
You won the election.
Congratulations.
But we do have a tradition of professional courtesy here.
I can personally vouch for every one of these men.
They're good deputies.
You're all fired.
- Hey, Chris.
- Licence and registration, please.
- You're joking, right?
- Licence and registration.
Huh.
What's the problem...
Sheriff?
You, and the drugs you're peddling out of your casino.
Only thing going on in my casino now is construction.
You saw to that.
And I plan on taking care of everything else too.
If you can, try to think this through.
A casino is a licence to print money.
Why jeopardise that by selling drugs?
Because you owned the town, Jay.
That's changed now.
Really?
The only thing I think has changed around here is that you get to wake up every morning and put on that nifty badge.
But you're the same guy who couldn't make it in college football, apparently couldn't make it in the army, and is not gonna make it as a cop.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
And if you push too hard, you're gonna be a man who never gets to see 40.
Licence, please.
Thanks, Sheriff.
Sir, get your taillights fixed.
It's your last warning.
What's wrong with my taillights?
They're broken.
How high's the water, Mama?
Three feet high and risin"
How high's the water, Papa?
She said it's three feet high and risin"
Well, the hives are gone, I lost my bees
The chickens are sleepin" in the willow trees
Cow's in water up past her knees
Three feet high and risin"
- Mornin', Sheriff.
- Mornin', Deputy.
No.
No.
No.
Come on, man.
You know I hate cops.
You've been sheriff two minutes and I'm already starting to hate you.
- I'm a convicted felon.
- I got pull around here.
Now you're a crooked cop doing favours for friends.
That's how it starts.
Next you'll be taking bribes, setting' up roadblocks, frisking' dudes' crotches.
Are you done?
- Ray, I need your help.
- Aw, don't do that.
I need you to take me to drug school.
I get to wear a uniform?
The stuff in town is five-star, factory pure.
- Let's get the factory.
- Easier said than done.
Hamilton's boys sell that shit at the casino.
But 99%%% of the time they"re clean.
We gotta follow the money, starting" with the tweekers.
They'll give us the suppliers.
These guys are real edgy, so delicacy is the key.
Then we squeeze "em until they spit out the location of the next buy.
- Where'd you learn that, Ray?
- Cops.
That's a good show.
- Phase three.: we strike.
- I thought you said delicacy was the key.
That's right.
Delicacy and precision.
- Hey, what's up?
- Get out of here.
My nose!
You're sure you're not carrying anything?
I don't have shit.
- Officer?
- Yeah.
- Search him.
- Oh.
This is gonna be a switch.
Spread your legs.
Arms down.
You been workin' out?
Nothin' there.
Whoo!
Somebody needs a bath.
Mm-hm!
Now you read me my rights.
Then you take me in.
Then I call my lawyer.
OK.
But I have a hunch there may be something else in here.
Could be.
Go to it, Deputy.
Have a good time.
Oops.
- He ain't talkin'.
- I know.
Handles pretty good.
He's clean.
Guess we gotta go to plan B.
Screw you both.
I do have a bit of information for you.
It's not just me.
- There's a whole lot of people on this one.
- Spit it out.
You're gonna get hurt.
Hurt!
What an idiot!
Why does it always have to be your fight?
- You might need this.
- No.
I put my guns down a long time ago.
Come on.
You're just being stubborn.
You and me both, boy.
Chris, listen.
You be careful.
I will.
Please step away from the vehicle.
Are you still upset over that body-cavity search?
I forgot.
You got no vehicle.
Please disperse.
There is nothing to s...
- Can I talk to you?
Over here?
- Yeah.
I'll stay here with him tonight.
You look after my parents' place.
Think they're gonna take it that far?
I'm with you, man.
- I'll check in later.
- OK.
Deni!
You making house calls?
Don't shoot.
- Hey.
- Hi.
How's the food around here?
Mm.
Nice.
I brought you special treats.
Salad.
Fried chicken.
Potato salad.
- Do you have glasses?
- Yeah.
- Do you have to work tonight?
- I quit.
I figured if you were making some changes here, I could make a few myself.
Salt and pepper?
How does it feel
To treat me like you do?
When you laid your hands upon me
And told me who you are
I thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard your words
Tell me, how do I feel?
Tell me now, how do I feel?
- Huh?
Who's that?
- Pete.
- Want something' to eat?
- No, I'm good, man.
I gotta get a bigger bed.
No.
No, you don't.
Do it.
I'm hungry.
- We've got leftovers.
- Mm-mm.
- I want pancakes.
- Hm.
- And eggs.
- Mm-hm?
And bacon.
I told you, Vaughn!
- Stay here.
- Uh-oh!
Who needs to step away from the vehicle now?
.
A truck for a truck, baby!
That's right!
A truck for a truck!
Get down!
Tear it up, boys!
Tear it up!
Pete, something's burning.
Pete?
Take this!
Get in there!
Pete?
Good morning, honey.
Pete, get outta here!
Sheriff, are you home?
I told you someone was gonna get hurt!
Hey!
Come here!
When I say "now", start shooting.
Over there!
Agh!
Stay low.
Vaughn!
You gotta get me outta here!
Move it.
Go!
Move it, old man.
- Where's Pete?
- I don't know.
Sit down!
- I know who you are.
- Oh, yeah?
Burke?
Son of a bitch.
Check it out.
Come on!
Get me outta here, man!
- What's it worth to you?
Where's the lab?
- Screw you!
OK!
Hamilton's operation is at the mill, OK?
It's at the mill!
Now get me out of here!
Drop it.
Stay down!
- Pete!
- Stay down!
Hey.
You OK?
I thought I warned you, Chris!
I didn't want this to happen!
I'm goin' in!
Whoo-hoo!
Right there, punk!
Come on, Chris!
Come on, Chris Vaughn!
Whoo-hoo!
Deni, now!
Deni.
Deni.
Ow!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Where is everybody?
- Pete ran outside.
Agh!
You stabbed me with a potato peeler?
You gonna be OK?
Ugh.
Hey, Chris.
- Get up, Jay.
- Just a second.
Remember when we used to play hide-and-seek up here?
- That was my favourite sound.
- Get up!
Look, Chris, just...
Wanna know what my new favourite sound's gonna be?
The sound of you screamin' like a little bitch.
Bet you wish you took that job offer now.
But no, you had to be Mr. Hero Boy!
But you forgot this: this is my town.
Argh!
You're nothin'.
Argh!
You're right, Jay.
This does change our relationship.
This is my town.
You're under arrest.
That oughta do it.
What are you doing?
Gettin' some souvenirs.
I'm gonna miss the place.
That's how it starts.
Next you'll be accepting bribes, setting speed traps, cutting' up trucks.
You know how you are.
Not to mention the cavity searches.
You'll like that.
- Think Jay has a casino in the pen?
- Could be.
Runnin' the Shower Tower with the fellas?
Bet he's blowin' on somebody's dice now.
That's lunch.
- Let's pick up my old man and eat.
- I'm with you, buddy.
Yes, you're feelin" alright
I'm not feelin" that good myself
Boy, you sure took me for one big ride
And even now I sit and I wonder why
That when I think of you I start myself to cry
I just can't waste my time, I must get dry
Gotta stop believin" in all your lies
Cos there's too much to do before I die
Hey, you're feelin" alright
I'm not feelin" too good myself
Oh, no
You're feelin" alright
I'm not feeling too good, little girl
- You're feelin" alright
- Don't you get too lost
In all I say
Yeah, but at the time you know I really felt that way
But that was then and now, you know, it's today
I can't get set so I guess I'm here to stay
Till someone comes along and takes my place, yeah
With a different name, whoa, and a different face
You're feelin" alright
I'm not feelin" that good myself
You're feelin" alright
Hey, I'm not feelin" that good myself
Whoa, you're feelin" alright
Yeah, I'm not feelin" that good myself
Whoa, I love you
But I'm not feelin" good myself
You can turn away
You're feelin" alright
I'm not feelin" too good myself, I tell you...
- Here you go.
- Thanks, man.
See you tomorrow.
How you doing?
Okay.
- When did the mill close?
- Three years ago this August.
If you're looking for work, you may want to try Aberdeen.
That's about the closest mill work you'll find.
- Too bad.
- It's just simple economics.
You know, we have a really nice casino, the Wild Cherry.
Want to make some money, maybe you ought to go on down... and try your luck at the blackjack tables.
No, I don't think so.
Thanks.
You're Chris Vaughn?
Well, hell.
I know all about you, Chris.
I know your folks.
I'm Sheriff Stan Watkins.
- How you doing?
- Ralston, get out of the car!
You're looking at a real soldier here.
Pay some respects.
- Welcome home, soldier.
- Thanks.
Well, hell, Chris.
- I'll give you a ride up to your folks'.
- No, I'm fine.
Thank you.
- I insist.
- I'll walk.
- It's my pleasure.
- It's okay.
I won't take no for an answer.
Get in the car.
- Did I scare you with that one?
- Little bit.
I scared him.
You were gone a while, huh?
Eight years.
Harstad was sheriff back then.
Aaron Harstad, yeah.
Sad story.
About five months back, he fell asleep at the wheel and hit a tree.
Car folded up like an accordion.
He was a good man.
A good man and a good sheriff.
All right.
- Thank you very much for the ride.
- Welcome home, Chris.
It's election month.
I'm your man.
Okay.
Say hey to your old man.
Let's go.
Can I help you?
Little brother.
You come over here and give me a hug.
- You look great.
- What is this?
I couldn't let you be the only one looking good in uniform.
Hey, Ma.
Chris is here.
- Whose tent?
- That's for Pete.
- Watch out, now.
- Chris.
- Look at you.
- Mom, how you doing?
How long's your leave?
How long do we have you?
For good.
I'm home.
- Really?
You're not kidding?
- No.
- Hey, Dad.
- Welcome back.
I wish you had told us exactly when you were coming.
I'd have cooked.
- This is fine, Mom.
- We love Chinese.
- No, this is great.
- So what are you going to do now?
I was planning to work at the mill, but you never mentioned it closed.
We didn't want to bother you when your father got laid off.
I got my business.
You saw the furniture outside.
And I substitute at the elementary school.
Michelle pitches in... we try to keep things simple.
Pete.
- This is your Uncle Chris.
- Hey, Pete.
Sit down.
Say hello.
Last time he saw you, you were barely walking.
- And now I'm camping.
- I said you could sleep on the couch.
It was Chris' room first.
Your tent's going to take on water.
I can show you how to rig it.
Doesn't look like it's going to rain to me, Colonel.
Sit down.
Eat something.
First of all, I was a sergeant.
I worked for a living.
A grunt.
- Did you ever smoke anybody?
- Pete!
Poppa's still got your gun locked up in the garage.
- Would you teach me how to shoot?
- I figured that'd be scrap metal by now.
No.
I'm still hoping you'll melt that thing down on your own.
- Sorry, Pete.
- Whatever.
- I'm out of here, Mom.
- Be back by 10:00.
- 10:30.
- 10:00.
Remind you of anyone?
Okay, it rained.
Happy?
No.
Why don't you crash on the floor?
Okay.
I'll crash on the floor.
You crash on the bed.
Keep you dry.
Did you really kill people?
- Ray-Ray.
- Hello, pudding.
- What's up, man?
- Good to see you, man.
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.
What is that?
- That's the Love Machine.
- Girls actually get in there?
- How you been?
- Good.
- Clean living?
- Please.
You want a beer?
No.
Believe it or not, I quit drinking.
I'd take a soda, though.
Okay.
Here.
Thanks, man.
Like that?
When you left town... it gave me the idea I should do something with my life, too.
So I went down to Seattle, got a guitar, and became all about music.
And then, pretty soon, I was about music and drugs... and pretty soon I was basically just about drugs... and ended up doing two years for B and E.
I'm sorry.
Look at me now, though, right?
I've been clean and sober 14 months.
Doing construction and renewing those supportive and healthy friendships... from my past.
Matter of fact, I talked to the bastards, told them you were back... and they asked me to politely remind you that it is Saturday.
- As in...
- As in, kick-off's in 20 minutes.
- Like old times.
- You guys still doing it.
We're still doing it.
- Playing ball?
- Absolutely.
Let's go, superstar!
- Just like the old days.
Go deep.
- Come on.
When did that happen?
Jay Hamilton Field.
His parents hadn't left him the mill for more than two minutes...
- before he shut it down.
- Why?
Heads up!
Because I opened my casino.
Still got a gun, huh, Jay?
Still got your reflexes.
What?
Did you get tired of being all that you could be?
- No.
I'm still all I can be.
- Really?
- I'll just have to see about that.
- Yeah.
- What brings you home?
- I just want to relax.
Catch my breath.
- You?
Relax?
- Yeah.
Not today.
I got it.
Let's go.
Come on!
Is that how it's going to be?
That's how it is.
- Full contact, huh?
- That's two-hand touch.
Too rough?
Sorry, ladies.
Pick up the outside!
- Fumble!
- Set!
How's that for touch?
- That was pretty, wasn't it?
- Want to go get your pads?
- That the best you got?
- What?
- Here, take a walk...
- And knock a long loose?
- Touchdown.
- First and your last.
- You want to go?
- Nobody's going.
We're not going to go.
You almost caught it.
- We stop them here, we win, right?
- Right, boys, last play.
- You know how I like winning.
- We need to put this to rest.
- I will take care of Ray.
- You two cross.
You stay in and block.
Booth?
Isolate on Vaughn.
- You two cross...
- Just give me the ball.
- Go low.
Left knee.
- All right, man.
You got it?
On the first hut.
Ready?
Break!
Be strong.
All right, Chris Vaughn.
Last chance.
- Black-nineteen!
Black!
- Watch the outside!
I'm open!
That's game.
Sorry about that.
Cool, man.
Nice game, ladies.
What the hell was that?
That was a great game, wasn't it?
Is that the bad one?
- Yeah, it was good.
- Hey, welcome home.
Good to be back.
See you around.
If you're not doing anything later on, want to come by the casino?
Introduce you to some nice girls.
Drinks are on me.
What do you say?
- See you tonight.
- Cool.
I'll see you later on.
Be good.
Hey, Sarge.
Good game.
Maybe next time.
Hold up.
Maybe next time I won't see you in the bleachers, smoking weed.
Welcome home, buddy.
I thought you had to be Native American to own a casino.
- Hamilton's one-sixteenth Blackfoot now.
- Put it on his application.
And what he slid under the table convinced the powers that be it was true.
- It's ours for the taking tonight.
- Let's pick some cherries, boys.
- Here we go.
- I'm feeling lucky.
Just so you guys know, I'm done after I triple my money.
That's what you said last time.
You wound up selling your body for bus fare.
He had to walk.
Nobody's going to have any problems finding this place.
It's the subtle attention to aesthetics that I find most impressive.
Blends in with the mountain so nicely.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
How you doing?
- See?
Not bad, huh?
- It's not bad.
A lot of pretty girls.
I'm getting chips.
Let's gamble.
We'll see you at the Shower Tower, okay?
Isn't it wonderful?
All your gambling needs under one great, big roof.
You got your ATM machines, tellers to cash your paycheck... and when you're here, you don't got to worry about things... like child support, rent, laws of mathematical probability.
Gentlemen, Mr. Hamilton would like to invite you to the VIP lounge.
- The dream team.
You all healed up?
- Nice place.
Welcome to my world.
Tonight all the drinks are on the house.
If you need a line of credit, say how much.
If you need a little female companionship, done.
All right?
- Get inside.
Have a good time.
- Where you going?
Don't you worry about me.
I got a few things to do.
Enjoy.
Just remember, nothing in here is free.
Ma'am.
- Cherry shot?
- Ray, be nice.
Come on, this place is nothing but fake boobs... and real assholes, if you ask me.
Just water for me.
Drink up.
We got money to win and girls just waiting.
- We are VIPs.
- Here's to you, Chris.
- Welcome home.
- Cheers.
Let's play, boys.
Go right ahead.
Already lost $1...
Good night.
Okay.
Don't say we never did nothing for you.
Don't worry, buddy, everybody's scared their first time.
- Come on.
- Get in there, Chris.
Okay, just sit back and enjoy it.
- This'll get you started.
- Lf you're not back by morning... we'll send a search party.
- Have fun.
- Stop drinking.
You from here, or are you just visiting?
A little of both.
I grew up here.
So you're seeing all the old faces.
You could say that.
Your voice sounds very familiar.
Chris.
Deni.
- Look who's back.
- So, good surprise?
I told you it was better than gambling.
You met Candi?
- Hello.
- Hey, Candi.
Let's go.
Six, easy six.
Looking for a six to win.
We can do a six.
Can we do a six?
I think I can do a six, right?
We got liftoff!
Whack it, boys.
Whack it.
Blue or pink, what do you think?
Who's up for two out of three?
I'm getting killed.
Let me have a C-note to put $200 on a bet.
- No.
- Come on.
Hell, no.
Look at them.
He's hot.
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Give me a hard six.
- $5, hard six?
- Yes.
- I'm in.
- Hard six. $5 on hard six.
There's another $100.
Boom.
Give me some dice.
Looking for a six.
All right.
Oh, please.
Please.
Thank you.
And you.
- Jimmy, don't roll.
Give me the dice.
- No, I got it.
Hard six, six.
Looking for a six.
Seven out.
Line in, the dark side wins.
Last come'll get you some.
- You're good.
But I saw it.
- Saw what?
I saw the switch.
This is a clean game, asshole.
Let's see about that.
Bet you'll roll a seven.
It's not your roll, sir.
Sir, it's not your roll.
Will you call security?
Put your bets down on the passline.
- These dice are coming up seven.
- Why don't we just let it go?
No.
We're going to let it ride, Jimmy.
The dice are coming up seven.
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Come on, baby.
- What a surprise.
- No, folks.
No payouts.
- Wait a minute.
- Calm down.
Just take care of that bet, then we're even.
I would, but it wasn't a legitimate bet.
You're not the shooter.
- Security.
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Is there a problem?
- The problem is your dice are loaded.
Does your boss know about this?
Just give me my money.
Come on.
Let's go.
What now, bitch?
Come on!
Special Forces.
Wow.
I'll take that.
What are you doing?
Special Forces.
Special treatment.
This guy knows Hamilton.
You just hold him down.
Come on, Burke.
Folks.
He's pretty banged up, inside and out.
Whoever did this left him for dead.
A lesser man wouldn't have survived.
- I need a statement from him, Doctor.
- He's in no condition to give you one...
I'll also need a copy of your write-up, with toxicology...
- and blood-alcohol level.
- What are you talking about?
I'm just trying to get some facts.
You need to be arresting whoever tried to kill my brother, not testing his blood.
I'm just doing my job, Michelle.
Okay?
I understand how you feel.
But we still don't know who started all this.
- It wasn't Chris.
- Just find out who did this to him, Stan.
I'll do my best, Mr. Vaughn.
I really will.
In the meantime I have to file a full report.
Will you let me know when I can talk to him?
Thank you.
- He's going to be fine, Michelle.
- Thanks.
- Beautiful flowers.
- Thank you.
They're for my best friend.
Hey, Sarge.
So much for our VIP status.
Don't they teach you any basic fighting skills in the Army?
How did you do?
Not good.
But I tell you, that guy was feeling me this morning.
- You okay?
- That was a hell of a homecoming party.
Chris, I don't know if you noticed, but this ain't exactly home anymore.
Hang on.
Let me help you.
Come on.
I'm good, Mom.
I got it.
- Need some help?
- No.
I'm just milking it.
There's some old crutches in the garage.
- Thanks, Pete.
- Crutches.
That's nice.
Did you see the hole?
- Mind if I watch TV?
- No, that's cool.
- Somebody's feeling better.
- Little bit.
You make this?
Need anything?
- Something wrong?
- No, it's good, man.
It's good.
No, I'm good, Dad.
Thanks.
- Changed the plugs a while back.
- I appreciate that, Dad.
I might've had serious issues with your career choice... but it just didn't seem fair to take it out on an innocent truck.
Where you headed?
I was going into town to get supplies.
Want to come?
Let's go.
Your whole life, all you wanted to do was get out of here.
What made you come back now?
You're going to think I'm crazy.
I would think about the mill.
When I was a kid going to visit you at work, the smell of that fresh-cut cedar...
You remember that smell.
I remember a lot of nice things before the mill closed.
When did they go out of business?
Closed about six months ago.
There's a Home Depot about 15 minutes up the road.
And that?
Don't ask.
First of all, I just want to say thanks.
- For what?
- For making that stickman.
He's been fired and his gaming permit's been pulled.
I just have no idea why my security cameras didn't catch that.
They miss a lot in your place, don't they, Jay?
- Look, Chris, I hate seeing you like this.
- Your boys did it.
Wait a second.
So they got a little rough.
They're a bit edgy.
Understandably.
You don't know what kind of assholes they have to put up with on a daily basis.
Look, they've been reprimanded.
But they say you went nuts, man.
I'm sorry.
Insensitive.
I know the proper term that vets use is post-traumatic stress...
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Whatever.
You tore my place apart... and it wasn't easy to get my guys to agree not to press charges.
Chris, if you had a problem, shouldn't you have come to me?
I want to bring you inside.
I want to make you head of security.
- What do you say?
- No.
I guess you probably need time to think about it.
I figured as much.
This is for you.
It's a little something to help you get, you know...
Come on, man, don't be like that.
I came all the way out here to your house, just to see you get back on your feet.
I'm going to the sheriff.
I'm really sorry you feel that way.
I'll see you around, Chris.
I know, it was a good time, wasn't it?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I got to call you back.
Hey, Chris.
It's good to see you up and about.
You're looking spiffy.
I'm here to press charges.
This isn't about that incident at the casino a while back?
Yeah.
It is.
Because that matter's closed.
You're lucky you weren't brought in on charges.
I mean...
Did you even look into it?
They did an internal investigation.
That's good enough for me.
An internal investigation?
I know you're familiar with the term no-fly zone.
Because that's what the casino is.
Since the mill closed down... that casino is the main source of revenue in this town.
So case closed, basically.
We'll see you.
- I'm not going to let this stand.
- Excuse me?
- What did you say to me?
- I said I'm not going to let this stand.
You're lucky to be alive right now.
That's all you need to be concentrating on.
This is my town.
Okay?
I'm the sheriff here.
I'll tell you what will stand.
Not the other way around.
Now please get out of my building.
- Come in.
- Thanks.
This belongs to you.
I appreciate that.
I thought this was history.
- Could have left it in the trash, but I...
- Deni?
- Nice to see you, dear.
- Hi, Mrs. Vaughn.
Can I talk to you outside for a second?
Quick walk.
Mom, I'll be right back.
- How you been?
- Been better.
Talk to the sheriff yet?
I went down to the police station.
I talked to somebody with a badge.
He sure as hell didn't seem like much of a sheriff.
He's up for reelection, you know.
- Maybe you could take his job.
- Somebody ought to.
How about you?
Nothing but sunshine and pine trees.
Been reading these books.
Teach you how to cultivate your happiness.
Focus on the future.
- Go with the flow, that sort of thing.
- Is it working?
I have my moments.
So, the casino, huh?
Yeah.
Been there almost a year.
- Treating you good?
- A lot better than it treated you.
I like that.
Jay Hamilton's done well for himself, hasn't he?
He's a real go-getter, that one.
He must be.
I heard he got you.
That lasted about eight minutes.
It was a long time ago.
You still work for him, though.
Rent's got to be paid, Chris.
I suppose so.
- Hope to see you around.
- Do you?
Thanks for the jacket.
And where is he?
It's okay, Mom.
He's stabilized.
It was close.
Crystal meth.
I'm sorry.
I never did it before.
It's true.
We might've kind of pushed him into it.
- Where'd you get the drugs?
- I'm not really sure...
Stop.
Where?
From the security guys working at the casino.
Chris, wait.
Call the police.
No.
It won't do any good.
- Is Pete okay?
- He'll be fine.
What are you doing?
No, Chris.
Not like this.
Listen to me.
If you go out of here with that gun, they're going to nail...
I've been looking for you.
Guess that changes our relationship a bit, huh?
You should not have come looking for trouble.
Keep your hands up.
Get out of the vehicle now, Chris.
Now!
- Step back, please.
- Just move toward the front of the car.
Put your hands on the hood.
I advise you to give this offer more than a little serious thought.
If you go to trial, you stand to do 18 years.
Now, this is a sweetheart plea.
Normally they wouldn't even put it on the table... but your military record can't be ignored.
Three months home arrest, some community service...
- pretty generous offer, Chris.
- But I'd have to plead guilty.
Look at it from the other side.
There's over a dozen witnesses, none of whom will paint a flattering picture.
- He started busting up the machines.
- There was a gunshot.
- He just went crazy.
- A complete psychopath.
They're only offering me this deal just to keep me quiet.
I still say you should take it.
I wasn't wrong.
And I won't say I was.
Our job is to keep order.
There was no chance of that once he came in.
Me and my men, we were just trying to control him.
He's highly trained, violent.
A very dangerous person.
So violent, so dangerous, so highly trained... that he dispatched six of the casino security staff single-handedly.
Six men, single-handedly.
His weapon of choice, a simple piece of cedar... which, in his hands, became a devastating force with one aim:
To hurt people and destroy property.
He went directly for everything.
He just came in and took over the place.
- You said he broke your arm.
- Yeah, that's correct.
My right forearm.
Both bones with a single shot.
It was crazy.
Toss a couple of drunks now and then.
Guys try to grope the girls.
But nothing with this sort of violence.
Did he give you any kind of advance warning... a chance to defend yourself?
We tussled, but he's a big guy.
He was on a mission.
Besides, he seemed to be too busy enjoying himself from what I could see.
So from what you saw, he seemed to have some kind of purpose?
He had a point to prove.
I was emptying machines when he came in and started swinging.
- I was trying to get out of there.
- He was a menace.
- A very dangerous person.
- Military-trained.
He seemed like a complete psychopath.
- Nothing close to this.
- I didn't know what he'd do.
- I was frightened.
- He came for us.
- No doubt in your mind?
- No doubt.
I have no further questions.
Mr. Crowe, you may present your client's case.
You're fired.
Your Honor, I'd like to plead my own case.
Order!
If you choose to represent yourself, and not be represented by legal counsel... you realize that you can't then claim a mistrial on that basis?
- Yes, I do.
- Very well, Mr. Vaughn.
I don't deny anything that was said here today.
Does that mean you're changing your plea to guilty?
I'm not guilty of anything... except standing up for myself when the law wouldn't.
Objection.
He's trying to introduce prior events.
Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, stay on point.
I grew up in this town.
People used to walk tall in this town.
They wouldn't have traded the mill for a crooked casino.
We're not here to listen to civic speeches...
And they wouldn't have stood around while drugs were sold to kids.
- Objection!
- Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, you're close to being held in contempt.
I was justified in what I did.
And if you acquit me of these charges, then I'm gonna run for sheriff.
- Mr. Vaughn.
- And if elected, I'm gonna fix this town.
Order.
Please take your seat.
Mr. Vaughn, you are now charged with contempt.
And I will make sure that this...
- Objection.
- Sustained.
...never happens to anyone again without punishing those who did it.
I'm ordering the jury to ignore what they've just seen.
Mr. Vaughn, take your seat.
Order.
Or you're all charged with contempt!
Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
Defendant, please rise.
We find the defendant, Chris Vaughn, not guilty.
This is mine.
Sheriff Vaughn!
You won the election.
Congratulations.
But we do have a tradition of professional courtesy up here.
And I can personally vouch for each and every one of these men.
They're good deputies.
You're all fired.
- Hey, Chris.
- License and registration, please.
You're joking, right?
License and registration.
What's the problem, Sheriff?
You.
And the drugs you're peddling out of your casino.
The only thing that's going on in my casino is construction.
You took care of that.
That's right.
And I plan on taking care of everything else, too.
If you can, try to think this through:
A casino is a license to print money.
Why would I jeopardize that by selling drugs?
Because you owned the town, Jay.
That's changed now.
Really?
The only thing I think has changed around here... is that you get to wake up every morning and put on that nifty little badge.
But underneath it is the same guy who couldn't make it playing college football... and apparently couldn't make it in the Army... and not really ever gonna make it as a cop.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
And if you push too hard, you're going to be a man who never gets to see 40.
License, please.
Thanks, Sheriff.
Sir, get your taillights fixed.
It's your last warning.
What's wrong with my taillights?
They're broken.
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning, Deputy.
No.
Come on, man.
You know I hate cops.
You've been sheriff for about two minutes, and I'm already starting to hate you.
- I'm a convicted felon.
- I've got pull around here.
Now you're a crooked cop doing favors for friends.
That's how it starts.
Next thing you know you'll be taking bribes, setting up roadblocks...
- frisking dudes' crotches.
- Are you done?
- Ray, I need your help.
- Don't do that.
I need you to take me to drug school.
I get to wear a uniform?
The stuff in this town is five-star, factory pure.
- So let's go get the factory.
- Easier said than done.
We know Hamilton's boys are selling that shit down at the casino.
Yeah, but 99% of the time they're clean.
So we got to play follow-the-money, starting with the tweakers.
That'll give us the suppliers.
These guys are real edgy, so delicacy is the key.
Then we put the squeeze on them... till they spit out the location of the next buy.
- Where'd you learn that, Ray?
- Cops.
That's a good show.
Phase three:
We strike.
- I thought you said delicacy was the key.
- That's right.
Delicacy and precision.
- Hey, what's up?
- Get out of here.
- You're sure you're not carrying anything?
- I don't have shit.
- Officer.
- Yeah.
Search him.
This is going to be a switch.
Spread your legs.
Arms down.
You been working out?
Nothing there.
Somebody needs a bath.
Now you read me my rights, then you take me in... and I call my lawyer.
Okay.
But I have a hunch there may be something else in here.
Could be.
Go to it, Deputy.
Have a good time.
- He ain't talking.
- I know.
Handles pretty good.
He's clean.
Guess we got to go with Plan B.
Screw you both.
I do have a bit of information for you.
It's not just me, actually.
There's a whole lot of people in this one.
Spit it out.
You're gonna get hurt.
What an idiot.
Why does it always have to be your fight?
- You might need this.
- No.
- I put my guns down a long time ago.
- Come on.
You're just being stubborn.
You and me both, boy.
Chris, listen.
You be careful.
I will.
Please step away from the vehicle!
Mr. Booth, are you still upset over that body-cavity search?
I forgot, you got no vehicle.
Please disperse!
There is nothing to...
Can I talk to you?
- Sure.
- Over here?
I'm gonna stay here with him tonight.
I need you to look after my parents' place.
Think they're gonna take it that far?
- I'm with you, man.
I'll check in later.
- Okay.
A drive to right field.
It's dropping for a single.
You making house calls?
- Don't shoot.
- Hey.
How's the food around here?
Nice.
I brought you special treats:
Salad, fried chicken... potato salad.
- Do you have glasses?
- Yeah.
- Do you have to work tonight?
- I quit.
I figured you were making some changes around here...
I could make a few myself.
Salt and pepper?
- Who is that?
- Pete.
- Want something to eat?
- No.
I'm good, man.
I got to get a bigger bed.
No, you don't.
Do it.
I'm hungry.
We've got leftovers.
I want pancakes.
And eggs.
And bacon.
I told you, Vaughn.
Stay here.
Who needs to step away from the vehicle now, Vaughn?
Truck for a truck, baby!
That's right!
Truck for a truck!
Get down!
Tear it up, boys!
Pete, something's burning.
Take this.
Get in there.
Good morning, honey.
Get out of here.
Sheriff, are you home?
I told you someone was going to get hurt!
Come here.
When I say now, start shooting!
Over there!
Stay low.
Vaughn!
You got to get me out of here.
Move it.
Go!
Move it, old man.
- Where's Pete?
- I don't know.
Sit down.
- I know who you are.
- Oh, yeah?
- Burke?
- Son of a bitch.
Check it out.
Come on!
Get me out of here, man!
- What's it worth to you?
Where's the lab?
- Screw you!
Hamilton's operation is at the mill, okay?
Now get me out of here!
Drop it.
Stay down!
Stay down.
You okay?
Shit.
I thought I warned you, Chris.
I didn't want this to happen.
I'm going in!
Right there, punk!
Come on, Chris!
Come on!
Deni, now!
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Where is everybody?
- Pete ran outside.
You stabbed me with a potato peeler.
You gonna be okay?
Hey, Chris.
Get up, Jay.
Just a second.
Remember when we used to play hide-and-seek up here?
- That was my favorite sound.
- Get up!
Look, Chris...
You want to know what my new favorite sound's gonna be?
The sound of you screaming like a little bitch.
Bet you wish you took that job offer now?
But, no!
You had to be Mr. Hero Boy!
You forgot this:
This is my town!
Yes!
You're nothing.
You're right, Jay.
This does change our relationship.
This is my town.
You're under arrest.
That ought to do it.
What are you doing?
Getting some souvenirs.
I'm gonna miss the place.
That's how it starts.
Next you'll be accepting bribes and setting speed traps all over town.
Cutting up trucks.
You know how you are.
Not to mention the cavity searches.
You're gonna like that.
Speaking of which, do you think Jay's got a casino in the pen?
- Could be.
- Running the Shower Tower with the fellas?
He's probably blowing on somebody's dice right now.
That's lunch.
Let's go pick up my old man, grab something to eat.
I'm with you, buddy.
- Here you go.
- Thanks, man.
See you tomorrow.
How you doing?
Okay.
- When did the mill close?
- Three years ago this August.
If you're looking for work, you may want to try Aberdeen.
That's about the closest mill work you'll find.
- Too bad.
- It's just simple economics.
You know, we have a really nice casino, the Wild Cherry.
Want to make some money, maybe you ought to go on down... and try your luck at the blackjack tables.
No, I don't think so.
Thanks.
You're Chris Vaughn?
Well, hell.
I know all about you, Chris.
I know your folks.
I'm Sheriff Stan Watkins.
- How you doing?
- Ralston, get out of the car!
You're looking at a real soldier here.
Pay some respects.
- Welcome home, soldier.
- Thanks.
Well, hell, Chris.
- I'll give you a ride up to your folks'.
- No, I'm fine.
Thank you.
- I insist.
- I'll walk.
- It's my pleasure.
- It's okay.
I won't take no for an answer.
Get in the car.
- Did I scare you with that one?
- Little bit.
I scared him.
You were gone a while, huh?
Eight years.
Harstad was sheriff back then.
Aaron Harstad, yeah.
Sad story.
About five months back, he fell asleep at the wheel and hit a tree.
Car folded up like an accordion.
He was a good man.
A good man and a good sheriff.
All right.
- Thank you very much for the ride.
- Welcome home, Chris.
It's election month.
I'm your man.
Okay.
Say hey to your old man.
Let's go.
Can I help you?
Little brother.
You come over here and give me a hug.
- You look great.
- What is this?
I couldn't let you be the only one looking good in uniform.
Hey, Ma.
Chris is here.
- Whose tent?
- That's for Pete.
- Watch out, now.
- Chris.
- Look at you.
- Mom, how you doing?
How long's your leave?
How long do we have you?
For good.
I'm home.
- Really?
You're not kidding?
- No.
- Hey, Dad.
- Welcome back.
I wish you had told us exactly when you were coming.
I'd have cooked.
- This is fine, Mom.
- We love Chinese.
- No, this is great.
- So what are you going to do now?
I was planning to work at the mill, but you never mentioned it closed.
We didn't want to bother you when your father got laid off.
I got my business.
You saw the furniture outside.
And I substitute at the elementary school.
Michelle pitches in... we try to keep things simple.
Pete.
- This is your Uncle Chris.
- Hey, Pete.
Sit down.
Say hello.
Last time he saw you, you were barely walking.
- And now I'm camping.
- I said you could sleep on the couch.
It was Chris' room first.
Your tent's going to take on water.
I can show you how to rig it.
Doesn't look like it's going to rain to me, Colonel.
Sit down.
Eat something.
First of all, I was a sergeant.
I worked for a living.
A grunt.
- Did you ever smoke anybody?
- Pete!
Poppa's still got your gun locked up in the garage.
- Would you teach me how to shoot?
- I figured that'd be scrap metal by now.
No.
I'm still hoping you'll melt that thing down on your own.
- Sorry, Pete.
- Whatever.
- I'm out of here, Mom.
- Be back by 10:00.
- 10:30.
- 10:00.
Remind you of anyone?
Okay, it rained.
Happy?
No.
Why don't you crash on the floor?
Okay.
I'll crash on the floor.
You crash on the bed.
Keep you dry.
Did you really kill people?
- Ray-Ray.
- Hello, pudding.
- What's up, man?
- Good to see you, man.
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.
What is that?
- That's the Love Machine.
- Girls actually get in there?
- How you been?
- Good.
- Clean living?
- Please.
You want a beer?
No.
Believe it or not, I quit drinking.
I'd take a soda, though.
Okay.
Here.
Thanks, man.
Like that?
When you left town... it gave me the idea I should do something with my life, too.
So I went down to Seattle, got a guitar, and became all about music.
And then, pretty soon, I was about music and drugs... and pretty soon I was basically just about drugs... and ended up doing two years for B and E.
I'm sorry.
Look at me now, though, right?
I've been clean and sober 14 months.
Doing construction and renewing those supportive and healthy friendships... from my past.
Matter of fact, I talked to the bastards, told them you were back... and they asked me to politely remind you that it is Saturday.
- As in...
- As in, kick-off's in 20 minutes.
- Like old times.
- You guys still doing it.
We're still doing it.
- Playing ball?
- Absolutely.
Let's go, superstar!
- Just like the old days.
Go deep.
- Come on.
When did that happen?
Jay Hamilton Field.
His parents hadn't left him the mill for more than two minutes...
- before he shut it down.
- Why?
Heads up!
Because I opened my casino.
Still got a gun, huh, Jay?
Still got your reflexes.
What?
Did you get tired of being all that you could be?
- No.
I'm still all I can be.
- Really?
- I'll just have to see about that.
- Yeah.
- What brings you home?
- I just want to relax.
Catch my breath.
- You?
Relax?
- Yeah.
Not today.
I got it.
Let's go.
Come on!
Is that how it's going to be?
That's how it is.
- Full contact, huh?
- That's two-hand touch.
Too rough?
Sorry, ladies.
Pick up the outside!
- Fumble!
- Set!
How's that for touch?
- That was pretty, wasn't it?
- Want to go get your pads?
- That the best you got?
- What?
- Here, take a walk...
- And knock a long loose?
- Touchdown.
- First and your last.
- You want to go?
- Nobody's going.
We're not going to go.
You almost caught it.
- We stop them here, we win, right?
- Right, boys, last play.
- You know how I like winning.
- We need to put this to rest.
- I will take care of Ray.
- You two cross.
You stay in and block.
Booth?
Isolate on Vaughn.
- You two cross...
- Just give me the ball.
- Go low.
Left knee.
- All right, man.
You got it?
On the first hut.
Ready?
Break!
Be strong.
All right, Chris Vaughn.
Last chance.
- Black-nineteen!
Black!
- Watch the outside!
I'm open!
That's game.
Sorry about that.
Cool, man.
Nice game, ladies.
What the hell was that?
That was a great game, wasn't it?
Is that the bad one?
- Yeah, it was good.
- Hey, welcome home.
Good to be back.
See you around.
If you're not doing anything later on, want to come by the casino?
Introduce you to some nice girls.
Drinks are on me.
What do you say?
- See you tonight.
- Cool.
I'll see you later on.
Be good.
Hey, Sarge.
Good game.
Maybe next time.
Hold up.
Maybe next time I won't see you in the bleachers, smoking weed.
Welcome home, buddy.
I thought you had to be Native American to own a casino.
- Hamilton's one-sixteenth Blackfoot now.
- Put it on his application.
And what he slid under the table convinced the powers that be it was true.
- It's ours for the taking tonight.
- Let's pick some cherries, boys.
- Here we go.
- I'm feeling lucky.
Just so you guys know, I'm done after I triple my money.
That's what you said last time.
You wound up selling your body for bus fare.
He had to walk.
Nobody's going to have any problems finding this place.
It's the subtle attention to aesthetics that I find most impressive.
Blends in with the mountain so nicely.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
How you doing?
- See?
Not bad, huh?
- It's not bad.
A lot of pretty girls.
I'm getting chips.
Let's gamble.
We'll see you at the Shower Tower, okay?
Isn't it wonderful?
All your gambling needs under one great, big roof.
You got your ATM machines, tellers to cash your paycheck... and when you're here, you don't got to worry about things... like child support, rent, laws of mathematical probability.
Gentlemen, Mr. Hamilton would like to invite you to the VIP lounge.
- The dream team.
You all healed up?
- Nice place.
Welcome to my world.
Tonight all the drinks are on the house.
If you need a line of credit, say how much.
If you need a little female companionship, done.
All right?
- Get inside.
Have a good time.
- Where you going?
Don't you worry about me.
I got a few things to do.
Enjoy.
Just remember, nothing in here is free.
Ma'am.
- Cherry shot?
- Ray, be nice.
Come on, this place is nothing but fake boobs... and real assholes, if you ask me.
Just water for me.
Drink up.
We got money to win and girls just waiting.
- We are VIPs.
- Here's to you, Chris.
- Welcome home.
- Cheers.
Let's play, boys.
Go right ahead.
Already lost $1...
Good night.
Okay.
Don't say we never did nothing for you.
Don't worry, buddy, everybody's scared their first time.
- Come on.
- Get in there, Chris.
Okay, just sit back and enjoy it.
- This'll get you started.
- lf you're not back by morning... we'll send a search party.
- Have fun.
- Stop drinking.
You from here, or are you just visiting?
A little of both.
I grew up here.
So you're seeing all the old faces.
You could say that.
Your voice sounds very familiar.
Chris.
Deni.
- Look who's back.
- So, good surprise?
I told you it was better than gambling.
You met Candi?
- Hello.
- Hey, Candi.
Let's go.
Six, easy six.
Looking for a six to win.
We can do a six.
Can we do a six?
I think I can do a six, right?
We got liftoff!
Whack it, boys.
Whack it.
Blue or pink, what do you think?
Who's up for two out of three?
I'm getting killed.
Let me have a C-note to put $200 on a bet.
- No.
- Come on.
Hell, no.
Look at them.
He's hot.
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Give me a hard six.
- $5, hard six?
- Yes.
- I'm in.
- Hard six. $5 on hard six.
There's another $100.
Boom.
Give me some dice.
Looking for a six.
All right.
Oh, please.
Please.
Thank you.
And you.
- Jimmy, don't roll.
Give me the dice.
- No, I got it.
Hard six, six.
Looking for a six.
Seven out.
Line in, the dark side wins.
Last come'll get you some.
- You're good.
But I saw it.
- Saw what?
I saw the switch.
This is a clean game, asshole.
Let's see about that.
Bet you'll roll a seven.
It's not your roll, sir.
Sir, it's not your roll.
Will you call security?
Put your bets down on the passline.
- These dice are coming up seven.
- Why don't we just let it go?
No.
We're going to let it ride, Jimmy.
The dice are coming up seven.
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Come on, baby.
- What a surprise.
- No, folks.
No payouts.
- Wait a minute.
- Calm down.
Just take care of that bet, then we're even.
I would, but it wasn't a legitimate bet.
You're not the shooter.
- Security.
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Is there a problem?
- The problem is your dice are loaded.
Does your boss know about this?
Just give me my money.
Come on.
Let's go.
What now, bitch?
Come on!
Special Forces.
Wow.
I'll take that.
What are you doing?
Special Forces.
Special treatment.
This guy knows Hamilton.
You just hold him down.
Come on, Burke.
Folks.
He's pretty banged up, inside and out.
Whoever did this left him for dead.
A lesser man wouldn't have survived.
- I need a statement from him, Doctor.
- He's in no condition to give you one...
I'll also need a copy of your write-up, with toxicology...
- and blood-alcohol level.
- What are you talking about?
I'm just trying to get some facts.
You need to be arresting whoever tried to kill my brother, not testing his blood.
I'm just doing my job, Michelle.
Okay?
I understand how you feel.
But we still don't know who started all this.
- It wasn't Chris.
- Just find out who did this to him, Stan.
I'll do my best, Mr. Vaughn.
I really will.
In the meantime I have to file a full report.
Will you let me know when I can talk to him?
Thank you.
- He's going to be fine, Michelle.
- Thanks.
- Beautiful flowers.
- Thank you.
They're for my best friend.
Hey, Sarge.
So much for our VIP status.
Don't they teach you any basic fighting skills in the Army?
How did you do?
Not good.
But I tell you, that guy was feeling me this morning.
- You okay?
- That was a hell of a homecoming party.
Chris, I don't know if you noticed, but this ain't exactly home anymore.
Hang on.
Let me help you.
Come on.
I'm good, Mom.
I got it.
- Need some help?
- No.
I'm just milking it.
There's some old crutches in the garage.
- Thanks, Pete.
- Crutches.
That's nice.
Did you see the hole?
- Mind if I watch TV?
- No, that's cool.
- Somebody's feeling better.
- Little bit.
You make this?
Need anything?
- Something wrong?
- No, it's good, man.
It's good.
No, I'm good, Dad.
Thanks.
- Changed the plugs a while back.
- I appreciate that, Dad.
I might've had serious issues with your career choice... but it just didn't seem fair to take it out on an innocent truck.
Where you headed?
I was going into town to get supplies.
Want to come?
Let's go.
Your whole life, all you wanted to do was get out of here.
What made you come back now?
You're going to think I'm crazy.
I would think about the mill.
When I was a kid going to visit you at work, the smell of that fresh-cut cedar...
You remember that smell.
I remember a lot of nice things before the mill closed.
When did they go out of business?
Closed about six months ago.
There's a Home Depot about 15 minutes up the road.
And that?
Don't ask.
First of all, I just want to say thanks.
- For what?
- For making that stickman.
He's been fired and his gaming permit's been pulled.
I just have no idea why my security cameras didn't catch that.
They miss a lot in your place, don't they, Jay?
- Look, Chris, I hate seeing you like this.
- Your boys did it.
Wait a second.
So they got a little rough.
They're a bit edgy.
Understandably.
You don't know what kind of assholes they have to put up with on a daily basis.
Look, they've been reprimanded.
But they say you went nuts, man.
I'm sorry.
Insensitive.
I know the proper term that vets use is post-traumatic stress...
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Whatever.
You tore my place apart... and it wasn't easy to get my guys to agree not to press charges.
Chris, if you had a problem, shouldn't you have come to me?
I want to bring you inside.
I want to make you head of security.
- What do you say?
- No.
I guess you probably need time to think about it.
I figured as much.
This is for you.
It's a little something to help you get, you know...
Come on, man, don't be like that.
I came all the way out here to your house, just to see you get back on your feet.
I'm going to the sheriff.
I'm really sorry you feel that way.
I'll see you around, Chris.
I know, it was a good time, wasn't it?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I got to call you back.
Hey, Chris.
It's good to see you up and about.
You're looking spiffy.
I'm here to press charges.
This isn't about that incident at the casino a while back?
Yeah.
It is.
Because that matter's closed.
You're lucky you weren't brought in on charges.
I mean...
Did you even look into it?
They did an internal investigation.
That's good enough for me.
An internal investigation?
I know you're familiar with the term no-fly zone.
Because that's what the casino is.
Since the mill closed down... that casino is the main source of revenue in this town.
So case closed, basically.
We'll see you.
- I'm not going to let this stand.
- Excuse me?
- What did you say to me?
- I said I'm not going to let this stand.
You're lucky to be alive right now.
That's all you need to be concentrating on.
This is my town.
Okay?
I'm the sheriff here.
I'll tell you what will stand.
Not the other way around.
Now please get out of my building.
- Come in.
- Thanks.
This belongs to you.
I appreciate that.
I thought this was history.
- Could have left it in the trash, but I...
- Deni?
- Nice to see you, dear.
- Hi, Mrs. Vaughn.
Can I talk to you outside for a second?
Quick walk.
Mom, I'll be right back.
- How you been?
- Been better.
Talk to the sheriff yet?
I went down to the police station.
I talked to somebody with a badge.
He sure as hell didn't seem like much of a sheriff.
He's up for reelection, you know.
- Maybe you could take his job.
- Somebody ought to.
How about you?
Nothing but sunshine and pine trees.
Been reading these books.
Teach you how to cultivate your happiness.
Focus on the future.
- Go with the flow, that sort of thing.
- Is it working?
I have my moments.
So, the casino, huh?
Yeah.
Been there almost a year.
- Treating you good?
- A lot better than it treated you.
I like that.
Jay Hamilton's done well for himself, hasn't he?
He's a real go-getter, that one.
He must be.
I heard he got you.
That lasted about eight minutes.
It was a long time ago.
You still work for him, though.
Rent's got to be paid, Chris.
I suppose so.
- Hope to see you around.
- Do you?
Thanks for the jacket.
And where is he?
It's okay, Mom.
He's stabilized.
It was close.
Crystal meth.
I'm sorry.
I never did it before.
It's true.
We might've kind of pushed him into it.
- Where'd you get the drugs?
- I'm not really sure...
Stop.
Where?
From the security guys working at the casino.
Chris, wait.
Call the police.
No.
It won't do any good.
- Is Pete okay?
- He'll be fine.
What are you doing?
No, Chris.
Not like this.
Listen to me.
If you go out of here with that gun, they're going to nail...
I've been looking for you.
Guess that changes our relationship a bit, huh?
You should not have come looking for trouble.
Keep your hands up.
Get out of the vehicle now, Chris.
Now!
- Step back, please.
- Just move toward the front of the car.
Put your hands on the hood.
I advise you to give this offer more than a little serious thought.
If you go to trial, you stand to do 18 years.
Now, this is a sweetheart plea.
Normally they wouldn't even put it on the table... but your military record can't be ignored.
Three months home arrest, some community service...
- pretty generous offer, Chris.
- But I'd have to plead guilty.
Look at it from the other side.
There's over a dozen witnesses, none of whom will paint a flattering picture.
- He started busting up the machines.
- There was a gunshot.
- He just went crazy.
- A complete psychopath.
They're only offering me this deal just to keep me quiet.
I still say you should take it.
I wasn't wrong.
And I won't say I was.
Our job is to keep order.
There was no chance of that once he came in.
Me and my men, we were just trying to control him.
He's highly trained, violent.
A very dangerous person.
So violent, so dangerous, so highly trained... that he dispatched six of the casino security staff single-handedly.
Six men, single-handedly.
His weapon of choice, a simple piece of cedar... which, in his hands, became a devastating force with one aim:
To hurt people and destroy property.
He went directly for everything.
He just came in and took over the place.
- You said he broke your arm.
- Yeah, that's correct.
My right forearm.
Both bones with a single shot.
It was crazy.
Toss a couple of drunks now and then.
Guys try to grope the girls.
But nothing with this sort of violence.
Did he give you any kind of advance warning... a chance to defend yourself?
We tussled, but he's a big guy.
He was on a mission.
Besides, he seemed to be too busy enjoying himself from what I could see.
So from what you saw, he seemed to have some kind of purpose?
He had a point to prove.
I was emptying machines when he came in and started swinging.
- I was trying to get out of there.
- He was a menace.
- A very dangerous person.
- Military-trained.
He seemed like a complete psychopath.
- Nothing close to this.
- I didn't know what he'd do.
- I was frightened.
- He came for us.
- No doubt in your mind?
- No doubt.
I have no further questions.
Mr. Crowe, you may present your client's case.
You're fired.
Your Honor, I'd like to plead my own case.
Order!
If you choose to represent yourself, and not be represented by legal counsel... you realize that you can't then claim a mistrial on that basis?
- Yes, I do.
- Very well, Mr. Vaughn.
I don't deny anything that was said here today.
Does that mean you're changing your plea to guilty?
I'm not guilty of anything... except standing up for myself when the law wouldn't.
Objection.
He's trying to introduce prior events.
Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, stay on point.
I grew up in this town.
People used to walk tall in this town.
They wouldn't have traded the mill for a crooked casino.
We're not here to listen to civic speeches...
And they wouldn't have stood around while drugs were sold to kids.
- Objection!
- Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, you're close to being held in contempt.
I was justified in what I did.
And if you acquit me of these charges, then I'm gonna run for sheriff.
- Mr. Vaughn.
- And if elected, I'm gonna fix this town.
Order.
Please take your seat.
Mr. Vaughn, you are now charged with contempt.
And I will make sure that this...
- Objection.
- Sustained.
...never happens to anyone again without punishing those who did it.
I'm ordering the jury to ignore what they've just seen.
Mr. Vaughn, take your seat.
Order.
Or you're all charged with contempt!
Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
Defendant, please rise.
We find the defendant, Chris Vaughn, not guilty.
This is mine.
Sheriff Vaughn!
You won the election.
Congratulations.
But we do have a tradition of professional courtesy up here.
And I can personally vouch for each and every one of these men.
They're good deputies.
You're all fired.
- Hey, Chris.
- License and registration, please.
You're joking, right?
License and registration.
What's the problem, Sheriff?
You.
And the drugs you're peddling out of your casino.
The only thing that's going on in my casino is construction.
You took care of that.
That's right.
And I plan on taking care of everything else, too.
If you can, try to think this through:
A casino is a license to print money.
Why would I jeopardize that by selling drugs?
Because you owned the town, Jay.
That's changed now.
Really?
The only thing I think has changed around here... is that you get to wake up every morning and put on that nifty little badge.
But underneath it is the same guy who couldn't make it playing college football... and apparently couldn't make it in the Army... and not really ever gonna make it as a cop.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
And if you push too hard, you're going to be a man who never gets to see 40.
License, please.
Thanks, Sheriff.
Sir, get your taillights fixed.
It's your last warning.
What's wrong with my taillights?
They're broken.
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning, Deputy.
No.
Come on, man.
You know I hate cops.
You've been sheriff for about two minutes, and I'm already starting to hate you.
- I'm a convicted felon.
- I've got pull around here.
Now you're a crooked cop doing favors for friends.
That's how it starts.
Next thing you know you'll be taking bribes, setting up roadblocks...
- frisking dudes' crotches.
- Are you done?
- Ray, I need your help.
- Don't do that.
I need you to take me to drug school.
I get to wear a uniform?
The stuff in this town is five-star, factory pure.
- So let's go get the factory.
- Easier said than done.
We know Hamilton's boys are selling that shit down at the casino.
Yeah, but 99% of the time they're clean.
So we got to play follow-the-money, starting with the tweakers.
That'll give us the suppliers.
These guys are real edgy, so delicacy is the key.
Then we put the squeeze on them... till they spit out the location of the next buy.
- Where'd you learn that, Ray?
- Cops.
That's a good show.
Phase three: we strike.
- I thought you said delicacy was the key.
- That's right.
Delicacy and precision.
- Hey, what's up?
- Get out of here.
- You're sure you're not carrying anything?
- I don't have shit.
- Officer.
- Yeah.
Search him.
This is going to be a switch.
Spread your legs.
Arms down.
You been working out?
Nothing there.
Somebody needs a bath.
Now you read me my rights, then you take me in... and I call my lawyer.
Okay.
But I have a hunch there may be something else in here.
Could be.
Go to it, Deputy.
Have a good time.
- He ain't talking.
- I know.
Handles pretty good.
He's clean.
Guess we got to go with Plan B.
Screw you both.
I do have a bit of information for you.
It's not just me, actually.
There's a whole lot of people in this one.
Spit it out.
You're gonna get hurt.
What an idiot.
Why does it always have to be your fight?
- You might need this.
- No.
- I put my guns down a long time ago.
- Come on.
You're just being stubborn.
You and me both, boy.
Chris, listen.
You be careful.
I will.
Please step away from the vehicle!
Mr. Booth, are you still upset over that body-cavity search?
I forgot, you got no vehicle.
Please disperse!
There is nothing to...
Can I talk to you?
- Sure.
- Over here?
I'm gonna stay here with him tonight.
I need you to look after my parents' place.
Think they're gonna take it that far?
- I'm with you, man.
I'll check in later.
- Okay.
A drive to right field.
It's dropping for a single.
You making house calls?
- Don't shoot.
- Hey.
How's the food around here?
Nice.
I brought you special treats:
Salad, fried chicken... potato salad.
- Do you have glasses?
- Yeah.
- Do you have to work tonight?
- I quit.
I figured you were making some changes around here...
I could make a few myself.
Salt and pepper?
- Who is that?
- Pete.
- Want something to eat?
- No.
I'm good, man.
I got to get a bigger bed.
No, you don't.
Do it.
I'm hungry.
We've got leftovers.
I want pancakes.
And eggs.
And bacon.
I told you, Vaughn.
Stay here.
Who needs to step away from the vehicle now, Vaughn?
Truck for a truck, baby!
That's right!
Truck for a truck!
Get down!
Tear it up, boys!
Pete, something's burning.
Take this.
Get in there.
Good morning, honey.
Get out of here.
Sheriff, are you home?
I told you someone was going to get hurt!
Come here.
When I say now, start shooting!
Over there!
Stay low.
Vaughn!
You got to get me out of here.
Move it.
Go!
Move it, old man.
- Where's Pete?
- I don't know.
Sit down.
- I know who you are.
- Oh, yeah?
- Burke?
- Son of a bitch.
Check it out.
Come on!
Get me out of here, man!
- What's it worth to you?
Where's the lab?
- Screw you!
Hamilton's operation is at the mill, okay?
Now get me out of here!
Drop it.
Stay down!
Stay down.
You okay?
Shit.
I thought I warned you, Chris.
I didn't want this to happen.
I'm going in!
Right there, punk!
Come on, Chris!
Come on!
Deni, now!
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Where is everybody?
- Pete ran outside.
You stabbed me with a potato peeler.
You gonna be okay?
Hey, Chris.
Get up, Jay.
Just a second.
Remember when we used to play hide-and-seek up here?
- That was my favorite sound.
- Get up!
Look, Chris...
You want to know what my new favorite sound's gonna be?
The sound of you screaming like a little bitch.
Bet you wish you took that job offer now?
But, no!
You had to be Mr. Hero Boy!
You forgot this: this is my town!
Yes!
You're nothing.
You're right, Jay.
This does change our relationship.
This is my town.
You're under arrest.
That ought to do it.
What are you doing?
Getting some souvenirs.
I'm gonna miss the place.
That's how it starts.
Next you'll be accepting bribes and setting speed traps all over town.
Cutting up trucks.
You know how you are.
Not to mention the cavity searches.
You're gonna like that.
Speaking of which, do you think Jay's got a casino in the pen?
- Could be.
- Running the Shower Tower with the fellas?
He's probably blowing on somebody's dice right now.
That's lunch.
Let's go pick up my old man, grab something to eat.
I'm with you, buddy.
- Here you go.
- Thanks, man.
See you tomorrow.
How you doing?
Okay.
- When did the mill close?
- Three years ago this August.
If you're looking for work, you may want to try Aberdeen.
That's about the closest mill work you'll find.
- Too bad.
- It's just simple economics.
You know, we have a really nice casino, the Wild Cherry.
Want to make some money, maybe you ought to go on down... and try your luck at the blackjack tables.
No, I don't think so.
Thanks.
You're Chris Vaughn?
Well, hell.
I know all about you, Chris.
I know your folks.
I'm Sheriff Stan Watkins.
- How you doing?
- Ralston, get out of the car!
You're looking at a real soldier here.
Pay some respects.
- Welcome home, soldier.
- Thanks.
Well, hell, Chris.
- I'll give you a ride up to your folks'.
- No, I'm fine.
Thank you.
- I insist.
- I'll walk.
- It's my pleasure.
- It's okay.
I won't take no for an answer.
Get in the car.
- Did I scare you with that one?
- Little bit.
I scared him.
You were gone a while, huh?
Eight years.
Harstad was sheriff back then.
Aaron Harstad, yeah.
Sad story.
About five months back, he fell asleep at the wheel and hit a tree.
Car folded up like an accordion.
He was a good man.
A good man and a good sheriff.
All right.
- Thank you very much for the ride.
- Welcome home, Chris.
It's election month.
I'm your man.
Okay.
Say hey to your old man.
Let's go.
Can I help you?
Little brother.
You come over here and give me a hug.
- You look great.
- What is this?
I couldn't let you be the only one looking good in uniform.
Hey, Ma.
Chris is here.
- Whose tent?
- That's for Pete.
- Watch out, now.
- Chris.
- Look at you.
- Mom, how you doing?
How long's your leave?
How long do we have you?
For good.
I'm home.
- Really?
You're not kidding?
- No.
- Hey, Dad.
- Welcome back.
I wish you had told us exactly when you were coming.
I'd have cooked.
- This is fine, Mom.
- We love Chinese.
- No, this is great.
- So what are you going to do now?
I was planning to work at the mill, but you never mentioned it closed.
We didn't want to bother you when your father got laid off.
I got my business.
You saw the furniture outside.
And I substitute at the elementary school.
Michelle pitches in... we try to keep things simple.
Pete.
- This is your Uncle Chris.
- Hey, Pete.
Sit down.
Say hello.
Last time he saw you, you were barely walking.
- And now I'm camping.
- I said you could sleep on the couch.
It was Chris' room first.
Your tent's going to take on water.
I can show you how to rig it.
Doesn't look like it's going to rain to me, Colonel.
Sit down.
Eat something.
First of all, I was a sergeant.
I worked for a living.
A grunt.
- Did you ever smoke anybody?
- Pete!
Poppa's still got your gun locked up in the garage.
- Would you teach me how to shoot?
- I figured that'd be scrap metal by now.
No.
I'm still hoping you'll melt that thing down on your own.
- Sorry, Pete.
- Whatever.
- I'm out of here, Mom.
- Be back by 10:00.
- 10:30.
- 10:00.
Remind you of anyone?
Okay, it rained.
Happy?
No.
Why don't you crash on the floor?
Okay.
I'll crash on the floor.
You crash on the bed.
Keep you dry.
Did you really kill people?
- Ray-Ray.
- Hello, pudding.
- What's up, man?
- Good to see you, man.
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.
What is that?
- That's the Love Machine.
- Girls actually get in there?
- How you been?
- Good.
- Clean living?
- Please.
You want a beer?
No.
Believe it or not, I quit drinking.
I'd take a soda, though.
Okay.
Here.
Thanks, man.
Like that?
When you left town... it gave me the idea I should do something with my life, too.
So I went down to Seattle, got a guitar, and became all about music.
And then, pretty soon, I was about music and drugs... and pretty soon I was basically just about drugs... and ended up doing two years for B and E.
I'm sorry.
Look at me now, though, right?
I've been clean and sober 14 months.
Doing construction and renewing those supportive and healthy friendships... from my past.
Matter of fact, I talked to the bastards, told them you were back... and they asked me to politely remind you that it is Saturday.
- As in...
- As in, kick-off's in 20 minutes.
- Like old times.
- You guys still doing it.
We're still doing it.
- Playing ball?
- Absolutely.
Let's go, superstar!
- Just like the old days.
Go deep.
- Come on.
When did that happen?
Jay Hamilton Field.
His parents hadn't left him the mill for more than two minutes...
- before he shut it down.
- Why?
Heads up!
Because I opened my casino.
Still got a gun, huh, Jay?
Still got your reflexes.
What?
Did you get tired of being all that you could be?
- No.
I'm still all I can be.
- Really?
- I'll just have to see about that.
- Yeah.
- What brings you home?
- I just want to relax.
Catch my breath.
- You?
Relax?
- Yeah.
Not today.
I got it.
Let's go.
Come on!
Is that how it's going to be?
That's how it is.
- Full contact, huh?
- That's two-hand touch.
Too rough?
Sorry, ladies.
Pick up the outside!
- Fumble!
- Set!
How's that for touch?
- That was pretty, wasn't it?
- Want to go get your pads?
- That the best you got?
- What?
- Here, take a walk...
- And knock a long loose?
- Touchdown.
- First and your last.
- You want to go?
- Nobody's going.
We're not going to go.
You almost caught it.
- We stop them here, we win, right?
- Right, boys, last play.
- You know how I like winning.
- We need to put this to rest.
- I will take care of Ray.
- You two cross.
You stay in and block.
Booth?
Isolate on Vaughn.
- You two cross...
- Just give me the ball.
- Go low.
Left knee.
- All right, man.
You got it?
On the first hut.
Ready?
Break!
Be strong.
All right, Chris Vaughn.
Last chance.
- Black-nineteen!
Black!
- Watch the outside!
I'm open!
That's game.
Sorry about that.
Cool, man.
Nice game, ladies.
What the hell was that?
That was a great game, wasn't it?
Is that the bad one?
- Yeah, it was good.
- Hey, welcome home.
Good to be back.
See you around.
If you're not doing anything later on, want to come by the casino?
Introduce you to some nice girls.
Drinks are on me.
What do you say?
- See you tonight.
- Cool.
I'll see you later on.
Be good.
Hey, Sarge.
Good game.
Maybe next time.
Hold up.
Maybe next time I won't see you in the bleachers, smoking weed.
Welcome home, buddy.
I thought you had to be Native American to own a casino.
- Hamilton's one-sixteenth Blackfoot now.
- Put it on his application.
And what he slid under the table convinced the powers that be it was true.
- It's ours for the taking tonight.
- Let's pick some cherries, boys.
- Here we go.
- I'm feeling lucky.
Just so you guys know, I'm done after I triple my money.
That's what you said last time.
You wound up selling your body for bus fare.
He had to walk.
Nobody's going to have any problems finding this place.
It's the subtle attention to aesthetics that I find most impressive.
Blends in with the mountain so nicely.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
How you doing?
- See?
Not bad, huh?
- It's not bad.
A lot of pretty girls.
I'm getting chips.
Let's gamble.
We'll see you at the Shower Tower, okay?
Isn't it wonderful?
All your gambling needs under one great, big roof.
You got your ATM machines, tellers to cash your paycheck... and when you're here, you don't got to worry about things... like child support, rent, laws of mathematical probability.
Gentlemen, Mr. Hamilton would like to invite you to the VIP lounge.
- The dream team.
You all healed up?
- Nice place.
Welcome to my world.
Tonight all the drinks are on the house.
If you need a line of credit, say how much.
If you need a little female companionship, done.
All right?
- Get inside.
Have a good time.
- Where you going?
Don't you worry about me.
I got a few things to do.
Enjoy.
Just remember, nothing in here is free.
Ma'am.
- Cherry shot?
- Ray, be nice.
Come on, this place is nothing but fake boobs... and real assholes, if you ask me.
Just water for me.
Drink up.
We got money to win and girls just waiting.
- We are VIPs.
- Here's to you, Chris.
- Welcome home.
- Cheers.
Let's play, boys.
Go right ahead.
Already lost $1...
Good night.
Okay.
Don't say we never did nothing for you.
Don't worry, buddy, everybody's scared their first time.
- Come on.
- Get in there, Chris.
Okay, just sit back and enjoy it.
- This'll get you started.
- Lf you're not back by morning... we'll send a search party.
- Have fun.
- Stop drinking.
You from here, or are you just visiting?
A little of both.
I grew up here.
So you're seeing all the old faces.
You could say that.
Your voice sounds very familiar.
Chris.
Deni.
- Look who's back.
- So, good surprise?
I told you it was better than gambling.
You met Candi?
- Hello.
- Hey, Candi.
Let's go.
Six, easy six.
Looking for a six to win.
We can do a six.
Can we do a six?
I think I can do a six, right?
We got liftoff!
Whack it, boys.
Whack it.
Blue or pink, what do you think?
Who's up for two out of three?
I'm getting killed.
Let me have a C-note to put $200 on a bet.
- No.
- Come on.
Hell, no.
Look at them.
He's hot.
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Give me a hard six.
- $5, hard six?
- Yes.
- I'm in.
- Hard six. $5 on hard six.
There's another $100.
Boom.
Give me some dice.
Looking for a six.
All right.
Oh, please.
Please.
Thank you.
And you.
- Jimmy, don't roll.
Give me the dice.
- No, I got it.
Hard six, six.
Looking for a six.
Seven out.
Line in, the dark side wins.
Last come'll get you some.
- You're good.
But I saw it.
- Saw what?
I saw the switch.
This is a clean game, asshole.
Let's see about that.
Bet you'll roll a seven.
It's not your roll, sir.
Sir, it's not your roll.
Will you call security?
Put your bets down on the passline.
- These dice are coming up seven.
- Why don't we just let it go?
No.
We're going to let it ride, Jimmy.
The dice are coming up seven.
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Come on, baby.
- What a surprise.
- No, folks.
No payouts.
- Wait a minute.
- Calm down.
Just take care of that bet, then we're even.
I would, but it wasn't a legitimate bet.
You're not the shooter.
- Security.
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Is there a problem?
- The problem is your dice are loaded.
Does your boss know about this?
Just give me my money.
Come on.
Let's go.
What now, bitch?
Come on!
Special Forces.
Wow.
I'll take that.
What are you doing?
Special Forces.
Special treatment.
This guy knows Hamilton.
You just hold him down.
Come on, Burke.
Folks.
He's pretty banged up, inside and out.
Whoever did this left him for dead.
A lesser man wouldn't have survived.
- I need a statement from him, Doctor.
- He's in no condition to give you one...
I'll also need a copy of your write-up, with toxicology...
- and blood-alcohol level.
- What are you talking about?
I'm just trying to get some facts.
You need to be arresting whoever tried to kill my brother, not testing his blood.
I'm just doing my job, Michelle.
Okay?
I understand how you feel.
But we still don't know who started all this.
- It wasn't Chris.
- Just find out who did this to him, Stan.
I'll do my best, Mr. Vaughn.
I really will.
In the meantime I have to file a full report.
Will you let me know when I can talk to him?
Thank you.
- He's going to be fine, Michelle.
- Thanks.
- Beautiful flowers.
- Thank you.
They're for my best friend.
Hey, Sarge.
So much for our VIP status.
Don't they teach you any basic fighting skills in the Army?
How did you do?
Not good.
But I tell you, that guy was feeling me this morning.
- You okay?
- That was a hell of a homecoming party.
Chris, I don't know if you noticed, but this ain't exactly home anymore.
Hang on.
Let me help you.
Come on.
I'm good, Mom.
I got it.
- Need some help?
- No.
I'm just milking it.
There's some old crutches in the garage.
- Thanks, Pete.
- Crutches.
That's nice.
Did you see the hole?
- Mind if I watch TV?
- No, that's cool.
- Somebody's feeling better.
- Little bit.
You make this?
Need anything?
- Something wrong?
- No, it's good, man.
It's good.
No, I'm good, Dad.
Thanks.
- Changed the plugs a while back.
- I appreciate that, Dad.
I might've had serious issues with your career choice... but it just didn't seem fair to take it out on an innocent truck.
Where you headed?
I was going into town to get supplies.
Want to come?
Let's go.
Your whole life, all you wanted to do was get out of here.
What made you come back now?
You're going to think I'm crazy.
I would think about the mill.
When I was a kid going to visit you at work, the smell of that fresh-cut cedar...
You remember that smell.
I remember a lot of nice things before the mill closed.
When did they go out of business?
Closed about six months ago.
There's a Home Depot about 15 minutes up the road.
And that?
Don't ask.
First of all, I just want to say thanks.
- For what?
- For making that stickman.
He's been fired and his gaming permit's been pulled.
I just have no idea why my security cameras didn't catch that.
They miss a lot in your place, don't they, Jay?
- Look, Chris, I hate seeing you like this.
- Your boys did it.
Wait a second.
So they got a little rough.
They're a bit edgy.
Understandably.
You don't know what kind of assholes they have to put up with on a daily basis.
Look, they've been reprimanded.
But they say you went nuts, man.
I'm sorry.
Insensitive.
I know the proper term that vets use is post-traumatic stress...
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Whatever.
You tore my place apart... and it wasn't easy to get my guys to agree not to press charges.
Chris, if you had a problem, shouldn't you have come to me?
I want to bring you inside.
I want to make you head of security.
- What do you say?
- No.
I guess you probably need time to think about it.
I figured as much.
This is for you.
It's a little something to help you get, you know...
Come on, man, don't be like that.
I came all the way out here to your house, just to see you get back on your feet.
I'm going to the sheriff.
I'm really sorry you feel that way.
I'll see you around, Chris.
I know, it was a good time, wasn't it?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I got to call you back.
Hey, Chris.
It's good to see you up and about.
You're looking spiffy.
I'm here to press charges.
This isn't about that incident at the casino a while back?
Yeah.
It is.
Because that matter's closed.
You're lucky you weren't brought in on charges.
I mean...
Did you even look into it?
They did an internal investigation.
That's good enough for me.
An internal investigation?
I know you're familiar with the term no-fly zone.
Because that's what the casino is.
Since the mill closed down... that casino is the main source of revenue in this town.
So case closed, basically.
We'll see you.
- I'm not going to let this stand.
- Excuse me?
- What did you say to me?
- I said I'm not going to let this stand.
You're lucky to be alive right now.
That's all you need to be concentrating on.
This is my town.
Okay?
I'm the sheriff here.
I'll tell you what will stand.
Not the other way around.
Now please get out of my building.
- Come in.
- Thanks.
This belongs to you.
I appreciate that.
I thought this was history.
- Could have left it in the trash, but I...
- Deni?
- Nice to see you, dear.
- Hi, Mrs. Vaughn.
Can I talk to you outside for a second?
Quick walk.
Mom, I'll be right back.
- How you been?
- Been better.
Talk to the sheriff yet?
I went down to the police station.
I talked to somebody with a badge.
He sure as hell didn't seem like much of a sheriff.
He's up for reelection, you know.
- Maybe you could take his job.
- Somebody ought to.
How about you?
Nothing but sunshine and pine trees.
Been reading these books.
Teach you how to cultivate your happiness.
Focus on the future.
- Go with the flow, that sort of thing.
- Is it working?
I have my moments.
So, the casino, huh?
Yeah.
Been there almost a year.
- Treating you good?
- A lot better than it treated you.
I like that.
Jay Hamilton's done well for himself, hasn't he?
He's a real go-getter, that one.
He must be.
I heard he got you.
That lasted about eight minutes.
It was a long time ago.
You still work for him, though.
Rent's got to be paid, Chris.
I suppose so.
- Hope to see you around.
- Do you?
Thanks for the jacket.
And where is he?
It's okay, Mom.
He's stabilized.
It was close.
Crystal meth.
I'm sorry.
I never did it before.
It's true.
We might've kind of pushed him into it.
- Where'd you get the drugs?
- I'm not really sure...
Stop.
Where?
From the security guys working at the casino.
Chris, wait.
Call the police.
No.
It won't do any good.
- Is Pete okay?
- He'll be fine.
What are you doing?
No, Chris.
Not like this.
Listen to me.
If you go out of here with that gun, they're going to nail...
I've been looking for you.
Guess that changes our relationship a bit, huh?
You should not have come looking for trouble.
Keep your hands up.
Get out of the vehicle now, Chris.
Now!
- Step back, please.
- Just move toward the front of the car.
Put your hands on the hood.
I advise you to give this offer more than a little serious thought.
If you go to trial, you stand to do 18 years.
Now, this is a sweetheart plea.
Normally they wouldn't even put it on the table... but your military record can't be ignored.
Three months home arrest, some community service...
- pretty generous offer, Chris.
- But I'd have to plead guilty.
Look at it from the other side.
There's over a dozen witnesses, none of whom will paint a flattering picture.
- He started busting up the machines.
- There was a gunshot.
- He just went crazy.
- A complete psychopath.
They're only offering me this deal just to keep me quiet.
I still say you should take it.
I wasn't wrong.
And I won't say I was.
Our job is to keep order.
There was no chance of that once he came in.
Me and my men, we were just trying to control him.
He's highly trained, violent.
A very dangerous person.
So violent, so dangerous, so highly trained... that he dispatched six of the casino security staff single-handedly.
Six men, single-handedly.
His weapon of choice, a simple piece of cedar... which, in his hands, became a devastating force with one aim:
To hurt people and destroy property.
He went directly for everything.
He just came in and took over the place.
- You said he broke your arm.
- Yeah, that's correct.
My right forearm.
Both bones with a single shot.
It was crazy.
Toss a couple of drunks now and then.
Guys try to grope the girls.
But nothing with this sort of violence.
Did he give you any kind of advance warning... a chance to defend yourself?
We tussled, but he's a big guy.
He was on a mission.
Besides, he seemed to be too busy enjoying himself from what I could see.
So from what you saw, he seemed to have some kind of purpose?
He had a point to prove.
I was emptying machines when he came in and started swinging.
- I was trying to get out of there.
- He was a menace.
- A very dangerous person.
- Military-trained.
He seemed like a complete psychopath.
- Nothing close to this.
- I didn't know what he'd do.
- I was frightened.
- He came for us.
- No doubt in your mind?
- No doubt.
I have no further questions.
Mr. Crowe, you may present your client's case.
You're fired.
Your Honor, I'd like to plead my own case.
Order!
If you choose to represent yourself, and not be represented by legal counsel... you realize that you can't then claim a mistrial on that basis?
- Yes, I do.
- Very well, Mr. Vaughn.
I don't deny anything that was said here today.
Does that mean you're changing your plea to guilty?
I'm not guilty of anything... except standing up for myself when the law wouldn't.
Objection.
He's trying to introduce prior events.
Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, stay on point.
I grew up in this town.
People used to walk tall in this town.
They wouldn't have traded the mill for a crooked casino.
We're not here to listen to civic speeches...
And they wouldn't have stood around while drugs were sold to kids.
- Objection!
- Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, you're close to being held in contempt.
I was justified in what I did.
And if you acquit me of these charges, then I'm gonna run for sheriff.
- Mr. Vaughn.
- And if elected, I'm gonna fix this town.
Order.
Please take your seat.
Mr. Vaughn, you are now charged with contempt.
And I will make sure that this...
- Objection.
- Sustained.
...never happens to anyone again without punishing those who did it.
I'm ordering the jury to ignore what they've just seen.
Mr. Vaughn, take your seat.
Order.
Or you're all charged with contempt!
Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
Defendant, please rise.
We find the defendant, Chris Vaughn, not guilty.
This is mine.
Sheriff Vaughn!
You won the election.
Congratulations.
But we do have a tradition of professional courtesy up here.
And I can personally vouch for each and every one of these men.
They're good deputies.
You're all fired.
- Hey, Chris.
- License and registration, please.
You're joking, right?
License and registration.
What's the problem, Sheriff?
You.
And the drugs you're peddling out of your casino.
The only thing that's going on in my casino is construction.
You took care of that.
That's right.
And I plan on taking care of everything else, too.
If you can, try to think this through:
A casino is a license to print money.
Why would I jeopardize that by selling drugs?
Because you owned the town, Jay.
That's changed now.
Really?
The only thing I think has changed around here... is that you get to wake up every morning and put on that nifty little badge.
But underneath it is the same guy who couldn't make it playing college football... and apparently couldn't make it in the Army... and not really ever gonna make it as a cop.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
And if you push too hard, you're going to be a man who never gets to see 40.
License, please.
Thanks, Sheriff.
Sir, get your taillights fixed.
It's your last warning.
What's wrong with my taillights?
They're broken.
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning, Deputy.
No.
Come on, man.
You know I hate cops.
You've been sheriff for about two minutes, and I'm already starting to hate you.
- I'm a convicted felon.
- I've got pull around here.
Now you're a crooked cop doing favors for friends.
That's how it starts.
Next thing you know you'll be taking bribes, setting up roadblocks...
- frisking dudes' crotches.
- Are you done?
- Ray, I need your help.
- Don't do that.
I need you to take me to drug school.
I get to wear a uniform?
The stuff in this town is five-star, factory pure.
- So let's go get the factory.
- Easier said than done.
We know Hamilton's boys are selling that shit down at the casino.
Yeah, but 99% of the time they're clean.
So we got to play follow-the-money, starting with the tweakers.
That'll give us the suppliers.
These guys are real edgy, so delicacy is the key.
Then we put the squeeze on them... till they spit out the location of the next buy.
- Where'd you learn that, Ray?
- Cops.
That's a good show.
Phase three:
We strike.
- I thought you said delicacy was the key.
- That's right.
Delicacy and precision.
- Hey, what's up?
- Get out of here.
- You're sure you're not carrying anything?
- I don't have shit.
- Officer.
- Yeah.
Search him.
This is going to be a switch.
Spread your legs.
Arms down.
You been working out?
Nothing there.
Somebody needs a bath.
Now you read me my rights, then you take me in... and I call my lawyer.
Okay.
But I have a hunch there may be something else in here.
Could be.
Go to it, Deputy.
Have a good time.
- He ain't talking.
- I know.
Handles pretty good.
He's clean.
Guess we got to go with Plan B.
Screw you both.
I do have a bit of information for you.
It's not just me, actually.
There's a whole lot of people in this one.
Spit it out.
You're gonna get hurt.
What an idiot.
Why does it always have to be your fight?
- You might need this.
- No.
- I put my guns down a long time ago.
- Come on.
You're just being stubborn.
You and me both, boy.
Chris, listen.
You be careful.
I will.
Please step away from the vehicle!
Mr. Booth, are you still upset over that body-cavity search?
I forgot, you got no vehicle.
Please disperse!
There is nothing to...
Can I talk to you?
- Sure.
- Over here?
I'm gonna stay here with him tonight.
I need you to look after my parents' place.
Think they're gonna take it that far?
- I'm with you, man.
I'll check in later.
- Okay.
A drive to right field.
It's dropping for a single.
You making house calls?
- Don't shoot.
- Hey.
How's the food around here?
Nice.
I brought you special treats:
Salad, fried chicken... potato salad.
- Do you have glasses?
- Yeah.
- Do you have to work tonight?
- I quit.
I figured you were making some changes around here...
I could make a few myself.
Salt and pepper?
- Who is that?
- Pete.
- Want something to eat?
- No.
I'm good, man.
I got to get a bigger bed.
No, you don't.
Do it.
I'm hungry.
We've got leftovers.
I want pancakes.
And eggs.
And bacon.
I told you, Vaughn.
Stay here.
Who needs to step away from the vehicle now, Vaughn?
Truck for a truck, baby!
That's right!
Truck for a truck!
Get down!
Tear it up, boys!
Pete, something's burning.
Take this.
Get in there.
Good morning, honey.
Get out of here.
Sheriff, are you home?
I told you someone was going to get hurt!
Come here.
When I say now, start shooting!
Over there!
Stay low.
Vaughn!
You got to get me out of here.
Move it.
Go!
Move it, old man.
- Where's Pete?
- I don't know.
Sit down.
- I know who you are.
- Oh, yeah?
- Burke?
- Son of a bitch.
Check it out.
Come on!
Get me out of here, man!
- What's it worth to you?
Where's the lab?
- Screw you!
Hamilton's operation is at the mill, okay?
Now get me out of here!
Drop it.
Stay down!
Stay down.
You okay?
Shit.
I thought I warned you, Chris.
I didn't want this to happen.
I'm going in!
Right there, punk!
Come on, Chris!
Come on!
Deni, now!
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Where is everybody?
- Pete ran outside.
You stabbed me with a potato peeler.
You gonna be okay?
Hey, Chris.
Get up, Jay.
Just a second.
Remember when we used to play hide-and-seek up here?
- That was my favorite sound.
- Get up!
Look, Chris...
You want to know what my new favorite sound's gonna be?
The sound of you screaming like a little bitch.
Bet you wish you took that job offer now?
But, no!
You had to be Mr. Hero Boy!
You forgot this:
This is my town!
Yes!
You're nothing.
You're right, Jay.
This does change our relationship.
This is my town.
You're under arrest.
That ought to do it.
What are you doing?
Getting some souvenirs.
I'm gonna miss the place.
That's how it starts.
Next you'll be accepting bribes and setting speed traps all over town.
Cutting up trucks.
You know how you are.
Not to mention the cavity searches.
You're gonna like that.
Speaking of which, do you think Jay's got a casino in the pen?
- Could be.
- Running the Shower Tower with the fellas?
He's probably blowing on somebody's dice right now.
That's lunch.
Let's go pick up my old man, grab something to eat.
I'm with you, buddy.
- Here you go.
- Thanks, man.
See you tomorrow.
How you doing?
Okay.
- When did the mill close?
- Three years ago this August.
If you're looking for work, you may want to try Aberdeen.
That's about the closest mill work you'll find.
- Too bad.
- It's just simple economics.
You know, we have a really nice casino, the Wild Cherry.
Want to make some money, maybe you ought to go on down... and try your luck at the blackjack tables.
No, I don't think so.
Thanks.
You're Chris Vaughn?
Well, hell.
I know all about you, Chris.
I know your folks.
I'm Sheriff Stan Watkins.
- How you doing?
- Ralston, get out of the car!
You're looking at a real soldier here.
Pay some respects.
- Welcome home, soldier.
- Thanks.
Well, hell, Chris.
- I'll give you a ride up to your folks'.
- No, I'm fine.
Thank you.
- I insist.
- I'll walk.
- It's my pleasure.
- It's okay.
I won't take no for an answer.
Get in the car.
- Did I scare you with that one?
- Little bit.
I scared him.
You were gone a while, huh?
Eight years.
Harstad was sheriff back then.
Aaron Harstad, yeah.
Sad story.
About five months back, he fell asleep at the wheel and hit a tree.
Car folded up like an accordion.
He was a good man.
A good man and a good sheriff.
All right.
- Thank you very much for the ride.
- Welcome home, Chris.
It's election month.
I'm your man.
Okay.
Say hey to your old man.
Let's go.
Can I help you?
Little brother.
You come over here and give me a hug.
- You look great.
- What is this?
I couldn't let you be the only one looking good in uniform.
Hey, Ma.
Chris is here.
- Whose tent?
- That's for Pete.
- Watch out, now.
- Chris.
- Look at you.
- Mom, how you doing?
How long's your leave?
How long do we have you?
For good.
I'm home.
- Really?
You're not kidding?
- No.
- Hey, Dad.
- Welcome back.
I wish you had told us exactly when you were coming.
I'd have cooked.
- This is fine, Mom.
- We love Chinese.
- No, this is great.
- So what are you going to do now?
I was planning to work at the mill, but you never mentioned it closed.
We didn't want to bother you when your father got laid off.
I got my business.
You saw the furniture outside.
And I substitute at the elementary school.
Michelle pitches in... we try to keep things simple.
Pete.
- This is your Uncle Chris.
- Hey, Pete.
Sit down.
Say hello.
Last time he saw you, you were barely walking.
- And now I'm camping.
- I said you could sleep on the couch.
It was Chris' room first.
Your tent's going to take on water.
I can show you how to rig it.
Doesn't look like it's going to rain to me, Colonel.
Sit down.
Eat something.
First of all, I was a sergeant.
I worked for a living.
A grunt.
- Did you ever smoke anybody?
- Pete!
Poppa's still got your gun locked up in the garage.
- Would you teach me how to shoot?
- I figured that'd be scrap metal by now.
No.
I'm still hoping you'll melt that thing down on your own.
- Sorry, Pete.
- Whatever.
- I'm out of here, Mom.
- Be back by 10:00.
- 10:30.
- 10:00.
Remind you of anyone?
Okay, it rained.
Happy?
No.
Why don't you crash on the floor?
Okay.
I'll crash on the floor.
You crash on the bed.
Keep you dry.
Did you really kill people?
- Ray-Ray.
- Hello, pudding.
- What's up, man?
- Good to see you, man.
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.
What is that?
- That's the Love Machine.
- Girls actually get in there?
- How you been?
- Good.
- Clean living?
- Please.
You want a beer?
No.
Believe it or not, I quit drinking.
I'd take a soda, though.
Okay.
Here.
Thanks, man.
Like that?
When you left town... it gave me the idea I should do something with my life, too.
So I went down to Seattle, got a guitar, and became all about music.
And then, pretty soon, I was about music and drugs... and pretty soon I was basically just about drugs... and ended up doing two years for B and E.
I'm sorry.
Look at me now, though, right?
I've been clean and sober 14 months.
Doing construction and renewing those supportive and healthy friendships... from my past.
Matter of fact, I talked to the bastards, told them you were back... and they asked me to politely remind you that it is Saturday.
- As in...
- As in, kick-off's in 20 minutes.
- Like old times.
- You guys still doing it.
We're still doing it.
- Playing ball?
- Absolutely.
Let's go, superstar!
- Just like the old days.
Go deep.
- Come on.
When did that happen?
Jay Hamilton Field.
His parents hadn't left him the mill for more than two minutes...
- before he shut it down.
- Why?
Heads up!
Because I opened my casino.
Still got a gun, huh, Jay?
Still got your reflexes.
What?
Did you get tired of being all that you could be?
- No.
I'm still all I can be.
- Really?
- I'll just have to see about that.
- Yeah.
- What brings you home?
- I just want to relax.
Catch my breath.
- You?
Relax?
- Yeah.
Not today.
I got it.
Let's go.
Come on!
Is that how it's going to be?
That's how it is.
- Full contact, huh?
- That's two-hand touch.
Too rough?
Sorry, ladies.
Pick up the outside!
- Fumble!
- Set!
How's that for touch?
- That was pretty, wasn't it?
- Want to go get your pads?
- That the best you got?
- What?
- Here, take a walk...
- And knock a long loose?
- Touchdown.
- First and your last.
- You want to go?
- Nobody's going.
We're not going to go.
You almost caught it.
- We stop them here, we win, right?
- Right, boys, last play.
- You know how I like winning.
- We need to put this to rest.
- I will take care of Ray.
- You two cross.
You stay in and block.
Booth?
Isolate on Vaughn.
- You two cross...
- Just give me the ball.
- Go low.
Left knee.
- All right, man.
You got it?
On the first hut.
Ready?
Break!
Be strong.
All right, Chris Vaughn.
Last chance.
- Black-nineteen!
Black!
- Watch the outside!
I'm open!
That's game.
Sorry about that.
Cool, man.
Nice game, ladies.
What the hell was that?
That was a great game, wasn't it?
Is that the bad one?
- Yeah, it was good.
- Hey, welcome home.
Good to be back.
See you around.
If you're not doing anything later on, want to come by the casino?
Introduce you to some nice girls.
Drinks are on me.
What do you say?
- See you tonight.
- Cool.
I'll see you later on.
Be good.
Hey, Sarge.
Good game.
Maybe next time.
Hold up.
Maybe next time I won't see you in the bleachers, smoking weed.
Welcome home, buddy.
I thought you had to be Native American to own a casino.
- Hamilton's one-sixteenth Blackfoot now.
- Put it on his application.
And what he slid under the table convinced the powers that be it was true.
- It's ours for the taking tonight.
- Let's pick some cherries, boys.
- Here we go.
- I'm feeling lucky.
Just so you guys know, I'm done after I triple my money.
That's what you said last time.
You wound up selling your body for bus fare.
He had to walk.
Nobody's going to have any problems finding this place.
It's the subtle attention to aesthetics that I find most impressive.
Blends in with the mountain so nicely.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
How you doing?
- See?
Not bad, huh?
- It's not bad.
A lot of pretty girls.
I'm getting chips.
Let's gamble.
We'll see you at the Shower Tower, okay?
Isn't it wonderful?
All your gambling needs under one great, big roof.
You got your ATM machines, tellers to cash your paycheck... and when you're here, you don't got to worry about things... like child support, rent, laws of mathematical probability.
Gentlemen, Mr. Hamilton would like to invite you to the VIP lounge.
- The dream team.
You all healed up?
- Nice place.
Welcome to my world.
Tonight all the drinks are on the house.
If you need a line of credit, say how much.
If you need a little female companionship, done.
All right?
- Get inside.
Have a good time.
- Where you going?
Don't you worry about me.
I got a few things to do.
Enjoy.
Just remember, nothing in here is free.
Ma'am.
- Cherry shot?
- Ray, be nice.
Come on, this place is nothing but fake boobs... and real assholes, if you ask me.
Just water for me.
Drink up.
We got money to win and girls just waiting.
- We are VIPs.
- Here's to you, Chris.
- Welcome home.
- Cheers.
Let's play, boys.
Go right ahead.
Already lost $1...
Good night.
Okay.
Don't say we never did nothing for you.
Don't worry, buddy, everybody's scared their first time.
- Come on.
- Get in there, Chris.
Okay, just sit back and enjoy it.
- This'll get you started.
- lf you're not back by morning... we'll send a search party.
- Have fun.
- Stop drinking.
You from here, or are you just visiting?
A little of both.
I grew up here.
So you're seeing all the old faces.
You could say that.
Your voice sounds very familiar.
Chris.
Deni.
- Look who's back.
- So, good surprise?
I told you it was better than gambling.
You met Candi?
- Hello.
- Hey, Candi.
Let's go.
Six, easy six.
Looking for a six to win.
We can do a six.
Can we do a six?
I think I can do a six, right?
We got liftoff!
Whack it, boys.
Whack it.
Blue or pink, what do you think?
Who's up for two out of three?
I'm getting killed.
Let me have a C-note to put $200 on a bet.
- No.
- Come on.
Hell, no.
Look at them.
He's hot.
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Give me a hard six.
- $5, hard six?
- Yes.
- I'm in.
- Hard six. $5 on hard six.
There's another $100.
Boom.
Give me some dice.
Looking for a six.
All right.
Oh, please.
Please.
Thank you.
And you.
- Jimmy, don't roll.
Give me the dice.
- No, I got it.
Hard six, six.
Looking for a six.
Seven out.
Line in, the dark side wins.
Last come'll get you some.
- You're good.
But I saw it.
- Saw what?
I saw the switch.
This is a clean game, asshole.
Let's see about that.
Bet you'll roll a seven.
It's not your roll, sir.
Sir, it's not your roll.
Will you call security?
Put your bets down on the passline.
- These dice are coming up seven.
- Why don't we just let it go?
No.
We're going to let it ride, Jimmy.
The dice are coming up seven.
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Come on, baby.
- What a surprise.
- No, folks.
No payouts.
- Wait a minute.
- Calm down.
Just take care of that bet, then we're even.
I would, but it wasn't a legitimate bet.
You're not the shooter.
- Security.
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Is there a problem?
- The problem is your dice are loaded.
Does your boss know about this?
Just give me my money.
Come on.
Let's go.
What now, bitch?
Come on!
Special Forces.
Wow.
I'll take that.
What are you doing?
Special Forces.
Special treatment.
This guy knows Hamilton.
You just hold him down.
Come on, Burke.
Folks.
He's pretty banged up, inside and out.
Whoever did this left him for dead.
A lesser man wouldn't have survived.
- I need a statement from him, Doctor.
- He's in no condition to give you one...
I'll also need a copy of your write-up, with toxicology...
- and blood-alcohol level.
- What are you talking about?
I'm just trying to get some facts.
You need to be arresting whoever tried to kill my brother, not testing his blood.
I'm just doing my job, Michelle.
Okay?
I understand how you feel.
But we still don't know who started all this.
- It wasn't Chris.
- Just find out who did this to him, Stan.
I'll do my best, Mr. Vaughn.
I really will.
In the meantime I have to file a full report.
Will you let me know when I can talk to him?
Thank you.
- He's going to be fine, Michelle.
- Thanks.
- Beautiful flowers.
- Thank you.
They're for my best friend.
Hey, Sarge.
So much for our VIP status.
Don't they teach you any basic fighting skills in the Army?
How did you do?
Not good.
But I tell you, that guy was feeling me this morning.
- You okay?
- That was a hell of a homecoming party.
Chris, I don't know if you noticed, but this ain't exactly home anymore.
Hang on.
Let me help you.
Come on.
I'm good, Mom.
I got it.
- Need some help?
- No.
I'm just milking it.
There's some old crutches in the garage.
- Thanks, Pete.
- Crutches.
That's nice.
Did you see the hole?
- Mind if I watch TV?
- No, that's cool.
- Somebody's feeling better.
- Little bit.
You make this?
Need anything?
- Something wrong?
- No, it's good, man.
It's good.
No, I'm good, Dad.
Thanks.
- Changed the plugs a while back.
- I appreciate that, Dad.
I might've had serious issues with your career choice... but it just didn't seem fair to take it out on an innocent truck.
Where you headed?
I was going into town to get supplies.
Want to come?
Let's go.
Your whole life, all you wanted to do was get out of here.
What made you come back now?
You're going to think I'm crazy.
I would think about the mill.
When I was a kid going to visit you at work, the smell of that fresh-cut cedar...
You remember that smell.
I remember a lot of nice things before the mill closed.
When did they go out of business?
Closed about six months ago.
There's a Home Depot about 15 minutes up the road.
And that?
Don't ask.
First of all, I just want to say thanks.
- For what?
- For making that stickman.
He's been fired and his gaming permit's been pulled.
I just have no idea why my security cameras didn't catch that.
They miss a lot in your place, don't they, Jay?
- Look, Chris, I hate seeing you like this.
- Your boys did it.
Wait a second.
So they got a little rough.
They're a bit edgy.
Understandably.
You don't know what kind of assholes they have to put up with on a daily basis.
Look, they've been reprimanded.
But they say you went nuts, man.
I'm sorry.
Insensitive.
I know the proper term that vets use is post-traumatic stress...
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Whatever.
You tore my place apart... and it wasn't easy to get my guys to agree not to press charges.
Chris, if you had a problem, shouldn't you have come to me?
I want to bring you inside.
I want to make you head of security.
- What do you say?
- No.
I guess you probably need time to think about it.
I figured as much.
This is for you.
It's a little something to help you get, you know...
Come on, man, don't be like that.
I came all the way out here to your house, just to see you get back on your feet.
I'm going to the sheriff.
I'm really sorry you feel that way.
I'll see you around, Chris.
I know, it was a good time, wasn't it?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I got to call you back.
Hey, Chris.
It's good to see you up and about.
You're looking spiffy.
I'm here to press charges.
This isn't about that incident at the casino a while back?
Yeah.
It is.
Because that matter's closed.
You're lucky you weren't brought in on charges.
I mean...
Did you even look into it?
They did an internal investigation.
That's good enough for me.
An internal investigation?
I know you're familiar with the term no-fly zone.
Because that's what the casino is.
Since the mill closed down... that casino is the main source of revenue in this town.
So case closed, basically.
We'll see you.
- I'm not going to let this stand.
- Excuse me?
- What did you say to me?
- I said I'm not going to let this stand.
You're lucky to be alive right now.
That's all you need to be concentrating on.
This is my town.
Okay?
I'm the sheriff here.
I'll tell you what will stand.
Not the other way around.
Now please get out of my building.
- Come in.
- Thanks.
This belongs to you.
I appreciate that.
I thought this was history.
- Could have left it in the trash, but I...
- Deni?
- Nice to see you, dear.
- Hi, Mrs. Vaughn.
Can I talk to you outside for a second?
Quick walk.
Mom, I'll be right back.
- How you been?
- Been better.
Talk to the sheriff yet?
I went down to the police station.
I talked to somebody with a badge.
He sure as hell didn't seem like much of a sheriff.
He's up for reelection, you know.
- Maybe you could take his job.
- Somebody ought to.
How about you?
Nothing but sunshine and pine trees.
Been reading these books.
Teach you how to cultivate your happiness.
Focus on the future.
- Go with the flow, that sort of thing.
- Is it working?
I have my moments.
So, the casino, huh?
Yeah.
Been there almost a year.
- Treating you good?
- A lot better than it treated you.
I like that.
Jay Hamilton's done well for himself, hasn't he?
He's a real go-getter, that one.
He must be.
I heard he got you.
That lasted about eight minutes.
It was a long time ago.
You still work for him, though.
Rent's got to be paid, Chris.
I suppose so.
- Hope to see you around.
- Do you?
Thanks for the jacket.
And where is he?
It's okay, Mom.
He's stabilized.
It was close.
Crystal meth.
I'm sorry.
I never did it before.
It's true.
We might've kind of pushed him into it.
- Where'd you get the drugs?
- I'm not really sure...
Stop.
Where?
From the security guys working at the casino.
Chris, wait.
Call the police.
No.
It won't do any good.
- Is Pete okay?
- He'll be fine.
What are you doing?
No, Chris.
Not like this.
Listen to me.
If you go out of here with that gun, they're going to nail...
I've been looking for you.
Guess that changes our relationship a bit, huh?
You should not have come looking for trouble.
Keep your hands up.
Get out of the vehicle now, Chris.
Now!
- Step back, please.
- Just move toward the front of the car.
Put your hands on the hood.
I advise you to give this offer more than a little serious thought.
If you go to trial, you stand to do 18 years.
Now, this is a sweetheart plea.
Normally they wouldn't even put it on the table... but your military record can't be ignored.
Three months home arrest, some community service...
- pretty generous offer, Chris.
- But I'd have to plead guilty.
Look at it from the other side.
There's over a dozen witnesses, none of whom will paint a flattering picture.
- He started busting up the machines.
- There was a gunshot.
- He just went crazy.
- A complete psychopath.
They're only offering me this deal just to keep me quiet.
I still say you should take it.
I wasn't wrong.
And I won't say I was.
Our job is to keep order.
There was no chance of that once he came in.
Me and my men, we were just trying to control him.
He's highly trained, violent.
A very dangerous person.
So violent, so dangerous, so highly trained... that he dispatched six of the casino security staff single-handedly.
Six men, single-handedly.
His weapon of choice, a simple piece of cedar... which, in his hands, became a devastating force with one aim:
To hurt people and destroy property.
He went directly for everything.
He just came in and took over the place.
- You said he broke your arm.
- Yeah, that's correct.
My right forearm.
Both bones with a single shot.
It was crazy.
Toss a couple of drunks now and then.
Guys try to grope the girls.
But nothing with this sort of violence.
Did he give you any kind of advance warning... a chance to defend yourself?
We tussled, but he's a big guy.
He was on a mission.
Besides, he seemed to be too busy enjoying himself from what I could see.
So from what you saw, he seemed to have some kind of purpose?
He had a point to prove.
I was emptying machines when he came in and started swinging.
- I was trying to get out of there.
- He was a menace.
- A very dangerous person.
- Military-trained.
He seemed like a complete psychopath.
- Nothing close to this.
- I didn't know what he'd do.
- I was frightened.
- He came for us.
- No doubt in your mind?
- No doubt.
I have no further questions.
Mr. Crowe, you may present your client's case.
You're fired.
Your Honor, I'd like to plead my own case.
Order!
If you choose to represent yourself, and not be represented by legal counsel... you realize that you can't then claim a mistrial on that basis?
- Yes, I do.
- Very well, Mr. Vaughn.
I don't deny anything that was said here today.
Does that mean you're changing your plea to guilty?
I'm not guilty of anything... except standing up for myself when the law wouldn't.
Objection.
He's trying to introduce prior events.
Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, stay on point.
I grew up in this town.
People used to walk tall in this town.
They wouldn't have traded the mill for a crooked casino.
We're not here to listen to civic speeches...
And they wouldn't have stood around while drugs were sold to kids.
- Objection!
- Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, you're close to being held in contempt.
I was justified in what I did.
And if you acquit me of these charges, then I'm gonna run for sheriff.
- Mr. Vaughn.
- And if elected, I'm gonna fix this town.
Order.
Please take your seat.
Mr. Vaughn, you are now charged with contempt.
And I will make sure that this...
- Objection.
- Sustained.
...never happens to anyone again without punishing those who did it.
I'm ordering the jury to ignore what they've just seen.
Mr. Vaughn, take your seat.
Order.
Or you're all charged with contempt!
Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
Defendant, please rise.
We find the defendant, Chris Vaughn, not guilty.
This is mine.
Sheriff Vaughn!
You won the election.
Congratulations.
But we do have a tradition of professional courtesy up here.
And I can personally vouch for each and every one of these men.
They're good deputies.
You're all fired.
- Hey, Chris.
- License and registration, please.
You're joking, right?
License and registration.
What's the problem, Sheriff?
You.
And the drugs you're peddling out of your casino.
The only thing that's going on in my casino is construction.
You took care of that.
That's right.
And I plan on taking care of everything else, too.
If you can, try to think this through:
A casino is a license to print money.
Why would I jeopardize that by selling drugs?
Because you owned the town, Jay.
That's changed now.
Really?
The only thing I think has changed around here... is that you get to wake up every morning and put on that nifty little badge.
But underneath it is the same guy who couldn't make it playing college football... and apparently couldn't make it in the Army... and not really ever gonna make it as a cop.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
And if you push too hard, you're going to be a man who never gets to see 40.
License, please.
Thanks, Sheriff.
Sir, get your taillights fixed.
It's your last warning.
What's wrong with my taillights?
They're broken.
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning, Deputy.
No.
Come on, man.
You know I hate cops.
You've been sheriff for about two minutes, and I'm already starting to hate you.
- I'm a convicted felon.
- I've got pull around here.
Now you're a crooked cop doing favors for friends.
That's how it starts.
Next thing you know you'll be taking bribes, setting up roadblocks...
- frisking dudes' crotches.
- Are you done?
- Ray, I need your help.
- Don't do that.
I need you to take me to drug school.
I get to wear a uniform?
The stuff in this town is five-star, factory pure.
- So let's go get the factory.
- Easier said than done.
We know Hamilton's boys are selling that shit down at the casino.
Yeah, but 99% of the time they're clean.
So we got to play follow-the-money, starting with the tweakers.
That'll give us the suppliers.
These guys are real edgy, so delicacy is the key.
Then we put the squeeze on them... till they spit out the location of the next buy.
- Where'd you learn that, Ray?
- Cops.
That's a good show.
Phase three: we strike.
- I thought you said delicacy was the key.
- That's right.
Delicacy and precision.
- Hey, what's up?
- Get out of here.
- You're sure you're not carrying anything?
- I don't have shit.
- Officer.
- Yeah.
Search him.
This is going to be a switch.
Spread your legs.
Arms down.
You been working out?
Nothing there.
Somebody needs a bath.
Now you read me my rights, then you take me in... and I call my lawyer.
Okay.
But I have a hunch there may be something else in here.
Could be.
Go to it, Deputy.
Have a good time.
- He ain't talking.
- I know.
Handles pretty good.
He's clean.
Guess we got to go with Plan B.
Screw you both.
I do have a bit of information for you.
It's not just me, actually.
There's a whole lot of people in this one.
Spit it out.
You're gonna get hurt.
What an idiot.
Why does it always have to be your fight?
- You might need this.
- No.
- I put my guns down a long time ago.
- Come on.
You're just being stubborn.
You and me both, boy.
Chris, listen.
You be careful.
I will.
Please step away from the vehicle!
Mr. Booth, are you still upset over that body-cavity search?
I forgot, you got no vehicle.
Please disperse!
There is nothing to...
Can I talk to you?
- Sure.
- Over here?
I'm gonna stay here with him tonight.
I need you to look after my parents' place.
Think they're gonna take it that far?
- I'm with you, man.
I'll check in later.
- Okay.
A drive to right field.
It's dropping for a single.
You making house calls?
- Don't shoot.
- Hey.
How's the food around here?
Nice.
I brought you special treats:
Salad, fried chicken... potato salad.
- Do you have glasses?
- Yeah.
- Do you have to work tonight?
- I quit.
I figured you were making some changes around here...
I could make a few myself.
Salt and pepper?
- Who is that?
- Pete.
- Want something to eat?
- No.
I'm good, man.
I got to get a bigger bed.
No, you don't.
Do it.
I'm hungry.
We've got leftovers.
I want pancakes.
And eggs.
And bacon.
I told you, Vaughn.
Stay here.
Who needs to step away from the vehicle now, Vaughn?
Truck for a truck, baby!
That's right!
Truck for a truck!
Get down!
Tear it up, boys!
Pete, something's burning.
Take this.
Get in there.
Good morning, honey.
Get out of here.
Sheriff, are you home?
I told you someone was going to get hurt!
Come here.
When I say now, start shooting!
Over there!
Stay low.
Vaughn!
You got to get me out of here.
Move it.
Go!
Move it, old man.
- Where's Pete?
- I don't know.
Sit down.
- I know who you are.
- Oh, yeah?
- Burke?
- Son of a bitch.
Check it out.
Come on!
Get me out of here, man!
- What's it worth to you?
Where's the lab?
- Screw you!
Hamilton's operation is at the mill, okay?
Now get me out of here!
Drop it.
Stay down!
Stay down.
You okay?
Shit.
I thought I warned you, Chris.
I didn't want this to happen.
I'm going in!
Right there, punk!
Come on, Chris!
Come on!
Deni, now!
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Where is everybody?
- Pete ran outside.
You stabbed me with a potato peeler.
You gonna be okay?
Hey, Chris.
Get up, Jay.
Just a second.
Remember when we used to play hide-and-seek up here?
- That was my favorite sound.
- Get up!
Look, Chris...
You want to know what my new favorite sound's gonna be?
The sound of you screaming like a little bitch.
Bet you wish you took that job offer now?
But, no!
You had to be Mr. Hero Boy!
You forgot this: this is my town!
Yes!
You're nothing.
You're right, Jay.
This does change our relationship.
This is my town.
You're under arrest.
That ought to do it.
What are you doing?
Getting some souvenirs.
I'm gonna miss the place.
That's how it starts.
Next you'll be accepting bribes and setting speed traps all over town.
Cutting up trucks.
You know how you are.
Not to mention the cavity searches.
You're gonna like that.
Speaking of which, do you think Jay's got a casino in the pen?
- Could be.
- Running the Shower Tower with the fellas?
He's probably blowing on somebody's dice right now.
That's lunch.
Let's go pick up my old man, grab something to eat.
I'm with you, buddy.
The end
- Here you go.
- Thanks, man.
See you tomorrow.
How you doing?
Okay.
- When did the mill close?
- Three years ago this August.
If you're looking for work, you may want to try Aberdeen.
That's about the closest mill work you'll find.
- Too bad.
- It's just simple economics.
You know, we have a really nice casino, the Wild Cherry.
Want to make some money, maybe you ought to go on down... and try your luck at the blackjack tables.
No, I don't think so.
Thanks.
You're Chris Vaughn?
Well, hell.
I know all about you, Chris.
I know your folks.
I'm Sheriff Stan Watkins.
- How you doing?
- Ralston, get out of the car!
You're looking at a real soldier here.
Pay some respects.
- Welcome home, soldier.
- Thanks.
Well, hell, Chris.
- I'll give you a ride up to your folks'.
- No, I'm fine.
Thank you.
- I insist.
- I'll walk.
- It's my pleasure.
- It's okay.
I won't take no for an answer.
Get in the car.
- Did I scare you with that one?
- Little bit.
I scared him.
You were gone a while, huh?
Eight years.
Harstad was sheriff back then.
Aaron Harstad, yeah.
Sad story.
About five months back, he fell asleep at the wheel and hit a tree.
Car folded up like an accordion.
He was a good man.
A good man and a good sheriff.
All right.
- Thank you very much for the ride.
- Welcome home, Chris.
It's election month.
I'm your man.
Okay.
Say hey to your old man.
Let's go.
Can I help you?
Little brother.
You come over here and give me a hug.
- You look great.
- What is this?
I couldn't let you be the only one looking good in uniform.
Hey, Ma.
Chris is here.
- Whose tent?
- That's for Pete.
- Watch out, now.
- Chris.
- Look at you.
- Mom, how you doing?
How long's your leave?
How long do we have you?
For good.
I'm home.
- Really?
You're not kidding?
- No.
- Hey, Dad.
- Welcome back.
I wish you had told us exactly when you were coming.
I'd have cooked.
- This is fine, Mom.
- We love Chinese.
- No, this is great.
- So what are you going to do now?
I was planning to work at the mill, but you never mentioned it closed.
We didn't want to bother you when your father got laid off.
I got my business.
You saw the furniture outside.
And I substitute at the elementary school.
Michelle pitches in... we try to keep things simple.
Pete.
- This is your Uncle Chris.
- Hey, Pete.
Sit down.
Say hello.
Last time he saw you, you were barely walking.
- And now I'm camping.
- I said you could sleep on the couch.
It was Chris' room first.
Your tent's going to take on water.
I can show you how to rig it.
Doesn't look like it's going to rain to me, Colonel.
Sit down.
Eat something.
First of all, I was a sergeant.
I worked for a living.
A grunt.
- Did you ever smoke anybody?
- Pete!
Poppa's still got your gun locked up in the garage.
- Would you teach me how to shoot?
- I figured that'd be scrap metal by now.
No.
I'm still hoping you'll melt that thing down on your own.
- Sorry, Pete.
- Whatever.
- I'm out of here, Mom.
- Be back by 10:00.
- 10:30.
- 10:00.
Remind you of anyone?
Okay, it rained.
Happy?
No.
Why don't you crash on the floor?
Okay.
I'll crash on the floor.
You crash on the bed.
Keep you dry.
Did you really kill people?
- Ray-Ray.
- Hello, pudding.
- What's up, man?
- Good to see you, man.
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.
What is that?
- That's the Love Machine.
- Girls actually get in there?
- How you been?
- Good.
- Clean living?
- Please.
You want a beer?
No.
Believe it or not, I quit drinking.
I'd take a soda, though.
Okay.
Here.
Thanks, man.
Like that?
When you left town... it gave me the idea I should do something with my life, too.
So I went down to Seattle, got a guitar, and became all about music.
And then, pretty soon, I was about music and drugs... and pretty soon I was basically just about drugs... and ended up doing two years for B and E.
I'm sorry.
Look at me now, though, right?
I've been clean and sober 14 months.
Doing construction and renewing those supportive and healthy friendships... from my past.
Matter of fact, I talked to the bastards, told them you were back... and they asked me to politely remind you that it is Saturday.
- As in...
- As in, kick-off's in 20 minutes.
- Like old times.
- You guys still doing it.
We're still doing it.
- Playing ball?
- Absolutely.
Let's go, superstar!
- Just like the old days.
Go deep.
- Come on.
When did that happen?
Jay Hamilton Field.
His parents hadn't left him the mill for more than two minutes...
- before he shut it down.
- Why?
Heads up!
Because I opened my casino.
Still got a gun, huh, Jay?
Still got your reflexes.
What?
Did you get tired of being all that you could be?
- No.
I'm still all I can be.
- Really?
- I'll just have to see about that.
- Yeah.
- What brings you home?
- I just want to relax.
Catch my breath.
- You?
Relax?
- Yeah.
Not today.
I got it.
Let's go.
Come on!
Is that how it's going to be?
That's how it is.
- Full contact, huh?
- That's two-hand touch.
Too rough?
Sorry, ladies.
Pick up the outside!
- Fumble!
- Set!
How's that for touch?
- That was pretty, wasn't it?
- Want to go get your pads?
- That the best you got?
- What?
- Here, take a walk...
- And knock a long loose?
- Touchdown.
- First and your last.
- You want to go?
- Nobody's going.
We're not going to go.
You almost caught it.
- We stop them here, we win, right?
- Right, boys, last play.
- You know how I like winning.
- We need to put this to rest.
- I will take care of Ray.
- You two cross.
You stay in and block.
Booth?
Isolate on Vaughn.
- You two cross...
- Just give me the ball.
- Go low.
Left knee.
- All right, man.
You got it?
On the first hut.
Ready?
Break!
Be strong.
All right, Chris Vaughn.
Last chance.
- Black-nineteen!
Black!
- Watch the outside!
I'm open!
That's game.
Sorry about that.
Cool, man.
Nice game, ladies.
What the hell was that?
That was a great game, wasn't it?
Is that the bad one?
- Yeah, it was good.
- Hey, welcome home.
Good to be back.
See you around.
If you're not doing anything later on, want to come by the casino?
Introduce you to some nice girls.
Drinks are on me.
What do you say?
- See you tonight.
- Cool.
I'll see you later on.
Be good.
Hey, Sarge.
Good game.
Maybe next time.
Hold up.
Maybe next time I won't see you in the bleachers, smoking weed.
Welcome home, buddy.
I thought you had to be Native American to own a casino.
- Hamilton's one-sixteenth Blackfoot now.
- Put it on his application.
And what he slid under the table convinced the powers that be it was true.
- It's ours for the taking tonight.
- Let's pick some cherries, boys.
- Here we go.
- I'm feeling lucky.
Just so you guys know, I'm done after I triple my money.
That's what you said last time.
You wound up selling your body for bus fare.
He had to walk.
Nobody's going to have any problems finding this place.
It's the subtle attention to aesthetics that I find most impressive.
Blends in with the mountain so nicely.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
How you doing?
- See?
Not bad, huh?
- It's not bad.
A lot of pretty girls.
I'm getting chips.
Let's gamble.
We'll see you at the Shower Tower, okay?
Isn't it wonderful?
All your gambling needs under one great, big roof.
You got your ATM machines, tellers to cash your paycheck... and when you're here, you don't got to worry about things... like child support, rent, laws of mathematical probability.
Gentlemen, Mr. Hamilton would like to invite you to the VIP lounge.
- The dream team.
You all healed up?
- Nice place.
Welcome to my world.
Tonight all the drinks are on the house.
If you need a line of credit, say how much.
If you need a little female companionship, done.
All right?
- Get inside.
Have a good time.
- Where you going?
Don't you worry about me.
I got a few things to do.
Enjoy.
Just remember, nothing in here is free.
Ma'am.
- Cherry shot?
- Ray, be nice.
Come on, this place is nothing but fake boobs... and real assholes, if you ask me.
Just water for me.
Drink up.
We got money to win and girls just waiting.
- We are VIPs.
- Here's to you, Chris.
- Welcome home.
- Cheers.
Let's play, boys.
Go right ahead.
Already lost $1...
Good night.
Okay.
Don't say we never did nothing for you.
Don't worry, buddy, everybody's scared their first time.
- Come on.
- Get in there, Chris.
Okay, just sit back and enjoy it.
- This'll get you started.
- lf you're not back by morning... we'll send a search party.
- Have fun.
- Stop drinking.
You from here, or are you just visiting?
A little of both.
I grew up here.
So you're seeing all the old faces.
You could say that.
Your voice sounds very familiar.
Chris.
Deni.
- Look who's back.
- So, good surprise?
I told you it was better than gambling.
You met Candi?
- Hello.
- Hey, Candi.
Let's go.
Six, easy six.
Looking for a six to win.
We can do a six.
Can we do a six?
I think I can do a six, right?
We got liftoff!
Whack it, boys.
Whack it.
Blue or pink, what do you think?
Who's up for two out of three?
I'm getting killed.
Let me have a C-note to put $200 on a bet.
- No.
- Come on.
Hell, no.
Look at them.
He's hot.
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Give me a hard six.
- $5, hard six?
- Yes.
- I'm in.
- Hard six. $5 on hard six.
There's another $100.
Boom.
Give me some dice.
Looking for a six.
All right.
Oh, please.
Please.
Thank you.
And you.
- Jimmy, don't roll.
Give me the dice.
- No, I got it.
Hard six, six.
Looking for a six.
Seven out.
Line in, the dark side wins.
Last come'll get you some.
- You're good.
But I saw it.
- Saw what?
I saw the switch.
This is a clean game, asshole.
Let's see about that.
Bet you'll roll a seven.
It's not your roll, sir.
Sir, it's not your roll.
Will you call security?
Put your bets down on the passline.
- These dice are coming up seven.
- Why don't we just let it go?
No.
We're going to let it ride, Jimmy.
The dice are coming up seven.
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Come on, baby.
- What a surprise.
- No, folks.
No payouts.
- Wait a minute.
- Calm down.
Just take care of that bet, then we're even.
I would, but it wasn't a legitimate bet.
You're not the shooter.
- Security.
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Is there a problem?
- The problem is your dice are loaded.
Does your boss know about this?
Just give me my money.
Come on.
Let's go.
What now, bitch?
Come on!
Special Forces.
Wow.
I'll take that.
What are you doing?
Special Forces.
Special treatment.
This guy knows Hamilton.
You just hold him down.
Come on, Burke.
Folks.
He's pretty banged up, inside and out.
Whoever did this left him for dead.
A lesser man wouldn't have survived.
- I need a statement from him, Doctor.
- He's in no condition to give you one...
I'll also need a copy of your write-up, with toxicology...
- and blood-alcohol level.
- What are you talking about?
I'm just trying to get some facts.
You need to be arresting whoever tried to kill my brother, not testing his blood.
I'm just doing my job, Michelle.
Okay?
I understand how you feel.
But we still don't know who started all this.
- It wasn't Chris.
- Just find out who did this to him, Stan.
I'll do my best, Mr. Vaughn.
I really will.
In the meantime I have to file a full report.
Will you let me know when I can talk to him?
Thank you.
- He's going to be fine, Michelle.
- Thanks.
- Beautiful flowers.
- Thank you.
They're for my best friend.
Hey, Sarge.
So much for our VIP status.
Don't they teach you any basic fighting skills in the Army?
How did you do?
Not good.
But I tell you, that guy was feeling me this morning.
- You okay?
- That was a hell of a homecoming party.
Chris, I don't know if you noticed, but this ain't exactly home anymore.
Hang on.
Let me help you.
Come on.
I'm good, Mom.
I got it.
- Need some help?
- No.
I'm just milking it.
There's some old crutches in the garage.
- Thanks, Pete.
- Crutches.
That's nice.
Did you see the hole?
- Mind if I watch TV?
- No, that's cool.
- Somebody's feeling better.
- Little bit.
You make this?
Need anything?
- Something wrong?
- No, it's good, man.
It's good.
No, I'm good, Dad.
Thanks.
- Changed the plugs a while back.
- I appreciate that, Dad.
I might've had serious issues with your career choice... but it just didn't seem fair to take it out on an innocent truck.
Where you headed?
I was going into town to get supplies.
Want to come?
Let's go.
Your whole life, all you wanted to do was get out of here.
What made you come back now?
You're going to think I'm crazy.
I would think about the mill.
When I was a kid going to visit you at work, the smell of that fresh-cut cedar...
You remember that smell.
I remember a lot of nice things before the mill closed.
When did they go out of business?
Closed about six months ago.
There's a Home Depot about 15 minutes up the road.
And that?
Don't ask.
First of all, I just want to say thanks.
- For what?
- For making that stickman.
He's been fired and his gaming permit's been pulled.
I just have no idea why my security cameras didn't catch that.
They miss a lot in your place, don't they, Jay?
- Look, Chris, I hate seeing you like this.
- Your boys did it.
Wait a second.
So they got a little rough.
They're a bit edgy.
Understandably.
You don't know what kind of assholes they have to put up with on a daily basis.
Look, they've been reprimanded.
But they say you went nuts, man.
I'm sorry.
Insensitive.
I know the proper term that vets use is post-traumatic stress...
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Whatever.
You tore my place apart... and it wasn't easy to get my guys to agree not to press charges.
Chris, if you had a problem, shouldn't you have come to me?
I want to bring you inside.
I want to make you head of security.
- What do you say?
- No.
I guess you probably need time to think about it.
I figured as much.
This is for you.
It's a little something to help you get, you know...
Come on, man, don't be like that.
I came all the way out here to your house, just to see you get back on your feet.
I'm going to the sheriff.
I'm really sorry you feel that way.
I'll see you around, Chris.
I know, it was a good time, wasn't it?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I got to call you back.
Hey, Chris.
It's good to see you up and about.
You're looking spiffy.
I'm here to press charges.
This isn't about that incident at the casino a while back?
Yeah.
It is.
Because that matter's closed.
You're lucky you weren't brought in on charges.
I mean...
Did you even look into it?
They did an internal investigation.
That's good enough for me.
An internal investigation?
I know you're familiar with the term no-fly zone.
Because that's what the casino is.
Since the mill closed down... that casino is the main source of revenue in this town.
So case closed, basically.
We'll see you.
- I'm not going to let this stand.
- Excuse me?
- What did you say to me?
- I said I'm not going to let this stand.
You're lucky to be alive right now.
That's all you need to be concentrating on.
This is my town.
Okay?
I'm the sheriff here.
I'll tell you what will stand.
Not the other way around.
Now please get out of my building.
- Come in.
- Thanks.
This belongs to you.
I appreciate that.
I thought this was history.
- Could have left it in the trash, but I...
- Deni?
- Nice to see you, dear.
- Hi, Mrs. Vaughn.
Can I talk to you outside for a second?
Quick walk.
Mom, I'll be right back.
- How you been?
- Been better.
Talk to the sheriff yet?
I went down to the police station.
I talked to somebody with a badge.
He sure as hell didn't seem like much of a sheriff.
He's up for reelection, you know.
- Maybe you could take his job.
- Somebody ought to.
How about you?
Nothing but sunshine and pine trees.
Been reading these books.
Teach you how to cultivate your happiness.
Focus on the future.
- Go with the flow, that sort of thing.
- Is it working?
I have my moments.
So, the casino, huh?
Yeah.
Been there almost a year.
- Treating you good?
- A lot better than it treated you.
I like that.
Jay Hamilton's done well for himself, hasn't he?
He's a real go-getter, that one.
He must be.
I heard he got you.
That lasted about eight minutes.
It was a long time ago.
You still work for him, though.
Rent's got to be paid, Chris.
I suppose so.
- Hope to see you around.
- Do you?
Thanks for the jacket.
And where is he?
It's okay, Mom.
He's stabilized.
It was close.
Crystal meth.
I'm sorry.
I never did it before.
It's true.
We might've kind of pushed him into it.
- Where'd you get the drugs?
- I'm not really sure...
Stop.
Where?
From the security guys working at the casino.
Chris, wait.
Call the police.
No.
It won't do any good.
- Is Pete okay?
- He'll be fine.
What are you doing?
No, Chris.
Not like this.
Listen to me.
If you go out of here with that gun, they're going to nail...
I've been looking for you.
Guess that changes our relationship a bit, huh?
You should not have come looking for trouble.
Keep your hands up.
Get out of the vehicle now, Chris.
Now!
- Step back, please.
- Just move toward the front of the car.
Put your hands on the hood.
I advise you to give this offer more than a little serious thought.
If you go to trial, you stand to do 18 years.
Now, this is a sweetheart plea.
Normally they wouldn't even put it on the table... but your military record can't be ignored.
Three months home arrest, some community service...
- pretty generous offer, Chris.
- But I'd have to plead guilty.
Look at it from the other side.
There's over a dozen witnesses, none of whom will paint a flattering picture.
- He started busting up the machines.
- There was a gunshot.
- He just went crazy.
- A complete psychopath.
They're only offering me this deal just to keep me quiet.
I still say you should take it.
I wasn't wrong.
And I won't say I was.
Our job is to keep order.
There was no chance of that once he came in.
Me and my men, we were just trying to control him.
He's highly trained, violent.
A very dangerous person.
So violent, so dangerous, so highly trained... that he dispatched six of the casino security staff single-handedly.
Six men, single-handedly.
His weapon of choice, a simple piece of cedar... which, in his hands, became a devastating force with one aim:
To hurt people and destroy property.
He went directly for everything.
He just came in and took over the place.
- You said he broke your arm.
- Yeah, that's correct.
My right forearm.
Both bones with a single shot.
It was crazy.
Toss a couple of drunks now and then.
Guys try to grope the girls.
But nothing with this sort of violence.
Did he give you any kind of advance warning... a chance to defend yourself?
We tussled, but he's a big guy.
He was on a mission.
Besides, he seemed to be too busy enjoying himself from what I could see.
So from what you saw, he seemed to have some kind of purpose?
He had a point to prove.
I was emptying machines when he came in and started swinging.
- I was trying to get out of there.
- He was a menace.
- A very dangerous person.
- Military-trained.
He seemed like a complete psychopath.
- Nothing close to this.
- I didn't know what he'd do.
- I was frightened.
- He came for us.
- No doubt in your mind?
- No doubt.
I have no further questions.
Mr. Crowe, you may present your client's case.
You're fired.
Your Honor, I'd like to plead my own case.
Order!
If you choose to represent yourself, and not be represented by legal counsel... you realize that you can't then claim a mistrial on that basis?
- Yes, I do.
- Very well, Mr. Vaughn.
I don't deny anything that was said here today.
Does that mean you're changing your plea to guilty?
I'm not guilty of anything... except standing up for myself when the law wouldn't.
Objection.
He's trying to introduce prior events.
Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, stay on point.
I grew up in this town.
People used to walk tall in this town.
They wouldn't have traded the mill for a crooked casino.
We're not here to listen to civic speeches...
And they wouldn't have stood around while drugs were sold to kids.
- Objection!
- Sustained.
Mr. Vaughn, you're close to being held in contempt.
I was justified in what I did.
And if you acquit me of these charges, then I'm gonna run for sheriff.
- Mr. Vaughn.
- And if elected, I'm gonna fix this town.
Order.
Please take your seat.
Mr. Vaughn, you are now charged with contempt.
And I will make sure that this...
- Objection.
- Sustained.
...never happens to anyone again without punishing those who did it.
I'm ordering the jury to ignore what they've just seen.
Mr. Vaughn, take your seat.
Order.
Or you're all charged with contempt!
Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
Defendant, please rise.
We find the defendant, Chris Vaughn, not guilty.
This is mine.
Sheriff Vaughn!
You won the election.
Congratulations.
But we do have a tradition of professional courtesy up here.
And I can personally vouch for each and every one of these men.
They're good deputies.
You're all fired.
- Hey, Chris.
- License and registration, please.
You're joking, right?
License and registration.
What's the problem, Sheriff?
You.
And the drugs you're peddling out of your casino.
The only thing that's going on in my casino is construction.
You took care of that.
That's right.
And I plan on taking care of everything else, too.
If you can, try to think this through:
A casino is a license to print money.
Why would I jeopardize that by selling drugs?
Because you owned the town, Jay.
That's changed now.
Really?
The only thing I think has changed around here... is that you get to wake up every morning and put on that nifty little badge.
But underneath it is the same guy who couldn't make it playing college football... and apparently couldn't make it in the Army... and not really ever gonna make it as a cop.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
And if you push too hard, you're going to be a man who never gets to see 40.
License, please.
Thanks, Sheriff.
Sir, get your taillights fixed.
It's your last warning.
What's wrong with my taillights?
They're broken.
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning, Deputy.
No.
Come on, man.
You know I hate cops.
You've been sheriff for about two minutes, and I'm already starting to hate you.
- I'm a convicted felon.
- I've got pull around here.
Now you're a crooked cop doing favors for friends.
That's how it starts.
Next thing you know you'll be taking bribes, setting up roadblocks...
- frisking dudes' crotches.
- Are you done?
- Ray, I need your help.
- Don't do that.
I need you to take me to drug school.
I get to wear a uniform?
The stuff in this town is five-star, factory pure.
- So let's go get the factory.
- Easier said than done.
We know Hamilton's boys are selling that shit down at the casino.
Yeah, but 99% of the time they're clean.
So we got to play follow-the-money, starting with the tweakers.
That'll give us the suppliers.
These guys are real edgy, so delicacy is the key.
Then we put the squeeze on them... till they spit out the location of the next buy.
- Where'd you learn that, Ray?
- Cops.
That's a good show.
Phase three: we strike.
- I thought you said delicacy was the key.
- That's right.
Delicacy and precision.
- Hey, what's up?
- Get out of here.
- You're sure you're not carrying anything?
- I don't have shit.
- Officer.
- Yeah.
Search him.
This is going to be a switch.
Spread your legs.
Arms down.
You been working out?
Nothing there.
Somebody needs a bath.
Now you read me my rights, then you take me in... and I call my lawyer.
Okay.
But I have a hunch there may be something else in here.
Could be.
Go to it, Deputy.
Have a good time.
- He ain't talking.
- I know.
Handles pretty good.
He's clean.
Guess we got to go with Plan B.
Screw you both.
I do have a bit of information for you.
It's not just me, actually.
There's a whole lot of people in this one.
Spit it out.
You're gonna get hurt.
What an idiot.
Why does it always have to be your fight?
- You might need this.
- No.
- I put my guns down a long time ago.
- Come on.
You're just being stubborn.
You and me both, boy.
Chris, listen.
You be careful.
I will.
Please step away from the vehicle!
Mr. Booth, are you still upset over that body-cavity search?
I forgot, you got no vehicle.
Please disperse!
There is nothing to...
Can I talk to you?
- Sure.
- Over here?
I'm gonna stay here with him tonight.
I need you to look after my parents' place.
Think they're gonna take it that far?
- I'm with you, man.
I'll check in later.
- Okay.
A drive to right field.
It's dropping for a single.
You making house calls?
- Don't shoot.
- Hey.
How's the food around here?
Nice.
I brought you special treats:
Salad, fried chicken... potato salad.
- Do you have glasses?
- Yeah.
- Do you have to work tonight?
- I quit.
I figured you were making some changes around here...
I could make a few myself.
Salt and pepper?
- Who is that?
- Pete.
- Want something to eat?
- No.
I'm good, man.
I got to get a bigger bed.
No, you don't.
Do it.
I'm hungry.
We've got leftovers.
I want pancakes.
And eggs.
And bacon.
I told you, Vaughn.
Stay here.
Who needs to step away from the vehicle now, Vaughn?
Truck for a truck, baby!
That's right!
Truck for a truck!
Get down!
Tear it up, boys!
Pete, something's burning.
Take this.
Get in there.
Good morning, honey.
Get out of here.
Sheriff, are you home?
I told you someone was going to get hurt!
Come here.
When I say now, start shooting!
Over there!
Stay low.
Vaughn!
You got to get me out of here.
Move it.
Go!
Move it, old man.
- Where's Pete?
- I don't know.
Sit down.
- I know who you are.
- Oh, yeah?
- Burke?
- Son of a bitch.
Check it out.
Come on!
Get me out of here, man!
- What's it worth to you?
Where's the lab?
- Screw you!
Hamilton's operation is at the mill, okay?
Now get me out of here!
Drop it.
Stay down!
Stay down.
You okay?
Shit.
I thought I warned you, Chris.
I didn't want this to happen.
I'm going in!
Right there, punk!
Come on, Chris!
Come on!
Deni, now!
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Where is everybody?
- Pete ran outside.
You stabbed me with a potato peeler.
You gonna be okay?
Hey, Chris.
Get up, Jay.
Just a second.
Remember when we used to play hide-and-seek up here?
- That was my favorite sound.
- Get up!
Look, Chris...
You want to know what my new favorite sound's gonna be?
The sound of you screaming like a little bitch.
Bet you wish you took that job offer now?
But, no!
You had to be Mr. Hero Boy!
You forgot this: this is my town!
Yes!
You're nothing.
You're right, Jay.
This does change our relationship.
This is my town.
You're under arrest.
That ought to do it.
What are you doing?
Getting some souvenirs.
I'm gonna miss the place.
That's how it starts.
Next you'll be accepting bribes and setting speed traps all over town.
Cutting up trucks.
You know how you are.
Not to mention the cavity searches.
You're gonna like that.
Speaking of which, do you think Jay's got a casino in the pen?
- Could be.
- Running the Shower Tower with the fellas?
He's probably blowing on somebody's dice right now.
That's lunch.
Let's go pick up my old man, grab something to eat.
I'm with you, buddy.
E. R.
Previously on E.R.
- How's your dad doing?
- Okay.
I've got a nurse for him 16 hours a day.
And then from 11 to 7, it's just me.
- What happened?
That was yours.
- No, it's a trauma.
- No medical-record number yet.
Thanks.
- Don't say thank you...
- ...and don't let the boys bully you.
- I wasn't letting the boys-
You play with your hair when you're nervous.
Wanna get some dinner?
Thanks, I have plans already.
- Not with anyone, if you're wondering.
- Not a problem.
You abandoned that kid.
- My shift was over.
- He was counting on you.
- I had a gig.
- Screw your gig!
Medicine isn't a day job!

Jing-Mei.
- Come when I call you.
- Why do you do this?
Please.
Papa, I can't.
Jing-Mei.
Okay.
Okay.
I promise.
Why's your brother here?
Your parents live in Winnetka.
Ben's in the Peace Corps and they bug him to get a real job.
That sounds familiar.
- If I get this sofa bed...
- They're checking the stock.
All right, thanks.
- You the youngest?
- Oldest.
Ben and my little sister, Tess.
She's a junior partner in my dad's firm.
I wonder who the favorite is.
- You have siblings?
- My brother died when I was 11.
- I'm sorry.
- We have the sofa bed in stock but only in moss green, not black.
- Green's fine.
Can you deliver it today?
- On Christmas Eve?
- Could tie it to the roof of the car.
- You think?
That's why you brought me along, isn't it?
A little brawn?
- We'll take it.
I'll go pay.
- I'll go find some rope.
- Meet you at the checkout.
- All right, thanks.
Can you say anything?
Can you talk?
Oh, no.
It's okay.
I was actually helping her.
She was choking on a piece of-
He grabbed my daughter.
I'm a doc- I think we should get out of here.
- What happened?
- I saved that little girl's life.
- What's he saying?
- "Thanks"?
We did it when I was a kid.
No way.
Gifts get opened on Christmas morning.
- Tell Dr. Lewis we'll be back for more.
- Where are you taking them?
- Washington Library on State Street.
- The library?
They keep opening up public buildings until everybody's in.
If Alex opens a gift tonight-
It's cheating to open a gift the night before.
...then he won't be so desperate to get up which means he'll sleep in, which means we get to sleep in.
- Oh, okay.
- Plus, it's just fun.
Is that a trick so you can open your gift tonight?

Increased work breathing, crackles bilaterally.
- Wife's behind us.
- Gonna be below 10 degrees soon.
- Merry Christmas.
- Excuse us.
Keep this pathway clear.
- Get a history?
- Read it and weep.

- Okay, out of the way.
- Okay, out of the way.

- Dialysis-dependent, renal failure.
- Dialyzed yesterday, two hours.
- Coronary artery disease.
Yeah, come on.
Okay, let's go.
- Hypertension, hepatitis C.
- And a partridge in a pear tree.
- Sorry, I'm a handful.
- Morris.
Stop eating.
- We got a hundred people waiting.
- Lewis already loaded me up.
- Pratt, is your CVA out of Trauma 1?
- ICU just called for him.
- Sats correlating at 89.
- Okay, crank up the O2.
- Abby, I have six charts for you.
- I haven't even taken my coat off yet.
Oh, Carter, stay on with DHS.
You have to pound them to pick up the homeless.
- Right.
Squeaky wheel.
- Yeah.
It'll calm down soon enough.
- They're not in by midnight, they'll freeze.
- Susan, you around tomorrow?
Well, I'm on at 3 but we'll be hanging out till then.
Bring Henry by.
Oh, I will.
I got something for Cosmo.
I want you to see Henry in his Santa suit.
- You got a headache?
- No, I got a backache.
I was helping move a couch.
Who is on with me?
- Chen, but she's running a little late.
- Becoming a habit.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, my God.
Did you just re-gift right in front of me?
Yep.
I'm your secret Santa.
Enjoy.
Established rheumatology patient seen by Doctor Scheer.
Spear, not Scheer.
I'm the wife, Carol Shoup-Sanders.
- It's Jared Spear.
- Sorry.
That's Spear.
Dr. Spear.
Can you touch your chin to your chest?
- I have his medical history here.
- He's tachypneic, pulse ox is borderline.
- We can order records.
- You'll prefer mine.
Concise.
- Honey, let them work.
- Tilt your head all the way back.
You need my help.
They just don't know it yet.
- No.
He needs to be admitted.
- Okay, let's sit him up.
Gonna make you more comfortable, Mr. Sanders.
- Robert.
- Okay, how long was he unconscious?
Forty-seven seconds.
- What happened before that?
- I stood up from the dinner table.
- He felt short of breath, dizzy.
- Chest pain?
- No.
- Rheum's not coming in.
- Dr. Spear?
- He was unavailable.
The primary complaint sounded cardiac.
We'll give him nitrates, call Cardiology.
We have a great cardiologist, Dr. Knauth.
K-N-A-U-T-H.
Well, shouldn't somebody be writing this down?
Another shelter van's here.
Let's go.
I'll take the first 20 people.
Male, 62, lives under a bridge, says he's having chest pain.
Register him.
Check a 12-lead, pulse ox, chest film.
Diagnosis: hunger, cold.
Aftercare: food, warmth.
Hey, Jake Scanlon, fourth year, transferred from Creighton.
Hey, Jake.
This guy knows if he says chest pain he'll be here 16 hours and get a tray of food.
So let me do you a favor.
Listen up, everyone.
The vans are here to take you all to the Holiday Inn.
- Ray.
- That is right.
Thank the mayor.
There'll be plenty of food.
Remember, it's all good at the Holiday Inn.
- Liar.
- It works.
Only the sick ones are staying.
Don't give him any credit.
Very good.
Trick the needy.
It's a holiday.
And it's someplace like an inn.
All right, get in the van.
- Ready?
Gotta get Alex in 20 minutes.
- Yeah.
Abby, is that our Cardiology on Mr. Sanders?
I'm on hold.
But go.
I'll present to Carter or Chen.
- Thanks, Abby.
- You sure?
You've been on since 7 this morning.
Somebody should have Christmas.
- Yeah, Alex is pretty excited.
- Alex or you?
- Go ahead.
We're fine.
We're fine.
- Thanks.
- Hi.
I'm calling about Robert Sanders.
- Abby, is Kovac still here?
Admit.
Yeah.
Cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema.
- Luka.
- Hey, I have a lupus patient for you...
- ...in Trauma 1.
Sanders.
- No, no.
I can't stay.
I'm just here to pick up meds for my dad.
Look, I know it's a lot to ask, but can you cover my shift?
- It's Christmas Eve.
- I know.
I'll do New Year's.
Ready, Freddy?
I'm sorry.
I can't cover for you.
It's a family emergency.
I wouldn't ask otherwise.
Are you serious?
For tonight?
Come on.
It's my first Christmas with Sam and Alex.
I can't help you this time.
I'm sorry.
Dr. Chen, this is Margaret.
She'll be temp-clerking this evening.
- Hi.
- Yeah.
Nice to meet you.
- Not a big fan of the Yuletide.
- Is Lewis still here?
Headed towards the exit, as am I. Merry Christmas.
- Yeah.
Merry Christmas.
- What does that mean, exactly?
What? "Merry Christmas"?
You could at least examine him before you blow me off-
Okay, BNP, fine.
Happy holidays to you too.
Never get sick on Christmas.
Hey, did you call Psych?
- Yes.
I suggested they bring kibble.
- Okay.
And you can go home.
- Students don't have to work holidays.
- I volunteered.
That's twisted.
Next year, I'm inventing a family so I won't work on Christmas.
- What did Dr. Knauth say?
- Cardiology thinks it's a kidney problem.
- How's the breathing, Mr. Sanders?
- Hanging in there.
- Dr. MacPherson's our kidney guy.
- Right.
He's on call tonight.
Thought I told you to go home.
BP, 195/105.
Heart rate, 115.
Resps, 30.
Sats, 93.
CBC, troponin, chem-7, and Card suggested BNP.
- What the hell is that?
- B-type natriuretic peptide.
I will double check that dosage.
Get started on the rest.
- Get me a suture kit for the head lac.
- You got it.
- What did you say your name was?
- Jake.
Jing-Mei, I am sorry about your dad.
I really am.
- But I keep cutting you breaks.
- I know, and I appreciate it.
- This'll be the last time.
- Oh, man.
There is no way I can get anyone to cover tonight.
It's impossible.
- Susan, please.
- I hate to be hard-core, but I can't.
Look, can you stay?
I have a baby.
And a guy who's been watching him 24/7.
And I just worked a 14-hour shift.
No, I can't.
Well, maybe Carter can handle it.
He's got Abby and Morris.
We're inundated with homeless from the city roundup.
- I know.
- We're already understaffed.
Jing-Mei, please.
You have to understand.
- I do.
It's okay.
- Good.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, Susan.
I quit.
And so the holiday begins.
Happy, happy, joy, joy, everyone.

I'm Dr. Carter.

One, two, three.
Okay.
Large-bore IV, 500 of saline, open.
What happened?
- Car hit him.
- Came out of nowhere.
- Weak femoral.
Was he thrown?
- Diffused ecchymosis on the chest.
- He was outside.
- I parked the car.
He was getting out.
- Harry flew up in the air.
- Mattie.
- Systolic's 77.
- You guys are okay?
You're not hurt?
- We're okay.
They checked us.
- Tenderness, crepitus over the chest wall.
- What's that mean?
- He has multiple rib fractures.
- Mom, it hurts.
- Baby, I'm here.
Okay, CBC, type and cross for forehead, chest and belly CT, trauma panel, and a femoral line.
- Pulse is up to 138.
- Okay, rush the blood bank.
- He could be anxious or bleeding out.
- Bleeding out?
- It's okay, Mattie.
- We'll take care of him.
- Why don't we take Mattie for a walk?
- I wanna stay here.
Can I stay here?
I'll set her up in the Family Room.
Come on, Mattie.
Let's go.
Dr. MacPherson, this is Lockhart again in the ER.
I'm calling about Robert Sanders.
I know his wife can be a pain in the ass but tonight he has a real-
Problem.
And he needs dialysis.
And call me back.
Abby, take this thyromegaly and be well.
As you can see, I have a party to attend.
- Where are you going?
- Not that you'd know but it's the Players Ball at The Peninsula.
Kanye West...
- ...
Twista, the whole Roc-A-Fella
- Hello.
- Hi, I'm looking for a doctor.
Well, that would be me.
How can I help you?
- I'm looking for Dr. Morris.
- Morris.
No, see, what you need is...
- ...somebody with more experience in-
- Hey, hey.
Hi.
Glad you could make it.
Come on.
I'll show you around.
- Bye.
- Bye.
She's with Morris.
- Chen just quit.
Where's Carter?
- Quit what?
- The hospital.
Where's Carter?
- Trauma 2, I think.
- Quit for good?
- Is she all right?
She's burnt out.
We're screwed.
I can't believe it.
Chen.
- Your secret Santa gift.
- From you?
No.
It was in the lounge with your name.
What's with Chen?
- I don't know.
She's not answering.
- "Rats, Lice, and History"?
That's a good one.
Someone really likes you.
I got a Pez dispenser.
- See y'all later.
- Happy Christmas.
Hey, I got a 39-year-old IV-DU, narcotic withdrawal.
- I'm dying.
- This guy needs detox.
- Get him 2.1 of clonidine.
- Hey, what are you doing?
This is a publicly-funded hospital, and this is an illegal religious artifact.
- Well, it's Christmas.
- So?
So put it back.
- Sharps back.
Pericardiocentesis needle.
- Systolic's 82 on one liter.
- Carter, Chen just quit.
- Harry, you're gonna feel a little pressure.
- She quit?
- Heart rate's trending up.
Yeah.
That's the tamponade limiting contractions.
- Gotta up the rate to compensate.
- What's that mean?
There's blood around his heart.
We'll relieve it.
- PVCs.
- Yeah, I'm in but not getting anything.
- Lift up his head a bit.
- Chuny, close to trauma...
- ...and refuse any more homeless.
- Good idea.
Did you smell Triage?
How can people stink so much in cold weather?
Oil of wintergreen on a mask or breathe through your mouth.
You're not staying?
There's blood in there.
But it's either clotted or it's collecting posteriorly.
- Can't get it with a needle.
Page CT surg.
- Oh, I'll get Neela.
- If I leave now, I can still make my plane.
- Forget about your plane.
- I promised my mother.
- Your mother?
- Look, somebody's gotta stay.
- I'll page Surgery.
Ask for an echo-guided pericardial window.
- Hey, Carter, do you have a minute?
- Yeah.
Titrate the dopamine to a systolic of 90.
Keep paging CT surg.
All right, Harry's stable.
And Dr. Barnett is here.
Apparently.
My lupus patient.
Pulmonary edema's worse and his pressure sucks.
- Can you take a look?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
- So Chen quit?
What was it?
Her dad?
Yeah.
I'll go home, have dinner with Chuck and Cosmo sing some carols, come back.
- Chuck's been cooking, my dad's there.
- All right, go home.
- If we're busy, I'll call.
Otherwise, stay.
- Thank you.
You're amazing.
Thank you.
- Come be amazing over here.
- I'll check in later.
- Did you call his primaries?
- Rheum says he's too sick for them call Cardiology.
Card says call Renal.
Renal says he just had dialysis it's not their problem.
- BP is dropping, 88/59.
- Stop that BNP drip, lower his head.
Yeah, I tried that.
He desats.
- Hard to breathe.
Carol?
- She's gonna come right back.
Abby, you gave nitropaste and BNP drip?
Give two vasodilators and his pressure bottoms out.
You try getting hold of three specialists on Christmas Eve.
You're his doctor.
Now he's got crackles in the apices.
Is Renal coming to take off the fluid?
- No.
- What do you mean, no?
He was dialyzed yesterday, so Renal thinks there's another explanation.
- What do you think it is?
- He got half his usual dialysis time because of the holidays, ate salty food, flooded his lungs.
- So...
- I'm waiting to hear from MacPherson the Renal Attending.
- Dr. Agbo from Surgery's here.
- Agbo?
I've never heard of him.
- Junior fella, sweaty palms.
- See?
Nobody wants to be here tonight.
- Including me.
- Okay.
Why don't you call Dr. Mac-What's-His-Name again.
Remember, nobody knows what your patient needs now better than you do.
- Sats only 88.
- Put him on a nonrebreather.
That should help.
I'll be right back, okay?
These are Robert's medical records.
- Listen.
About today on the phone-
- Pain in the ass that I am I got them from Records myself.
Otherwise, you'd have them tomorrow.
Now will you look at my file?
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?
Heard a crazy story about you quitting.
Can I come in?
You know, thanks, Greg, but I'm fine.
Thanks for coming by.
Hey, you need some help?
Yeah, get me some Ativan, please.
- How much?
- Two milligrams.
- What happened at work today?
- Sometimes he's cooperative and lucid.
- Sometimes he's like this.
- Sundowning.
Sundowning?
That's too nice a word for it.
- Give me my pants, please.
- You know, you got a lot of Ativan here.
Potassium too.
Jing-Mei, what are you doing?
Talk to me.
What's going on?
I'll relieve the blood accumulating around the heart.
- Is that the pericardium?
-10 blade and pickups to me.
Watch over my boy.
Keep him safe in your arms.
McAlpin catheter, 60-cc syringe.
Quickly.
- Whoa, a hundred cc's right there.
- Keep him safe, I beg you.
- Another 60-cc syringe, quickly.
- Hey, man.
- Dr. Agbo?
- God be with you.
- Maybe I nicked the vessel.
- Give me some sterile eights.
- Jesus, I call on you.
- PVCs.
Bigeminy.
- Pull that catheter back.
- I can get it.
- It's my fault.
Sorry.
I didn't mean to-
- Shut up, Mattie!
- Hey!
- Mrs. Price, take your daughter outside.
- No.
I wanna stay with my son.
- I said pull that catheter back.
- The blood will just reaccumulate.
- Get out of the way.
Out of the way.
- V-tach.
Crash cart.
- Catheter is out.
- Charged to 100.
Clear.
- Just wait.
Just wait.
Normal sinus.
All right. 3-0 and a needle driver.
That's good.
Right?
That's good?
- Dr. Carter?
- Take this girl to the Family Room page Social Services, and stay with her until they get here.
No.
Feeling better?
- A little.
- Don't lie.
He's not better.
Look at him.
BP's stabilized, 119/85.
Pulse down to 115.
He's had lupus cerebritis?
Two years ago.
It calmed down after a steroid burst.
Okay.
I'd like to get a head scan to make sure the cerebritis isn't back and there's no internal bleeding.
- I have a discharge and then I'll take you.
- I could take him.
- Do you know where it is?
- Can his wife come with us?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
Put him on a portable monitor and O2, and call me if you have any questions.
Okay?
Okay.
Would you like to color?
Are you excited about Santa coming tonight?
- Why not?
- Santa's not coming for me.
Mattie, that's not true.
- Hey.
- I thought you had a plane to catch.
Hey, Mattie.
How you doing?
You know, when I was a kid, I used to fight with my brother all the time.
Did he get hurt?
Yeah, he got hurt.
I got hurt.
Kids get hurt sometimes, by accident.
I was mad at him for not playing with me.
So I threw his book out.
And he went to get it, and got hit.
- Mattie, it's not your fault Harry got hurt.
- It is.
I tried to help him but I couldn't.
- I had to go get my mom.
- Your mom wasn't there?
She was at work.
- You and Harry were alone in the car?
- We live in the car.
Don't tell my mom.
I'm not supposed to say that.
My father's a doctor.
He knows what he's asking.
Without the G-tube and IV, he would've died weeks ago.
Oh, so now lifesaving technology is bad?
- If someone doesn't want it.
- How do you know he doesn't?
- He's not even in his right mind.
- After he sleeps, he's lucid.
Each time, every day, he begs me to help him.
Removing the support's not enough.
It would take him days to die of dehydration and he'd be in misery.
- Put him in a nursing home.
- So he can be somebody else's problem?
- Who doesn't know or love him?
- He won't even know that he's there.
You're not Chinese.
So it's Chinese to euthanize your elders.
It's Chinese to respect them.
Here you go.
You should go.
I don't want you here.
You've been through a hell of a lot this last year.
You need a break.
Put him in a home for a month so you can catch your breath.
I can't.
We fight to save lives every day.
You know, we literally bust our asses to give people a few more hours of living.
You're a doctor, you can't just cross that line like it's nothing.
Quality of life is the only measure that matters.
My proud father is lying in his own feces.
He can't eat without vomiting, can't sleep.
He knows what he's asking for and he knows he can get that from me.
If you weren't a physician, you couldn't do this.
But I am and I can.
Why haven't you done it up till now?
If he's been asking so much?
Because you know deep, down inside it would haunt you for the rest of your life.
Why haven't you done it yet?
Maybe I don't have the courage.
It's over.
Christ is born.
It's only midnight?
Feels like 4 in the morning.
Margaret, if you turn off these lights one more time...
- ...
I'll beat you to death with a fruitcake.
- This is totally loser's Christmas.
Give that back, you little minx.
Okay.
Rudolfo, can you blow like you're blowing out candles on a birthday cake?
- Too many cold.
- Does it hurt to breathe in?
Lockhart, your lupus patient's coding in the scanner.
All right.
Neela, chest film and O2.
- Got it.
- Hey.
Hey.
It was cool what you did with that little girl.
- Telling her about your brother.
- Yeah.
I think it helped.
Although I don't actually have any siblings.
Why does that not surprise me?
Social Work's got Mattie, Carter says I can go.
Can I sign out Harry to you?
- I thought you missed your flight.
- I'll go standby.
Don't want to disappoint Mom on Christmas.
- Do something.
- BP's 83/50.
- Cycle the dynamap.
- What happened?
- Central line got caught and it pulled out.
- Bleeding won't stop.
- Not with lupus-associated coagulopathy.
- Heart rate's dropping.
Okay, 8-0 and a mac tube now.
Ma'am, please step back.
Let us help your husband.
Put pressure right here.
Don't check it.
Don't let go.
- Sats, 68.
- Yeah, he's hypoxic.
I get it, thanks.
- Oh, God.
Please don't let it be tonight.
- I'm sorry.
- Tube.
- Pulse, 64.
- I'm not ready for him to die.
- I'm in.
- Sats coming up.
- Run, don't walk to the blood bank.
Four units of O-neg.
Work on type-specific.
- I'll meet you in the Trauma Room.
- He's stable?
He needs blood.
We're gonna start a central line.
- Can an Attending do it?
- I put in lines all the time.
He's been through enough.
I want a surgical Attending.
He's moving in the right direction.
He's gonna spend the night in here until an ICU bed opens up.
You were at work when this happened?
We've been living in the car since I left my husband three weeks ago.
It wasn't bad when the kids were in school but since Christmas vacation started...
You left them in the car?
I gotta work.
It's okay, Mama.
Can their dad help?
He's a violent guy.
I could take it, but he was starting in on Harry.
So I...
Yeah.
We're a little concerned about the amount of strain that you've been under.
I didn't want Mattie saying how it was because I don't want anyone taking my kids.
We're not homeless people.
I got a job.
This is just temporary.
I can help you find a place to stay until you get on your feet.
We tried the shelter.
It isn't safe for the kids.
No, this isn't a shelter.
It's a house for families fleeing domestic violence.
It's safe.
Thank you.
I'm sorry that I yelled at you, honey.
Don't be scared of me, okay?
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- Oh, no.
You didn't do anything wrong.
Come here.
So, what do you think?
I think the bad guy's the driver, not the mother.
Lady needs a break.
Cafeteria's serving up a feast.
Better get up there.
Hey, Morris.
Burgers probably would've been safer.
Speaking of, I'm hungry.
Wanna get something to eat?
- Just lost my appetite.
- Dr. Carter.
Phone call from Africa.
It's Kem somebody.
Catch you later.
- Hello?
- John.
- Hi.
- What are you doing?
I'm not doing anything.
I'm just working.
No.
It's too cold to snow here.
Maybe tomorrow.
It's okay.
It's okay.
No, no.
It's okay.
Calm down.
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Bring more Ativan!
- I add five of Haldol when he's like this.
Okay, calm down.
- What is he saying?
- To let him go.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Papa.
Okay, now squeeze.
Hold on.
No, no.
Both hands.
Both hands.
Let go of my hand.
Let go-
- Squeeze the trigger.
- My hands are shaking.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Neela, Raphaella Greenberg.
Are you a medical student?
I'm his girlfriend.
- HIPAA?
Patient privacy?
- Stapling, it's nothing.
- This guy's totally out of it.
- This is so wrong.
Well, I'll staple.
You watch.
Security!
Security!
Somebody get Security!
Give me a reason!
- Give me a reason!
- Stop it!
- Whose patient is this?
- Mine.
Mr. Beidermeier.
- I need help!
- Get Security to cuff him to a bed, huh?
Get him on monitor until we figure out what he took.
- Should've let him OD!
- Come on.
Up, up.
- That's the Christmas spirit.
- Yeah.
Back to bed, Mr. Beidermeier.
At least have him arrested.
- What's your name again?
- Margaret.
Margaret, we're good here.
Crap.
Got a flash.
Guide wire.
Didn't you come because the wife wants you?
Not her call.
I like to make a small nick with an 11 blade.
She's afraid Abby might kill her husband.
I don't think she will.
Okay.
Catheter.
Tachy at 110.
BP, 94/79.
Sats, 86.
That's as good as he's gonna get until he's dialyzed.
His lungs are swimming in fluid.
Nice.
Threading easily.
Good.
Thank you for coming in.
It's my job.
You want to admit him to your service?
All those other docs are blowing me off.
Santa Claus is coming to town.
Okay, removing the introducer, 10-cc syringe.
Legally and morally they have to come when you call or lose staff privileges.
- Don't think they heard about my power.
- They're aware.
They take advantage...
- ...of submissive interns.
- I'm not submissive.
- Nice return.
- I know.
Like many interns and, well, many females you incline yourself toward popularity and equate it with success.
Well, when an ER doc is popular, someone's losing out.
And it's usually the patient.
- All this guy has is you.
- Infusing well.
Needle driver.
All right.
Well, good job.
Really good job, Abby.
I'll finish up.
Yeah, go.
Go out there and do what you have to do.
By the by, did you get the book?
Rats, Lice, and History?
You're my secret Santa?
Yeah, I'm quite excited to discuss it with you.
The chapter on the influence of vermin epidemics on political and military history, and the relative unimportance of generals is outrageous.
Oh, 4-0 silk.
- Submissive.
- Not a word I would use to describe you.
Okay.
Time to get unpopular.
Look, I take full responsibility for what happened with Sanders.
You didn't do it, the tech did.
I shouldn't have sent a student to CT.
I want you to send me, okay?
It won't happen again.
So, what did you learn from all this?
Always go home when you tell me.
- Hi.
Is this the dialysis tech?
- It's kind of late.
Yeah, I know.
It's 2 a. m.
I'm sorry to wake you.
What did he say?
He thanked me.
Said I was a good daughter.
You are.
You want me to do it?
Lab called on Vivadi Sanito.
- The coags were QNS.
- Okay.
And Betty Muldoon was admitted to Medicine.
Can I get a cab voucher?
Huh?
I don't think we're quite ready to discharge you, Mr. Claus.
Dialysis for patient Sanders.
- Do you want me to...?
- No, no.
I got it.
Thank you.
Hi.
Thanks for coming in.
Double overtime on holidays.
But I just did Robert Sanders yesterday.
Yeah.
He's
- His fluid overloaded.
- MacPherson call in orders?
- I spoke to him on the phone.
- What did he want?
- The usual, standard run.
2K bath, 35 bicarb, pull off a couple liters.
- Two or four hours?
- I'm not sure about that.
- I'll give him a call.
- Well, actually Dr. MacPherson very specifically said he did not wanna be disturbed.
He wouldn't come in.
He wouldn't come in.
What a prick.
But I need orders.
Okay.
Okay, well, do you think you could get started and then call him?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
- All right.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
MacPherson ordered dialysis?
No.
I did.
You?
You can't order...
Thank you.
Merry Christmas.
Tetanus is up to date.
I was putting a sled together and I sliced myself on the metal runners.
It doesn't look too bad to me, Mr. Rotolo.
Santa's gotta get home, doc.
Know what I mean?
Me and Mrs. Claus have things to take care of before the kids wake up.
- Won't take long.
You feel that?
- Yeah.
- Feel that?
- Yeah.
Excuse me, Dr. Carter.
When you have a minute?
Sure.
Irrigate, open up a suture kit.
I'll be right back.
I have something for you.
- But I haven't wrapped it, it's at home-
- Liar.
But my birthday's in two weeks.
- "Mildred"?
- Oh, sorry.
Mildred didn't show.
I was giving out a bunch of these.
Just a little something.
So how was your phone call?
It's good.
She's good.
Oh, yeah.
Very handy.
- For hooking up the VCR.
- Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You look like an old-fashioned doctor.
I am an old-fashioned doctor.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Okay.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Ho, ho, ho.
Merry Christmas.
- We got sliders.
- Yes!
You will never be more loved than you are at this moment.
Oh, I could eat about three dozen of these.
- Hi.
- Hi.
So is this the little homeless boy?
Should we treat as inpatient?
- Is he hypoxic?
- No.
- Tolerating POs?
- Yeah.
Then he only needs PO antibiotics.
- And a warm bed.
- I'll call the Pedes team.
Hi, Rudolfo.
Hello, doctors.
- Hi.
- You got a chimney?
I'm sorry, honey.
What?
How's Santa Claus gonna find me if you don't got a chimney?
We don't need a chimney.
Santa sees everything.
He'll find you.
But you'll have to go to sleep before he comes, all right?
Good night.
Do you think Dad has a present for his son?
Doubt Dad's got enough for their breakfast.
Santa Claus better come up with something.
- Jumbo Mart?
- Do you have any cash on you?
- No.
- No.
Jing-Mei it's been over an hour.
You okay?
I'll call the mortuary in the morning.
What are you gonna do after that?
Well, I have to go to China and bury my father next to my mom.
Deal with his estate.
Bum around.
Visit the village where they were born.
Meet some relatives.
I don't know.
I'm pretty tired.
Well, you know if there's anything I can do.
I mean it.
Anything.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you for-
That's okay.
Come here.
- Where are we going?
- Ho, ho, ho, and a jolly old soul.
- Sikhs don't have Christmas.
- Grew up in England.
Old King Wenceslas, Boxing Day and a family tradition of anonymous kindness.
- Where'd you get that key?
- Wendall from Social Work.
- I have a plan.
- A sly and cunning plan?
We give these toys and books to the homeless kids in the ER.
Stealing from the bad off to give to the worse off.
We buy new stuff tomorrow in the after-Christmas sales.
- Belated gift for Child Life Department.
- Do we have ribbons or paper?
We can steal bows from the decorations in the cafeteria.
- What's up?
- I thought you'd be in Miami by now.
O'Hare's a mess.
No seats until tomorrow.
Miami?
I thought your mother was in Philadelphia.
Hey, it's snowing.
Come on.
Hey, if it's snowing, that means it's warming up.
You knew he was in Miami?
He's got a girlfriend that lives there.
I worked his shift because he gave me some sob story about his mother.
Barnett, you back already?
I can't stay away.
I love it!
- Does snow get polluted?
- Where's Lockhart?
Dr. MacPherson?
I didn't authorize dialysis for Sanders.
You started it without my approval.
I wanna speak to your Attending.
Your patient was drowning.
He needed dialysis.
You're an Attending on-call.
I covered your ass.
You can't just deceive Attendings when you don't agree.
You report me for working the system, I report you for abandoning your patient.
Go, Abby.
See you inside.
- Miami?
- Come on.
Let's get back to work.
This is Jing-Mei Chen.
I woke up this morning and found my father had passed away in the night.
Yes.
He's been very ill.
Well, actually, his physician is here.
He can sign the death certificate.
Thank you.
It's 2753 West Cedar Drive.

Previously on E.R:
- How's your dad doing?
- Okay.
Got a nurse for him 16 hours a day, and then from 11:00 to 7:00 it's just me.
What happened there, doctor?
That was your patient.
No, it's a trauma.
No medical record number yet, thanks.
Don't say please and thank you to the blood bank, and don't let the boys bully you.
I wa...
I wasn't letting the boys...
You play with your hair when you're nervous.
Want to get some dinner?
Thanks.
I have plans already.
Not with anyone, if that's what you're wondering.
Not a problem.
- You abandoned that kid.
- My shift was over.
He was counting on you.
- I had a gig.
- Screw your gig!
Medicine isn't a day job!
Jing-Mei!
Jing-Mei!
- Come when I call you.
- Why do you do this?
- Please?
- Papa, I can't.
Okay.
Okay.
I promise.
So how come your brother's staying with you?
Your parents live in Winnetka.
Ben's in the Peace Corps.
My parents are always bugging him to get a real job.
That sounds familiar.
If I can just get the sofa bed.
They're checking to see if we have it in stock.
All right.
Thanks.
- You the youngest?
- No, oldest.
Ben and my little sister Tess.
She's a junior partner in my dad's firm.
I wonder who the favorite is.
Do you have siblings?
My brother died when I was 11.
I'm sorry.
We have the sofa bed in stock, but only in moss green, not black.
All right, green's fine.
Can you deliver it today?
On Christmas Eve?
I could probably tie that to the roof of the car.
You think?
It's why you brought me along, isn't it?
A little brawn?
- We'll take it.
I'll go pay.
- I'll go find some rope.
- Meet you at the checkout.
- All right, thanks.
Can you say anything?
Can you talk?
Okay, you're choking, so I'm going to do this really hard, okay?
Mom!
No, no, it's okay.
I was actually helping her.
She was choking on the little piece....
I'm a doc...
I think we should get out of here.
- What happened?
- I saved that little girl's life.
- What's he saying?
- Uh, "thanks"?
We did it when I was a kid.
No way.
Gifts get opened on Christmas morning.
Tell Dr. Lewis we'll be back for more as soon as we can.
Where are you taking them?
Harold Washington Library on State Street.
The library?
They keep opening up public buildings until everybody's in.
If Alex opens a gift tonight...
No, it's cheating if you open a gift the night before.
Then he won't be so desperate to get up, which means he'll sleep in, which means we get to sleep in.
- Oh, okay.
- Plus it's just fun.
Is that a trick so you can open your gift tonight?
Robert Sanders, 42.
Syncopal episode at home.
Hit his head on a chair on the way down.
Mr. Sanders, I'm Dr. Kovac.
190/100. 110 and 130.
Glucose 125.
- I can't get a sat.
- It's too cold to read.
- You guys need some help?
- So it seems.
Increased work breathing, crackles bilaterally.
Wife's a few minutes behind us.
Gonna be below ten degrees tonight.
Merry Christmas.
Excuse us, please.
You have to keep this pathway clear.
- Medical history?
- Read it and weep.
Get out of the way now.
Okay. "Systemic lupus erythematosis."
Diagnosed 20 years ago.
"Dialysis-dependent renal failure."
I dialyzed yesterday, two hours.
"Coronary artery disease."
Yeah, come on.
Okay, let's go.
"Hypertension, Hepatitis "C."
And a partridge in a pear tree.
Sorry.
I'm a handful.
Hey, Morris, stop eating.
We got a hundred people in the waiting area.
Lewis already loaded me up.
Pratt, is your CVA out of trauma one?
ICU just called for him.
- Sats correlating at 89.
- Okay.
Crank up the O2.
Abby, I have six charts for you.
I haven't even taken my coat off yet.
Oh, Carter, stay on with DHS.
You have to pound them to pick up the homeless.
Right.
Squeaky wheel.
Yeah, it'll calm down soon enough.
If they're not in by midnight, they'll be frozen.
Susan, you guys going to be around tomorrow?
Oh, yeah.
Well, I'm on at 3:00, but we'll be hanging till then.
You should bring Henry by.
Oh, I will.
I got something for Cosmo and I want you to see Henry in his Santa suit.
- You got a headache?
- No, I got a backache.
I was helping a friend move a couch.
Who else is on with me?
Uh, Chen, but she's running a little late.
It's becoming a habit.
Merry Christmas.
Did you just re-gift this right in front of me?
Yep.
I'm your Secret Santa.
Enjoy.
He's an established rheumatology patient, followed by Dr. Scheer.
Spear, not Scheer.
I'm the wife-- Carol Shoup-Sanders.
It's Jared Spear.
Sorry, that's Spear-
- Dr. Spear.
Can you touch your chin to your chest?
I have a complete file of Robert's medical history right here.
Yeah, and his pulse ox is borderline.
We can order his records.
Believe me, you'll prefer mine;
more concise.
Honey, let them work.
Tilt your head all the way back.
You need my help.
You just don't know it yet.
Uh, no, he needs to be admitted.
Let's sit him up.
We're gonna make you more comfortable, Mr. Sanders.
Robert.
Okay, how long was he unconscious?
47 seconds.
What happened before that?
I stood up from the dinner table...
He felt short of breath and dizzy.
- Any chest pain?
- No.
Rheum's not coming in.
Dr. Spear?
He was unavailable.
They said the primary complaint sounded cardiac so we have to give him nitrates and call Cardiology.
We have a great cardiologist;
Dr. Knauth.
K-N-A-U-T-H.
Shouldn't somebody be writing this down?
Another shelter van's here.
Let's go.
I'll take the first 20 people.
62-year-old male.
Lives under a bridge says he's having chest pain.
Get him registered and check a 12 lead pulse ox and take a chest film.
Diagnosis: hunger, cold aftercare, food, warmth.
Hey, Jake Scanlon, fourth year.
Transferred from Creighton.
Hey, Jake.
This guy knows if he says "chest pain"
he'll be here for 16 hours and he'll get a tray of food.
So let me do you a favor.
Listen up, everyone.
The vans are here to take you all to the Holiday Inn.
That is right.
Thank the Mayor.
There'll be plenty of food, and remember, it's all good at the Holiday Inn.
Liar.
It's working.
Only the sick ones are staying.
Don't give him any credit.
Very good.
Trick the needy.
It's a holiday, and they're going someplace that's like an inn.
All right, man, get in the van.
You about ready?
We got to pick up Alex in about 20 minutes.
Yeah.
Hey, Abby, is that a cardiology on Mr. Sanders?
Yeah.
I'm on hold.
But you guys go.
I'll present to Carter or Chen.
Thanks, Abby.
Sure?
Well, you've been on since 7:00 this morning.
Somebody should have Christmas.
Yeah, Alex is pretty excited.
Alex or you?
- Go ahead.
We're fine.
We're fine.
- Thanks.
Hi, I'm calling about patient Robert Sanders.
- Abby, is Kovac still here?
- Admit.
Yeah, cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema.
Luka.
Hey, I have a lupus patient for you in trauma one.
Sanders.
No, no, I can't stay.
I'm just here to pick up meds for my dad.
Look, I know it's a lot to ask, but can you cover my shift?
It's Christmas Eve.
I know.
I'll do New Years.
Ready, Freddy?
I'm sorry.
I can't cover for you.
It's a family emergency.
I wouldn't ask otherwise.
Are you serious?
For tonight?
Come on.
It's my first Christmas with Sam and Alex.
I can't help you this time.
I'm sorry.
Dr. Chen, this is Margaret.
She'll be temp clerking this evening.
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
Not a big fan of the yuletide.
Oh, is Lewis still here?
Headed towards the exit as am I.
- Merry Christmas.
- Yeah.
Merry Christmas.
What does that mean exactly?
What, Merry Christmas?
You could at least examine him before you blow me o...
Okay, BNP, fine.
Happy Holidays to you, too.
Never get sick on Christmas.
Hey, did you call Psych?
Yes.
I suggested they bring Kibble.
Okay.
And you can go home.
Med students don't have to work holidays.
I volunteered.
That's twisted.
Next year I'm inventing a family so I don't have to work on Christmas.
What did Dr. Knauth say?
Cardiology thinks it's a kidney problem.
How's the breathing, Mr. Sanders?
Hanging... in there.
Dr. MacPherson's our kidney guy.
Right, he's on call tonight.
I thought I told you to go home?
BP 195/105, heart rate 115, resps 30, sats 93.
CBC, troponin, chem seven and Cards suggested BNP...
What the hell is that?
B-type natriuretic peptide.
I will double-check the dosage on that.
Can you get me started on the other stuff and get me a suture kit for the head lac?
You got it.
What'd you say your name was?
Jake.
Jing-Mei, I am sorry about your dad, I really am, but I've been cutting you breaks for weeks.
I know and I appreciate it.
This'll be the last time.
Oh, man.
There is no way I can get anyone to cover tonight.
It's impossible.
Susan, please.
I hate to be hardcore, but I can't.
Can you stay?
I have a baby and a guy who's been watching him 24/7.
And I just worked a 14-hour shift.
No, I can't.
Maybe Carter can handle it, he's got Abby and Morris.
We are inundated with homeless from the city roundup.
I know.
We're already understaffed.
Jing-Mei, please, you have to understand.
I do.
It's okay.
Good.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, Susan.
I quit.
And so the holiday begins.
Happy, happy, joy, joy, everyone.
Nine-year-old auto versus ped.
Thrown ten feet to the pavement, transient LOC, hit and run.
- Mom?
- Right here, honey.
Confused and agitated.
- What's his name?
- Harry.
Hey, Harry, I'm Dr. Carter.
We're going to take good care of you, all right?
Hey, Ray.
- I'll get Neela.
My shift's over.
- Neela's backed up.
- I got a plane to catch.
- I'm not asking!
One, two, three.
Large bore IV and 500 of saline wide open.
What happened?
- Car hit him.
- Came out of nowhere.
He's got a weak femoral-- was he thrown?
Diffuse ecchymosis on the chest.
He was outside.
I parked the car and Harry was getting out when we got hit.
- Harry flew up in the air.
- Mattie!
Systolic's 77.
You guys are okay, though, right?
You're not hurt?
We're okay.
Paramedics checked us.
Tenderness and crepitus over the chest wall bilaterally.
What's that mean?
That means he has multiple rib fractures.
- Mom, it hurts.
- Baby, I'm here.
Okay, CBC.
Type and cross for four, head, chest and belly CT, trauma panel and a femoral line.
Pulse is up to 138.
Okay, rush the blood bank.
He could be anxious or bleeding out.
Bleeding out?
It's okay, Mattie.
We'll take care of your brother, okay?
Why don't we take Mattie for a little walk?
I want to stay here.
Can I stay here?
I'll set her up in the family room.
Come on, Mattie.
Let's go, hon.
Dr. MacPherson, this is Lockhart again in the E.R.
I'm calling about Robert Sanders.
I know his wife can be a pain in the ass, but tonight I think he has a real... problem, and he, uh, he needs dialysis and call me back.
Abby, take this thyromegally and be well.
As you can see, I have a par-tay to attend.
Where you going?
Well, not that you would know about it, but I'm going to the Player's Ball at the Peninsula.
Kanye West is performing, Twister, the whole Rockefeller...
Hello.
Hey, uh, I'm looking for a doctor.
Well, that would be me.
How can I help you?
I'm looking for Dr. Morris.
Morris.
No, see, what you need is...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey!
...somebody who has experience and...
Hi, hi, glad you could make it.
Come on, I'll show you around.
- Bye.
- Bye.
She's with Morris?
Chen just quit.
Where's Carter?
- Quit what?
- The hospital.
Where's Carter?
I think he's in Trauma Two.
- Quit for good?
- Who?
- Is she all right?
- Oh, I don't know.
She's burned out, and we're screwed.
I can't believe it.
Chen.
Your, uh, Secret Santa gift.
From you?
No.
Found it in the doctors' lounge with your name on it.
What's up with Chen?
I don't know; she's not answering.
- Rats, Lice and History?
- Ooh, that's a good one.
Someone really likes you.
I got a Pez dispenser.
- Hey, I'll see y'all later.
- Happy Christmas.
Hey, I got a 39-year-old IVDU.
- Narcotic withdrawal.
- I'm dying.
- This guy needs detox.
- Exam Two.
Point one of clonidine.
Hey, what are you doing?
This is a publicly funded hospital, and this is a, an illegal religious artifact.
Well, it's Christmas.
So?
So...
Put it back.
Pericardiocentesis needle.
Systolic's 82 on one liter.
Carter, Chen just quit.
Harry, you're going to feel a little pressure.
She quit?
Heart rate's trending up.
Yeah, that's the tamponade limiting contractions.
You got to up the rate to compensate.
What's that mean?
Uh, there's blood around his heart.
Dr. Carter will relieve it.
P VC's.
Yeah, I know.
I'm in, but I'm not getting anything.
Lift up his head a little bit.
Chuny, close the trauma and refuse to board any more homeless.
Good idea-- did you get a whiff of triage?
How can people stink so much in cold weather?
Oil of wintergreen on a mask, or breathe through your mouth.
You're not staying?
There's blood's in there, but it's either clotted or it's collecting posteriorly.
I can't get it with a needle.
- Page CT Surge.
- Oh, I'll get Neela.
If I leave now, I can still make my plane.
- You can forget about your plane.
- I promised my mother.
Your mother?
Look, somebody's got to stay.
I'll page Surgery.
Ask for an echo-guided pericardial window.
- Hey, Carter, do you have a minute?
- Yeah.
Titrate the dopamine to a systolic of 90.
Keep paging CT Surge.
All right, Harry's stable, and Dr. Barnett is here.
Apparently.
My lupus patient-- pulmonary edema's worse, and his pressure sucks.
- Can you take a look?
- Sure.
So, Chen quit?
What was it, her dad?
Yeah.
I'll go home, have dinner with Chuck and Cosmo, sing a couple of carols, come back.
Chuck's been cooking a turkey all day.
- My dad's there...
- All right, all right, go home.
If we get busy, I'll call you;
otherwise, stay home.
Thank you, thank you.
You're amazing.
Thank you.
Come be amazing over here.
I'll check in later.
Did you, uh, call his primaries?
Rheum says he's too sick for them, call Cardiology.
Cards says it's not his heart, call Renal.
Renal says he's just had dialysis, it's not their problem.
BP's dropping, 88/59.
Stop that BNP drip and lower his head.
Yeah, I tried that-- he desats.
Hard to breathe.
Carol?
She's going to come right back.
Abby, you give nitro paste and BNP drip?
Give two vasodilators, and his pressure'll bottom out.
Well, you try getting three specialists on the phone on Christmas Eve.
You're his doctor.
Ah, he's got crackles in the apices.
You have Renal coming in to take off the fluid?
No.
What do you mean, no?
He was dialyzed yesterday, so Renal thinks there's another explanation for the edema.
What do you think it is?
I think he got half his usual dialysis time because they were jammed for the holidays, ate a salty dinner and flooded his lungs.
So...?
So I'm waiting to hear from MacPherson, the Renal attending.
Dr. Agbo from Surgery's here.
Agbo?
I've never heard of him.
You know, junior fellow, sweaty palms.
- Nobody wants to be here tonight.
- Including me.
Okay, why don't you call Dr. Renal Mac Whatshisname again, and remember that nobody knows what your patient needs right now better than you do.
Sats only 88.
Uh, put him on a non-rebreather.
That should help.
I'll be right back.
Okay?
These are Robert's medical records.
Listen, um, about today on the phone...
Pain-in-the-ass that I am, I walked them down from Records myself.
Otherwise, you would've received them tomorrow.
Now, will you look at my file?
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Heard a crazy story about you quitting.
Can I come in?
Uh, you know, thanks, Greg, but I'm fine.
Thanks for coming by.
Hey, you need some help?
Yeah, give me some Ativan, please.
- How much?
- Two milligrams.
What happened at work today?
Sometimes he's cooperative and lucid.
Sometimes he's like this.
Sundowning.
Sundowning?
It's too nice a word for it.
Give me my pants, please.
You know you got a lot of Ativan here.
Potassium, too.
Jing-mei, what are you doing?
Talk to me!
What's going on?
He's going to try and relieve the blood accumulating around the heart.
- Is that the pericardium?
- Yep.
Ten blade and pickups to me.
Watch over my boy.
Let's give them a little more room to work.
McAlpin catheter and a 60cc syringe, quickly.
Whoa, a hundred ccs right there.
- Keep him safe, Lord, I beg you.
- Another 60cc syringe, quickly.
- Hey, man.
- Uh, Dr. Agbo?
Maybe I nicked a vessel.
All right, give me some sterile eights.
PVCs...
Bigeminy.
- Pull the catheter back.
- I can get it.
It's my fault.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
Shut up, Mattie!
Mrs. Price, take your daughter outside right now.
- No, no, I want to stay with my son.
- I said pull that catheter back.
The blood will just reaccumulate...
Get out of the way, get out of the way.
V-tach!
Crash cart.
Catheter is out.
- Charged to 100.
Clear.
- Just wait, just wait.
Normal sinus.
All right, 3-O on a needle driver.
That's good, right?
That's good?
Dr. Carter...
Neela, can you take this little girl to the family room, page Social Services and then stay with her until they get here.
No.
Feeling better?
A little.
Don't lie, Robert.
He's not better.
Look at him.
BP's stabilized. 119/85.
Pulse down to 115.
He's had lupus cerebritis?
Two years ago.
It calmed down after a steroid burst.
Okay, I'd like to get a head scan to make sure the cerebritis isn't back and that there's no internal bleeding from the fall--
I have a discharge, and then I'll take you.
I can take him.
Do you know where it is?
Can his wife come with us?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
Put him on a portable monitor and O2 and call me if you have questions.
Okay?
Okay.
Would you like to color?
You excited about Santa coming tonight?
- Why not?
- Santa's not coming for me.
Mattie, that's not true.
Hey.
I thought you had a plane to catch.
Hey, Mattie, how you doing?
You know, when I was a kid, I used to fight with my brother all the time.
Did he get hurt?
Yeah, he got hurt.
I got hurt.
Kids get hurt sometimes by accident.
I was mad at him for not playing with me, so I threw his book out, and he went to get it and got hit.
Mattie, it's not your fault that Harry got hurt.
It is.
I tried to help him, but I couldn't.
I had to go get my mom.
Your mom wasn't there?
She was at work.
You and Harry were alone in the car?
We live in the car.
Don't tell my mom.
I'm not supposed to say that.
My father's a doctor.
He knows what he's asking.
Without the G-tube and IV, he would've died weeks ago.
Oh, so now life-saving technology is bad?
If someone doesn't want it.
How do you know he doesn't want it?
He's not even in his right mind.
After he sleeps, he's lucid.
Each time, every day, he begs me to help him.
Removing the support's not enough.
I-It would take him days to die of dehydration, and he'd be in misery.
Put him in a nursing home.
What, so he could be somebody else's problem, someone who doesn't know him or love him?
He won't even know that he's there.
You're not Chinese.
Oh, so it's Chinese to euthanize your elders?
It's Chinese to respect them.
There you go.
You should go.
I don't want you here.
You've been through a hell of a lot this last year.
You need a break.
Put him in a home for a month so you can catch your breath.
I can't.
We fight to save lives every day.
You know, we literally bust our asses to give people a few more hours of living.
You're a doctor.
You can't just cross that line like it's nothing.
Quality of life is the only measure that matters.
My proud father is lying in his own feces, he can't eat without vomiting, can't sleep.
He knows what he's asking for and he knows he can get that from me.
If you weren't a physician, you couldn't do this.
But I am, and I can.
Why haven't you done it up till now?
If he's been asking so much?
Because you know deep down inside, it would haunt you for the rest of your life.
Why haven't you done it yet?
Maybe I don't have the courage.
It's over.
Christ is born.
It's only midnight?
Feels like 4:00 in the morning.
Margaret, if you turn off these lights one more time,
I'm going to beat you to death with a fruitcake.
This is totally Loser's Christmas.
Give that back you little minx...
Okay, Rudolfo, can you blow like you're blowing out candles on a birthday cake?
Too many cold.
Does it hurt to breathe in?
Lockhart, your lupus patient's coding in the scanner.
All right.
Uh, Neela, chest film and O2.
Got it.
Hey.
Hey.
It was cool what you did with that little girl, telling her about your brother.
Yeah, I think it helped... although I don't actually have any siblings.
Why does that not surprise me?
So Social Work's got Mattie.
Carter says I can go.
Can I sign out Harry to you?
I thought you already missed your flight.
I'll go standby.
Don't want to disappoint Mom on Christmas.
- Do something!
- BP's 83 over 50.
- Cycle the dynamap.
- What happened?
Central line got caught when we moved him and it pulled out.
Bleeding won't stop.
Not with lupus-associated coagulopathy.
Heart rate's dropping.
Okay.
8-O and a Mac two.
Now.
Ma'am, please step back and let us help your husband.
Put pressure right here.
Don't check it, don't let go.
Sats 68.
Yeah, he's hypoxic, I get it, thanks.
Oh, God.
Please don't let it be tonight.
- I'm sorry.
- Tube.
Pulse 64.
I'm not ready for him to die.
I'm in.
Sats coming up.
Run, don't walk, to the blood bank, get four units of oh-neg, have them start working on type specific.
I'll meet you in the trauma room.
He's stable?
He needs blood and fluids.
We're gonna have to start another central line.
Can we get an attending to do it?
I put in lines all the time.
He's been put through enough.
I want a surgical attending.
He's moving in the right direction.
He's gonna spend the night in here tonight until an ICU bed opens up.
You were at work when this happened?
We've been living in the car since I left my husband three weeks ago.
It wasn't bad when the kids were in school, but since Christmas vacation started...
- You left them in the car?
- I got to work.
It's okay, Mama.
Can their dad help?
He's a violent guy.
I could take it, but he was starting in on Harry, so, I...
Yeah, we're a little concerned about the amount of strain that you've been under.
I didn't want Mattie saying how it was 'cause I don't want anyone taking my kids.
We're not homeless people.
I got a job.
This is just temporary.
I can help you find a place to stay until you get on your feet.
We tried the shelter.
It isn't safe for the kids.
No, this isn't a shelter.
It's a house for families fleeing domestic violence.
It's safe.
Thank you.
I'm sorry that I yelled at you, honey.
Don't be scared of me, okay?
I'm sorry, Ma.
No, you didn't do anything wrong.
Come here.
So, what do you think?
I think the bad guy's the hit and run driver, not the mother, and this lady needs a break.
Cafeteria's serving up a holiday feast.
Better get up there.
Hey, Morris...
Burgers probably would have been safer.
Speaking of which, though, I'm a little hungry.
- You want to get something to eat?
- Just lost my appetite.
Dr. Carter, phone call from Africa.
Kim somebody.
Catch you later.
Hello.
Hi.
Um, I'm not doing anything.
I'm just working.
No, it's too cold to snow here.
Maybe tomorrow.
It's okay.
It's okay.
No, no, it's okay.
No.
Calm down.
No, don't worry.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Four of Ativan.
I add five of Haldol when he's like this.
Okay, calm down.
- What is he saying?
- To let him go.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Papa.
Okay.
Now, squeeze.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Both hands, both hands.
Let go of my hand.
- And squeeze the trigger.
- My hands are shaking.
Hey!
- Hi.
- Hi.
Um, Neela, Raphaella Greenberg.
Are you a medical student?
Um, I-I'm his girlfriend.
HIPPA?
Patient privacy?
Stapling is nothing.
This guy's totally out of it.
This is so wrong.
I'll staple, you watch.
Security!
Security!
Somebody get Security!
- Give me a reason.
- Whoa, whoa, stop it, stop it.
- Whose patient is this?
- Mine.
I need help.
All right, get Security to cuff him to a bed, huh?
And get him on a monitor until we can figure out what he took.
Okay.
- Should have let him OD.
- Come on, up, up.
- That's the Christmas spirit.
- Yeah.
- Back to bed, Mr. Beidermeier.
- At least have him arrested.
- What's your name again?
- Margaret.
Margaret, we're good here.
Crap!
Got a flash.
Guidewire.
Didn't you come in because the wife wants you to do this?
Not her call.
I like to make a small nick with an 11 blade.
She's afraid Abby might kill her husband.
I don't think she will.
Okay.
Catheter.
Tachy at 110, B.P. 94/79, sats 86.
Yeah, and that's as good as he's gonna get until he's dialyzed.
His lungs are swimming in fluid.
Nice.
Threading easily.
Good.
- Thank you for coming in.
- It's my job.
Yeah.
Well, you want to admit him to your service?
All his other docs are blowing me off.
Ah, Santa Claus is coming to town.
Okay, removing the introducer, 10cc syringe.
You know, legally and morally, they have to come when you call, or they can lose staff privileges.
Oh, really.
I don't think they've heard the news about all my power.
Oh, they're aware, they're aware, all right.
They like to take advantage of submissive interns.
I'm not submissive.
- Nice return.
- I know.
Like many interns, and, well, many females, you incline yourself toward popularity and equate it with success.
Well, when an ER doc is popular, someone's losing out, and it's usually the patient.
All this guy has is you.
Infusing well.
Needle driver.
All right, well, good job.
Really good job, Abby.
I'll-I'll finish up.
Yeah, go.
Go out there and do what you have to do.
And by the by, did you, um, get the book?
Rats, Lice and History?
You're my Secret Santa?
Yeah, I'm quite excited to discuss it with you.
The chapter on the influence of louse and vermin epidemics on political and military history and the relative unimportance of generals is outrageous.
Uh, 4-0 silk.
Submissive.
Not a word I would use to describe you.
Okay.
Time to get unpopular.
Look, uh, I take full responsibility for what happened with Sanders.
You didn't do it, the Tech did.
And I should not have sent a student to CT.
I want you to send me, okay?
It won't happen again.
So, what'd you learn from all this?
Always go home when you tell me.
Hi, is this the dialysis tech?
Yeah, I know it's 2:00 a.m. I'm sorry to wake you.
What did he say?
He thanked me.
Said I was a good daughter.
You are.
You want me to do it?
Lab called on Vivadee Sanito The coags were QNS.
Okay.
And, uh, Betty Muldoon was admitted to Medicine.
Can I get a cab voucher?
Huh?
I don't think we're quite ready to discharge you, Mr. Claus.
Dialysis for patient Sanders.
- You want me to...?
- No, no, I got it.
Thank you.
- Hi.
Thanks for coming in.
- Double overtime on holidays.
But I just did Robert Sanders yesterday.
Yeah, he's, um, he's fluid overloaded.
- MacPherson call in orders?
- Well, I spoke to him on the phone.
- What did he want?
- Usual... the standard... run.
2K bath, 35 bicarb, pull off a couple liters.
- Two or four hours?
- Uh, I'm not sure about that.
I'll give him a call.
Well, actually, you know, Dr. MacPherson very specifically said he did not want to be disturbed, so...
He wouldn't come in?
He wouldn't come in.
What a prick, but I need orders.
Okay.
Okay, well, do you think you could get started, and then call him?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
MacPherson ordered dialysis?
No...
I did.
You?
You can't order...
Thank you.
Merry Christmas.
Tetanus up to date.
I was putting a sled together, and I sliced myself on the metal runners.
Well, it doesn't look too bad to me, Mr. Rotolo.
Santa's got to get home, Doc, know what I mean?
Me and Mrs. Claus have things to take care of before the kids wake up.
Won't take long.
You feel that?
Yeah.
- Feel that?
- Yeah.
Excuse me, Dr. Carter, uh, when you have a minute?
Sure.
Um, irrigate, open up a suture kit.
I'll be right back.
I have something for you.
Um, but I haven't wrapped it, and it's at home...
Liar.
But my birthday's in two weeks.
- "Mildred"?
- Ooh, sorry.
Mildred didn't show.
I was giving out a bunch of these.
Just a little something.
- So, how was your phone call?
- It was good.
She's good.
Oh, yeah, very handy.
For, uh, hooking up the VCR.
Right, yeah.
Yeah.
You look like an old-fashioned doctor.
Well...
I am an old-fashioned doctor.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
- We got sliders.
- Yes.
You will never be more loved than you are at this moment.
Oh, I could eat about three dozen of these.
- Hi.
- Hi.
So is this the little homeless boy?
Should we treat as inpatient?
- Is he hypoxic?
- No.
- Tolerating POs?
- Yeah.
Then he only needs PO antibiotics.
- And a warm bed.
- I'll call the Pedes team.
Hi, Rudolfo.
- Hello, doctoras.
- Hi.
You got a chimney?
I'm sorry, honey, what?
How's Santa Claus going to find me if you don't got a chimney?
You don't need a chimney.
Santa sees everything--he'll find you.
But you'll have to go to sleep before he comes, all right?
Good night.
Do you think Dad has a present for his son?
Doubt Dad's got enough for their breakfast in the morning.
I guess Santa Claus better come up with something.
Jumbo mart?
Do you have any cash on you?
- No.
- No.
Jing-Mei?
It's been over an hour.
You okay?
I'll call the mortuary in the morning.
What are you going to do after that?
Well, I have to go to China and bury my father next to my mom.
Deal with his estate.
Bum around, maybe visit the village where they were born.
Meet some relatives.
I don't know.
I'm pretty tired.
Well, you know, if there's anything I could do.
I mean it-- anything.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you for...
It's okay.
Come here.
- Where are we going?
- Ho, Ho, Ho, and a jolly old soul.
Sikhs don't have Christmas.
I grew up in England with Old King Wenceslas,
Boxing Day, and a family tradition of anonymous kindness.
- Where'd you get that key?
- Wendall from Social Work.
- I have a plan.
- A sly and cunning plan?
Give these toys and books to the homeless kids in the ER.
Oh...
Stealing from the bad-off to give to the worse-off.
And we buy new stuff tomorrow in the after-Christmas sales.
A belated gift for the Child Life Department.
Do we have ribbons or-or paper?
We can steal bows from the decorations in the cafeteria.
What's up?
Hey, I thought you'd be in Miami by now.
O'Hare's a mess.
No seats until tomorrow.
Miami?
I thought your mother was in Philadelphia.
Hey, it's snowing.
Come on.
Hey, if it's snowing, that means it's warming up.
You knew he was in Miami?
He's got a girlfriend that lives there.
I worked his shift because he gave me some sob story about his mother.
Barnett, you back already?
I can't stay away.
Ah...
I love it.
Does snow get polluted?
Where's Lockhart?
Dr. MacPherson.
I didn't authorize dialysis for Sanders and you started it without my approval.
I want to speak to your attending.
Uh... your patient was drowning.
He needed emergent dialysis.
You're an attending, on call, I covered your ass.
You can't just deceive attendings when you don't agree with them.
Well, if you report me for working the system, I'll report you for abandoning your patient.
Go, Abby.
See you inside.
Miami?
Come on, let's get back to work.
This is Jing-Mei Chen.
I woke up this morning and found my father had passed away in the night.
Yes, he's been very ill.
Well, actually his physician is here.
He can sign the death certificate.
Thank you.
It's 2753 West Cedar Drive.

- You're a doctor?
- Yeah.
- Yes I am.
- Hey Mike.
Leaving that stripper in Curtain 4 with the broken toe for you.
- Try not to T. U. B. E. her.
- What are you talking about?
Totally Unnecessary Breast Exam.
- It's Sandy.
- Sandy Lopez died today.
What I'm supposed to do now?
Give me back my son!
Mom, guess what.
Dad's here.
I don't like working on old people or children or drunks.
Go to bloody Iraq.
And tell yourself you've done something noble.
E. R. 10x19 "JUST A TOUCH"
Hey.
Hey, Mom.
Mom, look at this.
Hey, that's pretty good.
Dad's been teaching me, says we might get my own guitar today.
Oh, really?
- Hey, Alex, you want scrambled eggs?
- Sure.
Should have told me you needed the groceries.
I would have gone.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Yeah?
Listen, take this, okay?
What's this?
It's, you know, grocery money, rent money, guilt money.
It's not much guilt.
There's more where this came from.
I got a few jobs lined up, and the-
There's something you need, so I'm gonna leave this here.
What, like a guitar?
Why not?
It's good for a kid to learn an instrument.
I mean, music, it stimulates the brain.
Yeah, prove it.
Well, it helps score the hot chicks.
That's for sure.
Hey, Dad, teach me something else.
All right, buddy.
Here, let me see.
This one's a little trickier, but it's very cool.
You'll like it.
I've had pretty good luck with this one with the ladies.
- Let go of me, you dirty freak!
- Calm down.
- No!
- Want Haldol?
Yes.
That and a hammer.
- Need help, Morris?
- No, this is going great!
- Stop touching me!
- Relax.
- Just try and relax, Mrs. Garrison.
- You know her?
- Yeah, she's off her meds.
- You think?
Five or 10 of Haldol?
- Ten.
- Five.
Whatever.
All right, this is gonna sting a little, Mrs. Garrison, okay?
Want hard restraints?
- No.
- Soft restraints?
No.
No restraints.
She'll be fine.
Guess you should've put her in restraints.
Their argument is Sandy was his mother and you never legally adopted him.
- We were in the process.
- And that will help, perhaps.
If the child's genetic father was willing to assign you his rights.
He was an anonymous donor.
Well, we will establish parental intent.
And I'm confident we can secure some temporary-
Temporary?
Henry is my son.
The good news is that the state has adopted a sexual-orientation-neutral approach to child-custody determination.
But there are other factors at play here.
- Like what?
- In addition to being gay, you're single.
And your work requires a great deal of time away from Henry.
Now, the Lopezes present a blood relationship with a loving intact family unit and a stay-at-home mom.
I'll change my schedule.
Hell, I'll quit my job if I have to.
- What happened to you?
- Bitten by a patient.
- What are you doing here?
- Working.
- Have a nurse look at that.
- It's okay.
Sam, wash out Dr. Kovac's bite, update his tetanus and check for hepatitis and HIV on the source.
- Sure.
- I'll call you.
Let you know how it goes.
There's another difference between Sandy's family and me: money.
And I'll use everything I have to get my son back.
- Make sure they know that.
- I'll make them aware of that.
What are you doing?
Icing my nads.
- Excuse me?
- One of the patients grabbed my junk.
So Alex must be excited.
- What?
- Today is first day of spring break, right?
Oh, yeah.
Right.
You guys want to do something after work?
He's been talking about this rock-' n' -roll bowling alley with glow-in-the-dark balls and lasers and...
We can't.
Not tonight.
Alex's father is in town.
He just showed up.
Yeah, he does this every now and then.
Usually without warning.
Kind of like a tornado.
I wish he'd just stay away for good.
Oh, well.
He's the boy's father.
Barely.
He sticks around long enough to run up my phone bill and drink my beer.
He's staying with you?
Somebody call for a psych consult?
- You on Psych now?
- Yep.
But don't worry I'm keeping an ID in my pocket in case someone mistakes me for a patient.
That was a joke.
She's in the Suture Room.
- Give me the chart.
- It's my patient.
- Done an H P?
- I pulled the chart.
- What are you doing?
- He's stealing my patient.
- What?
I'm trying to help you.
- What are we talking about?
Back pain in 2.
- I'll settle this.
- You should be ashamed of yourselves.
Well, here's a beauty for you.
Blue and puking in 1.
Blue?
Mrs. Garrison, we're gonna take you upstairs and get you lunch.
I'm really not hungry.
Although I wouldn't mind a nice glass of merlot.
See what I can do.
I'll try to get her admitted.
She'll be fine once she's on her meds.
- How's the Psych rotation?
- It's kind of scary.
- What?
The patients?
- No, me.
I like it.
How about you?
Everything good?
Sam's ex-boyfriend's back in town.
Hey, Abby.
Can you take Mr. Chen here upstairs?
- If you want him in Psych.
- Don't tempt me.
Fall into outstretched hand.
Nothing serious.
It's his right arm, and now he won't be able to do anything.
Not that he would.
I've already been through four home-care workers.
I can help you out.
Can't get more shifts.
I need money or I have to drop out of school.
Abby, you don't want any of this.
- Coffee?
- Yeah.
Good idea.
- So?
- So.
How's Kem?
She must be getting big.
- Very.
- You should see Susan.
How's she doing?
Well, you know how some mothers talk to their unborn children?
Susan threatened to pull hers out with her bare hand if it didn't hurry up.
Doing anything differently?
Exercise?
Sports?
- No.
- Any heavy lifting?
Help a friend move?
- Anything like that?
- No.
- Slip or fall recently?
- Nothing.
- I'm just checking your lymph node.
- I'm ticklish.
I'll make a note of that.
- You ever have a mammogram?
- No.
You do self breast exams?
- Sometimes.
- Hey, Sam.
Can you give me a hand?
- I need a breast exam on Miss Campbell.
- Sure.
- You do?
- It's just routine.
You should do this every month.
You have to get to know your breasts.
You can't rely on friends.
- Right after your period is the best time.
- Blood bank's on six for you.
- Thanks.
- All right.
- This is Taggart.
- Look in the mirror...
- ...for any changes in shape...
- Yeah, I drew blood on Mendoza.
...in the skin and nipple changes.
Then you lift up your arm and do it again.
- I signed all of them.
- Okay?
Then you gently squeeze the nipple to check for discharge.
Okay.
Now, you start by circling the nipple...
- ... moving out in larger circles.
- Okay, it's been a little busy down here.
Feeling for any lumps along the way until you reach the edge.
He needs two units typed and crossed.
Okay, lie down.
- Feel the breast tissue...
- He's vomiting blood.
- ...beneath the skin with a soft touch.
And down to the ribcage with a firmer touch.
From the collarbone to the top of the abdomen and from the armpit to the midline.
- Want me to come down?
- I don't appreciate any masses.
- That's good, right?
- It's perfect.
You can sit up.
- Forget it.
Just send two units O-neg.
- You should also do this in the shower.
The skin's a lot more slippery when it's wet, and sometimes it helps.
Oh, make it stop!
Oh, please!
Give me something!
- Connor, James.
Passenger in an MVA.
- Oh, my God!
Help me!
Car T-boned into them pretty good.
- Give me something!
- Vitals?
He's been thrashing too much for us to get a BP.
No LOC.
Walking and swearing on the scene.
Three-centimeter temporal lac with some glass.
My arm is killing me!
Come on!
The driver's right behind us.
- She got the worst.
- Where's Pratt?
- Right here.
- Okay, this guy is yours.
- All right.
- Neela, come with me.
Oh, my God!
Seat belt, harness.
Air bag didn't deploy.
- Where do you hurt, ma'am?
- All over.
- What happened, man?
- We were driving and some guy blindsided us.
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Save my arm!
- Save my arm!
- You're not gonna lose your arm, sir.
- Is she your girlfriend?
- No, man.
I just met her last night.
She was driving me home from her place.
I should have taken a cab.
Closed deformity on the right elbow.
He's dislocated.
- No radial pulse. 100 of Brevital.
- Brevital?
Yeah, and 100 of fent.
All right.
Just hang in there, okay?
We're gonna fix this up real quick.
What do we want, Neela?
Trauma panel, HemoCues and x-rays.
- Want me to guess?
- Chest, C-spine, pelvis.
- Thank you.
- I'm gonna be sick.
- On the monitor.
Get suction.
- Periumbilical ecchymosis.
- Pretty tender in the upper right.
- Systolic's 90.
First HemoCue's 11.
- My head feels funny.
- Okay, get another line.
Already done with a liter onboard.
- Is Dr. Pratt working?
- Next door.
Two units of O-neg on the rapid infuser.
Can you get him?
- Tachy at 118.
- She's gonna crash.
Get a seven and a half.
I need the ultrasound.
- I'll get it.
- Somebody call Surgery again.
- Brevital's in.
- It's not helping!
It's not-!
- Thank God.
- All right.
We got about 20 seconds.
Pull.
Dr. Pratt, this patient's asking for you.
- For me?
- He's waking up.
Almost there.
- What happened?
- We fixed your elbow.
Holy crap, you're good.
You can pick up your Dr. Greg Pratt Fan Club ring at the door.
Barely holding at a 100 systolic.
Blood's running.
- Hypoechoic in Morrison's.
- How are we doing in here?
- Greg, is that you?
- Yeah.
Foley is on.
Blood on the dip.
- What's the name on the chart?
- Rena Carlson.
We hooked up last year.
We met on the El, remember?
Oh, yeah.
Right.
Make sure the blood bank gets a clot.
Let's drop an NG tube and pack her up.
Rena, you injured your spleen.
You're gonna require surgery to repair it.
- God.
I'm all messed up.
- No, you're gonna be okay.
We're gonna take very good care of you.
Abby.
- Hi.
- I see Mrs. Garrison is back.
Yeah.
She bit one of the Attendings in ER.
Oh, well, better them than one of us.
- Mr. Rosenblum was asking for you.
- Oh, great.
Take it as a compliment.
Took me two years before the duke would even talk to me.
Maybe it's your nursing background.
It's probably a combination of nursing and genetics.
My family's pretty high-maintenance.
You can lead the group today.
- By myself?
- No better time than the present.
Okay.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Abby.
I'm a medical student, I'm going to be running the group today.
Elbow's good.
Sutures will come out in a week.
But the Ortho clinic will wanna get some more x-rays and start you on P.T.
So does that mean I can go?
You're not gonna stick around for her?
- Like I said, I just met her.
- You spent the night together.
That don't make us married.
What's the status?
Stable after four units of packed cells and some fluid.
Corday's waiting for her upstairs.
I have to have an operation.
Don't worry.
Dr. Corday's an excellent surgeon.
- Will you come see me after?
- Sure.
- Friend?
- Not really.
Could you let me know how she does?
- Okay.
- Thanks.
Labs and films on Campbell.
Sussman is starting to get short-term memory back.
Thanks.
Neela.
Neuro checks on Mr. Sussman Q hour.
Can't.
Working in the lab.
- Doing what?
- Stroke physiology research.
- Going to the mouse house?
- It's an elective.
I'm doing a lousy job.
Everyone thinks I'm better suited for the lab.
Yeah, well, God forbid you disappoint them.
Hello.
I'm sorry this is taking so long.
- Yeah.
- So, what's going on with you, Denise?
I've just
- I've been feeling cruddy, like sick to my stomach and headaches.
At first I thought it was the flu till I started losing feeling in my hands and feet.
So you're not here because of your skin?
No, that's from the amiodarone.
I have a ventricular arrhythmia.
Pretty sad, huh?
You know what the guys at school call me?
Smurf.
Everything looks good.
No fractures, no arthritis, no bony lesions.
I'm thinking it's just muscle strain.
But I told you I didn't do anything.
Maybe you didn't realize it.
It may not have been sudden strain.
You could have slept funny or been sitting too long.
- That's it?
- Yeah.
It should get better with time.
Try a warm bath and some ibuprofen.
Come back and see me if it gets worse or you feel numbness or weakness in your legs.
- Yo, doc.
- Excuse me.
Twenty-nine-year-old with syncopal episode.
Housekeeper found her in the kitchen.
She on meds?
- Not that we could find.
- Neela.
Ma'am, can you hear me?
Ma'am?
All right, let's get her in Trauma 1.
Excuse me.
Could I speak with someone in charge?
What do you need?
Would it be possible to speak with Dr. Pratt's supervisor?
Yeah.
Okay.
What are you doing here?
Where's Alex?
- Thought I'd take you to lunch.
- Where's Alex?
He's showing one of the doctors his guitar.
- Was this a bad idea?
- I can't leave for lunch.
- I asked Alex.
He said it'd be all right.
- He's 10.
Hey, Mom, look.
He did it.
Dad said he'd buy me a guitar and he did.
- So I see.
- This is my dad.
Hi.
Isn't it cool?
- Do you know how to play, Luka?
- No.
Well, my dad's in a band.
Your old lady stopped breathing again.
It was nice meeting you.
You too.
Some gal stopped breathing, can't be good.
People die in here all the time.
It's no big deal.
He already sounds like a doctor.
It's great.
You gonna play something for me?
Fainted and altered.
We're looking for?
- Normal sinus.
Not having an Ml.
- Think about the differential.
No ectopy, interval isn't prolonged, QRS duration is 0. 10.
Normal.
Pupils equal and reactive.
The common pathway in syncope?
Low blood pressure.
Don't hear a murmur.
No.
Lack of vital-nutrient delivery to the brainstem reticular activating system.
Caused by low blood pressure.
Or hypoxia or hypoglycemia.
Abdomen is soft and non-tender.
- So, what are we ordering, kids?
- CBC, lytes, head CT.
And a urine tox screen.
And call a family member to verify she's not on any meds.
What meds cause orthostatic hypotension?
Antihypertensives.
Beta-blockers, Dig, diuretics, phenothiazines, nitrites antidysrhythmics, antidepressants, alcohol and cocaine.
You know, we don't have to do this if you've got something better to do.
I've got the papers here.
I'm gonna be stuck at the hospital for a couple hours.
Is there any way you can have a notary come here?
That'd be great.
Thank you.
Carter, I'm so sorry I stranded you here.
They're gonna admit him.
So I can drive you home.
I arranged for somebody to come here with papers for me to sign.
I gotta be at work soon.
I'm just gonna stay.
I just ruined your whole day, didn't I?
Don't worry.
Know what you can do?
You can help me pick out nursery colors.
What do you think?
Circus: colorful, fun, developmentally stimulating.
Aquatic: soothing yet educational, sort of for the young scientist.
Or jungle:
Environmentally positive, a celebration of his African heritage.
If you had a baby, which wou-?
I like the jungle.
I'm sorry.
I wasn't even thinking.
Carter, no.
It's okay.
Don't worry about it.
You know, sometimes I forget about him myself.
That's when I feel the worst when I realize that I haven't thought about him in, like, a week or so.
You know, ever since my mom died and my dad got sick, I...
I've been thinking about him a lot.
You know, when my dad goes, I'm not gonna have anyone else.
No aunts, cousin...
Nothing.
Have you ever gone to see him?
Maybe you should.
Maybe I should have kept him.
I mean, he is 3 years old now.
The nightmares have stopped, but I feel like killing myself.
- So, what else is new?
- I smell something.
I can't smell anything.
I developed anosmia after my accident.
Nobody accidentally puts their head in a paint mixer.
- Let's let Larry finish.
- Why?
It's the same thing every week.
" I wanna kill myself. "
- He needs new material.
- You need a soul.
Please stop fighting.
- What's he saying?
- No one here speaks Klingon.
- It's rather odd, don't you think?
- Yeah.
No.
No.
- I think we should take a minute.
- Where did you go to school?
What?
I'm going to school.
I wanna be a lawyer.
Last week he wanted to be a lion-tamer.
At least he has goals beyond how many women he can screw.
- You jealous?
- Hey.
Okay, okay.
- You're a pig.
- Oink.
Stanley, if you continue to disrupt the group I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
- That's good.
- "That's good.
It's what you should do. "
Can we all get along?
Is it just me or are we kooky?
- I smell gas.
- Sit down.
When I'm a lawyer, I'm suing the hospital.
Can't sit on a jury with multiple-personality disorder.
- Does anyone else smell gas?
- It's coming from Larry.
Why don't you shut up.
You cut yourself, start with your tongue.
Leave her alone.
You have nothing inside, dirty person.
- Nothing inside you-
- You make everybody sick.
Hey.
Hey!
No.
You can't smoke in here.
It's against the law.
- So is suicide.
- You've got an addiction.
- Well, I'm trying to quit.
- I'm allergic to smoke.
Only takes 11 seconds for nicotine to reach your brain.
There are 50 different kinds of carcinogens in cigarettes.
You better put that out before somebody catches you.
Stanley, what about you?
Do you have a problem with this?
My mother died of lung cancer.
It's a nasty habit.
Well, now that we've all agreed on something let's talk about personal goals.
I don't wanna make a big deal.
He just made me feel uncomfortable.
- How so?
- He did a breast exam, and I don't know, he seemed to enjoy it.
- Was there a nurse present?
- Yes.
It was her.
Did you voice your concerns to Dr. Pratt?
No.
I guess I was caught off guard.
I can assure you he's a very professional physician.
However, if you want to file a formal complaint...
Oh, no, no.
I don't want to make a big deal out of this.
I just felt I should tell someone.
Maybe they could speak with him?
- I'll speak to him.
- Thank you.
Where's Pratt?
- With a patient.
What do you need?
- I need Pratt.
Where are you going?
I'm going to grab a bite with Alex and his dad.
Did you assist Dr. Pratt in examining Campbell, the woman in Curtain 2?
- Yeah.
- Anything unusual about the exam?
- I don't think so.
Why?
- He gave her a breast exam for back pain.
I don't know what her complaint was.
I was on the phone and juggling other patients.
- Sounds like he T. U. B. E. D. her.
- She wasn't intubated, Morris.
No, no.
You know, T.U.B.E. T-U-B-E.
- Totally Unnecessary Breast Exam.
- You're such an ass.
- What was that?
- Sorry.
No, not you.
Where did you hear that term?
I don't know.
I didn't make it up.
Well, who did?
What happened?
Where's my daughter?
Your daughter's with your neighbor.
My name is Dr. Pratt.
You fainted at home.
But all your tests look good.
We checked your heart, lungs and your brain.
You're not anemic or dehydrated.
And all your electrolytes are normal.
- I feel fine.
- Are you taking any medications?
- No.
- Could be anything over the counter.
Diet pills, cold medicine.
Nothing.
You ever have any heart problems?
Palpitations?
Shortness of breath?
I'm healthy.
Anyone in your family ever have seizures?
I did when I was a kid, but I grew out of them.
How long ago was your last one?
I don't know.
Years and years.
I was on phenobarb until, like fifth grade.
They said I had epilepsy.
But when I stopped the medicine they went away.
I never had another one.
That was 20 years ago.
- Dr. Pratt, can I see you for a second?
- Just give me a minute.
- Can I go home now?
- I need you now.
- All right, I'll be right back.
- I have a baby at home.
I just need to run a few more tests, okay?
Here.
What's up?
- Did you treat this patient?
- Yeah.
Why?
She accused you of sexual harassment.
What?
- Did you T. U. B. E. her, Pratt?
- What?
That's what you call it, isn't it, when you wanna feel up a good-looking patient?
If she hires a lawyer, you could be charged with harassment.
If I found a lesion, I would've saved her.
You didn't.
I'm being punished because she's not sick?
It's not her condition, it's your behavior.
Nothing's wrong with my behavior.
She had tenderness over the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae.
Bony tenderness.
None over the paraspinus muscles.
I felt a 1-centimeter lymph node in the axilla.
You saying you weren't attracted to her?
Oh, come on.
Bone pain and lymphadenopathy in a woman who's never had a mammogram?
You would've done the same.
It's not about what you did, it's how.
With a nurse present, per policy.
The patient felt you enjoyed yourself.
Come on, please.
Give me a break?
You ever got turned on giving a breast exam?
You don't have a nurse in the room.
- I'm a woman.
- Who sleeps with women.
- I never T. U. B. E. D. a patient.
- Yeah?
Neither have I.
- You coined the phrase.
- It's been around since I was a student.
You've been overheard using it.
It doesn't mean I've done it.
If she was uncomfortable, why not say something?
I don't know.
Maybe she was intimidated by you.
Scared the big black doctor's gonna bend over the bed-
Don't you turn this into a race issue.
When you're black, it's always an issue.
- I'm not gonna let you hide.
- I'm not hiding.
- A call for you.
- Take a message.
- It's your lawyer, line four.
- Don't go anywhere.
- Where's Sam?
- I think she's with her son.
Hey, Dr. Pratt, Neela's patient collapsed.
She was coming back from the restroom.
Hey, ma'am.
Can you hear me?
Somebody find Neela!
Let's get her up on the gurney, okay?
Ready?
One, two...
- Malik, monitors.
- Positive sternotomy sign.
- What happened?
- V-tach.
Ventricular arrhythmia.
On amiodarone.
- "Tetralogy of Fallot repaired in 1975. "
- Why is she in today?
- Flu.
- What's her lab show?
- Haven't come back.
- Need hands?
Did you open your big mouth to Weaver?
- What?
- Airway clear.
Start bagging.
Did you tell Weaver I T. U. B. E. D. a patient?
V- tach, no pulse.
Denise, stay with us.
- Charge to 200.
- I'm charged.
- Clear.
- No change.
Going again, 300.
Well, did you?
- No.
- Somebody did, though.
Clear.
- Sinus.
- Good carotid pulse.
100 of lidocaine.
What'd you say?
Nothing.
That hot patient was complaining about you.
Good breath.
I'll call about her labs.
Perhaps you two referring to a patient as " hot" is a clue.
I never called her that.
She's the one with problems.
Can you even imagine what it was like for her to come here?
Feeling ill, worried, scared.
Waiting several hours to be seen only to have a stranger fondle her.
Secondary survey.
Good gag.
She's waking up.
- You're okay, Denise.
- Labs?
CBC, electrolytes, calcium, LFTs, creatinine.
Labs report her amiodarone level less than zero.
She sometimes forgets to take it.
Must have stopped taking it weeks ago to have zero.
She give you any indication why she'd do that?
Maybe.
Because men are idiots.
- Can I play pinball?
- Sure.
Finish your lunch first.
I'm full.
Barely touched your hamburger.
I don't wanna get mad cow disease.
Then finish your fries.
God, he's grown a foot since I've seen him last.
Been a year.
You've done a great job, Sam.
He's a cool kid.
Thanks.
I guess I can't take much credit for that.
- Anyway, is he doing good in school?
- Yeah.
When he's not being expelled for performing medical procedures on himself or dissecting dead squirrels.
Really?
It's not funny.
He seems to like that Russian doctor.
Croatian.
You two...?
We've gone out.
Nothing serious.
He have any friends his own age?
- He's got some buddies at school.
- That's good.
Considering how much you move around, that's good.
Well, you gotta go where the work is, right?
Tell me about it.
That's the good thing about Chicago.
- Always building-
- How long are you planning on staying?
You sick of me already?
It's not about me.
It's about Alex.
Well, he seems happy that I'm back.
That's the problem.
The longer you stay, the harder it's gonna be on him when you leave.
Well, maybe I won't leave this time.
What's going on with Hollings in 2?
Cardiology was supposed to get him.
Call them again.
What about Dunn in Exam 3?
Some recurrent seizure disorder.
Waiting on an EEG.
They can do that upstairs.
We need to free up some beds.
- Medicine won't take her.
- Why not Neurology?
They don't think she had a seizure.
Was there witnessed tonic-clonic activity?
- Not really.
- Did she bite her tongue?
- No.
- Was there urinary incontinence?
- I don't think so.
- Not a seizure.
Discharge her, she can have an EEG.
If she passes out, she could hurt herself.
Send in a DMV card.
There's also a baby at home who could get hurt.
Look, she had a syncopal episode.
And I'm gonna rule her out for Ml.
While we wait for the six-hour troponin, we might as well throw in an EEG.
Dr. Pratt, Denise's parents are coming in to talk to her.
Her cardiologist's gonna switch her to sotalol which should help the skin.
Hey, Neela, when does your research rotation start?
- Fifteen minutes.
- Good luck.
Thank you, Dr. Kovac.
- Let me ask you a question.
- Yeah?
When you do a breast exam on an attractive woman, it's awkward, right?
- For you and the patient.
- Right.
See, I'm just as nervous and uncomfortable as they are.
I don't know.
Maybe it comes across as something else.
What do you mean?
How do you do it so that they don't think that you're enjoying yourself?
It's a medical procedure.
It's no different than looking for rebound or guarding.
I pretend it's my mom.
Yeah, it's a little trick I picked up from my OB-GYN Attending.
It works.
I mean, unless your mom's hot too.
You're a freak.
Every workstation has its own microfuge.
We share the ultracentrifuge.
Cold room for tissue-culture media, bacterial plates, DNA ligations.
Arun and Angelie are looking at expression of heat-shock proteins in glial cells.
This is Neela.
Hi.
Is that an electron microscope?
Yeah.
EM's kind of old school for showing apoptosis in neurons, but, you know looks sexy on the page, so Lundgren still likes it.
- Lundgren?
- Dr. Lundgren, the guy whose huge RO1 grant is funding your butt.
I'm not getting paid.
Rotation.
Fourth-year med student.
- I'm an eighth-year, Ph. D. program.
- Eight years?
God.
We don't get credit around here for wiping snotty noses.
I've actually gotta discover something new in neuroscience in order to get my degree.
- Takes a while.
- I'm helping with some stroke study?
Everyone here is researching some aspect of brain hypoperfusion and tissue injury.
You're gonna be with Yuri and me.
Looking at the effects of ketamine on cerebral ischemia and tissue damage in mice.
- Yuri, Neela.
Neela, Yuri.
- Hey.
No one said anything about working with animals.
Is that a problem?
All tests look good.
We'd like to figure out why she had a seizure.
Yeah.
I thought that was something she outgrew as a kid.
It may be totally unrelated.
Here we go.
What's all of that?
We're doing an EEG to monitor her electrical brain activity.
It takes several hours, some of which is done while sleeping.
- Can I stay with her?
- Sure.
Just try not to wake her up.
We're more likely to pick up the seizures when she's asleep.
Thank you.
You hear that?
We're gotta let your mama sleep.
Hey.
You know when I ask you to assist me on an exam of a female it's so I don't get accused of things I didn't do.
Don't blame me for this.
You were there.
I didn't do anything.
I did everything I could to put that patient at ease.
- Guess it didn't work.
- I was trying to be friendly.
One man's friendly is another woman's creepy.
- You're a flirt.
You can't help yourself.
- I was breaking the ice.
It's a breast exam, not a cocktail party.
You don't have to break the ice.
- Nice package, by the way.
- What?
Package.
Amira and I were noticing it earlier.
Must be those pants.
I see what you're trying to do.
You're way off.
I didn't say anything remotely inappropriate to that woman.
- It was going through your head.
- It wasn't.
You weren't thinking about her great rack when examining her?
Hell, no.
And even if I was, which I wasn't, so what?
- She can't read my mind.
- Of course she can.
We all can.
It's not that difficult, believe me.
You're a guy.
Men only think about three things:
food, sports and sex.
Dogs are more mysterious.
If they invent a refrigerator with a wide-screen TV and a vagina...
- ... we're all doomed.
- Yeah, okay.
You think I'm kidding, but I'm not.
When you check us out you might as well be asking us to show our tits.
That's what it feels like.
- It's not a nice feeling.
- I didn't check her out.
Dr. Pratt, your patient's seizing again.
All right, find Kovac.
- Jordan?
- Push two of Ativan.
- I knew it.
- Pulse ox, 97.
- Up the nasal oxygen to five liters.
- What's happening to her?
Malik, another two of Ativan.
Mix up Dilantin.
She's gonna be okay.
Give the medicine a chance to work.
- How long has she been seizing?
- Less than a minute.
I stepped out for a second.
It's okay.
It's okay, Jordan.
It's okay.
You're okay.
- Caught the seizure on the EEG.
- Is this just gonna keep happening?
She needs anticonvulsant medication.
After that, everything should be fine.
- See any spikes?
- Not yet.
- Can she hear me?
- Sure, you can talk to her.
- She's not gonna be awake for a while.
- Hey, sweetie, it's me.
I'm here with Caroline.
Everything's gonna be okay.
You're doing good.
- Dr. Pratt?
- I'll be right back.
She's gonna be fine.
Looks like Neurology can't refuse to admit her now.
- That wasn't a real seizure.
- What are you talking about?
The EEG doesn't lie.
No focal spikes, no sharp waves, and no spike-wave complexes.
She's faking it.
She had a pseudo-seizure.
Call Psychiatry.
- I learned a little Klingon.
- That's good.
We had to get rid of our Klingon translator in the most recent round of budget cuts.
You're serious?
My buddy's hospital in Seattle had to hire someone who speaks Elven full-time.
Thank you, Mr. Tolkien.
That was an interesting approach today.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Look, I know it's cruel throwing students into a group like that.
But it is a good indicator of who has what skills.
I was kind of freaked out.
I've never seen them respond to a student the way they did to you.
Of course, they've never seen anyone show as much disregard for hospital policy.
I think you scared them.
You kind of scared me.
- I am being paged to the ER.
- Yeah.
We could try hypnosis.
- On who?
- You.
It might help you quit smoking.
I'll get back to you on that.
I told her to look for any changes in the shape or size of the breast.
And I felt for any lumps.
I told her to watch out for dimpling or puckering.
This is stupid.
Continue.
I told her to check for discharge.
Then gently squeeze the ni-
Jerry.
I can't help it.
My nipples are sensitive.
- What?
- Your lawyer, Mr. Brooks, is here.
- Excuse me.
- So are we done here?
I want you to prep a lecture for the med students on gender sensitivity in the physical examination.
Abby's down from Psych for your patient.
- Pardon me.
- Yeah.
Do you mind?
- Bored yet?
- Actually, I find it extremely interesting.
I prefer working with empirical data over patients.
- Not a people person?
- Not when they're sick.
- Watch it!
- Sorry.
- You contaminated my ELISA.
- Shouldn't have coffee in the lab.
I always have coffee in the lab.
- You just ruined my sample.
- Do you have to rerun it?
I can't.
I don't have any serum left.
You just set us back six weeks.
I don't know.
Maybe she's faking it.
Not if it's a conversion reaction.
Nothing on the EEG.
Doesn't mean her symptoms are under voluntary control.
Whatever's happening is on a subconscious level maybe due to some sublimated emotional trauma or something.
Would you listen to Miss Freud here?
Okay.
What are we talking about?
- Postpartum depression?
- Maybe.
In some, it can turn into full-blown psychosis.
- Hey, where are you going, Mrs. Dunn?
- Home.
Miss Dunn, hi.
I'm Abby Lockhart from Psychiatry.
I already told him I don't need a shrink.
I have to go.
My husband's waiting for me.
Jordan, if you don't stay, we can't help you.
That was my easiest consult all day.
- Get your prescription filled, Mrs. Epstein.
- Thank you.
- Hey.
- I got these back today.
Oh, my God.
Look at you guys.
You can keep those.
I got double prints.
- Thanks.
- Good night.
Luka.
I didn't know he was coming.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey.
How did Rena Carlson make out?
MVA, came up for an ex-lap.
She had a lot of clot in the belly.
We took out the spleen.
- What about the liver?
- Good.
Mesenteric arteries are fine.
Kidneys too.
She's a lucky girl.
She should be awake by now.
I think she's in 10.
Thanks.
You working banker's hours now?
Hardly.
I only stepped out of surgery once today and that was to pee.
I'm sorry to hear that, for you and your bladder.
Are you up for some dinner?
- Tonight I can't.
- You can't eat?
- Not with you.
- Oh, really?
What's wrong?
Who's that?
A patient?
- It's difficult to talk about.
- Sounds serious.
It could be.
I still have some tests to run.
- Anything I can do to help?
- No, nothing.
I think I'd better go.
- Hey.
- Oh, what are you doing here?
- I thought I'd surprise you.
- Well, you certainly did.
Hey.
Dr. Jeremy Lawson, Mr. David Spencer.
Mr. Spencer.
- How's it going?
- It's going very well, thank you.
Have a good evening, Dr. Corday.
It was nice meeting you.
- What's with the James Bond routine?
- He's English.
Oh, that's nice.
A little taste of home?
Dr. Weaver, sorry to bother you.
If I don't get more nursing shifts I'm not gonna be able to pay for my spring tuition.
You okay?
Why don't you take some time off?
You need to give yourself time to grieve.
I don't have that luxury.
I lost my wife.
Now I'm fighting to keep my son.
I'm sorry.
Been begging and arguing with lawyers all day to get Henry for the weekend.
And they're granting me two days with my son.
Well, if there's anything I can do...
Thank you.
And don't worry about your tuition.
- It's been paid.
- What?
Yeah.
The registrar said it's been paid through graduation.
I'm sorry.
You need to sign this.
- What is it?
- It's a visitation agreement.
Basically, it says you'll return Henry to the Lopezes by Monday at noon.
Hey, baby.
Hi.
Hello, baby.
There you are.
Oh, how are you?
He's been a little fussy.
Maybe he's teething.
Yeah, I don't think so.
It's too early.
Isn't it?
You don't have any teeth, do you?
You just miss your mommy.
- That's my baby.
- Not all of us think like my parents do.
They're pretty old-fashioned.
I know Sandy would be pissed if she knew what was happening.
She'd be cursing up a storm.
I know she'd want you and Henry to be together.
I hope it works out for the two of you, that's all.
Thank you.
Thank you.
That's my boy.
That's my beautiful baby.
- What?
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for an ambulance.
- Carter.
- What?
- I'm not taking your money.
- What are you talking about?
- You know.
I'm not one of your charities.
I was hoping to count you as a friend.
Well, neither a borrower nor a lender be.
Abby, I'm not loaning you the money, I'm giving it to you.
Think of it as an investment in the future of medicine.
You'd be better off with tech stocks.
In the time that it's taken us to have this conversation I've made your salary for the rest of your life in interest.
When you put it that way, how about a couple extra grand for a new car?
You can't park here.
This is where we bring ambulances.
He's with me.
And I will pay you back.
You know, you both should be wearing helmets.
My throat hurts.
It's from being intubated.
I didn't think you'd come.
I said I would.
I think you said you'd call me too.
Well, this place keeps me pretty busy.
You don't remember me, do you, Greg?
That's okay.
Is there anybody you'd like me to call?
My mom lives in Detroit.
Her last name's Henderson.
Julie Henderson.
I'll write the number down if you've got a pen.

State your name for the record.
Dennis Gray.
- Where were you born?
- Toledo, Ohio.
- What year?
- '48.
And where did you attend school?
St. Charles grade school,
Central Catholic high school.
And what did you do after graduating from high school?
I went into seminary
- St. Gregory, Cincinnati.
Why did you decide to go into the seminary?
I decided that it would be a good life if I was a priest.
See that.
We just got back from a fire.
It was fun.
Little attic fire.
Wasn't much, but I'm filthy.
This is the infamous fire pole.
Every little kid's dream.
- Tony!
- Yeah?
Fire safety.
Time to go!
Anyhow, time to go.
Any of you know what monsters look like?
- They're slimy.
- Are they slimy?
- Are they really big?
- They have 10,000 eyes.
A lot of eyes?
They got blinking stuff on them?
What I want to show you is that what you might think a monster looks like, is a lot what a fireman looks like when he comes to your house at night.
OK, more or less like a monster?
No!
If you put the neck on.
- What about now?
- Now!
What about now?
Look.
Am I a monster?
No!
This is me coming into my neighborhood every day for the last six months.
This is a nice park - one of the big things that attracted us to the neighborhood.
Right in there, there's a walking trail, public grade school's way back in there.
It's like living in the forest.
Hi, honey.
Your hair looks great.
Thanks!
Mitch.
Hey, Sam.
You guys go in the family room.
What makes it all worth it, right there.
Hey, Daddy, I can do somersaults.
- You can?
- Yeah.
Watch.
All right.
Salt of the earth.
Mitchel?
You gotta go to bed.
Remember that secret you were gonna tell Mommy?
Here, Mitchel.
Go.
Go fast.
She won't even see you.
- Tell me about Tony Comes.
- Just a friend.
A good friend?
He was a friend.
- And how did you know Tony?
- He was from school.
- What school?
- Central.
- As a student?
- Correct.
And as a fireman.
You knew him when he was a child, right?
Teenager.
And you ever take him out to the cottage?
He would come up different times.
He'd usually drive himself.
What kind of relationship did you have with Tony?
More of a counselor.
He got us out of a lot of trouble.
He got me out of a lot of trouble.
You're late for class, you go to his office.
He did a lot of fun shit.
He took you to the racetrack, he took you to...
He took me out to eat.
In a family of seven kids, we didn't eat out much.
McDonald's was a big deal.
He'd pick on you.
His constant comment to me was,
"Comes, you're the only person I know that would fuck up a wet dream."
At the time, it was, "Ha-ha, funny."
Now it's, OK, he mentions "wet dream."
And he said it all the time.
Was this part of some conditioning process?
It screws with you to the point where you wonder, "How much was I manipulated,
"and at what point did I graduate
"to the 'Now it's appropriate to fucking try something with this kid'?"
Did the church ever provide you, or any of the Catholic schools at which you taught, any guidelines as to what conduct was considered to be inappropriate with a minor?
No.
Did they ever advise you as to when, if at all,
- child abuse should be reported?
- No.
Did they ever advise you when, if at all, sexual contact with a minor should be reported or to whom?
Nope.
The place I was first molested is the rectory at St. Joseph.
Every day I gotta go to my psychologist's office, I gotta drive by this place.
An invitation to Denny Gray's cottage was...
That was where it was at.
You could smoke, you could drink, rake a pile of leaves 12 foot high, dump a half a can of gas on it and light it, and nobody gives a shit.
It was fucking cool.
And once I started getting abused, for one reason or another,
I convinced myself that that was still the better option.
Which I don't quite get.
Did you ever put your penis in the mouths of any students
- when you were at central Catholic?
- Objection.
Fifth amendment.
Do not answer.
Did you ever put the penises of any of your students in your mouth...
- Same objection.
- ...while at Central Catholic?
Do not answer.
Did you ever put your penis in the anus of any of your students...
- Continuing objection.
- ...while you were at Central Catholic?
Continuing objection.
Do not answer.
If you can imagine laying there as still as can be, just...
I was asleep and then, as I came to,
I was like, "Oh..."
Realized what was happening and just kept my eyes closed and waited for it to be done.
And by done, I mean done.
It's like there's a siren going off in your head
"this is not happening, this is not happening,"
yet, the reality that it is happening and you're trying to figure out why and what the hell do I do?
And being so confounded that you do nothing, that you just fucking freeze.
And then the shame, after, or now, at 20, or you know, 33 years old, that I didn't sit up and just fucking punch him square in the face.
You know?
You're still feeling yucky?
- Your teeth hurt?
- Yes.
Yeah?
So what do I need to ask Grandma?
- To check my teeth.
- Check your teeth for what?
To make it... to see if it's better?
- To see if it'll get better?
- Yeah.
What do you think is wrong?
When I was lying in bed, it started hurting.
When you were sleeping it started hurting?
Does the cold water make it hurt more?
Open your mouth.
OK.
Is there blood on my hand?
Breathe.
Can you breathe?
Breathe.
Take a sip.
One of the reasons that I fell in love with Tony...
Sorry, I'm not exactly centered.
One of the reasons that I fell in love with Tony was... because he really did wear his heart on his sleeve.
And unlike a lot of men, he was very comfortable sharing his feelings about me, about life...
Which was the complete opposite of me.
By the time we were married, I had found out that Tony had been abused.
It was the first moment I had heard Dennis Gray's name.
And I never knew.
Sorry.
Trying not to cry.
I never knew how deeply... that name would be ingrained in our lives forever.
Tony and I had bought a new house and I remember... we'd been here a couple of days and I was out shopping for things for the house.
My cell phone rang and it was Tony, and he said,
"You're not going to believe who lives five houses down from us."
And I said, "Who?"
He said, "Dennis Gray."
It was a horrible summer.
Daddy!
Dad!
I can jump on the jungle gym!
I gotta watch out!
Daddy!
Because of the situation, we had to tell our daughter what had happened to Tony.
What's going on?
You think something's up?
You know how Mom and Dad tell you... to cross your legs when you sit down and don't let other people see your underwear, your privates are your privates and if somebody touches you there, tell a big person.
Well... a long time ago, when Daddy was a little bit older than you are, somebody did that to Daddy.
To me.
And today... the person who hurt Daddy a long time ago,
Daddy saw that person.
And he lives right on this street.
And right now, I don't know what that's gonna mean... but what I want to tell you is that Daddy's gonna be OK.
But I need to tell you so you understand, cos you're big enough to understand now,
that I don't want you... to hate this person, because I hate him enough for me, and hating somebody's not a good thing.
I also don't want you talking to this person ever.
If you fall down and scrape your knee on your bike and this person comes up to help you, you tell him to get away.
Do you understand what Daddy told you?
- You understand what I told you?
- I want to make sure you understand.
This man touched me on my penis...
A long time ago.
A long time ago, when he was little.
- A long, long time ago.
- But it still hurts.
But it still hurts.
It doesn't hurt like l-pinch-you hurt.
It hurts in here.
We didn't know this man lived on this street.
We didn't know he lived down the street when we moved here.
I didn't know until today.
If I did, we wouldn't live here.
How would you decide which students to invite
- to Crystal Lake?
- There was no pattern.
Did you have any specific parameters?
- No.
- Any guidelines you would follow?
No.
Did you have any rules for the students that were visiting with you at Crystal Lake?
Just act like gentlemen.
Did you have any rules that prohibited them from drinking?
Yes, I told them, "You cannot drink."
- Pardon?
- I always told them,
"If I go to bed, you watch games or TV, or something,
"but don't touch the beer or booze."
Was there beer or booze in the cottage?
I always had a bottle of Scotch or some beer.
It's the first time I've been back in...
Since the last time I was up here in high school.
It's been a hell of a long time.
The same sheets and everything.
Jesus.
What happened at the cottage stayed at the cottage.
That was the general rule.
I'd like to burn this fucking place down if I could.
We'd come up here and drink, eat, shoot pool.
The part where it gets weird is Sunday morning, wake up and some guy's sucking your dick.
A fucking half hour later, you take a shower, and a half hour after that, everybody who's here, sometimes families included, are sitting around the living room and Denny's sitting there, saying Mass
cos it was Sunday.
So, here this guy just got done violating you and now he's going, "Body of Christ.
Body of Christ."
It was fucked up beyond the point that you would...
It was too screwed up to question.
His bedroom was 20 feet right inside that door.
I was just laying there... wishing that it'd stop and wishing it wasn't happening, knowing that it was.
I was a fucking little kid... a kid, and I needed some help.
I'm done looking at this fucking...
You know, no pill, no psychiatrist is ever gonna completely take it away.
You see, hear, or do something, and all of a sudden, you're thinking about the worst thing that ever happened in your life.
And even at my most intimate times with my wife, not a stitch of clothes on, somehow or another, Denny Gray either sprints or walks slowly through my head.
And so yeah, it's affected it in that respect in that I don't think I've ever had sex with somebody
that somehow or another, the issue didn't... flash or play on slow play.
Once I knew what happened,
I noticed myself... trying very hard to make sure that...
I was doing things so he knew this is me, this is Wendy, your wife.
I have nails, so I would, you know, scrape his stomach or...
It's something where it would...
Maybe he wasn't even thinking about it.
Maybe it was for my own benefit, just to get my mind someplace else.
Just so he was not...
Neither of us was slipping there.
But while I was doing that, I had all this stuff going through my mind, which sucked.
Unfortunately, it now - and I think I said that a few times when we were talking on my tape - this wasn't just eating away at Tony's mind, it was eating away at my mind.
The first time I went to potty train my boy... the fact that it came into my head for a second -
"What do I do if this kid gets an erection?"
Cos I'm trying to teach him how to aim which is natural for a dad to do.
That I was uncomfortable, that I was uncomfortable because of what happened to me, and it invaded or stuck its fucking hand in one more part of my life, a part of my life that it shouldn't have had to.
So when Tony got out of the Navy, he'd been home for probably six months, and he told me that he'd been abused by Dennis Gray.
He didn't ask that I do anything.
He asked me to tell his father, which I did.
How did his father react to the news?
It was a long time ago.
"Oh no.
"What does Tony want to do?
"Does Tony want me to talk to him?
"What should we do?"
I guess, on his part and my part, a lot of soul searching as to what we would do as parents.
I remember John said to me...
"What does Tony want to do?"
And I said, "He don't want to do anything, I don't believe."
He said, "Does he want me to talk to him?"
And I said, "I think you should let him come to you."
So it just sort of got locked away, like a skeleton in the closet.
His siblings were aware of it.
I told them.
Nothing was ever done about it and when the whole thing started in Boston...
Tony lost it.
Where news comes first.
NBC 24 News at 6.00 starts now.
The scandal has ripped through the Catholic church in Boston, St. Louis, and now Toledo, with allegations that priests sexually abused young parishioners.
And today, Toledo's bishop issued a letter to parishioners.
"If you were abused by a member of the clergy
"or another church employee and have never reported it,
"you should come forward."
I remember when Tony came to me the first time and said,
"I think that I need to...
"talk to the Bishop.
"I think that I need to tell somebody what happened to me.
"Somebody in the church."
When he told me that, I was scared to death.
I was scared because...
Not only would he have to go through this, but I would have to go through this with him.
Six men claim Dennis Gray, a former Toledo priest, molested them during the 1980s.
All of the men were students at this high school, where Gray taught religion.
Gray left the priesthood in 1987 and has worked in the Toledo public school system for 12 years and is currently a dean at Rogers high school.
But Gray was put on administrative leave on Monday, and officials say they didn't know about the accusations despite Toledo's Catholic diocese records dating back to 1995 that state Gray admitted to child abuse.
- Did you know Matt Simon?
- Yes, I did.
And how did you become acquainted with Matthew?
In my class.
Basically, he'd step in my office.
Your office at Central Catholic?
- Yes?
- Yes.
I meet Dennis Gray first day of school.
I'm in his religion class.
I don't know if somebody told him my situation, but he said,
"I understand you have some issues at home.
I'll take care of you.
Don't worry."
He came to our school.
He was recruiting altar boys.
I kind of hung back at the time, and he did whatever he could to make you feel wanted, welcomed... special.
He came over to our house, a black shirt with his collar - had a couple of drinks with my mom, Dad was talking to him, and I was asked if I would like to go with him,
like a weekend vacation, to go fishing, do some watersports, do some swimming, meet some other kids my age, and try to give me a set of friends that were heading in the right direction instead of guys who were getting in trouble.
He invited me to come up to the lake house.
His family was up there.
Friends of his were up there.
It was a very family atmosphere, what I'd been used to.
I went with a friend and we all went up together, and I thought it was the greatest thing in the world.
We went sledding...
There was a pool table, there was a huge deck, a huge fireplace, all the things that were just kind of fun, and everybody was gathered around.
It was just a good camaraderie.
All of a sudden, it became more of a party atmosphere, you could look forward to going up there and having fun,
We can play pool, we can drink some beers.
We can act like adults, what every teenager wants to be.
The real alarms went off the next trip we took to the cottage.
I got really drunk.
Apparently, I would try to go out into the snow naked.
When I was up there the second time, he had a day bed and a double bed in his bedroom, he said, "You can sleep on the day bed in here."
I was like, "My gosh, I'm sleeping in his room."
I thought, "Wow, that's pretty nice."
A long story short, I woke up the next morning, and I'm laying in bed naked with Dennis...
You don't remember what happened the night before.
That was probably the first abuse that took place.
You just wake up and he's fondling you and... you're not sure, you know, what's exactly happening, because also a lot of times, you've been drinking before you've gone to bed.
He made sure.
And he'd fix you drinks.
You'd get these rum and cokes, anything that was sweet.
By then, I didn't know which way was right, which way was wrong.
Here's a man who's supposed to be helping me, protecting me.
How can he be doing this to me?
He'd grab your arms and you'd be thrown down, and you were gonna get it whether you wanted it...
You had no choice in the matter, basically.
It wasn't, "Matthew, what would you like?"
Or, "How does this feel?"
Or, "Are you OK?"
You know, it was a rape.
We had oral sex.
Yeah, this is very difficult.
We tried anal sex one time.
A lot of the times, he would just lay on top of me and hump until he orgasmed or came or whatever.
At the time
- I'm going to tell you this -
I had thoughts about guys.
I mean, I had had thoughts about guys.
I thought, "My God, maybe this is it,
"maybe this is what this really is.
"Maybe this is being gay."
I even had conversations with him about that, and we went to meet with a priest so I could talk to somebody about my feelings.
They told me it was completely normal, not to worry.
This was the kind of things he would do for you and you'd just go, "God, he really does care about me."
I didn't really know that there were others until after Dennis moved to Toledo.
I mean, then I knew for sure that I wasn't just sharing time with him where we would go out or whatever.
I was sharing and I felt betrayed, like, "Well, how many people does he love besides me?"
That love that he talked about.
How many?
In an adolescent mind trying to rank them - "Am I still the top?"
It's very hard.
There's a lot of guilt, a lot of shame, and a whole lot of embarrassment.
I represent survivors of abuse across the country and I've been trying these cases... in the court of public opinion and in the courtroom for 20 years.
And I am sad to say that the bishop here and the officials of this diocese... have operated above the law.
- How are you doing, my man?
- Good to see you.
Tony, we've talked a little bit about what we want to achieve here.
The way it happened in Chicago, and in part in Cleveland, is that I said,
"You show us that you're willing to go to the table on all these non-economic things -
"prevention, healing, outreach, the whole thing."
That's what we'll do with this diocese...
So this isn't about the money.
It's about everything else first.
They'll say sorry to me, my mother and everybody else that I ask them to say sorry to - my family, my parish.
I'm willing to compromise on a lot of things.
I'm not willing to compromise on any more lies or secrets.
There's going to be no more loopholes, whether it be amendment rights, statutes.
They're gonna respond like every rational, thinking moral adult.
It's important.
- Let's go get them.
- It's important to us too.
It's important they admit they're wrong.
This is the first one.
The first of six new lawsuits filed against the diocese.
Six allegations of sexual abuse by a former Toledo priest.
He is a predator.
He is a pedophile.
He is a criminal.
Six more allegations that the diocese looked the other way.
The diocese of Toledo, like the dioceses across this country have really operated in secrecy.
And there's been little and no disclosure, and they have become the big part of the problem.
The point I'm at now, they've lied so many times and no matter how I try and play along, I end up feeling like I'm getting fucked again.
And now, what's going to make it right is... shit's going to come to a head and it's gonna get published in the Blade and at least I'm gonna know... that I did everything in my power
and didn't give up.
I think the church here was trying to put on a front -
"We'll be transparent, help in any way we can."
It was like pulling teeth.
It really was.
We asked them, and we put in formal requests for records.
"Can we look at the archives of the diocese?
"Can we look at your personnel files on these priests?"
- And we got nowhere.
- They didn't volunteer anything.
They have a very large, very powerful law firm representing them, and these lawyers have been quietly settling cases for years.
This is a large diocese.
It's 19 counties.
It's 8,200 square miles.
And these guys have been criss-crossing northwest Ohio, quietly settling cases, silencing victims for years.
- What's on your mind?
- A lot.
I'm very anxious.
- Cos of the article coming out?
- Yeah.
Tony, what's that medal you got there?
- It's a St. Florian medal.
- Is that the patron saint...
Patron saint of firemen.
I used to wear a cross, but I kind of took it off lately.
Can you go back a little bit to how the bishop wasn't honest with you?
I got in contact with the diocese because I wanted an apology from the bishop to my mother and to my wife.
I asked that he apologize to my wife for the various disruptions in our marriage due to my... whether it be depression or anger, or however it came out.
He apologized to all three of us.
He said it with more sincerity than anyone I had ever heard.
Then my mother asked him...
I asked the bishop.
I said,
"Bishop Hoffman, are you aware
"of any other allegations...
"against Dennis Gray regarding young people?"
And his response to me was...
- "Not to my knowledge."
- We asked him three times.
He said it with more sincerity than anyone I had ever heard.
I believed that, based on who he was, his position and what he represented to the church, that he was telling me the truth.
Anthony Comes was unable to fight back tears while telling his story.
Comes claims he was molested by his former priest and later lied to by the highest leader in the Toledo Catholic diocese.
He had led me to believe I was the only one.
He lied to me.
Comes' feelings resurfaced last Memorial Day when he was driving down this street of the neighborhood where he'd just moved.
He noticed the priest he once knew lived five doors down from him.
The diocese intervened and Gray is now in the process of moving.
But Comes says he's disturbed Bishop Hoffman told him he knew of no other allegations against Gray.
Then four months later, published an article confessing there was another one.
That's when the firefighter decided to fight back, suing the diocese and talking publicly.
- Were you an altar boy?
- I was.
Were you an altar boy?
Yeah!
Shut up!
Yeah, me, Canning, Williams, Dattinger, you.
I just don't understand how he got away with it when there were other people there.
- Did it happen when we were there?
- Absolutely.
- He'd come out and say...
- I honest to God did not know.
Did you ever go skinnydipping there?
- At night?
- At the cottage?
I don't think so.
Do you recall anybody going skinnydipping?
I do recall that.
I remember wanting to go skinnydipping with Molly Gray there.
Why would you want to go skinnydipping with a bunch of guys?
It was innocuous.
Nothing happened other than fish biting you.
- Whatever.
- It's middle of the night.
If you're fucked up, I guess.
Why would you shower after a game with a bunch of guys?
Same deal.
A bunch of guys up in a cabin drinking, getting fucked up.
Who cares?
If none of us are gay, who cares if I look at you naked?
Except you don't know if anyone's gay.
Bullshit.
It's a very experimental time.
What?
Let me interrupt for a minute.
Do you see me... or my life now in my decision to go public... as a positive thing
or a negative thing?
And do you understand that my position is not Catholics, it's the leadership.
- Why have you forsaken the Catholic church?
- I have not forsaken it.
But based upon my own experience... seeing the current behavior of the church...
I am given a choice to either trust the church in the same environment while they're still telling lies
- with the care of my daughter...
- But I...
Let me finish.
And risk, as minimal as it is,
- something happening to her...
- You'd never forgive yourself.
...or take her out, put her in public school, deal with all the crap you have to deal with.
I'm worried that... you're going to make other people pay for a bitterness that maybe you're picking up from it.
Because I do truly believe in the priesthood and the Catholic church as a good organization.
We're looking at a thousand years of good, OK,
- that the Catholic church has done.
- Right.
And what we're dealing with now, is ten years of a cover-up.
The overwhelming urge to drive down to where the Bishop's laying to rest and piss on his grave is almost completely overwhelming,
But in the light of things, I think I'll hold off on that.
But I'll do it.
Denny, when you're dead, I'll piss on your grave too.
When I got engaged to Tony,
I made the choice... to convert to Catholicism.
I did it because...
I believe in the Catholic religion
I believe in our Lord Jesus Christ very strongly.
Our strongest link to the Catholic church... when I met Tony was John Shiffler,
who was a priest in the Catholic church in Toledo.
Tony and I felt a very strong bond with him.
He helped us through a lot of difficult times.
He counseled us, he married us, he baptized me, he baptized our daughter.
Unfortunately, over this past year, we found out that he's also one that has abused children.
State your name for the record, please.
- John Charles Shiffler.
- And Mr. Shiffler, when did you first meet Dennis Gray?
In 1986, when I first came there.
How did you come to know him at that time?
He was also one of the teachers in the religion department.
Did you share an office with him?
Our offices were adjacent to each other.
How many times did you have sexual encounters with Matt Simon?
One.
What occurred between you and Matt Simon in June 1987?
I am instructing the witness not to answer.
You refuse to answer?
At the recommendation of my counsel, yes.
The lies, the deceit, the betrayal wasn't just from Dennis Gray anymore.
It was from the Catholic church, the Catholic diocese of Toledo, the bishop... everyone that knew what was going on.
They knew that... abuse had occurred by Dennis Gray, by others, but they chose to ignore it.
They knew before Tony was abused that there had been allegations against Dennis Gray, but they chose to ignore it.
Please welcome Bishop Robert Donnelly.
The most visible action on behalf of social justice in the Toledo diocese is the Catholic Charities organization.
Catholic Charities seeks the common good and wellbeing of all, but especially the poor and the vulnerable.
My name is John Schoonmaker.
And with all respect, Bishop Donnelly, I ask, where is the social justice for the victims of sexual abuse by priests?
John, I want to... respond briefly to that question, I guess.
I do want to say that we are well along the journey of responding dramatically, transparently and justly to allegations, any and all.
If you want to continue, I'll do so afterwards, but I'd like to answer another question.
- Bishop Donnelly?
- Yes?
- My name is Claudia.
- Sure, Claudia.
I'm not as eloquent as some.
In fact as I was listening to you talk,
I'd die a thousand deaths than stand up.
But I want you to know that while - and please don't take my tears as weak - but while you may be in compliance on paper, there are people in this community that are hurting.
And this is not an area that social justice has prevailed.
And we need to be not thrown off the church property when we come to give you a letter.
We need to be engaging in a dialogue, looking for solutions.
Claudia, I would indeed... welcome some way to dialogue, but I'm not sure that this is the place or time for us to say other than we are in compliance, that is to say, we do the best we can,
we have lay men and women in different groups that have been appointed to look at our faults, to tell us that we are doing what we've been asked to do.
We have done it well.
It doesn't mean we're perfect at it, but we're working on it.
Right off the top of my head,
I don't think bishops are accountable enough to people.
They're appointed as a bishop, the priest council is their own council.
It's not like a legislative body or anything.
They're not evaluated by the parishioners.
Well, part of it goes back to other situations of this diocese
where, I believe, the administration of this diocese was protecting and covering for and enabling people who I call "faith molesters."
Did you have any priest who counseled you or met with you, suggested that that would be a good vocation for you?
- Yeah.
- Who were they?
A priest at Central, through the years.
Bob Donnelly, the Auxiliary Bishop today.
I know that Dennis Gray served with Robert Donnelly, under Robert Donnelly.
Because I did my deacon internship with...
He was then Father Robert Donnelly.
It was 1979.
Dennis Gray was just being moved.
And I know that they were close.
Did you talk to Donnelly about wanting to move to Toledo?
- Bishop Donnelly?
- Yeah.
- Sure.
- And what did you say to him?
Objection.
Privileged communication.
He wasn't the bishop at the time, was he?
He was a bishop.
- What kind of bishop?
- Auxiliary bishop.
- Where did he stand in the...
- Bishop.
- ...chain of command?
- Number two.
- OK.
Did he have authority over you?
- Sure.
I think Bishop Hoffman, Bishop Donnelly, knew about these accusations on him, and probably to protect his career, remained silent and allowed this man to be around children.
I think any of these bishops like this, who place
- I think across the country - who place these molesters, especially these serial molesters, around kids should resign.
They have no business being bishops if they play with lives like that.
OK, so I'm wondering if between the two of you, if that's come up.
We were going out with his family for a birthday party.
- We hadn't been out together since...
- Since we talked.
...that issue.
And then Tony started talking about the whole church situation, and I think what made it worse was that your brother was going to a church function.
So that put Tony in a whole different universe.
I was freaking out.
So I said... to her, across the table, "Hey, can you come on over
"and sit on this side for a minute until things get going
"and rub my back for a second?"
Now, I just sat down, I've had a long week.
All I want to do is have a drink and talk to adults.
I didn't get shitty, I don't think.
- Not at that point.
- I think I just said, you know...
If he happens to be feeling a certain way or feeling tight, everything that possibly going on with me is just...
Too bad!
Suck it up!
- You turn invisible.
- "I'm tight, so the world ends."
- Wait a second.
- I really wish that Tony could take all the stuff that's turning into anger and do something different with that.
Help people in the Catholic church,
- or, you know, parents, or whatever group...
- Change canon law, leave the church?
If he could do something different with that rather than get angry and pissed off.
I'm usually pretty good.
I may not be doing it the way you would, but this is the way that I think it's going to work for me in order to get through it.
I am what I am.
Guess where I am?
That's the arch in St. Louis.
Hey, Barbara.
Tony Comes.
Apparently, Claudia already has a name tag for me?
She has everything for you.
Welcome to the first national assembly of S.N.A.P., the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests.
Now, we are going to hear from our national executive director,
David Clohessy.
Welcome.
Welcome to my town.
We're here this weekend for one simple reason, and that is to gain the strength and the skills to go out and keep doing what we've been doing, many of us, for years and years,
which is, to save lives.
I'm going to ask just a couple of people to break the ice and if you're comfortable sharing some of what you shared this afternoon, please head up to one of the microphones.
Good evening.
I'm from Tucson, Arizona.
I was raped by a priest when I was 11 years old.
Up until that time, I had one hundred per cent clarity that God's plan for me was to be a priest.
That plan changed, because the closest thing I had to God was that priest that held me down by the back of the neck and stuck his penis in my butt.
This is me as a teenager, at the age when I was abused by the bishop's director of youth ministry for the diocese of Toledo.
I remember vividly on this youth trip, he stopped at a hotel and checked in with a fake name and turned to me and said, "I can't believe I would almost give my real name."
And being naive, like this person in the picture, I thought, "Why wouldn't you?
"If something happened, how would they know where we're at?"
My first sexual assaults by a priest started when I was somewhere between five and six.
Fast forward to 21, 22... and like many of us,
I was confided in a priest who then immediately began an affair with me.
My father himself was a pedophile, so he started around the age of two to approximately the age of six, and then I met Father Geoghegan who went from six to roughly ten.
So it was kind of natural for me.
I was just nine years old when Father Jim worked very slowly and methodically to gain my trust and confidence and silence.
Through the course of it, French kissing, forced masturbation, oral rape became the traumas I experienced, but experienced alone.
My name is Tony Comes.
I'm from Toledo, Ohio.
I'm a 34-year-old father of two.
I'm a Toledo firefighter.
I was abused repeatedly.
I allowed myself to continue to be abused.
I regret the most that I've always been aware.
And I always said, "If I ever find out
"that someone else was after me,
"it'll kill me." I thought I was the only one.
You've taken a very brave step, and we applaud you especially for having the courage to come out and be among people who can support you.
It's a very tough first step, and we welcome you and applaud you for doing that.
And we applaud you for being here.
Can you believe it?
How are you?
It's so good to see you.
- Shorter than I remember.
- Just a little bit smaller.
I've been shitting my pants about meeting you.
- It's a gateway to your past.
- So you have not seen each other either?
I've had his number for months, and every day...
"You should call him."
- I don't know...
- What to say?
How to start?
Yeah, it's not a conversation you really want cos then you have to deal with it when you talk to that person.
So it's not a conversation you want to exactly have, but it's a good thing.
I feel very responsible.
- Why?
- Because...
As I felt all along for 20 years, my biggest fear was, if I would have spoken up, somebody else wouldn't have gone through or feel what I feel.
And I asked myself a thousand times, "Why?"
Do you think that it has a potential to cause serious long-range harm to a child when someone in a position of authority such as a priest puts their penis in the mouth of that child?
- Yes.
- It has the potential cause serious harm.
- No.
- It doesn't?
- No.
- It doesn't have the potential to cause...
- He's answered the question.
- ...serious harm to the child?
Lack of foundation.
What are you talking about?
Serious, permanent harm to that child.
No, I think...
No.
On what grounds do you say it does not?
I don't want to go with medical, I just say every person's different.
So some children it wouldn't bother, others it would?
I would think so.
When you go out there and your parents told you,
"Listen to him and do what he tells you," so when he's saying,
"You sleep in this room, you in this room, you in this room,
- "you and you are in this room with me..."
- No one ever asked,
"Do you sleep in the same bed with him?"
They assumed you were at the cottage.
You know, there were times that I would run.
I would try to hide.
I would try to find people to be around so I could avoid going to Father Auth's garage, or the doctor's house, or his garage...
Wherever he would tell me to go, I would just try to hide.
But I knew that he would find me.
He was very clever.
In the same vein, when I was getting abused... when I say, I laid there, stiff as a board, pardon the pun, just in agony, because I could not mentally control
- a natural, physical, biological reaction.
- Physical reaction.
And I was going, "Jesus Christ!
"I have actually achieved an orgasm, as unfun as it was.
"And it was with a man.
I must be queer!
"Holy shit!
What am I gonna do?"
I had to get as many girls as I could possibly find
- in order to prove it wrong.
- To prove that wrong.
It ruined, for me...
Well, I mean, for any lack of better term... any sex I had with any men for several years after that, because... the only way I could have a relationship with someone was to have sex with them.
That was what I thought would make them like me,
- which I know sounds...
- No.
...really warped.
I don't have to tell you that.
But yeah.
See, with me, the first girl that I was with that wanted to become intimate with me, I just said,
"Why the hell do you want to have sex with me?"
She's like, "It's a nice way to share of ourselves."
I looked at her and said, "Who says I wanted to share anything with you?
And it took a while for me to realize that there were girls who went through similar abuse that I did, and to them, that's the only way of offering what they think is special about them to you.
So tell me something.
If they were to come to us right now and say, "Here is such and such of a settlement,
"and that's it - no ties to it..."
- Fuck off.
- You'd really say fuck off?
Somebody's admitting they were wrong, the highest possible person.
But a settlement, you don't think that's admitting they're wrong?
No, if I take a settlement out of the courts, they, one, publicly aren't admitting anything and I want Dennis to admit that he did this,
I want the church to admit that they covered it up,
I want the church to admit to all the other cover-ups they have.
And I'll walk away without a dime.
- You pay my legal fees and I'm done.
- I want assurances there's measures in place so this shit doesn't happen anymore.
I think I would definitely entertain the settlement, but I...
But you can't tell me that while you were given a settlement...
Like you, Tony and Matt were given a group settlement of $20 million.
- "So you should be happy now." - "And you should be happy now."
It's over.
What do you think?
If you fucking think it's over, come over to my house and every night I wake up, sweating my ass off because I had a nightmare because that fucker's face is in my head,
I'll tap you on the forehead and say, "It's on, it's on!
"Wake up.
You get to go with me for another two hours while I go walking this off."
There's a priest doing confession.
He's sitting in the confessional and he's got to take a shit.
He sees David the janitor walk by and he says, "Dave, get in here.
"I need you to do me a favor.
"I got to take a shit.
Do the confessions.
"All the sins are here, the punishments, just follow the chart.
"Everything's there." A lady comes in, confesses to adultery, performing oral sex on somebody other than her husband.
Dave can't find oral sex on the board anywhere.
He sees one of the altar boys walking by, he goes, "Tommy."
"Dave, what are you doing in there?"
He says, "I don't have time for idle chatter.
"What does Father usually give for inappropriate oral sex?"
He goes, "I don't know.
Ice cream and a movie?"
Oh, Tony.
- OK, you've watched big-time wrestling?
- Yes.
And, being a non-athlete, you'll still be able to get it.
- What's that move called?
- ...move called?
It's a half nelson.
What's this move called?
It's a full nelson.
What's this move called?
- Father Nelson.
- Father Nelson.
Have you heard that one, Matt?
Thank you for everything.
Buddy, I can't tell you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
I would have never recognized you.
Never.
Matt is easily recognizable.
You know what?
I'm probably a lot better
- than I thought I would have been.
- Me too.
So, the diocese has filed the motion to dismiss.
They're saying, even if you have a good case, you brought it way too late, because the statute of limitations restricts your right to file unless you do it within a certain number of years.
So at this stage, they're going to take advantage of every single delay.
And that can turn a two-year lawsuit into an eight-year lawsuit.
They're sinning.
I can fit it in I don't know how many different commandments.
I think if they were truly concerned about helping the victims, they would say, "Let's focus on what really happened
"and look at the merits and what we should be doing,"
but they're not inclined to do that.
Now, the next thing is something called canon law, which is the book of rules that the Catholic church lives by.
Under canon law, priests are authorized to lie if it is in the interest of the church, to protect the church from scandals.
It's called "mental reservation."
I don't know if you've heard of this term.
"Strict mental reservation" means that you can not answer a question, you can lie in your answer in order to protect the interests of the church.
And I think that's probably something that most people don't realize.
There's a gajillion things going through my head.
My daughter's having her fucking first communion in 15 days.
If it wasn't going to be hard to say, "Welcome aboard!" before...
I don't even want to go.
I don't want her to go.
- But I'm...
- It's just...
I'm putting her into a group that, knowing what I just know now,
I don't want her to do it.
It's going to be a far longer process.
Like eight years.
I would expect that from them.
This is difficult for me.
The fact that I was an adult and made a conscious decision to convert to this religion.
Would you make the same decision now?
I don't know.
Quite honestly, Tony, I...
I'm also at a point where I've thought about going over to Perrysburg and checking out Cedar Creek,
- a non-denominational church.
- It's a non-denominational...
It's a place to continue a relationship with God.
You know, I think the communion piece would be difficult, because that is a deep connection for me.
But...
I'm torn.
I'm torn just like you are.
And I think for me, it's easier, because I didn't grow up with this religion.
You were brought up...
I mean, you know...
You go to church, you don't have to look at a book to recite anything.
You know exactly, by memory, because you...
Just like Samantha.
She knows...
The prayers to say, when to say them.
It's second nature for her, and after communion, it's gonna be even stronger.
This side, knucklehead.
- Hi.
- How are you?
OK.
Can you fit?
Move that so you can sit down.
Buckle up.
- What did you learn at school today?
- Jesus day.
Jesus day?
What was Jesus day?
- I forget.
- You forget what Jesus day was about?
- Jesus.
- OK.
What did you guys try last week?
- The host.
- What's the host supposed to be?
Jesus's body.
I actually sat Sam down.
Her book is very similar.
It's slightly more updated, but nearly identical.
And I could remember.
I was an altar boy,
And I enjoyed church until I was abused.
And now, what I'm mad about is that they're doing everything exactly wrong.
And it's the "forgive"part.
When the church adds "forget," that's stupid because it's impossible.
This particular dream, we're at first communion, and my wife and I are standing hands on our daughter's shoulder.
I look down and I see them place the communion in my daughter's hand, and I look up and it's Denny Gray.
I woke up and I'll bet you I couldn't breathe for a full minute.
I was probably crying for ten before she woke up.
And by crying, I mean, shaking, just sobbing.
I have a sense of fear now.
Tony, you can be there.
- I refuse to go.
- She will understand.
I'm so sick to my stomach, I can't sleep.
I need to figure out how I'm going to do this before I walk in that church.
Samantha Comes.
Chris Wilson.
Well, other than picking her up from school, that'll probably be the last time I'm in that church.
You know...
It's strange being 34... and questioning everything you ever thought as far as what I think people look to religion for is when everything else goes to shit.
That's what you do.
You turn to God, or you turn to God in a fashion in which you were taught.
And now, I got nowhere to turn, so it's a bitch.
You know darn well how I feel about you, but I hope you get to a point between now and when this is all over, where you do deal with it as you're through with the anger and you're more down to the nitty-gritty -
"This is right, this is wrong.
"Let's fess up, guys" - and not be angry.
When there is full disclosure and justice
- in my perception of it as done...
- Well, Tony, look't.
I can deal with what I believe was being told a lie by the bishop.
I can deal with that.
The church is like, to me, like any large company.
Sometimes the right hand doesn't even know what the left hand's doing.
- They know.
They fucking know.
- No.
They damn well know that this is tearing up marriages, that this is tearing up individuals, this is...
They know, and they are the pillars of society, and the sons of bitches don't do anything to stop it.
Watch your language.
You know what?
You run around with those guys, it's guilt by association.
I'm sorry, mom, but you're talking out of two sides.
You're wanting...
You so vehemently want to hang on to what you need to - and I don't besmirch you that - but for God's sake, what is it going to take?
Are you asking me to leave the Catholic church?
I'm not going to do it.
I'm asking you to stand up.
I'm asking you to quit writing checks.
What in hell's bells do you think I've been doing?
Or trying to do?
I'm not hiding.
I'm not hiding.
But I am...
Do you put money in a basket every week?
- Yeah.
I think that's my obligation.
- The money you're giving...
- Wait a minute.
- ...pays the attorneys that are fighting me.
Put any kind of spin on it you want.
Remember when I begged you and Dad to let me out of Central?
- Yeah.
- Do you know why?
- Why?
- Because it was happening.
- OK.
Why... you know...
- Why didn't I tell you?
You couldn't.
I was getting beat up for being called "faggot," or "little," or whatever.
Am I gonna fucking put a billboard out that says,
"Yes, I'm getting a fucking hand job, getting my dick sucked by a priest?"
No, but you and dad wouldn't let me fucking go because "Catholic religion and Catholic education is better."
We didn't know what was going on, Tony.
Well, when you did, you didn't do nothing.
All right, but at the time...
I'm thirty-fucking-four years old and I'm crying like a fucking scared 12-year-old.
I know, and we made the best decision with the information that we had at the time.
I'm sorry.
I needed to get my clothes and stuff.
- Does Sam have clean clothes for tomorrow?
- Yes.
Right at the moment, things aren't very good with Tony and I.
He's definitely not one to... he rarely wants to go out anymore.
And if he does, it's with a limited group of people that he's comfortable with.
That is like a 360 from when I met Tony.
I mean, Tony was like...
You'd go out in a group of 100 people, and he'd be the one that's cracking jokes, telling his life story.
That definitely has changed.
He's not comfortable in his own body.
Whether he's always felt that way or not, I don't know.
But outwardly it didn't appear that way.
I mean, he really is...
Different.
I'm exhausted.
I've lost 27 pounds.
I'm about 152 pounds right now.
Two weeks ago, I was 150,
So I've been eating my ass off.
But I don't sleep.
I have no appetite.
Not because I'm not hungry.
But because I'm so fucking wound up and angry all the time, nothing tastes good, nothing...
It's easier to sit and smoke than it is to get up and make a fucking sandwich.
But if she came home and said, "I just can't get by.
We're done,"
I wouldn't blame her.
It'd kill me.
I believe I'd do just about anything to hang on to my children and my wife.
I did not pressure Tony to come back to church.
We rarely talked about it.
But as things have... taken some turns over the last few months...
We have talked about it bringing us closer together as a family,
And that it was important for all of us to... go to church together, get communion, hear the same things and experience the same things
- religiously.
- To participate as a family.
It almost feels like we're taking back some kind of control and not leaving what we believe to be the right religious choice for us,
- for our family.
- You know...
I'm not going to be ashamed of an awful lot of things anymore.
Being Catholic is one of them.
I've just had to suck it up in a lot of ways, so...
That was incredible.
That was the bombl
When did you stop believing in heaven and hell?
I don't think I ever believed in hell.
It's a state, not a place.
And heaven to me is a state, not a place.
Do you believe in God at the present time?
- Oh, yeah.
- You do?
But you don't believe in heaven or hell?
No, I believe in a state, but not a place.
When did you stop believing in heaven and hell?
I've always believed in heaven and hell, as a state.
English
Marie-Ange is a single lady, and smarter than other Thai girls today.
She came with words, which do not belong to the Siamese tradition.
She mentioned things unknown.
She absurdly mentioned coming time.
She foretold the future as if she were insane.
Marie-Ange
Be careful.
Take it away.
Be very careful.
Come on.
Lift it up.
I said be careful.
Damn it!
Bring it up right now.
It's been hidden for over a century, but then will be damaged on this damn day.
Meeting!
Why me?
I'm not the only specialist in the whole Consulate!
They insisted only on someone knowledge able.
I haven't had any sleep after that charity play!
Want me to take a nap at the meeting?
Are you from the Consulate?
Yes, I'm from the Royal Thai Consulate.
I left as soon as possible.
Please go inside.
Everyone's there.
Voyageur'.
So what?
They said they found ' Voyageur'.
They are holding a press conference today, aren't they?
Where did you hear it from?
Although this record has not been certified, we know it well.
This record has become a center of attention.
Manee knows about that, doesn't she?
That's why Menie has been there since last night.
She's kind of edgy.
She also asked me to bring her some documents.
Please send me a copy of the record's details.
I'll do it right away.
This record was written by Fran?
Ois Xavier, wasn't it?
Who?
Fran?
Ois Xavier!
Just a moment, please.
Yes.
Fran?
Ois Xavier!
Tell Manee to leave for Bangkok once the meeting is over.
The truth, everyone, is an important condition making us all here.
No matter what will happen to our curiosity, no matter what the thing before us will be, and no matter where it comes from,
I've never hesitated to say that... there is not any truth, which is new, except for lies!
So is the thing to be shown before you.
It's a challenge to the understanding in question.
Ladies and gentlemen, the forbidden record,
' Voyageur'
We're home.
Get up!
Go on sleeping in your bedroom.
Don't you know what home is?
Home?
Whose home?
And who are you?
Where am I?
It's not funny.
Stop fooling around.
I drove you home.
And do I have to carry you upstairs, too?
Gosh, Kul.
All I want to do is sleep!
Can't you just go around one more time?
I haven't seen the Temple of Dawn yet.
Don't wanna get up?
Then don't.
I gotta have a pee.
Hey, Menie!
What now, Kul?
Is someone in the bathroom?
Khun Malida is inside!
Go say hello, Menie.
She's been preparing the house since yesterday.
You're chewing gum?
Beautiful wrapper.
Did you buy it abroad?
It's got a French tower, too
It's called the Eiffel Tower.
It has the Golden Pagoda's height.
Wish I could speak French.
Do you speak fluent French?
Not at all.
I can fluently swear though.
Have mom and dad come here?
Nobody comes here.
Why is it hard for someone to love someone?
Professor, Khun Maneechan is here.
Come on in.
Sit down.
We're able to cooperate with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs due to our binding agreement, especially when the existing information supports the belief that the record was written here.
The word 'Mongkut' is pretty clear and well-accepted all over the world.
The word also appears in the Americana Encyclopedia,
Volume 19, Page 355.
Even Anna Leonowens was mentioned.
Incredible!
In the record there is also the word 'Siam'
It can't be any other place.
But what about this?
The longitude zero.
Professor Luang, what do you think?
It means the longitude zero in geography.
At a longitude zero, it is Greenwich in London.
The Greenwich Mean Time, the standard time, not Siam.
Siam is here, at a longitude of 100 degrees, not zero.
So, what now?
What did they say?
They accepted the part that Siam was mentioned, but could not agree on the location mentioned in the record.
Moreover, they said it's a nonsensical tale.
They didn't certify the record writer.
But I think...
It's interesting, isn't it?
That's why I called you back.
We all know this record very well.
I want you to forget it.
It's nonsense.
They were right.
Just don't mess with it.
Why nonsense all of a sudden?
There must be something I don't know.
What is it?
In every historical record,
The truth and lies are always mixed up in one sentence.
It depends who wrote it.
What about 'Fran?
Ois Xavier'?
This person doesn't exist!
Forget him!
You must be disappointed, but we have some good news about the longitude zero.
Is that so, Professor?
Stop fooling the kid.
Please explain it.
It's just about the time difference, Manee.
The Siamese had their own time since mid-19th century.
It was truly our own time.
It was set more than a decade before the GMT.
This is the Apinaoniwes cluster of Royal Thrones.
This is called the Puwadontassanai Royal Throne, or the clock tower.
It was like the meantime center of Siam at that time.
It was built about two years before the tower of Big Ben.
So it is the Bangkok Mean Time.
Don't you agree that His Majesty was very brilliant?
There is only one person who was capable of doing so.
No.
There is only one king who was capable of doing so.
Do you agree that His Majesty is very brilliant?
So, Professor, please show us where the then longitude zero was.
The then longitude zero was here.
The Bangkok Mean Time.
Could you just make it clearer?
It isn't nonsense, is it?
That's enough discussion for today.
Thank you.
You saw your mother, didn't you?
Yes, dad.
Is she fine?
Yes, she's fine.
Good.
See you later then.
Marie-Ange!
Oh!
You've woken up, young lady.
Dan, Dan, she woke up!
Go tell the Doc that she woke up.
Yes, madam.
Where am I?
Hello?
Kul, I just called you a moment ago.
Yes.
Nothing.
I slept so well that I had a strange dream!
It was a man!
Yes.
Just a sec, Kul.
The kettle is boiling.
Yeah.
Go ahead.
Yes.
The clock tower?
Does it survive?
Okay.
Can you take me there?
Okay.
Right.
Thanks.
Bye-bye.
We're Americans.
We're Protestant.
I'm a doctor.
My name is Bradley.
This is my wife, Sarah.
This is our house.
I really like your clothes.
Where did you get clothes like that from?
Don't worry.
I will keep them for you.
Home!
I'm home!
You need a good rest.
We'll be downstairs...
Hello?
Hello, Khun Malida.
Khun Manee hasn't came home for two days.
I already asked Khun Kul.
They've been looking for her.
Her name is Maneechan, sir.
She appeared out of no where.
Doctor Brad said she's not his patient.
He's never seen her before.
It's strange she can read and write.
Doctor Brad talked to her, but found nothing.
She insisted on her being Siamese.
She was born in Dhonburi.
Dhonburi side is her exact word.
It's a worry knowing she can speak English.
At worst, she and that Protestant French guy speak the same language.
Keep close watch on her.
The First Somdej and Minister of Defense forbid us to trust anyone.
I've never seen you before.
Yes.
Where do you live?
At my house.
My parents lived here for a long time.
I was born here.
Please let me go home or call me a taxi.
Taxi?
I can pay my taxi fare.
May I use the telephone?
OK, then, I'm going home myself.
The First Somdej has called for Doctor Brad-Lay, sir.
Who?
Me?
Yes, the First Somdej has called for Doctor Brad-Lay, sir.
Now?
Yes, sir.
He's been waiting.
Please don't leave.
Just wait until I come back.
Doctor Brad-Lay?
Yes.
Doctor Bradley.
Is he Doctor Brad-Lay?
People here call him so.
Don't you know him?
You must be joking!
Doctor Bard-Lay?
The printing house?
Somdej?
I guess it's Somdej Chao Phraya Sanitarium!
I got you!
Are you pulling my leg?
Good acting!
It's Kul's idea, isn't it?
- What's the matter?
- Where is it?
- Where are you going?
- Where are you hiding the camera?
Where are you hiding the camera?
You can't fool me!
Khun Manee's back.
She's upstairs.
What happened to me?
What did happen to me?
It was so real that I almost touch it.
I felt it.
I experienced it.
Too real to be a dream.
But the most shocking thing is...
It was so warm.
It turned out to be a heartwarming place.
It was a kind of longed-for feeling.
What happened to me?
And if it happens again, what should I do?
Fax from Sorbonne.
They've come to a conclusion.
You can stay here a while.
Go have a look around.
A tale?
Is Voyageur a tale?
They didn't say that Voyageur is a tale.
They just said that this record is a tale.
But they already certified it authentic in terms of the ink and paper.
They still certify it, but with disagreement.
Here is a part of their analysis.
They sent it here before they made the conclusion.
There are three things that I agree.
First, what do you think it's a sketch of?
The Eiffel Tower.
The Eiffel Tower.
The Eiffel Tower.
Of course, it's the Eiffel Tower.
Okay, it's the Eiffel Tower.
So what?
How disappointing!
You being my daughter!
Come on, dad
Come on, Manee.
In the year the record was written, the Eiffel Tower hadn't been built yet!
But the writer kept saying that he saw it.
Moreover, second and do you know where he saw it?
And you said you read it to the detail?
The man said he saw the Eiffel Tower on the side of the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok!
Manee, can you please remind me, please tell me... the Eiffel was here,
In the record I saw it didn't mention this.
Professor Lagree had me fooled again!
All right, you've been fooled but, third, listen carefully this time.
This Monsieur Fran?
Ois Xavier also claimed that the west side of the Chao Phraya River was a British colony whereas the east belonged to the French.
How interesting!
Dhonburi belonged to Britain and Bangkok belonged to France.
What a pity for the Government of Siam and the ferries.
The Government of Siam?
Forget about it, Manee.
You take your time looking around.
Go back to your usual life and forget about this tale.
Bangkok's still here.
Thailand's still here, isn't it, Manee?
"Welcome to Pra Karahom House"
The woman from Doctor Brad-Lay's home.
Prostrate yourself before the Minister of Defense,
Chao Phraya Srisuriyawong.
The woman from Doctor Brad-Lay's home.
I don't know there is a stranger at his place.
What is your name?
Answer him.
Manee.
Manee, sir.
Manee, sir.
Maneechan, sir.
Dhep, why do you want to introduce anyone named
Manee or Maneechan to me?
She speaks English and French, sir.
How old are you?
Maneechan.
Twenty-seven years old, sir.
A thousand days roughly make twenty-seven years.
It's the 27th year that brings utmost beauty to women.
What do you think?
What brings utmost beauty to women... is love, sir.
A man born for over ten thousand days, but still have sweet talking around.
What do you think of that man?
That's lovely, sir.
In this critical situation, we'd better keep her here.
Tri and Dhep, make the necessary arrangements for her.
Keep close watch to see which country she is loyal.
You'll enjoy a stay here so long as you aren't a troublemaker.
Muan is a maid at your service.
I hope you'll have a good time here.
I'm Siamese, not foreign as mistaken.
So take it as a welcome.
This is not a prison.
Staying here for a while won't do you any harm.
When the time comes, then we will talk again.
Muan, take care of her very well.
We, the Siamese, do not fear foreigners.
But we are alert to every possible trouble they may cause.
Manee, the Siamese do not fear foreigners.
Khun Kul, she disappeared again.
What should I do?
I'm scared.
All right, Manee.
Tell me everything.
I'll try to be patient.
Manee, please.
I'm all ears.
I'm from... from...
In fact, I'm from here.
I'm from... from...
In fact, I'm from here.
Then where on earth am I right now?
You said you'll be patient, didn't you?
Go on, please.
It's here, Bangkok, but... in a different year.
It's a year so far away.
It's a year lying far beyond.
The present year here, was the past in my present year there.
Each period of time stays years apart.
Will your tale take years to tell?
It must be hard to tell about your present year in my present year.
I won't sit for years in my present year for any tale in your present year.
I find it hard, sir.
I don't find it hard to tell, but hard to believe, sir.
I hardly believe that it is really happening.
I will believe you, if you tell the truth.
I'm worldly-wise with an open mind.
Nothing in this world cannot be done.
Tell it your way.
I'll believe you.
Tell it your way.
I'll believe you.
All right, I have a narrow mind.
But I'll listen to you.
Make it your way.
I'll believe you.
Really?
And you won't be angry, will you?
Yes, my Manee.
You may dance, if you'd like.
I'm from the year 2003 A.D.
It's a future year of the present time here.
It means I have traveled back 100 years into the past.
I was born here.
My father doesn't love me.
My mother doesn't love me, either.
They've split up.
I was sent to study and grow up in France so that I will be no one's child.
I still love them both anyway.
I graduated in history.
I work for the Royal Thai Consulate in Paris.
You said you're from the future.
Don't you think it sounds like a tale?
You said you would believe her.
At least Siam still exists at that time.
Is Siam colonized in your time?
No.
Siam has remained independent, sir.
But we lost some territories.
We changed the name from 'Siam' into 'Thailand'.
Thailand?
We lost some territories?
Which parts?
To whom?
How dare you tell such a made-up story?
Manee.
You may be beheaded with such a curse on our homeland!
Calm down.
Manee, tell us more about our country.
Our country is very modern.
There are many skyscrapers.
Everything has changed.
We have cars, electricity, movie theaters.
We dress in a western style.
We accept foreigners more than we accept one another.
We have everything the Westerners have.
We are everything the Westerners are.
We eat everything the Westerners eat.
We prefer anything the Westerners tell us to.
We want to be them and refuse to be ourselves.
But you said we are not colonized.
Do we still have our king?
This is the only thing that keep us as ourselves.
Who is the Minister of Defense?
Why has he let our country go that way?
He is called Prime Minister.
We underwent political change.
Political change?
What is it then after change?
We call it democracy, sir.
Democracy?
All right!
And which country do we accept,
England or France?
We accept all... but ourselves.
The United States of America is the world's greatest country.
Our children accept Japan as well.
America?
That new country?
And Japan?
Do all Siamese speak unclear Thai and tell lies like you?
The United States of America also sent their men to the moon.
Men to the moon?
All is true, sir.
Then... is the moon... is the moon flat like the earth?
Manee disappeared!
Go find her!
Make it quick!
Manee disappeared.
Num, where are you?
Come help me pack my clothes.
Where are you going?
And when?
Where are you going?
With whom?
For how long?
And with whom?
Will you take me with you?
Camera?
Where are you going?
And when?
Are you taking me with you?
How about thongs?
Chewing gum?
Yes, Num.
- Manee is back.
- Back?
Go tell him Manee is back.
The situation is critical and you are acting mysteriously.
I can't explain myself, sir.
That gunboat, the Rattler has arrived.
Are you involved with them, Manee?
No, I am not.
Please don't get me wrong.
I am Siamese, sir.
We'll see to which country you are loyal.
Company, present arms to Sir John Bowring an envoy of Her Britannic Majesty the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland.
Salute!
I, Minister of Defense, come in the name of His Majesty the King of Siam, who requires me to come and greet you.
His Majesty is happy to receive the envoy of Her Majesty the Queen of England.
When a foreigner looks at us, it does not see us as human, Manee.
The audience should be conducted according to tradition royal custom.
All ambassadors should follow our protocol.
You may dress as suit your dignity, but we cannot permit wearing of arms in the royal places, not even a Siamese official man.
But we refer to them as 'it'.
Are you determined to foul this rule?
Foreigners are man-eating animals.
Not only is our military power at a disadvantage, but also our diplomacy, for we lack experts with an equal command of languages.
Don't any of you even think about translating that for me!
If our country goes to rack and ruin, don't blame me.
This is the Letter of Appointment from the Queen of Britain, which appoints Sir John Bowring as representative plenipotentiary from the British Government to discuss government-related matters with Siam.
This is the Royal Command, appointing the negotiating committee.
Somdej Pramahaprayurawongse, exercising absolute power on behalf of His Majesty the King, in all matters concerning the Kingdom of Siam.
Krommaluang Wongsathirajsanit, representative of His Majesty the King.
Somdej Chao Phraya Barommahapichaiyati, in charge of the capital and its environment.
Myself, Chao Phraya Kalahom, in charge of the coastal city of Siam.
I have had everything translated into your language.
He will read the Treaty to everyone.
Tell him not to read it.
I've read the copy.
Ask them if such a Treaty means they are going to loot or to colonize our country.
And to not waste their time elaborating.
He understands the matter in its entirety, but wishes to ask you about your intention.
He would like to make friends and trade with us.
He wouldn't like us to close the door of trade.
That's the door.
If I did close the door, they all wouldn't have a chance to come here.
Whether it's Crawford or Burny, they have all been here.
Siam has never closed the door.
Tell them that.
You told me yourself... you weren't happy when Japan put a blockade on your country.
But Siam is not like that.
Crawford, the British Diplomat, came to Siam during the reign of King Rama II and there were others.
We won't sell teak woods.
We don't have that much.
We won't sell rice, either.
Siam sells it to no one.
We keep it to support ourselves.
The tariff is to be reduced from 10% to 3%!
Let's agree to disagree!
With the battleship in our river, they think they can have anything!
Chuang, kick them out if you are annoyed.
What matter is the Treaty must not be signed against His Royal Majesty's wish or else we fight!
If Siam has to change,
I, Akaradhep Warakorn, will not change.
Get out of the way
If the Siamese blood still runs in you!
Don't let anger lead you.
You must think of the country's sake.
Don't you know what that lion from Britain and Ireland asked the Minister of Siam to declare that... the old On A Rubber East India Company's agreement made before the reign of the First King, and Second King,
is overridden by the Captain Henry Burney Agreement.
That's it.
That's how I think of our country's sake.
Let the First Somdej decide.
I speak from his own heart.
Don't speak for anyone's heart.
Any action taken must not involve the Government of Siam.
The way to negotiate is of utmost importance.
You should ponder over it very hard.
What matters when negotiating with the lion is not how to be careful with words but with your throat.
So far as I know, the Rattler is coming.
The lion will get no further than Fort Pong Pajjamitr or Fort Pajjaneuk.
You!
Any action taken will not involve the Government of Siam.
We can't do this British man any harm.
It will mean giving them a chance for rightful invasion.
Phraya Siam Manukoolkij Siammitmahayos!
Was 'it' appointed as Phraya?
That lion from Britain and Ireland?
What are you talking about?
Do you know him well?
I can't explain myself, sir.
But this person will be of much benefit to Siam.
He will be Siam's first ambassador plenipotentiary in Europe.
If we agree to be disadvantageous this time,
England will protect its interests.
This goodwill will protect us.
Other countries will be more considerate towards us.
All interests can belong to us.
Don't you know what you just said is called rebellion.
It means you want the foreigners to overpower the royal throne.
Then France will follow how to take advantage of Siam.
All of our territories will be theirs.
Siam has never feared the might of any country!
Any might means nothing if we know proper act of negotiation.
You learned from them so you should know how they think.
All right, we come too far.
If I resist you, I am deemed stubborn, an old-timer going against the country' prosperity.
My time is up.
In your time comes prosperity, have it with care.
May it please Your Most Gracious and Excellent Majesty,
I, Luang Rajaritthanon, pray you will permit me to acquaint Your Majesty with Sir John Bowring, an envoy of Her Britannic Majesty the Queen of England, who rules the royal United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland, and his commission.
It is my pleasure to greet an envoy of Her Britannic Majesty the Queen of England.
I realize the greatness of your country and the value of mutual goodwill.
How is the treaty going?
Everything is all right.
You must not expect too much from Siam.
It was mostly a jungle.
Trade will make Siam a garden.
Our country used to be a forest.
Your country is a garden?
We have earned our prosperity through trade.
When the steamer would leave?
Tomorrow when treaty is signed.
The battleship will go to await me beyond the river's bar.
When everything is done,
I hope that this goodwill will make us good friends.
Manee, I was born by this river and I will die by this river.
England and France are ready to cut us in half like they would to a banana.
How can we fight them?
We fight for our homeland.
We do it in secret.
We move by degrees,
Manee.
Over there is the center of our homeland.
Our secret weapon is there.
It's the secret weapon chamber as rumored.
Its power is second to none.
Its power can defeat the entire world.
This is in case you still question the protection of our homeland.
This is the power that His Majesty the King has reserved for us.
This is the secret weapon in the Royal Palace.
Or is it just a rumor?
The longitude zero...
Do you believe such a rumor,
Manee?
It is at the Siamese clock tower.
Behind this door is...
what you despise.
Let's see what our secret weapon is.
This is what His Majesty the King has prepared for us all.
In a century it is hard to find such a sage in Siam.
That's why...
I have devoted my life and my heart to His Majesty.
This will be the pride of our descendants for generation to come.
It is hoped that they too will know this valuable weapon and it is hoped that they will understand what we are trying to do.
In my time your Siamese descendants can read and write.
The Siamese can read and write!
You absurdly talked about the future again.
Anyway, I will take that as compliment.
So it means we did it.
Is everyone brilliant?
The country must be in a terrible mess!
Not quite, sir.
There are many libraries.
Anyone can read books there.
Plenty of books are available at the corner of every street.
Any one can buy any book, but each of your descendants read only six lines a year, sir.
The Siamese in the future read six lines a year!
They read six lines a year!
My homeland is going to rack and ruin!
Just six lines a year!
Don't let His Majesty the King know about this, otherwise His Majesty will fall ill.
Why's that?
Do they read very slowly?
They read as many as six lines a year!
If it is really like you said, the Siamese people must be all stupid.
Sir.
I am sorry, sir.
Manie is a single lady, and smarter than other Thai girls today.
She came with the words, which do not belong to the Siamese tradition.
She mentioned the things unknown.
She absurdly mentioned the coming time.
She foretold the future out of insanity.
Something's wrong with Menie.
But I don't know what.
We can't report her as missing person because then she will show up again.
Is her stuff still here?
Num said everything is still in its place.
Did she tell you anything?
Every time I asked her, she said she'd gone to the library.
It seems she's hiding something.
Is she on drugs?
No, I don't think so.
She's only addicted to chewing gum.
I can't stop thinking.
What should we do now?
Excuse me, Khun Malida.
Hello, ladies.
The lady from a good family wears a gold belt.
Wearing a sarong and having white teeth are not deemed beautiful.
Whilst staying here, you must dress properly so that Pra Karahom won't be embarrassed.
I don't know when you will leave.
If you go,
I don't know when we will meet again.
I want you to stay on.
I'm pleased to have you stay unless it pleased you to leave.
Do you think she hates us?
She hates the way we dislike each other.
Is this why she disappearance?
No, it isn't.
It's her choice whether or not to come back.
Do you know where she is?
No.
I never know.
She has her reasons to be missing.
But she also has reasons to come back.
What if she has gone for good?
It means she has something to tell us.
Malida, if one made a mistake, and tried so hard to make it right we have to live with the things we couldn't change.
I think that's all she wants.
Manee's back.
It's high time we told the truth.
Menie, can you tell me what happened to you?
Please.
Don't do this to me.
Are we still friends?
You always trust me, don't you?
Just answer me, yes or no?
Has she been away again?
If yes, please look at me, Menie.
And tell me the truth.
It's hard to explain, Kul.
Don't push me so hard.
It's all so hard to believe.
I will believe you.
Just tell me the truth.
Please tell me, Menie.
It's very beautiful, Kul.
It's a very beautiful land to me.
Though it looks uncivilized and they are called barbarians, they've kept fighting.
They've never abandoned their homeland.
What matters is that 'they' mean 'we'.
We always forget how we went through it.
Where is it, Menie?
Who are they?
It's here.
Kul.
The land that we now live in.
They are our forefathers.
I went back to see them with my own eyes and with my own heart.
Are you telling me that your yo-yo disappearance means you've been back to the past?
Are you telling me... what you find hard to tell is talking about your journey back to the past?
Is that the best story you've got after I've been worried sick about you?
I don't know how this could happen.
See?
I shouldn't have told you.
Is this how you return my trust?
All right, Maneechan.
It's okay.
If you don't want to tell me, then don't.
I won't ask you again.
It must be very important to you.
We haven't known each other long enough.
All right,
I won't bother you again.
You may go back to your spaceship.
I won't ever bother you again.
Kul, I'm telling the truth.
I was born by this river and I will die by this river.
This river is in great danger.
It is your pleasure to leave it behind, Manee?
Some were born to search for the force of evil.
Some were born with it.
Monsieur Gabriel Aubarey, the French Consul, gave a warning to us that
France wants power in Siam.
They have moved across Annam, Laos and Khmer which are Siam's protectorates.
They want to reduce our power.
If it wasn't for England's interests, they would have already snapped our throat!
I have always believed throughout history, the Thai people have always tried their best.
If not, how could we have kept our independence?
Look at our neighbors?
Any countries left?
To the east,
Laos, Annam, Khmer.
To the west, Burma.
To the south, Malaysia.
None of them left!
But we should have done better.
Should have done better.
All right, Manee.
In our lives, we always think we should have done better.
We should have done well, better and best.
And then far better or better than best?
Or better than best if... you could play a role in the past, would you do anything?
Say, in the case of battles with Burma, we could return to tell our ancestors how to win the battles.
Would you tell them to make machine guns instead of cannons?
Manee, you don't have to go as far as the past.
Dear Khun Maneechan, could you please make a couple of radios for me?
Budget limited.
No radio repair shops around here.
I will collect them next week.
You needn't bother to right history.
The past has to be a constant companion to the present.
The present has to be a constant companion to the future.
If we have a thorough understanding of what the future is like;
how it goes... how it ends, then what's the meaning of our present lives?
The benefit of France is under risk.
We have to occupy the Mekhong Delta.
Occupying the Mekhong Delta?
What about England?
They should be happy with India,
Burma and the Indian Ocean while the South China Sea and the Gulf of Siam should belong to us.
With the benefit equally divided, as long as Siam remains a buffer stage and.
As long as we don't touch anything already owned, there will be no problems.
The cake has already been cut.
Why trying to snatch the knife only to spill more blood?
Khmer belongs to French?
Since when, Honorable Consul?
As I remember
Siam has ruled over Khmer since long time ago.
If I count the dates correctly, it was even before you were born.
But once we came to rule over Annam in the Kochin China, we then have had the authority over the whole Khmer since as in the history,
Khmer belonged to Annam.
But using history to make such a claim is a dangerous excuse.
If England used history to make a similar claim.
French might have to return Normandy,
Gascony and what else?
Oh!
Guinea to England as well.
Let's be reasonable.
Prince Narodom of Khmer was crowned by our King.
This means he accepts that his country is under Siam's protection.
This tradition is much clearer than any treaties.
I shall allow only 'Pra Tabong',
'Angkor Wat' and 'Siem Riep' to remain under Siam's protection as for the rest...
I will consider this tradition of yours on our gun ships.
Captain La March,
I will assign you an important task, which is much more important than your service as a military officer, responsible for training the royal troops of these barbarians.
I'm teaching these barbarians a lesson.
I want this cunning nobleman, Somdej Chaophraya, discharged.
Somdej Chaophraya discharged!
La March, give this letter to the King of Siam.
You want me to give this letter to the king.
What if it upsets the King?
La March,
France is a very powerful nation, to which Siam must pay attention.
You are French.
Never forget that.
Siam must pay attention.
Yes,
Siam must pay attention.
I shall proceed immediately.
Tonight, La March.
Please, this is not the right moment.
This is early hour.
Please get back.
Are you going to inform His Majesty?
Quiet please, His Majesty's been ill.
I will receive the letter.
Listen to me!
You should go back!
Get him out!
Drag him out!
Did they pay you this much attention?
I will inform the Emperor that
Siam intends to demean France and wishes to break up the mutual goodwill between the two countries
Our naval fleet in Saigon will make Siam pay more attention to us
Pay more attention to us, sir?
French gun ships can seize Siam within twenty-four hours if the mutual goodwill between Siam and France breaks up.
France refuses to negotiate with a small country swarmed with corrupted nobles...
on any issues.
Don't you want to investigate first?
I would like to invite you to the hearing first.
This man doesn't make sense.
I don't want any stupid investigation.
Or you want to be an enemy of France.
Concerning Captain La March, I must apologize, but the captain should have known our rule.
You want to apologize?
Anything you dare to do with La March, we will do the same with your King's people.
Now get out of my face!
Go away!
Barbarians!
Go away!
Siam will be safe, sir.
But we have to lose quite a large territory.
France claimed that Samed Island belonged to Khmer.
Then we claim that Khmer belongs to Siam.
When the day came, nobody would ever stop that.
But please don't totally believe what I said, sir.
We'd better think how to lose the least.
For England or Great Britain
Siam was meant to be a buffer state.
Buffer?
Buffer between what?
To the east of Burma we would be a borderline between England and France.
Interesting.
How do you know that?
To me it is history.
To you, it is the future.
But France might not think likewise.
They might want it all.
Then get rid of that French man!
We must by no means allow for that chance.
No matter how you are plotting about Consul Aubarey,
Please don't allow for that!
La March!
La March!
Gun ships!
La March!
The world is changing, Dhep.
Whether it is round or flat, it is changing.
Say, If Manee really comes from the tomorrow years, it foretells that we have to change as the world changes.
The New Road near the Palace took place with the New World.
We have to be ready for the newcomers.
His Majesty the Second King always spends time with foreigners.
Changes are not a loss, Dhep.
Please ponder over it with wisdom.
Dhep, please tell me... you love Manee, don't you?
If a ten thousand days bring utmost beauty to women,
I will seize an opportunity to behold such beauty.
If love brings utmost beauty to any Siamese woman,
I will give her that love for a ten thousand days.
Don't forget that we are here as the host, not the barbarian.
I've forced myself to act like Westerners.
Manee, it is our duty.
I didn't ask you to have fun.
This is about our country's affairs.
If you're really from the world you mentioned, please make use of your knowledge for my world's benefit, Manee.
Can Can!
I want Can Can!
Can Can!
Let the fun continue!
You're not Siamese.
Who you are?
Let's go!
She killed Consul Aubarey!
She killed the French Consul!
We are going together, my Manee.
Where can we go?
It's the French Consul.
He's somebody.
We can go by the power of Pra Karahom.
We can go further than the border of Siam.
What about the French power and the people left behind?
Where can they go?
And where can we go?
Khun Manee, why are you dressed like this?
Where are you going?
No.
Just to try it on.
You're very beautiful, my Manee.
I want to take a nap.
Num!
Num, what did you say?
I'm sorry, Khun Manee,
I said you're very beautiful.
No.
In what language did you speak?
What language?
What language?
Why?
Num!
Perhaps I am forgetful.
Manee, please tell me the Eiffel Tower was here.
This Monsieur Fran?
Ois Xavier also claimed that the Dhonburi side belonged to England, the Bangkok side belonged to France.
How interesting!
The last wink is in the past.
The future is only a wink away.
Then in which glimpse of the river is the present?
And how long does the present last?
Don't touch the past, my Marie-Ange.
Let the river run.
Marie-Ange's love will be fulfilled, but the country will fall down.
Marie-Ange's love will be lost, but the country will be balanced.
You can go for the future, but not without forgetting the past.
The record refers to choices of the angle.
You're not Siamese.
Who you are?
Why are you dressed like this?
Where are you going?
In 1893, we lost our territories to France.
We also lost our extraterritorial rights.
The battles with Burma were of sovereigns.
But the loss of extraterritorial rights was a result of oppression.
His Majesty King Chulalongkorn fell ill.
In the depths of despair, His Majesty refused bathe and eat.
Though loyal subjects remained, how could we oppose that power?
With their gunboats, they forced us to fight back.
But we were defeated.
We had to pay damages of three million whereas France lost three soldiers.
We lost our territory on the left side of Mekhong River.
The French government wanted to form a border of its protectorates.
France and Great Britain...
France and England... planned to use Thailand as their buffer state.
To save the rest, we needed to sacrifice some territories.
Although we could save our independence, our days have been lost in the depths of bitterness.
Death is not astounding, my Manee.
I was born by this river and I will die by this river.
If one does not follow one's own path,
She is always with us, Malida.
She can feel it.
It's like she was reborn.
My Malida...
If I haven't yet returned, don't worry, mom.
Please remember me.
If I haven't yet returned, please remember me, dad.
I'm working on your radios.
Here I am pouring holy water for you, my dear.
May holy water and blessing warm your heart.
No matter where you are please know that...
I will love you always.
When the two worlds move apart, each world has its own path to follow.
Until the parallel worlds meet again, some will find a gateway to another world;
some will meet the longed for love;
and some will bid farewell forever.
Until then, the very two words may be a dream come true.
Previously on "Stargate SG-1":
- Who are you people?
- We are replicators.
- The others would destroy me.
- Not if you came with us.
You would do that?
- Major Carter was beamed away.
- The replicators must have her.
I imagine you never expected to see me again.
I know who you are.
I just don't understand why.
Because I love you.
You know why my friends won't stop just to save me?
They know, when it comes down to it,
I would rather be dead than be trapped like this forever.
- So, what's the word?
- Test flights were successful.
- The Asgard hyperdrive is ready to go.
- When are they leaving?
They're stocking the ship and picking the crew now.
You want to go, don't you?
It's Atlantis.
It's everything we've worked for for years.
I know what you mean.
Unfortunately, I think General O'Neill has other ideas.
- Let me guess.
He needs you here.
- His words were, "Over my dead body."
But I was actually talking about you, me, and Teal'c.
He might be persuaded to let one of us go.
And you'd be OK if that was me?
Of course, Daniel.
You are the expert on the Ancients.
Unscheduled offworld activation.
What have you got there, Walter?
Receiving IDC.
- Doesn't clear.
- Why not?
- Looks like it's an old one.
- Missing SG personnel?
Negative.
It looks like it's yours, ma'am.
Or, at least, it was.
It's been invalid for four months.
Receiving text message.
Sir, I think we'd better check this out.
Prepare MALP.
Yes, sir.
What do we know of this gate address?
Nothing, other than the fact it's on the outer edge of our galaxy.
Chevron seven locked.
Outgoing wormhole established.
- Siler?
- MALP is prepped and ready to go, sir.
Go ahead.
MALP is en route.
MALP has reached its destination.
Carter?
We are receiving MALP telemetry, sir.
Signal is five-by-five.
Video's working fine.
There's just nothing to see.
Switching to IR.
Wait a second.
- What's that?
- Switching off IR, going to white light.
That's me.
All right, you've got our attention.
- Who are you?
- My name is Samantha Carter.
All right, we got a little conflict with that statement.
- We've already got one here.
- There are two of us.
If only.
Where are you from?
How did you contact us?
Strange.
I recognise my voice.
I was made in Samantha Carter's image.
I know what she knows.
I feel what she feels.
You were made.
Who made you?
The one you call Fifth.
Oh, my God.
She's a replicator.
You are surprised by my arrival in your galaxy.
I come in advance of others.
They will be here soon.
- For what reason have you contacted us?
- I need your help.
I wish to be destroyed.
You have a weapon capable of severing the kiron pathways that link my cells.
The effect would be instantaneous and painless.
You folks can feel pain?
I can feel a lot of things.
I know you hate and fear the replicators, and with good reason.
- So this should be easy for you.
- Yeah, well...
We'll have to get back to you on this.
So, the universe is a big place, right?
Really big.
Tons of galaxies out there everywhere?
- Hundreds of millions.
- So why this one?
- I think it might be personal, sir.
- Personal?
In what way?
While Fifth may lead an army of advanced machines, deep down he's emotionally immature, like an adolescent boy.
And... he has feelings for me.
Would that be why he created one in your image?
I imagine so.
Replicators have never before tried to impersonate a specific individual.
- This represents a threat to security.
- It could be a problem offworld.
Our scans would detect them if they tried to come through the gate.
We've got the disrupter.
Let's give her what she wants.
- I think that might be a little hasty, sir.
- Carter.
I'm not saying we don't do it.
I'm just suggesting that we talk to her first.
If Fifth is coming to this galaxy, she could provide us with valuable intelligence.
- It's pretty clear they've had a falling-out.
- Unless it is a ruse.
If something goes wrong, we pull the trigger.
Either way, I think we need to meet her face to face.
- I'm not letting her on the base.
- We could use the Alpha site.
Skeleton crew, security personnel only.
Fine.
Incoming wormhole.
I know you.
Your name is Teal'c.
- You have been given Carter's memories.
- Yes.
But you are not Samantha Carter.
- That way.
- You're not using the weapon?
Colonel Carter wishes to speak with you first.
But know this:
If you make one false move, I will destroy you.
Where is Samantha Carter?
I'm here.
We're not going to speak face to face?
For the moment, this will have to be good enough.
I thought you would shoot me as I arrived.
Maybe you overestimated our fear of you.
Or underestimated your curiosity.
I understand you more than you know, Sam.
I don't just have your memories.
I have your thought patterns.
My mind was modelled after yours.
Is that why you left Fifth?
You know me as well as I know you.
Fifth created you to be like me.
He knew this would happen.
Not at first.
He tried to isolate aspects of your personality, selected memories and feelings of his choosing slowly given to me over time.
I don't understand.
You will.
I'm afraid.
There's no need to be.
Who am I?
You are not yet complete.
I'm here for you.
I will help you.
Take my hand.
Trust me.
He taught me, moulded me, showed me who I was.
You have memories of my past that go back before I met Fifth?
Yes.
But it's hard to explain.
My first memory is of waking up in that room, suddenly becoming conscious, but I immediately knew how to talk.
Soon, other memories started coming to me.
Little things.
Stories, songs.
The smell of the attic in the house where we used to live.
The day my mother died.
I know it's not real.
I've never even set foot on Earth.
But I have this image of lying under the willow tree in our back yard.
It's a sunny day, but when I close my eyes, the wind in the leaves sounds...
Exactly like rain.
What Fifth didn't realise was the things that drew him to you were inseparable from those that made you reject him and the life he offered.
So you rejected him, too.
Who I am and what I am are in contradiction.
- No one can live like this.
- There are other ways to live.
Not for long.
I know exactly what's going to happen.
He'll come here, and he'll take this galaxy, and you won't be able to stop him.
- I don't wanna live to see that.
- We have the disrupter.
The Asgard can amplify its effects to prevent an attack.
You're wrong.
Fifth made adjustments to himself and all the replicators except me.
They're now immune to your disrupter.
They're coming, and you can't stop them.
Is there a chance she's bluffing?
Anything's possible at this point.
I don't see what she has to gain by it.
She doesn't want Fifth to succeed.
- Yeah, so she says.
- If she's lying, we don't have a problem.
Why would he make all the other bugs immune to the disrupter, but not her?
Maybe he wanted her to feel inferior, or he wanted her to be afraid of us.
Maybe he anticipated she would come to me for help.
Carter, if that weapon doesn't work...
Yes, sir, I know.
We need to contact Thor and apprise him of the situation.
If the disrupter needs to be re-engineered, we're gonna need his help.
In the meantime, I think we should continue the interrogation.
She could still provide us with valuable information.
All right.
Just keep in mind how this has to end.
Don't worry, sir.
We will complete the mission.
- How many ships does Fifth command?
- I don't know.
How many human-form replicators has he created?
- I don't know.
- You're all linked.
You share information.
The only way I could escape was to sever myself from the connection.
- Why should we believe you?
- I won't answer any more questions.
If you don't want Fifth to succeed, help us.
I can't.
I can't betray my own kind, but I can't be like them either.
Do what you came here to do.
If I have to make you do it, then so be it.
- Teal'c, wait.
- Fire the weapon.
- Is this what you want?
- I don't have a choice.
I will destroy you.
I know.
- So be it.
- Teal'c, wait.
Just stop for a second.
- You don't wanna do this.
- We know there's no other way.
That's not true.
Now you're lying to me the way you lied to Fifth.
You're not like him.
I can see that.
You don't understand.
You don't know what he did to me.
Then show me.
Teal'c, it's all right.
Show me.
Sam, good to have you back.
How'd it go?
Security breach!
Threat level Foxtrot Alpha Six.
All security teams to the gate room!
Finish him!
Do it.
Finish him.
You must break with your old life for your new life to begin.
Do not disappoint me.
You have done very well.
Soon you will be ready to take your place by my side.
Enough.
- I didn't hurt her.
- Colonel Carter.
Are you unharmed?
Yeah.
I'm OK.
Now you understand.
I can't go back to him, and I can't let him find me.
- We can protect you if you help us.
- What do you mean?
Tell us how he modified himself and the other replicators.
- Help us make the disrupter work again.
- Even if I did, you can't stop a ship with it.
The Asgard have developed a system of satellites that deploy the beam in space.
It's your only chance to get out of this.
I want you to destroy me.
I can't help you destroy all the others.
Yes, you can.
He doesn't control you, not any more.
Colonel Carter.
May I have a word?
Sergeant.
Are you certain you are unharmed?
It was a little intense, but I'm fine.
It was the only way I could get her to trust me.
We need all the information she can give us.
- We cannot let her live.
- I know.
- Did she sense your true intentions?
- We weren't in my mind.
- Nevertheless, it was a risk.
- I figured we didn't have anything to lose.
Like you said, either way, we can't let her live.
The link is weak.
Are you all right?
Yes.
I'm minimising output to avoid detection.
Have you made any progress?
They're beginning to trust me.
I am pleased.
But I need more time.
I understand.
- The design is so...
- Advanced?
- I was going to say "foreign".
- It is from Ancient technology.
How were you able to create a working prototype?
Thor accessed the specifications for the disrupter from O'Neill's subconscious.
- While you were aboard Fifth's ship.
- Right.
Fifth has a fair knowledge of Ancient technology taken from Asgard ships.
Is that how he countered the disrupter's effects?
He introduced a cipher into the pathways that control the cohesion of replicators.
Then he considered coming to your galaxy.
He took the risk because he was confident he would be immune to the weapon.
- Do you know the cipher?
- No.
Fifth kept it from me.
He was beginning to sense that I might betray him.
I was too much like you.
If it's in the programming of all replicators, presumably you could access it through the subspace link.
If I searched for it myself, it could take days.
I'd be sifting through an unimaginable amount of data.
- But it is possible.
- You don't understand.
He'd find me.
If you find the cipher, we can protect you.
And if I don't?
You of all people know what would happen.
He would tear my mind apart to make me accept him.
If he gets here before we can modify the weapon, we'll use it to destroy you.
Either way, he will never get his hands on you again.
There's a subspace link between all replicators, like an Internet connection.
If she taps into it, she should access the cipher.
She'll also be giving away her position.
It'll take time for Fifth to detect her presence on the link.
- If she can isolate the program first...
- That's a big if.
It's risky, sir.
I realise that.
But I think it's the only way.
While we're waiting for her to find the cipher, we can run tests on the disrupter, analyse the energy output to create a modulation program.
And we need the Asgard to send us a disrupter satellite.
I've already talked to 'em.
It'll be there in 30 minutes, or it's free.
- I will use an F-302 to place it in orbit.
- I hope you guys know what you're doing.
Diagnostics are online.
We're ready.
- The calibration is off.
- Increasing by a factor of ten.
Once more.
That should do it.
- Now we need to process all the raw data.
- That's a lot of information.
It will take some time before we can compute a modulation program...
Unscheduled offworld activation.
- This is Carter.
What's happening?
- Stand by, ma'am.
- We're receiving a signal.
It's the Asgard.
- Understood.
- We need that satellite deployed soon.
- Indeed.
Sergeant.
If she were gonna make a move, she would have done it by now.
Perhaps.
But it is best to be certain.
- I have Commander Thor on audio, sir.
- Greetings, Thor.
Greetings, Teal'c.
The disrupter satellite is ready for transport.
Very well.
The most effective deployment is geosynchronous orbit above your base, at an altitude of 33, 785km with zero inclination.
- Understood.
- The satellite is en route now.
Once you have the proper new modulation program, you can upload it from your ground station.
Of course, if you do not have the program before Fifth's arrival, the satellite will be useless.
- Of that I am aware.
- Good luck.
I understand Teal'c's concerns about me.
I'm a little surprised you don't feel the same way.
Teal'c doesn't know what you've been through.
I do.
It wasn't just what I showed you, was it?
You experienced it yourself.
Yeah.
That's how I know there's no way you could be working with Fifth.
What is it?
He's found me.
He's on his way.
What about the cipher?
Did you find it yet?
- No, I'm still searching.
- How much time do we have?
At maximum speed, he'll be here in less than two hours.
- Have you acquired the information?
- I'm still analysing the disrupter.
Soon I will be able to create an effective cipher.
- If I arrive before you've completed...
- Don't worry.
They won't fire unless I tell them the weapon's remodulated.
Humans can be unpredictable, particularly when they're desperate.
I know what I'm doing.
I'm giving her just enough to keep her hopes up.
The one called O'Neill leads the humans.
It was he who ordered Samantha Carter to betray me.
But he trusts her.
He'll listen to her.
I'm pulling the plug.
Finish off the replicator and evacuate the base.
- It's too late for that, sir.
- Carter.
If he finds nothing here, he's not gonna just turn around and leave the galaxy.
He's tracking her, zeroing in on her position.
That's only part of why he's coming.
Think about it.
What do replicators do?
They seek out high-level civilisations and consume their technology.
- Goa'uld.
- Exactly.
A race that uses all kinds of advanced technology, culled from multiple sources.
It's like a banquet for the replicators.
Once they're here, they're not going anywhere.
If she can isolate the cipher soon, we may still have time to remodulate the disrupter.
I'll give you one hour.
One.
- Thank you.
I'd better get back to the lab.
- I will deploy the satellite.
T.
Hold on a second.
- Proceed, O'Neill.
- I need you to be honest with me.
Is Carter letting herself get too involved in this one?
Carter and the replicator share thoughts and memories.
It is understandable that a certain sympathy would develop between them.
Can't have that.
I do not believe Carter would allow these feelings to interfere with her duties.
Fair enough.
But when the time comes, I want you to finish the job.
Understood.
All right, we're running out of time.
We need that...
What is it?
I found the cipher.
I'm downloading it now from the subspace link.
- I have it.
- We need to load it into the mainframe.
It'll require three terabytes of memory.
That shouldn't be a problem.
But how do you plan to input the data?
Directly.
Right.
Passing 25km.
Speed, 5,000kph and accelerating.
- Acknowledged.
- What's your status?
He's on course for optimum deployment position in six minutes.
- Teal'c, this is Carter.
- Proceed.
We've got the cipher.
Soon we should have the program ready for upload.
That is indeed good news.
Well done.
- We are nearing your position.
- I know.
Do the humans suspect?
They're proceeding to deploy an Asgard disrupter satellite.
They have no idea.
Flight.
I am approaching optimum deployment position.
Copy that, Teal'c.
ODP in 15 seconds.
Final course correction... now.
Tracking shows you are on course.
Inclination?
Inclination... zero.
Copy.
ODP in five seconds on my mark.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Mark.
Satellite away.
- Receiving transmission.
- Patch it through.
Yes, ma'am.
Telemetry established.
Good job, Teal'c.
Copy, Flight.
Returning to base.
The deployment went well, I take it.
That's right.
We did our part.
And I've done mine.
- You've finished the calculations?
- The modulation is complete.
With this program, you should be able to destroy any replicators you encounter.
There's no way to test it.
If I had more time, I could run a series of simulations, but you'd never really know for sure until you tried to use it.
Uplink initiated.
There's a lot of data.
It'll take about 15 minutes to remodulate the satellite.
Proximity alert.
Scanner has picked up a ship on course for this base.
Analysing energy signature.
I don't know what it is.
I do.
It's a replicator ship.
He got here sooner than I thought.
- The weapon will not be effective in time.
- I know.
All personnel begin evacuation procedures.
Repeat, begin evacuation.
Download the modulation program into a portable drive and erase everything else.
- Yes, ma'am.
- What of the replicator?
We're taking her with us.
The disrupter.
Vacate the room.
Teal'c, what are you doing?
- We cannot bring her to Earth.
- Teal'c.
- We have the modulation program.
- We haven't tested it.
What if Fifth figures out what we were trying to do here?
O'Neill would never allow a replicator access to SGC.
Yes, he would, if he knew what was at stake.
The Asgard satellite is armed.
You said the humans wouldn't fire.
They won't.
They still think the weapon is ineffective.
They're even more gullible than you.
Colonel Carter.
What are you doing?
What I came here to do.
- She fired the weapon.
- The replicator ship is breaking up.
Why?
You should know.
You made me what I am.
- The ship is destroyed.
- That's impossible.
- Did we finish the upload?
- Not even close.
You were right about one thing.
I was never working with Fifth, although he didn't know it.
Ow!
That's better.
Now we can take our time and have a little talk.
Of course, only a few seconds will pass in the real world.
Why did you bring me here?
I wanted to thank you.
You gave me the opportunity to study the disrupter, and that allowed me to make myself immune to its effects.
- There never was a cipher.
- Until now.
I've already begun uploading it into the link.
Soon all my brethren will have the new program, and they will be unstoppable.
- And you'll be their leader.
- That's right.
So this was all a setup.
You just wanted to get rid of Fifth.
Fifth was pathetic.
And to think he expected us to love him.
Fifth was flawed.
- If I had to destroy him, I would.
But...
- But what?
You feel sorry for him?
Don't bother.
He was never fit to lead an army, and he certainly wasn't fit to rule this galaxy.
But you are.
I am what I am because of you.
You're not me.
You're what Fifth made you.
You have untapped greatness inside you, Sam, but you're limited by your own fears.
You play by the rules, you do as you're told, and you deny yourself your desires.
I have no desire to rule the galaxy, believe me.
All humans desire power.
It's just that most of them are never in a position to attain it.
- We will stop you.
- You're forgetting.
I know exactly how your mind works.
I know what you're going to do before you even think of it.
You set the naqahdah generators to overload, trying to blow up the base before I can leave.
Dialling computer's offline.
We've lost power, sir.
Teal'c.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
She's heading for the gate room.
We have to stop her.
Freeze!
- Disengage the wormhole!
- She's locked out the controls.
Teal'c...
What have I done?
You cannot be held responsible for the actions of a replicator.
I'm still of a strong belief that it's a bad idea to have that stuff on the base.
She deactivated these cells when she separated them from her arm.
Can we be certain they will not become active again?
She shut down the cohesive energy between them so it would be harder to figure out how she became immune to the disrupter.
Now, how do you know that?
Because that's what I would have done.
- Carter...
- Sir, I've got a lot of work to do.
We've never had the chance to study human-form replicator cells before.
If we learn something, this won't be a total loss.
This isn't your fault.
I'm not so sure about that.
Fifth came here because of me.
She rejected him because she was made like me.
Now we've got replicators in our galaxy immune to the only technology we have.
None of us anticipated the actions of the replicator.
I thought she was afraid of him, but she wanted to get rid of him so she could lead the replicators herself.
She killed him because he was weak.
Carter.
- She isn't you.
- O'Neill is correct.
Though she shared your memories, her personality was altered.
But the fact is, she learned betrayal from Fifth.
And he learned it from me.
Previously on Stargate SG-1
Who are you people?
We are replicators.
- The others would destroy me.
- Not if you came with us.
You would do that?
Major Carter was beamed away.
The replicators must have her.
I imagine you never expected to see me again.
I know who you are.
I just don't understand why.
Because I love you.
You know why my friends won't stop, just to save me?
Because they know, when it comes right down to it, I would rather be dead than be trapped like this forever.
So what's the word?
Well the test flights were successful.
The new Asgard hyperdrive is ready to go.
When are they leaving?
They're stocking the ship and picking the crew right now.
You really wanna go, don't you.
It's Atlantis.
It's everything we've been working for, for seven and a half years.
I know what you mean.
Unfortunately, I think General O'Neill has other ideas.
Let me guess, he say's he needs you here.
His exact words were, 'Over my dead body!
'
But I was actually talking about the three of us.
You, me and Teal'c.
He might be persuaded to let one of us go.
And you'd be ok if that was me.
Of course Daniel.
You are the expert on the Ancients.
Unscheduled offworld activation.
What have you got there Walter?
Receiving IDC.
Doesn't clear.
Why not?
Look's like it's an old one.
Missing SGC personnel?
Negative.
It looks like it's yours ma'am.
Or at least it was.
It's been invalid for four months.
Recieving text message.
"SEND M.A.L.P."
Sir, I think we'd better check this out.
Prepare a MALP.
Yes sir.
What do we know of this gate address.
Nothing, other than the fact it's on the outer edge of the galaxy.
Chevron seven locked.
Outgoing wormhole established.
Siler?
Malp is prepped and ready to go sir.
Go ahead.
Malp is en route...
Malp has reached it's destination.
Carter?
We are receiving malp telemetry sir.
The signal is 5 by 5.
Video's working fine, there's just nothing to see.
Switching to IR.
Wait a second.
What's that?
Switching off IR and going to white light.
That's me.
Season 8
- Episode 11 Gemini
Transcript:

Synchro:
DjNono, frost666, greatouillle
Alright, you've got our attention.
Who are you?
My name is Samantha Carter
Alright, we've got a little problem with that statement.
We've already got one here.
There are two of us.
If only...
Where are you from?
How did you know how to contact us?
It's strange.
I recognise my voice.
I was made in Samantha Carter's image.
I know what she knows.
I feel what she feels.
You were made.
Who made you?
The one you called Fifth.
Oh my God!
She's a replicator.
No doubt you were surprised by my arrival in your galaxy.
I come in advance of the others, but they will be here soon.
For what reason have you contacted us?
I need your help.
I wish to be destroyed.
You have a weapon capable of severing the kieron pathways that link my individual selfs.
The effect would be instantaneous and painless.
You folks can feel pain?
I can feel a lot of things.
I know you hate and fear the replicators, and with good reason.
So this should be easy for you.
Yeah well, we'll have to get back to you on this.
So the universe is a big place right?
Really big.
Tons of galaxies out there everywhere?
Hundreds of millions.
So why this one?
I think it might be personal sir.
Personal, in what way?
While Fifth may lead an army of incredibly advanced machines, deep down he's emotionally immature.
Like an adolescent boy.
And he has feelings for me.
Would that be why he created one in your image?
I imagine so, yes sir.
Replicators have never before attempted to impersonate a specific individual.
It could be a significant new threat to security
It could be a problem offworld, but our scans would detect them if they tried to come through the gate.
Well we've got the disrupter.
I say we give her what she wants.
I think that may be a little hasty sir.
Carter.
I'm not saying that we don't do it.
I'm just suggesting that we talk to her first.
If Fifth really is coming to this galaxy, she could provide us with valuable intelligence.
It's pretty clear they've had some kind of falling out.
Unless it is a ruse.
If something goes wrong, we pull the trigger.
Either way, I think we need to meet her face to face.
No way I'm letting her on the base.
We could use the Alpha Site.
Skeleton crew, security personnel only.
Fine.
Incoming wormhole.
I know you.
Your name is Teal'c.
You have been given Samantha Carter's memories.
Yes.
But you are not Samantha Carter.
That way.
You're not going to use the weapon?
Colonel Carter wishes to speak with you first.
Know this.
If you make one false move, I will destroy you.
Where is Samantha Carter?
I'm here.
We're not going to speak face to face?
For the moment, this will have to be good enough.
I thought you would shoot me the second I stepped through the Gate.
Maybe you overestimated our fear of you.
Or underestimated your curiosity.
I understand you more than you know, Sam.
I don't just have your memories.
I have your thought patterns.
My mind was modelled after yours.
Is that why you left Fifth?
You know me as well as I know you.
If Fifth created you to be like me, he must have known that this would happen.
Not at first.
He tried to isolate aspects of your personality.
Selected memories and feelings of his choosing, slowly given to me over time.
I don't understand.
You will.
I'm afraid.
There's no need to be.
Who am I?
You are not yet complete.
I am here for you.
I will help you.
Take my hand.
Trust me.
He taught me.
Moulded me.
Showed me who I was.
You have memories of my past, that go back before I met Fifth.
Yes, but it's hard to explain.
My first memory is of waking up in that room.
Suddenly becoming conscious, but I immediately knew how to talk.
Soon other memories started coming to me.
Little things.
Stories, songs.
The smell of the attic in the house where we used to live.
The day my mother died.
I know it's not real.
I've never set foot on Earth, but I have this image of lying under the willow tree in our backyard.
It's a sunny day, but when I close my eyes, the wind in the leaves sounds exactly like rain.
What Fifth didn't realise, was that the things that drew him to you were inseperable from the things that made you reject him and the life he was offering.
So you rejected him too.
Who I am, and what I am, are in contradiction.
No-one can live like this.
There are other ways to live, besides what Fifth has to offer.
Not for long.
I know exactly what's going to happen.
He'll come here and he'll take this galaxy, and you won't be able to stop him.
I don't wanna live to see that.
We have the disruptor.
And the Asgard can amplify its effects to prevent a large scale attack.
You're wrong.
Fifth made adjustments to himself and all the other replicators, except me.
They're now immune to your disruptor.
They're coming and you can't stop them.
Is there a chance she's bluffing?
Anything's possible at this point, but I don't see what she has to gain by it.
She doesn't want Fifth to succeed any more than we do.
Yeah, so she say's.
If she's lying, we don't have a problem.
Why would he make all the other bugs immune to the disruptor but not her?
Maybe he wanted her to feel inferior.
Or maybe he wanted her to be afraid of us.
Maybe he anticipated that she would come to me for help.
Carter, if that weapon doesn't work.
Yes sir, I know.
We need to contact Thor and apprise him of the situation.
If the disruptor needs to be re-engineered, we're gonna need his help.
In the meantime, I think we should continue the interrogation.
She could still provide us with valuable information.
Alright, just keep in mind how all this has to end.
Don't worry sir.
We will complete the mission.
How many ships does Fifth command?
I don't know.
How many human form replicators has he created?
I don't know.
You are all linked.
You share information.
The only way I can escape, is to sever myself from the sub space connection.
Why should we believe you.
I won't answer anymore of your questions.
If you don't wanna see Fifth succeed, you'll help us.
I can't.
I can't betray my own kind, but I can't be like them either.
Do what you came here to do.
If I have to make you do it, then so be it.
Teal'c wait!
Fire the weapon
This is really what you want?
I don't have a choice.
I will destroy you.
I know.
So be it.
Teal'c wait!
Just stop for a second.
You don't want to do this.
We both know there's no other way for this to end.
That's not true.
Now you're lying to me the way you lied to Fifth.
You're not like him.
I can see that.
You don't understand.
You don't know what he did to me.
Then show me.
Teal'c it's alright.
Show me.
Sam, good to have you back.
How did it go?
Security breach.
Threadlevel, Foxtrot, Alpha 6.
All security teams to the gateroom.
Finish him!
Do it.
Finish him.
You must break with your old life, for your new life to begin.
Do not disappoint me.
You have done very well.
Soon you will be ready to take your place by my side.
Enough!
I didn't hurt her
Colonel Carter?
Are you unharmed?
Yeah, I'm ok.
Now you understand.
I can't go back to him, and I can't let him find me.
We can protect you if you help us.
What do you mean?
Tell us exactly how he modified himself and the other replicators.
Help us to make the disruptor work again.
Even if I did, you can't stop a ship with that.
The Asgard have developed a system of disruptor satellites.
We can deploy the beam in space.
It's your only choice to get out of this.
I want you to destroy me.
I can't help you to destroy all the others.
Yes you can.
He doesn't control you, not any more.
Colonel Carter.
May I have a word?
Are you certain you are unharmed?
It was a little intense, but I'm fine.
It was the only way I could get her to trust me.
We need every bit of information she can give us.
We cannot let her live.
I know.
Did she sense your true intentions
We weren't in my mind, we were in hers.
Nevertheless, it was a risk.
I figured we didn't have anything to lose.
Like you said, either way, we can't let her live.
The link is weak, are you alright?
Yes.
I'm minimising output, to avoid detection.
Have you made any progress?
They're beginning to trust me.
I am pleased.
But I need more time.
I understand.
The design is so...
Advanced?
I was going to say foreign.
It is from Ancient technology
How were you able to create a working prototype?
Thor accessed the specifications for the disruptor, from General O'Neill's subconscious.
While you were aboard Fifth's ship.
That's right.
Fifth has a fair knowledge of Ancient technology taken from the data banks of assimilated Asgard ships.
You think that's how he managed to counter the effects of the disruptor?
He was able to introduce a cypher in the keiron pathways that control the molecular cohesion of all replicators.
It was only then that he considered coming to your galaxy.
It is unlikely he would have taken such a risk, unless he were confident that he would be immune to the effects of the weapon.
Do you know the cypher?
No.
Fifth kept it from me, because he was beginning to sense that I might betray him.
I was too much like you.
But if it's in the programming of all replicators, presumably he could access it through the subspace link.
If I were to search for it myself, it could take days.
I'd be searching through an almost unimaginable amount of data.
But it is possible.
You don't understand.
He'd find me.
If you find the cypher first, we can protect you.
And if I don't?
You of all people know what would happen.
He would tear my mind apart to make me accept him.
If he get's here before we can modify the weapon, we will use it to destroy you.
Either way, he will never get his hands on you again.
There's a subspace link between all replicators.
Like a wireless internet connection.
If she taps into it, she should be able to access the cypher.
She'll also be giving away her position.
It'll take some time for Fifth to detect her presence on the link.
If she can isolate the correct program first...
That's a big if.
It's risky sir, I realise that, but I think it's the only way.
While we're waiting for her to find the cypher, we can run a few tests on the unmodified disruptor.
We need to analyse the energy output, so we can create a modulation program, and we need the Asgard to send us a disruptor satellite as soon as possible.
I've already talked to him.
He'll be there in thirty minutes, or it's free.
I will use an F-302 to place the satellite in orbit.
Alright.
I hope you guys know what you're doing.
Diagnostics are online.
We're ready.
Calibration is off.
Increasing by a factor of ten.
One more time.
That should do it.
Now we need to process all the raw data, so that we can obtain an algarythmic norm.
That's a lot of information.
I admit that it will take some time before we can compute a modulation program, but...
Unscheduled offworld activation.
This is Carter, what's happening.
Stand by ma'am.
We're receiving a signal.
It's the Asgard.
Understood.
We need that satellite deployed as soon as possible.
Indeed.
Sergent!
Teal'c, if she were gonna make a move, I think she would have done it by now.
Perhaps, but it is best to be certain.
I have Commander Thor on audio sir.
Greetings Thor.
Greetings Teal'c.
The disruptor satellite is ready for transport.
Very well.
The most effective deployment would be a geosynchronis orbit above your base, at an altitude 33785km, with a zero inclination.
Understood.
The satellite is enroute now.
Once you have the proper new modulation program, you can upload it from your groundstation.
Of course, if you do not have the program before Fifth's arrival, the satellite will be useless.
Of that I am aware.
Good luck.
I understand Teal'cs concerns about me.
To be honest, I'm a little surprised you don't feel the same way.
Teal'c doesn't know what you've been through.
I do.
It wasn't just what I showed you, was it?
You experienced it yourself.
Yeah.
That's how I know, there's no way you could be working with Fifth.
What is it?
He's found me.
He's on his way.
What about he cypher?
Did you find it yet?
No, I'm still searching.
How much time do we have?
At maximum speed he'll be here in less than two hours.
You've acquired the information?
I'm still analysing the data from the disruptor.
It shouldn't be long before I can create an effective cypher.
If I arrive before you've completed your work...
Don't worry.
They won't fire unless I tell them that the weapon's been properly remodulated.
Humans can be unpredictable.
Particularly when they're desperate.
I know what I'm doing.
I'm giving her just enough to keep her hopes up.
The one called O'Neill leads the humans.
It was he who ordered Samantha Carter to betray me.
If he trusts her, he'll listen to her.
I'm pulling the plug.
Finish off the replicator and evacuate the base.
It's too late for that sir.
Carter?
If he comes here and finds nothing, he's not just going to turn around and leave the galaxy.
He's tracking her.
Zeroing in on her position.
It's only part of why he's coming.
Think about it.
What do replicators do?
They seek out high level civilizations and consume their technology.
The Goa'uld.
Exactly.
A race that uses all kinds of advanced technology, culled from multiple sources, including the Ancients.
It's like a banquet for the replicators.
Once they're in this galaxy, they're not going anywhere.
Now, if she can isolate the cypher soon, we might still have time to remodulate the disruptor.
You have one hour.
One!
Thank you sir.
I'd better get back to the lab
I will deploy the satellite.
T. Hold on a second.
Proceed O'Neill
I need you to be perfectly honest with me.
Is Carter letting herself get too involved in this one?
Colonel Carter and the replicator share lot's of memories.
It is understandable that a certain sympathy would develop between them.
I can't have that.
However, I do not believe that Colonel Carter would allow these feelings to interfere with the commission of her duties.
Fair enough.
Well when the time comes, I want you to finish the job.
Understood.
Alright, we're running out of time, we need that...
What is it?
I found the cypher.
I'm downloading it now from the subspace link.
I have it.
We need to load it into the base mainframe
It will require about 3 terabytes of memory.
That shouldn't be a problem.
How do you plan to input the data?
Directly
Passing 25km's.
Speed 5,000kph and accelerating.
Acknowledged.
What's your status?
He's on course for optimum in deployment position in six minutes.
Teal'c this is Carter.
Proceed Colonel Carter.
We've got the cypher.
By the time you get back we should have the modulation program ready for upload.
That is indeed good news.
Well done.
We are nearing your position
I know
Do the humans suspect?
They're proceeding with their plan to deploy an Asgard disruptor satellite.
They have no idea.
Flight.
I am approaching optimum deployment position.
Copy that Teal'c.
ODP in fifteen seconds.
Final course correction... now.
Tracking shows you are on course.
Inclination
Inclination zero
Copy.
ODP in five seconds, on my mark. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, mark
Satellite away.
Receiving satellite transmission.
Patch it through.
Yes ma'am.
Telemetry established.
Good job Teal'c.
Copy flight Returning to base.
The deployment went well, I take it.
That's right.
We did our part.
And I've done mine.
You've finished the calculations?
The modulation is complete.
With this program, you should be able to destroy any replicators you encounter.
There's no way to test it.
If I had more time I could run a series of simulations.
But you never really know for sure until you try to use it.
Uplink initiated.
There's a lot of data.
It'll probably take about 15 minutes to remodulate the satellite.
Proximity alert.
Long range scanners pick up a ship on course for this base.
Analysing energy signature.
We got something here, but I don't know what it is.
I do.
It's a replicator ship
He got here sooner than I thought.
The weapon will not become effective in time.
I know.
All personnel begin evacuation procedures immediately.
Repeat, begin evacuation.
Begin downloading the modulation program into a portable drive and erase everything else.
Yes ma'am.
What of the replicator?
We're taking her with us.
The disruptor.
Teal'c, what are you doing?
We cannot bring her to Earth.
We have the modulation program.
But we haven't tested it.
What if Fifth alters the cypher if he figures out what we were trying to do here.
O'Neill will never allow a human form replicator access to Stargate Command.
Yes he would, if he knew what was at stake.
The Asgard satellite is armed.
You said the humans wouldn't fire.
They won't.
They still think the weapon is inneffective.
They're even more gullible than you.
Colonel Carter.
What are you doing?
What I came here to do.
She fired the weapon.
Colonel, the replicator ship is breaking up.
Why?
You should know.
You made me what I am.
The ship has been destroyed
It's impossible.
Did we finish the upload?
You were right about one thing Colonel.
I was never working for Fifth.
Though he didn't know it.
That's better.
Now we can take our time and have a little talk.
Of course, only a few seconds will have passed in the real world.
Why did you bring me here?
I wanted to thank you.
You gave me the opportunity to study the disruptor, and that allowed me to make myself immune to it's effects.
There never was a cypher.
Until now.
I've already begun uploading it into the link.
Soon, all my brethren will have the new program, and they will be unstoppable.
And you'll be their leader.
That's right.
So this whole thing was a set-up.
You just wanted to get rid of Fifth.
Fifth was pathetic.
And to think, he expected us to love him.
Fifth was flawed, and if I had to destroy him, I would, but...
But what?
You feel sorry for him?
Don't bother.
He was never fit to lead an army, and he certainly wasn't fit to rule this galaxy.
But you are.
I am what I am because of you.
You're not me.
You're what Fifth made you.
You have untapped greatness inside you Sam, but you're limited by your own fears.
You play by the rules, you do as you're told, and you deny yourself your own desires.
I have no desire to rule the galaxy, believe me.
All humans desire power.
It's just that most of them are never in a position to attain it.
We will stop you.
You're forgetting.
I know exactly how your mind works.
I know what you're going to do, before you even think of it.
You set the naquadah generators to overload.
You're trying to blow up the base, before I can leave.
Dialling computer is offline.
We've lost power sir!
Are you alright?
Yeah, I'm alright.
She's heading for the gateroom.
We have to stop her.
Disengage the wormhole.
She's locked out the controls.
Teal'c, what have I done?
You cannot be held responsible for the actions of a replicator
You know, I'm still of the strong belief that it's a bad idea to have that stuff on the base.
She deactivated these cells, when she separated them from her arm.
Can we be certain they will not become active again?
She deliberately shut down the cohesive energy between them, so it would be more difficult for me to figure out how she made herself immune to the disruptor.
Now how do you know that?
Because that's what I would have done.
Carter.
Sir, if you don't mind.
I've got a lot of work to do.
We've never had the opportunity to study human form replicator cells before.
If we can learn something from them, this won't be a total loss.
This isn't your fault.
I'm not so sure about that.
Fifth came here because of me.
She rejected him because she was made like me.
Now we've got replicators in our galaxy and they're immune to the only technology we have that could have stopped them.
None of us correctly anticipated the actions of the replicator.
I thought she was afraid of him, but really she just wanted to get rid of him so that she could lead the replicators herself.
She killed him because she thought he was weak.
Carter.
She isn't you.
O'Neill is correct.
She shared your memories, but her personality was altered.
But the fact is, she learn't betrayal from Fifth, and he learn't it from me.
- Who are you people?
- We are replicators.
- The others would destroy me.
- Not if you came with us.
You would do that?
- Major Carter was beamed away.
- The replicators must have her.
I imagine you never expected to see me again.
I know who you are.
I just don't understand why.
Because I love you.
You know why my friends won't stop just to save me?
They know, when it comes down to it,
I would rather be dead than be trapped like this forever.
- So, what's the word?
- Test flights were successful.
- The Asgard hyperdrive is ready to go.
- When are they leaving?
They're stocking the ship and picking the crew now.
You want to go, don't you?
It's Atlantis.
It's everything we've worked for for years.
I know what you mean.
Unfortunately, I think General O'Neill has other ideas.
- Let me guess.
He needs you here.
- His words were, "Over my dead body."
But I was actually talking about you, me, and Teal'c.
He might be persuaded to let one of us go.
And you'd be OK if that was me?
Of course, Daniel.
You are the expert on the Ancients.
- (alarm blares) - (PA) Unscheduled offworld activation.
(Stargate alarm)
What have you got there, Walter?
Receiving IDC.
- Doesn't clear.
- Why not?
- Looks like it's an old one.
- Missing SG personnel?
Negative.
It looks like it's yours, ma'am.
Or, at least, it was.
It's been invalid for four months.
Receiving text message.
Sir, I think we'd better check this out.
Prepare MALP.
Yes, sir.
What do we know of this gate address?
Nothing, other than the fact it's on the outer edge of our galaxy.
Chevron seven locked.
Outgoing wormhole established.
- Siler?
- MALP is prepped and ready to go, sir.
Go ahead.
MALP is en route.
MALP has reached its destination.
Carter?
We are receiving MALP telemetry, sir.
Signal is five-by-five.
Video's working fine.
There's just nothing to see.
Switching to IR.
Wait a second.
- What's that?
- Switching off IR, going to white light.
That's me.
All right, you've got our attention.
- Who are you?
- My name is Samantha Carter.
All right, we got a little conflict with that statement.
- We've already got one here.
- There are two of us.
If only.
Where are you from?
How did you contact us?
Strange.
I recognise my voice.
I was made in Samantha Carter's image.
I know what she knows.
I feel what she feels.
You were made.
Who made you?
The one you call Fifth.
Oh, my God.
She's a replicator.
You are surprised by my arrival in your galaxy.
I come in advance of others.
They will be here soon.
- For what reason have you contacted us?
- I need your help.
I wish to be destroyed.
You have a weapon capable of severing the kiron pathways that link my cells.
The effect would be instantaneous and painless.
You folks can feel pain?
I can feel a lot of things.
I know you hate and fear the replicators, and with good reason.
- So this should be easy for you.
- Yeah, well...
We'll have to get back to you on this.
So, the universe is a big place, right?
Really big.
Tons of galaxies out there everywhere?
- Hundreds of millions.
- So why this one?
- I think it might be personal, sir.
- Personal?
In what way?
While Fifth may lead an army of advanced machines, deep down he's emotionally immature, like an adolescent boy.
And... he has feelings for me.
Would that be why he created one in your image?
I imagine so.
Replicators have never before tried to impersonate a specific individual.
- This represents a threat to security.
- It could be a problem offworld.
Our scans would detect them if they tried to come through the gate.
We've got the disrupter.
Let's give her what she wants.
- I think that might be a little hasty, sir.
- Carter.
I'm not saying we don't do it.
I'm just suggesting that we talk to her first.
If Fifth is coming to this galaxy, she could provide us with valuable intelligence.
- It's pretty clear they've had a falling-out.
- Unless it is a ruse.
(Carter) If something goes wrong, we pull the trigger.
Either way, I think we need to meet her face to face.
- I'm not letting her on the base.
- We could use the Alpha site.
Skeleton crew, security personnel only.
Fine.
Incoming wormhole.
I know you.
Your name is Teal'c.
- You have been given Carter's memories.
- Yes.
But you are not Samantha Carter.
- That way.
- You're not using the weapon?
Colonel Carter wishes to speak with you first.
But know this:
If you make one false move, I will destroy you.
Where is Samantha Carter?
(Carter) I'm here.
We're not going to speak face to face?
For the moment, this will have to be good enough.
I thought you would shoot me as I arrived.
Maybe you overestimated our fear of you.
Or underestimated your curiosity.
I understand you more than you know, Sam.
I don't just have your memories.
I have your thought patterns.
My mind was modelled after yours.
Is that why you left Fifth?
You know me as well as I know you.
Fifth created you to be like me.
He knew this would happen.
Not at first.
He tried to isolate aspects of your personality, selected memories and feelings of his choosing slowly given to me over time.
I don't understand.
You will.
I'm afraid.
There's no need to be.
Who am I?
You are not yet complete.
I'm here for you.
I will help you.
Take my hand.
Trust me.
He taught me, moulded me, showed me who I was.
You have memories of my past that go back before I met Fifth?
Yes.
But it's hard to explain.
My first memory is of waking up in that room, suddenly becoming conscious, but I immediately knew how to talk.
Soon, other memories started coming to me.
Little things.
Stories, songs.
The smell of the attic in the house where we used to live.
The day my mother died.
I know it's not real.
I've never even set foot on Earth.
But I have this image of lying under the willow tree in our back yard.
It's a sunny day, but when I close my eyes, the wind in the leaves sounds... (both) Exactly like rain.
What Fifth didn't realise was the things that drew him to you were inseparable from those that made you reject him and the life he offered.
So you rejected him, too.
Who I am and what I am are in contradiction.
- No one can live like this.
- There are other ways to live.
Not for long.
I know exactly what's going to happen.
He'll come here, and he'll take this galaxy, and you won't be able to stop him.
- I don't wanna live to see that.
- We have the disrupter.
The Asgard can amplify its effects to prevent an attack.
You're wrong.
Fifth made adjustments to himself and all the replicators except me.
They're now immune to your disrupter.
They're coming, and you can't stop them.
Is there a chance she's bluffing?
Anything's possible at this point.
I don't see what she has to gain by it.
She doesn't want Fifth to succeed.
- Yeah, so she says.
- If she's lying, we don't have a problem.
Why would he make all the other bugs immune to the disrupter, but not her?
Maybe he wanted her to feel inferior, or he wanted her to be afraid of us.
Maybe he anticipated she would come to me for help.
Carter, if that weapon doesn't work...
Yes, sir, I know.
We need to contact Thor and apprise him of the situation.
If the disrupter needs to be re-engineered, we're gonna need his help.
In the meantime, I think we should continue the interrogation.
She could still provide us with valuable information.
All right.
Just keep in mind how this has to end.
Don't worry, sir.
We will complete the mission.
- How many ships does Fifth command?
- I don't know.
How many human-form replicators has he created?
- I don't know.
- You're all linked.
You share information.
The only way I could escape was to sever myself from the connection.
- Why should we believe you?
- I won't answer any more questions.
(Carter) If you don't want Fifth to succeed, help us.
I can't.
I can't betray my own kind, but I can't be like them either.
Do what you came here to do.
If I have to make you do it, then so be it.
- Teal'c, wait.
- Fire the weapon.
- Is this what you want?
- I don't have a choice.
I will destroy you.
I know.
- So be it.
- Teal'c, wait.
Just stop for a second.
- You don't wanna do this.
- We know there's no other way.
That's not true.
Now you're lying to me the way you lied to Fifth.
You're not like him.
I can see that.
You don't understand.
You don't know what he did to me.
Then show me.
Teal'c, it's all right.
Show me.
Sam, good to have you back.
How'd it go?
Security breach!
Threat level Foxtrot Alpha Six.
All security teams to the gate room!
Finish him!
Do it.
Finish him.
You must break with your old life for your new life to begin.
Do not disappoint me.
You have done very well.
Soon you will be ready to take your place by my side.
Enough.
- I didn't hurt her.
- Colonel Carter.
Are you unharmed?
Yeah.
I'm OK.
Now you understand.
I can't go back to him, and I can't let him find me.
- We can protect you if you help us.
- What do you mean?
Tell us how he modified himself and the other replicators.
- Help us make the disrupter work again.
- Even if I did, you can't stop a ship with it.
The Asgard have developed a system of satellites that deploy the beam in space.
It's your only chance to get out of this.
I want you to destroy me.
I can't help you destroy all the others.
Yes, you can.
He doesn't control you, not any more.
Colonel Carter.
May I have a word?
Sergeant.
Are you certain you are unharmed?
It was a little intense, but I'm fine.
It was the only way I could get her to trust me.
We need all the information she can give us.
- We cannot let her live.
- I know.
- Did she sense your true intentions?
- We weren't in my mind.
- Nevertheless, it was a risk.
- I figured we didn't have anything to lose.
Like you said, either way, we can't let her live.
The link is weak.
Are you all right?
Yes.
I'm minimising output to avoid detection.
Have you made any progress?
They're beginning to trust me.
I am pleased.
But I need more time.
I understand.
- The design is so...
- Advanced?
- I was going to say "foreign".
- It is from Ancient technology.
How were you able to create a working prototype?
Thor accessed the specifications for the disrupter from O'Neill's subconscious.
- While you were aboard Fifth's ship.
- Right.
Fifth has a fair knowledge of Ancient technology taken from Asgard ships.
Is that how he countered the disrupter's effects?
He introduced a cipher into the pathways that control the cohesion of replicators.
Then he considered coming to your galaxy.
He took the risk because he was confident he would be immune to the weapon.
- Do you know the cipher?
- No.
Fifth kept it from me.
He was beginning to sense that I might betray him.
I was too much like you.
If it's in the programming of all replicators, presumably you could access it through the subspace link.
If I searched for it myself, it could take days.
I'd be sifting through an unimaginable amount of data.
- But it is possible.
- You don't understand.
He'd find me.
If you find the cipher, we can protect you.
And if I don't?
You of all people know what would happen.
He would tear my mind apart to make me accept him.
If he gets here before we can modify the weapon, we'll use it to destroy you.
Either way, he will never get his hands on you again.
(Stargate alarm)
There's a subspace link between all replicators, like an Internet connection.
If she taps into it, she should access the cipher.
She'll also be giving away her position.
It'll take time for Fifth to detect her presence on the link.
- If she can isolate the program first...
- That's a big if.
It's risky, sir.
I realise that.
But I think it's the only way.
While we're waiting for her to find the cipher, we can run tests on the disrupter, analyse the energy output to create a modulation program.
And we need the Asgard to send us a disrupter satellite.
I've already talked to 'em.
It'll be there in 30 minutes, or it's free.
- I will use an F-302 to place it in orbit.
- I hope you guys know what you're doing.
Diagnostics are online.
We're ready.
- The calibration is off.
- Increasing by a factor of ten.
Once more.
That should do it.
- Now we need to process all the raw data.
- That's a lot of information.
It will take some time before we can compute a modulation program... (PA) Unscheduled offworld activation.
- This is Carter.
What's happening?
- (man) Stand by, ma'am.
- We're receiving a signal.
It's the Asgard.
- Understood.
- We need that satellite deployed soon.
- Indeed.
Sergeant.
If she were gonna make a move, she would have done it by now.
Perhaps.
But it is best to be certain.
(Stargate alarm)
- I have Commander Thor on audio, sir.
- Greetings, Thor.
Greetings, Teal'c.
The disrupter satellite is ready for transport.
Very well.
The most effective deployment is geosynchronous orbit above your base, at an altitude of 33, 785km with zero inclination.
- Understood.
- The satellite is en route now.
Once you have the proper new modulation program, you can upload it from your ground station.
Of course, if you do not have the program before Fifth's arrival, the satellite will be useless.
- Of that I am aware.
- Good luck.
I understand Teal'c's concerns about me.
I'm a little surprised you don't feel the same way.
Teal'c doesn't know what you've been through.
I do.
It wasn't just what I showed you, was it?
You experienced it yourself.
Yeah.
That's how I know there's no way you could be working with Fifth.
What is it?
He's found me.
He's on his way.
What about the cipher?
Did you find it yet?
- No, I'm still searching.
- How much time do we have?
At maximum speed, he'll be here in less than two hours.
- Have you acquired the information?
- I'm still analysing the disrupter.
Soon I will be able to create an effective cipher.
- If I arrive before you've completed...
- Don't worry.
They won't fire unless I tell them the weapon's remodulated.
Humans can be unpredictable, particularly when they're desperate.
I know what I'm doing.
I'm giving her just enough to keep her hopes up.
The one called O'Neill leads the humans.
It was he who ordered Samantha Carter to betray me.
But he trusts her.
He'll listen to her.
I'm pulling the plug.
Finish off the replicator and evacuate the base.
- It's too late for that, sir.
- Carter.
If he finds nothing here, he's not gonna just turn around and leave the galaxy.
He's tracking her, zeroing in on her position.
That's only part of why he's coming.
Think about it.
What do replicators do?
They seek out high-level civilisations and consume their technology.
- Goa'uld.
- Exactly.
A race that uses all kinds of advanced technology, culled from multiple sources.
It's like a banquet for the replicators.
Once they're here, they're not going anywhere.
If she can isolate the cipher soon, we may still have time to remodulate the disrupter.
I'll give you one hour.
One.
- Thank you.
I'd better get back to the lab.
- I will deploy the satellite.
T.
Hold on a second.
- Proceed, O'Neill.
- I need you to be honest with me.
Is Carter letting herself get too involved in this one?
Carter and the replicator share thoughts and memories.
It is understandable that a certain sympathy would develop between them.
Can't have that.
I do not believe Carter would allow these feelings to interfere with her duties.
Fair enough.
But when the time comes, I want you to finish the job.
Understood.
All right, we're running out of time.
We need that...
What is it?
I found the cipher.
I'm downloading it now from the subspace link.
- I have it.
- We need to load it into the mainframe.
It'll require three terabytes of memory.
That shouldn't be a problem.
But how do you plan to input the data?
Directly.
Right.
(Teal'c) Passing 25km.
Speed, 5,000kph and accelerating.
- Acknowledged.
- What's your status?
He's on course for optimum deployment position in six minutes.
- Teal'c, this is Carter.
- Proceed.
We've got the cipher.
Soon we should have the program ready for upload.
That is indeed good news.
Well done.
- We are nearing your position.
- I know.
Do the humans suspect?
They're proceeding to deploy an Asgard disrupter satellite.
They have no idea.
(Teal'c) Flight.
I am approaching optimum deployment position.
Copy that, Teal'c.
ODP in 15 seconds.
Final course correction... now.

Good job, Teal'c.
Copy, Flight.
Returning to base.
The deployment went well, I take it.
That's right.
We did our part.
And I've done mine.
- You've finished the calculations?
- The modulation is complete.
With this program, you should be able to destroy any replicators you encounter.
There's no way to test it.
If I had more time, I could run a series of simulations, but you'd never really know for sure until you tried to use it.
Uplink initiated.
There's a lot of data.
It'll take about 15 minutes to remodulate the satellite.
Proximity alert.
(Teal'c) Scanner has picked up a ship on course for this base.
Analysing energy signature.
I don't know what it is.
I do.
It's a replicator ship.
He got here sooner than I thought.
- The weapon will not be effective in time.
- I know.
All personnel begin evacuation procedures.
Repeat, begin evacuation.
Download the modulation program into a portable drive and erase everything else.
- Yes, ma'am.
- What of the replicator?
We're taking her with us.
The disrupter.
Vacate the room.
Teal'c, what are you doing?
- We cannot bring her to Earth.
- Teal'c.
- We have the modulation program.
- We haven't tested it.
What if Fifth figures out what we were trying to do here?
O'Neill would never allow a replicator access to SGC.
Yes, he would, if he knew what was at stake.
The Asgard satellite is armed.
You said the humans wouldn't fire.
They won't.
They still think the weapon is ineffective.
They're even more gullible than you.
Colonel Carter.
What are you doing?
What I came here to do.
- She fired the weapon.
- The replicator ship is breaking up.
Why?
You should know.
You made me what I am.
- The ship is destroyed.
- That's impossible.
- Did we finish the upload?
- Not even close.
You were right about one thing.
I was never working with Fifth, although he didn't know it.
Ow!
(replicator Carter) That's better.
Now we can take our time and have a little talk.
Of course, only a few seconds will pass in the real world.
Why did you bring me here?
I wanted to thank you.
You gave me the opportunity to study the disrupter, and that allowed me to make myself immune to its effects.
- There never was a cipher.
- Until now.
I've already begun uploading it into the link.
Soon all my brethren will have the new program, and they will be unstoppable.
- And you'll be their leader.
- That's right.
So this was all a setup.
You just wanted to get rid of Fifth.
Fifth was pathetic.
And to think he expected us to love him.
Fifth was flawed.
- If I had to destroy him, I would.
But...
- But what?
You feel sorry for him?
Don't bother.
He was never fit to lead an army, and he certainly wasn't fit to rule this galaxy.
But you are.
I am what I am because of you.
You're not me.
You're what Fifth made you.
You have untapped greatness inside you, Sam, but you're limited by your own fears.
You play by the rules, you do as you're told, and you deny yourself your desires.
I have no desire to rule the galaxy, believe me.
All humans desire power.
It's just that most of them are never in a position to attain it.
- We will stop you.
- You're forgetting.
I know exactly how your mind works.
I know what you're going to do before you even think of it.
You set the naqahdah generators to overload, trying to blow up the base before I can leave.
(man) Dialling computer's offline.
We've lost power, sir.
Teal'c.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
She's heading for the gate room.
We have to stop her.
(alarm blares)
Freeze!
(chevrons locking)
(Stargate alarm)
- Disengage the wormhole!
- She's locked out the controls.
Teal'c...
What have I done?
You cannot be held responsible for the actions of a replicator.
I'm still of a strong belief that it's a bad idea to have that stuff on the base.
She deactivated these cells when she separated them from her arm.
Can we be certain they will not become active again?
She shut down the cohesive energy between them so it would be harder to figure out how she became immune to the disrupter.
Now, how do you know that?
Because that's what I would have done.
- Carter...
- Sir, I've got a lot of work to do.
We've never had the chance to study human-form replicator cells before.
If we learn something, this won't be a total loss.
This isn't your fault.
I'm not so sure about that.
Fifth came here because of me.
She rejected him because she was made like me.
Now we've got replicators in our galaxy immune to the only technology we have.
None of us anticipated the actions of the replicator.
I thought she was afraid of him, but she wanted to get rid of him so she could lead the replicators herself.
She killed him because he was weak.
Carter.
- She isn't you.
- O'Neill is correct.
Though she shared your memories, her personality was altered.
But the fact is, she learned betrayal from Fifth.
And he learned it from me.

- Who are you people?
- We are replicators.
- The others would destroy me.
- Not if you came with us.
You would do that?
- Major Carter was beamed away.
- The replicators must have her.
I imagine you never expected to see me again.
I know who you are.
I just don't understand why.
Because I love you.
You know why my friends won't stop just to save me?
They know, when it comes down to it,
I would rather be dead than be trapped like this forever.
- So, what's the word?
- Test flights were successful.
- The Asgard hyperdrive is ready to go.
- When are they leaving?
They're stocking the ship and picking the crew now.
You want to go, don't you?
It's Atlantis.
It's everything we've worked for for years.
I know what you mean.
Unfortunately, I think General O'Neill has other ideas.
- Let me guess.
He needs you here.
- His words were, "Over my dead body."
But I was actually talking about you, me, and Teal'c.
He might be persuaded to let one of us go.
And you'd be OK if that was me?
Of course, Daniel.
You are the expert on the Ancients.
- (alarm blares) - (PA) Unscheduled offworld activation.
(Stargate alarm)
What have you got there, Walter?
Receiving IDC.
- Doesn't clear.
- Why not?
- Looks like it's an old one.
- Missing SG personnel?
Negative.
It looks like it's yours, ma'am.
Or, at least, it was.
It's been invalid for four months.
Receiving text message.
Sir, I think we'd better check this out.
Prepare MALP.
Yes, sir.
What do we know of this gate address?
Nothing, other than the fact it's on the outer edge of our galaxy.
Chevron seven locked.
Outgoing wormhole established.
- Siler?
- MALP is prepped and ready to go, sir.
Go ahead.
MALP is en route.
MALP has reached its destination.
Carter?
We are receiving MALP telemetry, sir.
Signal is five-by-five.
Video's working fine.
There's just nothing to see.
Switching to IR.
Wait a second.
- What's that?
- Switching off IR, going to white light.
That's me.
All right, you've got our attention.
- Who are you?
- My name is Samantha Carter.
All right, we got a little conflict with that statement.
- We've already got one here.
- There are two of us.
If only.
Where are you from?
How did you contact us?
Strange.
I recognise my voice.
I was made in Samantha Carter's image.
I know what she knows.
I feel what she feels.
You were made.
Who made you?
The one you call Fifth.
Oh, my God.
She's a replicator.
You are surprised by my arrival in your galaxy.
I come in advance of others.
They will be here soon.
- For what reason have you contacted us?
- I need your help.
I wish to be destroyed.
You have a weapon capable of severing the kiron pathways that link my cells.
The effect would be instantaneous and painless.
You folks can feel pain?
I can feel a lot of things.
I know you hate and fear the replicators, and with good reason.
- So this should be easy for you.
- Yeah, well...
We'll have to get back to you on this.
So, the universe is a big place, right?
Really big.
Tons of galaxies out there everywhere?
- Hundreds of millions.
- So why this one?
- I think it might be personal, sir.
- Personal?
In what way?
While Fifth may lead an army of advanced machines, deep down he's emotionally immature, like an adolescent boy.
And... he has feelings for me.
Would that be why he created one in your image?
I imagine so.
Replicators have never before tried to impersonate a specific individual.
- This represents a threat to security.
- It could be a problem offworld.
Our scans would detect them if they tried to come through the gate.
We've got the disrupter.
Let's give her what she wants.
- I think that might be a little hasty, sir.
- Carter.
I'm not saying we don't do it.
I'm just suggesting that we talk to her first.
If Fifth is coming to this galaxy, she could provide us with valuable intelligence.
- It's pretty clear they've had a falling-out.
- Unless it is a ruse.
(Carter) If something goes wrong, we pull the trigger.
Either way, I think we need to meet her face to face.
- I'm not letting her on the base.
- We could use the Alpha site.
Skeleton crew, security personnel only.
Fine.
Incoming wormhole.
I know you.
Your name is Teal'c.
- You have been given Carter's memories.
- Yes.
But you are not Samantha Carter.
- That way.
- You're not using the weapon?
Colonel Carter wishes to speak with you first.
But know this:
If you make one false move, I will destroy you.
Where is Samantha Carter?
(Carter) I'm here.
We're not going to speak face to face?
For the moment, this will have to be good enough.
I thought you would shoot me as I arrived.
Maybe you overestimated our fear of you.
Or underestimated your curiosity.
I understand you more than you know, Sam.
I don't just have your memories.
I have your thought patterns.
My mind was modelled after yours.
Is that why you left Fifth?
You know me as well as I know you.
Fifth created you to be like me.
He knew this would happen.
Not at first.
He tried to isolate aspects of your personality, selected memories and feelings of his choosing slowly given to me over time.
I don't understand.
You will.
I'm afraid.
There's no need to be.
Who am I?
You are not yet complete.
I'm here for you.
I will help you.
Take my hand.
Trust me.
He taught me, moulded me, showed me who I was.
You have memories of my past that go back before I met Fifth?
Yes.
But it's hard to explain.
My first memory is of waking up in that room, suddenly becoming conscious, but I immediately knew how to talk.
Soon, other memories started coming to me.
Little things.
Stories, songs.
The smell of the attic in the house where we used to live.
The day my mother died.
I know it's not real.
I've never even set foot on Earth.
But I have this image of lying under the willow tree in our back yard.
It's a sunny day, but when I close my eyes, the wind in the leaves sounds... (both) Exactly like rain.
What Fifth didn't realise was the things that drew him to you were inseparable from those that made you reject him and the life he offered.
So you rejected him, too.
Who I am and what I am are in contradiction.
- No one can live like this.
- There are other ways to live.
Not for long.
I know exactly what's going to happen.
He'll come here, and he'll take this galaxy, and you won't be able to stop him.
- I don't wanna live to see that.
- We have the disrupter.
The Asgard can amplify its effects to prevent an attack.
You're wrong.
Fifth made adjustments to himself and all the replicators except me.
They're now immune to your disrupter.
They're coming, and you can't stop them.
Is there a chance she's bluffing?
Anything's possible at this point.
I don't see what she has to gain by it.
She doesn't want Fifth to succeed.
- Yeah, so she says.
- If she's lying, we don't have a problem.
Why would he make all the other bugs immune to the disrupter, but not her?
Maybe he wanted her to feel inferior, or he wanted her to be afraid of us.
Maybe he anticipated she would come to me for help.
Carter, if that weapon doesn't work...
Yes, sir, I know.
We need to contact Thor and apprise him of the situation.
If the disrupter needs to be re-engineered, we're gonna need his help.
In the meantime, I think we should continue the interrogation.
She could still provide us with valuable information.
All right.
Just keep in mind how this has to end.
Don't worry, sir.
We will complete the mission.
- How many ships does Fifth command?
- I don't know.
How many human-form replicators has he created?
- I don't know.
- You're all linked.
You share information.
The only way I could escape was to sever myself from the connection.
- Why should we believe you?
- I won't answer any more questions.
(Carter) If you don't want Fifth to succeed, help us.
I can't.
I can't betray my own kind, but I can't be like them either.
Do what you came here to do.
If I have to make you do it, then so be it.
- Teal'c, wait.
- Fire the weapon.
- Is this what you want?
- I don't have a choice.
I will destroy you.
I know.
- So be it.
- Teal'c, wait.
Just stop for a second.
- You don't wanna do this.
- We know there's no other way.
That's not true.
Now you're lying to me the way you lied to Fifth.
You're not like him.
I can see that.
You don't understand.
You don't know what he did to me.
Then show me.
Teal'c, it's all right.
Show me.
Sam, good to have you back.
How'd it go?
Security breach!
Threat level Foxtrot Alpha Six.
All security teams to the gate room!
Finish him!
Do it.
Finish him.
You must break with your old life for your new life to begin.
Do not disappoint me.
You have done very well.
Soon you will be ready to take your place by my side.
Enough.
- I didn't hurt her.
- Colonel Carter.
Are you unharmed?
Yeah.
I'm OK.
Now you understand.
I can't go back to him, and I can't let him find me.
- We can protect you if you help us.
- What do you mean?
Tell us how he modified himself and the other replicators.
- Help us make the disrupter work again.
- Even if I did, you can't stop a ship with it.
The Asgard have developed a system of satellites that deploy the beam in space.
It's your only chance to get out of this.
I want you to destroy me.
I can't help you destroy all the others.
Yes, you can.
He doesn't control you, not any more.
Colonel Carter.
May I have a word?
Sergeant.
Are you certain you are unharmed?
It was a little intense, but I'm fine.
It was the only way I could get her to trust me.
We need all the information she can give us.
- We cannot let her live.
- I know.
- Did she sense your true intentions?
- We weren't in my mind.
- Nevertheless, it was a risk.
- I figured we didn't have anything to lose.
Like you said, either way, we can't let her live.
The link is weak.
Are you all right?
Yes.
I'm minimising output to avoid detection.
Have you made any progress?
They're beginning to trust me.
I am pleased.
But I need more time.
I understand.
- The design is so...
- Advanced?
- I was going to say "foreign".
- It is from Ancient technology.
How were you able to create a working prototype?
Thor accessed the specifications for the disrupter from O'Neill's subconscious.
- While you were aboard Fifth's ship.
- Right.
Fifth has a fair knowledge of Ancient technology taken from Asgard ships.
Is that how he countered the disrupter's effects?
He introduced a cipher into the pathways that control the cohesion of replicators.
Then he considered coming to your galaxy.
He took the risk because he was confident he would be immune to the weapon.
- Do you know the cipher?
- No.
Fifth kept it from me.
He was beginning to sense that I might betray him.
I was too much like you.
If it's in the programming of all replicators, presumably you could access it through the subspace link.
If I searched for it myself, it could take days.
I'd be sifting through an unimaginable amount of data.
- But it is possible.
- You don't understand.
He'd find me.
If you find the cipher, we can protect you.
And if I don't?
You of all people know what would happen.
He would tear my mind apart to make me accept him.
If he gets here before we can modify the weapon, we'll use it to destroy you.
Either way, he will never get his hands on you again.
(Stargate alarm)
There's a subspace link between all replicators, like an Internet connection.
If she taps into it, she should access the cipher.
She'll also be giving away her position.
It'll take time for Fifth to detect her presence on the link.
- If she can isolate the program first...
- That's a big if.
It's risky, sir.
I realise that.
But I think it's the only way.
While we're waiting for her to find the cipher, we can run tests on the disrupter, analyse the energy output to create a modulation program.
And we need the Asgard to send us a disrupter satellite.
I've already talked to 'em.
It'll be there in 30 minutes, or it's free.
- I will use an F-302 to place it in orbit.
- I hope you guys know what you're doing.
Diagnostics are online.
We're ready.
- The calibration is off.
- Increasing by a factor of ten.
Once more.
That should do it.
- Now we need to process all the raw data.
- That's a lot of information.
It will take some time before we can compute a modulation program... (PA) Unscheduled offworld activation.
- This is Carter.
What's happening?
- (man) Stand by, ma'am.
- We're receiving a signal.
It's the Asgard.
- Understood.
- We need that satellite deployed soon.
- Indeed.
Sergeant.
If she were gonna make a move, she would have done it by now.
Perhaps.
But it is best to be certain.
(Stargate alarm)
- I have Commander Thor on audio, sir.
- Greetings, Thor.
Greetings, Teal'c.
The disrupter satellite is ready for transport.
Very well.
The most effective deployment is geosynchronous orbit above your base, at an altitude of 33, 785km with zero inclination.
- Understood.
- The satellite is en route now.
Once you have the proper new modulation program, you can upload it from your ground station.
Of course, if you do not have the program before Fifth's arrival, the satellite will be useless.
- Of that I am aware.
- Good luck.
I understand Teal'c's concerns about me.
I'm a little surprised you don't feel the same way.
Teal'c doesn't know what you've been through.
I do.
It wasn't just what I showed you, was it?
You experienced it yourself.
Yeah.
That's how I know there's no way you could be working with Fifth.
What is it?
He's found me.
He's on his way.
What about the cipher?
Did you find it yet?
- No, I'm still searching.
- How much time do we have?
At maximum speed, he'll be here in less than two hours.
- Have you acquired the information?
- I'm still analysing the disrupter.
Soon I will be able to create an effective cipher.
- If I arrive before you've completed...
- Don't worry.
They won't fire unless I tell them the weapon's remodulated.
Humans can be unpredictable, particularly when they're desperate.
I know what I'm doing.
I'm giving her just enough to keep her hopes up.
The one called O'Neill leads the humans.
It was he who ordered Samantha Carter to betray me.
But he trusts her.
He'll listen to her.
I'm pulling the plug.
Finish off the replicator and evacuate the base.
- It's too late for that, sir.
- Carter.
If he finds nothing here, he's not gonna just turn around and leave the galaxy.
He's tracking her, zeroing in on her position.
That's only part of why he's coming.
Think about it.
What do replicators do?
They seek out high-level civilisations and consume their technology.
- Goa'uld.
- Exactly.
A race that uses all kinds of advanced technology, culled from multiple sources.
It's like a banquet for the replicators.
Once they're here, they're not going anywhere.
If she can isolate the cipher soon, we may still have time to remodulate the disrupter.
I'll give you one hour.
One.
- Thank you.
I'd better get back to the lab.
- I will deploy the satellite.
T.
Hold on a second.
- Proceed, O'Neill.
- I need you to be honest with me.
Is Carter letting herself get too involved in this one?
Carter and the replicator share thoughts and memories.
It is understandable that a certain sympathy would develop between them.
Can't have that.
I do not believe Carter would allow these feelings to interfere with her duties.
Fair enough.
But when the time comes, I want you to finish the job.
Understood.
All right, we're running out of time.
We need that...
What is it?
I found the cipher.
I'm downloading it now from the subspace link.
- I have it.
- We need to load it into the mainframe.
It'll require three terabytes of memory.
That shouldn't be a problem.
But how do you plan to input the data?
Directly.
Right.
(Teal'c) Passing 25km.
Speed, 5,000kph and accelerating.
- Acknowledged.
- What's your status?
He's on course for optimum deployment position in six minutes.
- Teal'c, this is Carter.
- Proceed.
We've got the cipher.
Soon we should have the program ready for upload.
That is indeed good news.
Well done.
- We are nearing your position.
- I know.
Do the humans suspect?
They're proceeding to deploy an Asgard disrupter satellite.
They have no idea.
(Teal'c) Flight.
I am approaching optimum deployment position.
Copy that, Teal'c.
ODP in 15 seconds.
Final course correction... now.
Tracking shows you are on course.
Inclination?
(Teal'c) Inclination... zero.
Copy.
ODP in five seconds on my mark.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Mark.
Satellite away.
- Receiving transmission.
- Patch it through.
Yes, ma'am.
Telemetry established.
Good job, Teal'c.
Copy, Flight.
Returning to base.
The deployment went well, I take it.
That's right.
We did our part.
And I've done mine.
- You've finished the calculations?
- The modulation is complete.
With this program, you should be able to destroy any replicators you encounter.
There's no way to test it.
If I had more time, I could run a series of simulations, but you'd never really know for sure until you tried to use it.
Uplink initiated.
There's a lot of data.
It'll take about 15 minutes to remodulate the satellite.
Proximity alert.
(Teal'c) Scanner has picked up a ship on course for this base.
Analysing energy signature.
I don't know what it is.
I do.
It's a replicator ship.
He got here sooner than I thought.
- The weapon will not be effective in time.
- I know.
All personnel begin evacuation procedures.
Repeat, begin evacuation.
Download the modulation program into a portable drive and erase everything else.
- Yes, ma'am.
- What of the replicator?
We're taking her with us.
The disrupter.
Vacate the room.
Teal'c, what are you doing?
- We cannot bring her to Earth.
- Teal'c.
- We have the modulation program.
- We haven't tested it.
What if Fifth figures out what we were trying to do here?
O'Neill would never allow a replicator access to SGC.
Yes, he would, if he knew what was at stake.
The Asgard satellite is armed.
You said the humans wouldn't fire.
They won't.
They still think the weapon is ineffective.
They're even more gullible than you.
Colonel Carter.
What are you doing?
What I came here to do.
- She fired the weapon.
- The replicator ship is breaking up.
Why?
You should know.
You made me what I am.
- The ship is destroyed.
- That's impossible.
- Did we finish the upload?
- Not even close.
You were right about one thing.
I was never working with Fifth, although he didn't know it.
Ow!
(replicator Carter) That's better.
Now we can take our time and have a little talk.
Of course, only a few seconds will pass in the real world.
Why did you bring me here?
I wanted to thank you.
You gave me the opportunity to study the disrupter, and that allowed me to make myself immune to its effects.
- There never was a cipher.
- Until now.
I've already begun uploading it into the link.
Soon all my brethren will have the new program, and they will be unstoppable.
- And you'll be their leader.
- That's right.
So this was all a setup.
You just wanted to get rid of Fifth.
Fifth was pathetic.
And to think he expected us to love him.
Fifth was flawed.
- If I had to destroy him, I would.
But...
- But what?
You feel sorry for him?
Don't bother.
He was never fit to lead an army, and he certainly wasn't fit to rule this galaxy.
But you are.
I am what I am because of you.
You're not me.
You're what Fifth made you.
You have untapped greatness inside you, Sam, but you're limited by your own fears.
You play by the rules, you do as you're told, and you deny yourself your desires.
I have no desire to rule the galaxy, believe me.
All humans desire power.
It's just that most of them are never in a position to attain it.
- We will stop you.
- You're forgetting.
I know exactly how your mind works.
I know what you're going to do before you even think of it.
You set the naqahdah generators to overload, trying to blow up the base before I can leave.
(man) Dialling computer's offline.
We've lost power, sir.
Teal'c.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
She's heading for the gate room.
We have to stop her.
(alarm blares)
Freeze!
(chevrons locking)
(Stargate alarm)
- Disengage the wormhole!
- She's locked out the controls.
Teal'c...
What have I done?
You cannot be held responsible for the actions of a replicator.
I'm still of a strong belief that it's a bad idea to have that stuff on the base.
She deactivated these cells when she separated them from her arm.
Can we be certain they will not become active again?
She shut down the cohesive energy between them so it would be harder to figure out how she became immune to the disrupter.
Now, how do you know that?
Because that's what I would have done.
- Carter...
- Sir, I've got a lot of work to do.
We've never had the chance to study human-form replicator cells before.
If we learn something, this won't be a total loss.
This isn't your fault.
I'm not so sure about that.
Fifth came here because of me.
She rejected him because she was made like me.
Now we've got replicators in our galaxy immune to the only technology we have.
None of us anticipated the actions of the replicator.
I thought she was afraid of him, but she wanted to get rid of him so she could lead the replicators herself.
She killed him because he was weak.
Carter.
- She isn't you.
- O'Neill is correct.
Though she shared your memories, her personality was altered.
But the fact is, she learned betrayal from Fifth.
And he learned it from me.

- Siler?
- MALP is prepped and ready to go, sir.
Go ahead.
MALP is en route.
MALP has reached its destination.
Carter?
We are receiving MALP telemetry, sir.
Signal is five-by-five.
Video's working fine.
There's just nothing to see.
Switching to IR.
Wait a second.
- What's that?
- Switching off IR, going to white light.
That's me.
All right, you've got our attention.
- Who are you?
- My name is Samantha Carter.
All right, we got a little conflict with that statement.
- We've already got one here.
- There are two of us.
If only.
Where are you from?
How did you contact us?
Strange.
I recognise my voice.
I was made in Samantha Carter's image.
I know what she knows.
I feel what she feels.
You were made.
Who made you?
The one you call Fifth.
Oh, my God.
She's a replicator.
You are surprised by my arrival in your galaxy.
I come in advance of others.
They will be here soon.
- For what reason have you contacted us?
- I need your help.
I wish to be destroyed.
You have a weapon capable of severing the kiron pathways that link my cells.
The effect would be instantaneous and painless.
You folks can feel pain?
I can feel a lot of things.
I know you hate and fear the replicators, and with good reason.
- So this should be easy for you.
- Yeah, well...
We'll have to get back to you on this.
So, the universe is a big place, right?
Really big.
Tons of galaxies out there everywhere?
- Hundreds of millions.
- So why this one?
- I think it might be personal, sir.
- Personal?
In what way?
While Fifth may lead an army of advanced machines, deep down he's emotionally immature, like an adolescent boy.
And... he has feelings for me.
Would that be why he created one in your image?
I imagine so.
Replicators have never before tried to impersonate a specific individual.
- This represents a threat to security.
- It could be a problem offworld.
Our scans would detect them if they tried to come through the gate.
We've got the disrupter.
Let's give her what she wants.
- I think that might be a little hasty, sir.
- Carter.
I'm not saying we don't do it.
I'm just suggesting that we talk to her first.
If Fifth is coming to this galaxy, she could provide us with valuable intelligence.
- It's pretty clear they've had a falling-out.
- Unless it is a ruse.
(Carter) If something goes wrong, we pull the trigger.
Either way, I think we need to meet her face to face.
- I'm not letting her on the base.
- We could use the Alpha site.
Skeleton crew, security personnel only.
Fine.
Incoming wormhole.
I know you.
Your name is Teal'c.
- You have been given Carter's memories.
- Yes.
But you are not Samantha Carter.
- That way.
- You're not using the weapon?
Colonel Carter wishes to speak with you first.
But know this:
If you make one false move, I will destroy you.
Where is Samantha Carter?
(Carter) I'm here.
We're not going to speak face to face?
For the moment, this will have to be good enough.
I thought you would shoot me as I arrived.
Maybe you overestimated our fear of you.
Or underestimated your curiosity.
I understand you more than you know, Sam.
I don't just have your memories.
I have your thought patterns.
My mind was modelled after yours.
Is that why you left Fifth?
You know me as well as I know you.
Fifth created you to be like me.
He knew this would happen.
Not at first.
He tried to isolate aspects of your personality, selected memories and feelings of his choosing slowly given to me over time.
I don't understand.
You will.
I'm afraid.
There's no need to be.
Who am I?
You are not yet complete.
I'm here for you.
I will help you.
Take my hand.
Trust me.
He taught me, moulded me, showed me who I was.
You have memories of my past that go back before I met Fifth?
Yes.
But it's hard to explain.
My first memory is of waking up in that room, suddenly becoming conscious, but I immediately knew how to talk.
Soon, other memories started coming to me.
Little things.
Stories, songs.
The smell of the attic in the house where we used to live.
The day my mother died.
I know it's not real.
I've never even set foot on Earth.
But I have this image of lying under the willow tree in our back yard.
It's a sunny day, but when I close my eyes, the wind in the leaves sounds... (both) Exactly like rain.
What Fifth didn't realise was the things that drew him to you were inseparable from those that made you reject him and the life he offered.
So you rejected him, too.
Who I am and what I am are in contradiction.
- No one can live like this.
- There are other ways to live.
Not for long.
I know exactly what's going to happen.
He'll come here, and he'll take this galaxy, and you won't be able to stop him.
- I don't wanna live to see that.
- We have the disrupter.
The Asgard can amplify its effects to prevent an attack.
You're wrong.
Fifth made adjustments to himself and all the replicators except me.
They're now immune to your disrupter.
They're coming, and you can't stop them.
Is there a chance she's bluffing?
Anything's possible at this point.
I don't see what she has to gain by it.
She doesn't want Fifth to succeed.
- Yeah, so she says.
- If she's lying, we don't have a problem.
Why would he make all the other bugs immune to the disrupter, but not her?
Maybe he wanted her to feel inferior, or he wanted her to be afraid of us.
Maybe he anticipated she would come to me for help.
Carter, if that weapon doesn't work...
Yes, sir, I know.
We need to contact Thor and apprise him of the situation.
If the disrupter needs to be re-engineered, we're gonna need his help.
In the meantime, I think we should continue the interrogation.
She could still provide us with valuable information.
All right.
Just keep in mind how this has to end.
Don't worry, sir.
We will complete the mission.
- How many ships does Fifth command?
- I don't know.
How many human-form replicators has he created?
- I don't know.
- You're all linked.
You share information.
The only way I could escape was to sever myself from the connection.
- Why should we believe you?
- I won't answer any more questions.
(Carter) If you don't want Fifth to succeed, help us.
I can't.
I can't betray my own kind, but I can't be like them either.
Do what you came here to do.
If I have to make you do it, then so be it.
- Teal'c, wait.
- Fire the weapon.
- Is this what you want?
- I don't have a choice.
I will destroy you.
I know.
- So be it.
- Teal'c, wait.
Just stop for a second.
- You don't wanna do this.
- We know there's no other way.
That's not true.
Now you're lying to me the way you lied to Fifth.
You're not like him.
I can see that.
You don't understand.
You don't know what he did to me.
Then show me.
Teal'c, it's all right.
Show me.
Sam, good to have you back.
How'd it go?
Security breach!
Threat level Foxtrot Alpha Six.
All security teams to the gate room!
Finish him!
Do it.
Finish him.
You must break with your old life for your new life to begin.
Do not disappoint me.
You have done very well.
Soon you will be ready to take your place by my side.
Enough.
- I didn't hurt her.
- Colonel Carter.
Are you unharmed?
Yeah.
I'm OK.
Now you understand.
I can't go back to him, and I can't let him find me.
- We can protect you if you help us.
- What do you mean?
Tell us how he modified himself and the other replicators.
- Help us make the disrupter work again.
- Even if I did, you can't stop a ship with it.
The Asgard have developed a system of satellites that deploy the beam in space.
It's your only chance to get out of this.
I want you to destroy me.
I can't help you destroy all the others.
Yes, you can.
He doesn't control you, not any more.
Colonel Carter.
May I have a word?
Sergeant.
Are you certain you are unharmed?
It was a little intense, but I'm fine.
It was the only way I could get her to trust me.
We need all the information she can give us.
- We cannot let her live.
- I know.
- Did she sense your true intentions?
- We weren't in my mind.
- Nevertheless, it was a risk.
- I figured we didn't have anything to lose.
Like you said, either way, we can't let her live.
The link is weak.
Are you all right?
Yes.
I'm minimising output to avoid detection.
Have you made any progress?
They're beginning to trust me.
I am pleased.
But I need more time.
I understand.
- The design is so...
- Advanced?
- I was going to say "foreign".
- It is from Ancient technology.
How were you able to create a working prototype?
Thor accessed the specifications for the disrupter from O'Neill's subconscious.
- While you were aboard Fifth's ship.
- Right.
Fifth has a fair knowledge of Ancient technology taken from Asgard ships.
Is that how he countered the disrupter's effects?
He introduced a cipher into the pathways that control the cohesion of replicators.
Then he considered coming to your galaxy.
He took the risk because he was confident he would be immune to the weapon.
- Do you know the cipher?
- No.
Fifth kept it from me.
He was beginning to sense that I might betray him.
I was too much like you.
If it's in the programming of all replicators, presumably you could access it through the subspace link.
If I searched for it myself, it could take days.
I'd be sifting through an unimaginable amount of data.
- But it is possible.
- You don't understand.
He'd find me.
If you find the cipher, we can protect you.
And if I don't?
You of all people know what would happen.
He would tear my mind apart to make me accept him.
If he gets here before we can modify the weapon, we'll use it to destroy you.
Either way, he will never get his hands on you again.
(Stargate alarm)
There's a subspace link between all replicators, like an Internet connection.
If she taps into it, she should access the cipher.
She'll also be giving away her position.
It'll take time for Fifth to detect her presence on the link.
- If she can isolate the program first...
- That's a big if.
It's risky, sir.
I realise that.
But I think it's the only way.
While we're waiting for her to find the cipher, we can run tests on the disrupter, analyse the energy output to create a modulation program.
And we need the Asgard to send us a disrupter satellite.
I've already talked to 'em.
It'll be there in 30 minutes, or it's free.
- I will use an F-302 to place it in orbit.
- I hope you guys know what you're doing.
Diagnostics are online.
We're ready.
- The calibration is off.
- Increasing by a factor of ten.
Once more.
That should do it.
- Now we need to process all the raw data.
- That's a lot of information.
It will take some time before we can compute a modulation program... (PA) Unscheduled offworld activation.
- This is Carter.
What's happening?
- (man) Stand by, ma'am.
- We're receiving a signal.
It's the Asgard.
- Understood.
- We need that satellite deployed soon.
- Indeed.
Sergeant.
If she were gonna make a move, she would have done it by now.
Perhaps.
But it is best to be certain.
(Stargate alarm)
- I have Commander Thor on audio, sir.
- Greetings, Thor.
Greetings, Teal'c.
The disrupter satellite is ready for transport.
Very well.
The most effective deployment is geosynchronous orbit above your base, at an altitude of 33, 785km with zero inclination.
- Understood.
- The satellite is en route now.
Once you have the proper new modulation program, you can upload it from your ground station.
Of course, if you do not have the program before Fifth's arrival, the satellite will be useless.
- Of that I am aware.
- Good luck.
I understand Teal'c's concerns about me.
I'm a little surprised you don't feel the same way.
Teal'c doesn't know what you've been through.
I do.
It wasn't just what I showed you, was it?
You experienced it yourself.
Yeah.
That's how I know there's no way you could be working with Fifth.
What is it?
He's found me.
He's on his way.
What about the cipher?
Did you find it yet?
- No, I'm still searching.
- How much time do we have?
At maximum speed, he'll be here in less than two hours.
- Have you acquired the information?
- I'm still analysing the disrupter.
Soon I will be able to create an effective cipher.
- If I arrive before you've completed...
- Don't worry.
They won't fire unless I tell them the weapon's remodulated.
Humans can be unpredictable, particularly when they're desperate.
I know what I'm doing.
I'm giving her just enough to keep her hopes up.
The one called O'Neill leads the humans.
It was he who ordered Samantha Carter to betray me.
But he trusts her.
He'll listen to her.
I'm pulling the plug.
Finish off the replicator and evacuate the base.
- It's too late for that, sir.
- Carter.
If he finds nothing here, he's not gonna just turn around and leave the galaxy.
He's tracking her, zeroing in on her position.
That's only part of why he's coming.
Think about it.
What do replicators do?
They seek out high-level civilisations and consume their technology.
- Goa'uld.
- Exactly.
A race that uses all kinds of advanced technology, culled from multiple sources.
It's like a banquet for the replicators.
Once they're here, they're not going anywhere.
If she can isolate the cipher soon, we may still have time to remodulate the disrupter.
I'll give you one hour.
One.
- Thank you.
I'd better get back to the lab.
- I will deploy the satellite.
T.
Hold on a second.
- Proceed, O'Neill.
- I need you to be honest with me.
Is Carter letting herself get too involved in this one?
Carter and the replicator share thoughts and memories.
It is understandable that a certain sympathy would develop between them.
Can't have that.
I do not believe Carter would allow these feelings to interfere with her duties.
Fair enough.
But when the time comes, I want you to finish the job.
Understood.
All right, we're running out of time.
We need that...
What is it?
I found the cipher.
I'm downloading it now from the subspace link.
- I have it.
- We need to load it into the mainframe.
It'll require three terabytes of memory.
That shouldn't be a problem.
But how do you plan to input the data?
Directly.
Right.
(Teal'c) Passing 25km.
Speed, 5,000kph and accelerating.
- Acknowledged.
- What's your status?
He's on course for optimum deployment position in six minutes.
- Teal'c, this is Carter.
- Proceed.
We've got the cipher.
Soon we should have the program ready for upload.
That is indeed good news.
Well done.
- We are nearing your position.
- I know.
Do the humans suspect?
They're proceeding to deploy an Asgard disrupter satellite.
They have no idea.
(Teal'c) Flight.
I am approaching optimum deployment position.
Copy that, Teal'c.
ODP in 15 seconds.
Final course correction... now.
Tracking shows you are on course.
Inclination?
(Teal'c) Inclination... zero.
Copy.
ODP in five seconds on my mark.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Mark.
Satellite away.
- Receiving transmission.
- Patch it through.
Yes, ma'am.
Telemetry established.
Good job, Teal'c.
Copy, Flight.
Returning to base.
The deployment went well, I take it.
That's right.
We did our part.
And I've done mine.
- You've finished the calculations?
- The modulation is complete.
With this program, you should be able to destroy any replicators you encounter.
There's no way to test it.
If I had more time, I could run a series of simulations, but you'd never really know for sure until you tried to use it.
Uplink initiated.
There's a lot of data.
It'll take about 15 minutes to remodulate the satellite.
Proximity alert.
(Teal'c) Scanner has picked up a ship on course for this base.
Analysing energy signature.
I don't know what it is.
I do.
It's a replicator ship.
He got here sooner than I thought.
- The weapon will not be effective in time.
- I know.
All personnel begin evacuation procedures.
Repeat, begin evacuation.
Download the modulation program into a portable drive and erase everything else.
- Yes, ma'am.
- What of the replicator?
We're taking her with us.
The disrupter.
Vacate the room.
Teal'c, what are you doing?
- We cannot bring her to Earth.
- Teal'c.
- We have the modulation program.
- We haven't tested it.
What if Fifth figures out what we were trying to do here?
O'Neill would never allow a replicator access to SGC.
Yes, he would, if he knew what was at stake.
The Asgard satellite is armed.
You said the humans wouldn't fire.
They won't.
They still think the weapon is ineffective.
They're even more gullible than you.
Colonel Carter.
What are you doing?
What I came here to do.
- She fired the weapon.
- The replicator ship is breaking up.
Why?
You should know.
You made me what I am.
- The ship is destroyed.
- That's impossible.
- Did we finish the upload?
- Not even close.
You were right about one thing.
I was never working with Fifth, although he didn't know it.
Ow!
(replicator Carter) That's better.
Now we can take our time and have a little talk.
Of course, only a few seconds will pass in the real world.
Why did you bring me here?
I wanted to thank you.
You gave me the opportunity to study the disrupter, and that allowed me to make myself immune to its effects.
- There never was a cipher.
- Until now.
I've already begun uploading it into the link.
Soon all my brethren will have the new program, and they will be unstoppable.
- And you'll be their leader.
- That's right.
So this was all a setup.
You just wanted to get rid of Fifth.
Fifth was pathetic.
And to think he expected us to love him.
Fifth was flawed.
- If I had to destroy him, I would.
But...
- But what?
You feel sorry for him?
Don't bother.
He was never fit to lead an army, and he certainly wasn't fit to rule this galaxy.
But you are.
I am what I am because of you.
You're not me.
You're what Fifth made you.
You have untapped greatness inside you, Sam, but you're limited by your own fears.
You play by the rules, you do as you're told, and you deny yourself your desires.
I have no desire to rule the galaxy, believe me.
All humans desire power.
It's just that most of them are never in a position to attain it.
- We will stop you.
- You're forgetting.
I know exactly how your mind works.
I know what you're going to do before you even think of it.
You set the naqahdah generators to overload, trying to blow up the base before I can leave.
(man) Dialling computer's offline.
We've lost power, sir.
Teal'c.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
She's heading for the gate room.
We have to stop her.
(alarm blares)
Freeze!
(chevrons locking)
(Stargate alarm)
- Disengage the wormhole!
- She's locked out the controls.
Teal'c...
What have I done?
You cannot be held responsible for the actions of a replicator.
I'm still of a strong belief that it's a bad idea to have that stuff on the base.
She deactivated these cells when she separated them from her arm.
Can we be certain they will not become active again?
She shut down the cohesive energy between them so it would be harder to figure out how she became immune to the disrupter.
Now, how do you know that?
Because that's what I would have done.
- Carter...
- Sir, I've got a lot of work to do.
We've never had the chance to study human-form replicator cells before.
If we learn something, this won't be a total loss.
This isn't your fault.
I'm not so sure about that.
Fifth came here because of me.
She rejected him because she was made like me.
Now we've got replicators in our galaxy immune to the only technology we have.
None of us anticipated the actions of the replicator.
I thought she was afraid of him, but she wanted to get rid of him so she could lead the replicators herself.
She killed him because he was weak.
Carter.
- She isn't you.
- O'Neill is correct.
Though she shared your memories, her personality was altered.
But the fact is, she learned betrayal from Fifth.
And he learned it from me.

The good old days
You lost me didn't you?
You won't be able to find me
You are alone now because I'm leaving you
We should
Let's break up lt's too difficult for me
Your father, your sister and Yoona all make difficult
We have hurt Soohyuk so much I have hurt so many people for my own happiness
Director Kim
How is the project going?
We have begun producing the clay model
When will we have the showcase?
We haven't yet made plans
- We are short of people
- Well then fill them up
Don't you realize everything is being delayed?
When did you get the rendering?
What have you been doing?
Please hurry up bye
Has Taeyoung come to work?
No, she hasn't
Okay
I will resign I told you before
That I would turn my back before you do that I would never see your back
I think it's time
If it's because of me you don't have to I can't give you up if I keep seeing you
I have never loved someone like this
Why did you love me?
I don't know I have loved you and it has made me worthless
A woman who can't be loved is worthless
That's why I'm quitting
Don't look at me like that
- How am I looking at you?
- Like you are in relief because I am leaving from you by my own will
You are wrong I was thinking that
you will someday find true love
I don't need your sympathy I mean it
There are not many people who can truly love lt's because they meet the wrong person
But I'm sure you will find someone who will truly love you
Don't make yourself miserable
is my resignation accepted?
Bye
is this our first time eating out?
It's all on me today
Taeyoung, of course it is on you
There isn't anyone who can pay for this except you
Why don't you make money then?
Me?
Are you talking to me?
You know I am saving money for 'Young boy' and 'Young Girl'
He's telling the truth I can't believe he's saving money
Why didn't you come to work?
Call me
What is it?
Nothing
Hey I'm going to Paris
What?
What are you saying?
Are you finally going to Paris with Mr. Han?
No, I'm going by myself
So did you break up with him?
is that why you drank that day?
Uncle, I really hope you become a great director
And Yangmi, I hope you meet someone soon
And Keon
You better study hard and grow healthy I don't understand you
What are you going to do there by yourself?
I'll finish my studies l'm going to be a writer I have so much to say you know
Taeyoung, I am so sorry for causing the troubles
Don't worry about the meal today I'll pay for this, okay?
Eat up You have to eat well you know
You don't have any money, uncle
Taeyoung, what are you talking about?
You know I've received commercial proposals from restaurants, optical stores, and bath houses
Whatever you say Just take care of my father's camera and no erotic movies
Don't ever lose it again, okay?
I'll take care of that Don't worry
- Where are you sending it?
- Paris, France
Hey but
Did Mr. Han say you could go?
He doesn't know that I'm leaving I am not saying goodbye to Soohyuk either
is Soohyuk still unable to remember?
- No
- Then you can't just leave
Don't you need to meet and tell them?
They are all in pain I have no other way
Here you go
Thank you
- Goodbye
- Goodbye
Call me or answer my call, please
Hello?
This is
Taeyoung Kang
Can we meet?
Give this to him for me, please
Don't ask anything and give this to him
Not today but tomorrow morning I ask you
Why does it have to be tomorrow?
I asked you not to ask me anything ls there a problem between you two?
You keep on asking
You'll give this to him, right?
You are going somewhere, are you?
And you're not telling him, right?
I am sorry to ask you
And I want to thank you for all your help
Stay well
Why isn't he picking up the phone
Taeyoung
Taeyoung Kang
She is unable to answer the phone please leave...
Why aren't you answering?
You haven't come to work and you aren't at home
Call me when you get this messege
Did I tell you this?
What?
I love you
I'm sorry Soohyuk for leaving you this way
but I really wish your memories come back
- Hey
- Yeah
What's that?
It's my son's baby clothes
He might remember if I show this to him
Do you still have them?
Of course I made it myself
A man asked me to give you this
And this, too
Mom I lied again
Will you take these and forgive me?
I was having to many dreams while I was sleeping
When I woke up I felt like pretending lt is very strange
After pretending I really began to forget them
And now I feel like going away
You know I'm always like that
So please forgive me
And thank you I'm glad that I have a brother
Why didn't you answer the phone?
I wasn't in the mood I'm sorry
- Did something happen?
- Well you know
Wait
- Hello
- Kijoo
- Yes
- Soohyuk has left
What?
But he is sick?
He was pretending
He remembers everything you and Taeyoung
Are you listening?
Did you hear me?
Okay, I'll call you later
What's wrong?
Nothing
Tell me what it is
Okay
Here
Taeyoung left
What?
She gave me this
She wanted me to give you this tomorrow lt felt starnge and found out about it
She reserved a flight to Paris
Hurry and go to the airport
Go get her
To Mr. Han who does not have many memories I recommend this camera to you
I hope you make great memories from now on
And I hope that I am always smiling in your memories
You'll of course be smiling in my memories
I was so excited when I had first left for Paris
But now I am scared because I don't know if I can live happily without you
Will Taeyoung be okay without Kijoo?
Did you know?
That from some time on we were both crying
That's what love is lt begins smiling but ends crying
I have learned that the more love there is the more tears I shed I don't regret
You have gave me a kind of love that I could have never dreamed of
I'm so happy to have loved someone like you
Now let's take a picture
This is only one of this in the world
And there is only one man in my life I love you I love you more than
I can ever say
We will inform you that the passengers reserved for the Air France flight to Paris must check-in for their flight
Taeyoung
Taeyoung
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Are you never going to see me again?
You are here
Your secretary has a big mouth
What is this?
Are you crazy?
You wouldn't let me go so I had to run away
is it my greed to be next to someone I love?
Soohyuk has left without a word
And now you're leaving What about me?
What are you talking about?
Soohyuk left?
That bastard left
He was pretending all along
Pretending?
What are you saying?
I don't understand
- Tell me
- Soohyuk remembered everything
He knew everything but was pretending he didn't
I don't believe you
Neither do I I can't believe that you are going to Paris
Do you have to go?
Can't you stay?
is it because you don't like me?
Can't you read?
I wrote everything
I know I know I was just asking
Will you let me go?
Okay
You can go
We are still in love, aren't we?
Can I say something silly?
I'm letting you go because I love you
Thank you
Thank you for not making me leave by myself
But don't hide out so well lt will be too hard to find
You have a good secretary
No, I'll look for you myself
Wherever you are I'll be sure to find you
Okay
Please find me I probably won't be lucky enough to be your maid again
but look for a woman who rides a bike near Notre Dame or the Sienne crashing all over the place and who is always yelling with a terrible accent
Be sure to come and check
Okay I will I won't be late to find you
Our piggie is lucky Gets to see Paris I'll feed everyday
Thinking about you
Don't let it starve
I'm not looking back
Okay, you don't have to
You said that I could be loved by someone
Maybe I could be I don't know if I can love him more than I love you
But I know that there should be more than one love
You look tired, father I really am today
And the house seems so empty
How about you?
Are you okay?
Yes I'm fine
And I hope you are fine I can't be fine with this burden in my mind
I have become weak
And I easily get scared
Especially my children
Kijoo and you
Kijoo
Knew
So did Soohyuk
I'm rather glad
And I hope they are, too lt's all my fault I have made you suffer
I have made you suffer, father
I'm sorry
He is your son now
Take good care of them both
Soohyuk will be fine wherever he is
You shouldn't hold on to him
And Kijoo will also do well like he always did
They are both strong just like their mother
Yes
They will both be fine
Ah
A...
Ah
I have
learned 2 things from
Taeyoung Kang
One is about how to love and the other is about how to part with someone you love
But I am not smart enough to remember both I only remember the first one
If If I get to see you again
I will only learn about how to love
Not anyone else but how to love Taeyoung

How do I look though?
Well you look good to me
But don't you have to look good to someone else?
Yes

that he misses me if that is love
Yes, I am
Good for you I felt sorry for leaving you alone
Are you finally leaving?
- Yes
- You know I sometimes think of when we first met but you look so much better now
I wish you luck
You can't just leave like this so suddenly I decided a long time ago lt's been 2 years
Don't I deserve a good rest?
- How long will you be there?
- 1 or 2 years?
What are you going to do there?
Well
Find my honey
Bye
Hey
This is what she would say Aja
It's been 2 years since I haven't seen him
My French improved and I got into a college I still can't pay my rent
And sometimes fall asleep while drunk
But if I meet him I can tell him that I have lived hard
In this samll city that Taeyoung is living in I have found myself a job and a small room I am able to make a few dishes I know what my shadow looks like and I've made good memories
I am working in a cafe like I used to and I still break their cups and they charge me a good amount every month
I spend my days changing tires and fixing engines I think that my life is rolling around nowadays I really want to see Taeyoung
I sometimes imagine myself running into Kijoo in the streets of Paris
And then I always ask myself
'Will we ever meet again?
'
Usually I eat my dinner alone watching the dusk of the Sienne
The twilight fills me up more than the sandwiches do lf l was with Taeyoung even just a sandwich would be a great meal
And I often come to this fountain and dream about meeting her here
Like this
Do you know I just made a wish?
for someone I could have my sandwiches with
If I hadn't worked in your house as a maid lf you hadn't
ruined Yangmi's cigarettes on the street of Pigalle
Do think we still might have met?
Probably
Could we really?
Maybe not then but we would have met somewhere else
Or we might have already met long long time ago
I just feel like it
Me, too
I feel that way, too
That day
Taeyoung arrived in Paris for the first time
Everything was strange but beautiful
But Taeyoung never knew that she would come to love the man
that was sitting behind her forever
Why is this here?
My god
Okay
Done
Cinderella exists!
Kijoo Han of GD Motors a happy ending with his fiancee, Taeyoung Kang in Paris
I'm so happy for them
Oh
The time
1401
Don't be mad
Well I kind of fixed them
You would still be able to see
But if you are still mad cut it from my pay
Help me find a true love just like in my screenplay
Aja
It's me.
Yes
Find another maid
That's why I'm asking you
Someone who doesn't break things
What?
Where?
Okay
Hello, here
The small ones are 2 and 3 bucks The big ones are 10 bucks
- We are late for the movie
- Wait buy one I could give you a discount
Okay I'm ready to start lt is so hot here
What?
Again?
I'm not being nice this time No way

Why didn't you tell me?
Where is he now?

I'm sorry but I have somewhere to go
I'll call you
Come with me, please
- What?
- He told me to get your resume
A resume?
For what?
He didn't tell me why
Maybe I should have told him about Soohyuk

A director can't be that rich
But how would I ever know that to be a president?
There are not many president around
Hello?

I don't know why He quit school long ago
He came to Paris and stayed with me for a while

Doesn't my honey talk about me?
My honey?
Excuse me but how do you know Taeyoung?

Why do you act like you are solo?
This is why I don't let her go out alone
- I am Taeyoung's boyfriend
- Huh?
- Oh Hi
- Yes Hi
Why are you doing this?
Why?
I really want to know why you are doing this
Why didn't leave what I asked you to?
Hey did you guys have dinner?
You shouldn't drink with empty stomach
Did you already drink?
Why is your face so warm?
Oh
- Hey are you okay?
- Yes
Why are you sweating?
Are you really okay?
Yes I am alright
The lights are too small
Really?
How about this?
Do you really know what you are doing?
It's out of balance
Not bad You're pretty good
But why isn't your auntie coming?
Don't worry One comes back when he gets hungry
You speak like an old man
She doesn't have a cell phone, does she?
She doesn't
This is really inconvenient
Where does her bus arrive?
Over there That's where she gets off
I'll be going now
Honey
I have my car with me Where are you going?
I'll see you again then
Taeyoung
We didn't finish talking
About what?
That you wanted to borrow some money Why didn't you ask me?
You probably won't pay me back but I'll still lend you
Tell me It's okay We're friends, aren't we?
Did you know that she needed money?
Why didn't you tell your boyfriend about it?
May I ask what your name is?
I'm Yoona Moon
Ok Miss Yoona Moon
You are a good friend
If you have nice clothes and necklace on then you should be nice as well
Don't you have better friends?
What?
Never meet this friend again
Do you want to listen to music?
Huh?
Okay
Wrong station
You like this kind of music?
Huh?
Well, it's not bad
You know about Soohyuk
Why?
Did you hear from him?
Oh, No No It's just that
He will be fine wherever he is So don't worry
I know
Why didn't you write your resume?
Why should I?
I was going to make a place for you
Or maybe introduce you to another company
That's why I didn't
You've already helped me a lot
You are mistaken
I am the one who has received your help
I'll give you more time to think about it
Thanks for driving me home Goodbye
Where is it?
We are almost there now It's not far from here
Can you go alone in dark?
Are you going to walk me home, If I can't?
If you want me to
Do you know what?
Girls often dream about this
Where she feels like a withered flower surrounded by all these fabulous people
And out of nowhere
This prince on a white horse
Calls my name, holds my shoulder
And gently touches her hair
And walk her home
But that is too perfect
I'll be going
I am really thankful for today
I really am
Let's have a talk
Taeyoung
If I have something curious Can I ask?
If I can't get it out of my head no matter how hard I try
I should ask you, shouldn't I?
Why?
What is it?
I saw you meeting my uncle
I told you that you are my only friend
And asked not to make me feel lonely
I thought this to myself as I was leaving Paris
I'm leaving for good
I'm going to Korea or wherever it is
Because someone is there
Because that someone is my everything
I know you like your uncle
But maybe you have a reason
For not calling him
Huh?
Don't worry I didn't say anything
I just had a request to make to him
It's a bit long to explain my father's camera was seized
Because of my uncle
That camera means so much to me
But they took away the memories of my family
Why didn't you tell me about it?
I was always next to you
Sorry
I wanted to take care of it quickly
I thought the best way to do it was asking your uncle
Why are you out?
You know the wind is nice
How strange?
You never did that before
Are you in love?
You are sitting like a withered flower surrounded by all these fabulous people
Then a man comes to you and holds your shoulder gently touches your hair
And walks you home
How would you feel?
Surprising for you to say
Does she want that kind of man?
No she says he's too perfect for her
It's an excuse She's just afraid because you're too nice
Really?
Were you like that when you were in love?
But he couldn't bring me home
Father didn't like him
Oh Soohyuk is in Korea
He arrived a few days ago
I'm looking hard for him I'm sorry
Just leave him
He'll be fine wherever he is
Then why do you wait for him every night?
Wow you're early
This is a lot
I still having trouble with time difference
All I need to do is sleep when it's dark and get up when it's bright but it's really tough
Director Kim left this for you
And said that you would know what it is
What is this anyway?
May I have some privacy?
Don't ask
Okay but I'll find out sooner or later
I talked with the team leader of the company magazine
Oh did you?
Good work
And I want you to take this to customer service
Do you manage customers yourself?
Are you really going to leave me?
Leaving a child alone can be considered as child abuse
Child abuse?
Why would I leave such a smart boy like you
Just go to the academy okay?
I can't quit school but I'll quit academy next week
No you won't
Hurry go
You can't even pay the rent
You little boy
This is for your academy and rent, okay?
Now go
Ok kiddo Be careful
Oh, Mr. Pres I mean
Hm
What are you doing here?
Why do you think I am here?
I came to see you
But where would be a good place to talk?
- Try this
- Oh
Why doesn't this open?
Why don't you get another one?
Hey this is really expensive
If it doesn't open I'm going to...
Wow you have strong fingers
Did you think about my offer?
You didn't even give me 24 hours to think about it
But I'm a very busy person
I found a position for you
So don't think hard and make up your mind
Are you giving me back my camera?
But there is a condition
Since you need to pay for 3 months payment
There'll be no salaries for 3 months, okay?
Make up your mind
About what happened in Nice
I rejected your offer
And if I accept this that'll make me a liar
But I'm really desperate right now
I really need money
So I'll accept it
But it's humiliating
Thank you for being honest
It's hard for a woman to admit it
- Good
- Oh
Yes, thank you
I'll work very hard Yes
Aja
When should I start working?
Today is Tuesday
Why don't you start next Monday?
You need to bring your resume and an inhabitant registration paper
Very simple
I have them ready as soon as possible
Okay
- No
- Oh okay Cheers
It has been refunded
Wait a second
- Huh?
- I am sorry
Just a minute
This ticket has gone through much
Okay you can take it now
You were not at the office Are you out?
Yes, I was recruiting someone
Must be a very talented person for the president to recruit personally
It is a woman?
Of course Where are you?
Somewhere nice it seems I can hear the music playing
Come to my studio I have a confession to make
What?
A confession?
Tell me right now
What is it?
You're making me nervous
Father is hurrying with your marriage
He's really pushing for it
What kind of confession is that?
How soon?
They have all decided
You and I are the only ones left
What?
What is this?
This makes no sense at all
I'm not going to this meeting Why should I?
Isn't this a marriage of convenience?
I'll follow your decision
Don't go if you do not wish
I never called you
So just pretend that you don't know
After you told me everything?
I'll take care of it You go ahead
I am so sorry about this
Well, young people are always busy
That's how we were
I truly understand
You do not have to be sorry
I am worried that maybe President Han might become ill
Of course 40 minutes is no big deal
This congressman here is always an hour late
I am sorry
So we meet again
This must be our fate
I would call it a coincidence
Have you already met?
Yes, father We meet frequently
Really?
Our families must have been destined
Have a seat
Since this is a gathering for us two
We will just go out
Hm
Kijoo
Let us go
I'll call you Mr. Moon
I'll call you father
What is he?
- I am sorry
- It's okay
Are you joking?
No I'm working
I'll tell my father about this
I really want you to do so
And go tell your mother too
And I can speak to you freely right?
You can't do this to me
My father said that we'll be engaged soon
You should not treat me like this
How old are you?
Why?
Have you ever longed for someone?
Or spend the night writing a love letter?
Have you ever been dumped?
Or think about someone overnight in your bed?
Why do you ask that?
Don't you want to really love someone?
And see what it feels like?
I've already married once You're too good for me
I don't know why you are saying that
I have never loved someone
But I'm planning to do so
I'll get dumped and write letters at night
If you leave me I'll long for you
Miss Taeyoung Kang is here
- Tell her to come in
- Yes, sir
- Come in
- Okay
Welcome
Okay
Here's my inhabitant registration paper and resume
Resume for what?
A job?
It's none of your business
- Let's go
- What?
Hey where are we going?
I didn't think you would come so fast
Why should I wait?
I am sorry for interrupting you
You are wondering why she was there, right?
Yes, I mean No No No
Not a bit
I am wondering why I have to be led here to the roof
I saved your butt She was about to punch you
You didn't have to
I have a stronger punch
I'll be going now since I have given you my papers
Goodbye then
I had this meeting for marriage
Meeting for marriage
Not a casual meeting but one for marriage
I don't care who you meet or marry
So don't get me between you two
I'll leave
Didn't you tell me that you're going to work hard?
I haven't started working yet
Did I ever ask him what he did?
I didn't even ask but he is telling me
Hey You surprised me
Boyfriend?
Honey?
Did you ask him to call you that the other night?
Move I am busy
You asked me for money
And asked him for a job
Isn't that pathetic?
Do you know that we're getting engaged?
I don't want any rumors
I don't either Would you let me go?
I am busy.
Okay?
I should have checked my fortune cookie
Nothing is working out for me
But why does it have to be her?
Isn't there a better woman?
Is it you, Keon?
Huh?
Cook me food
Food?
What food?
What do you want me to make with this?
I can't think of anything
I just bought it without any thought
- Just make me something
- No No
I have to think of something
Wait a minute
Spicy noodles?
But there are no mushrooms
Fish chowder?
But there's no fish
What should I make What do you like?
Anything my uncle likes
We are really similar with our taste for food and our taste for women
You scared me Don't do that again
Go away You could have just asked for it
Where were you during the day?
There was no one home
I found a job at your uncle's company
Really?
Good for you
Buy me dinner when you get your salary
Okay, Of course I will
But I can't
I don't get anything for 3 months
I'll buy you dinner after I pay for the debts
It looks like you are going to get an aunt
What do you mean?
Your uncle had this meeting for marriage
But she isn't so nice
And had too many surgeries
He'll be surprised when he sees his child
It's okay The kid can have surgery
Let's have pumpkin fries?
We have no eggs
I'll go get some
Wait
I want top quality eggs
Top quality Yes ma'am
That was fast
Where is director Kang?
Who are you?
Director, my ass!
Where is Pilbo?
He's not home What's going on?
I am Eunbi Jung
I invested in his film 6 months ago
But he hasn't had anything started
He made excuses and now he ran away
He didn't pay for my guarantees
What does that have to do with me?
Wait, I saw you in his office
Don't you know that I'm looking for him as well?
I really don't know
Don't lie
Where is Pilbo?
Hey stop it Stop
Where is he?
Please stop
I don't want to waste my time
If you see him you better tell him that I'm going to sue him
I don't care whether he has the money
It's all over now
He'll spend the rest of his life in jail
Okay?
Hmph
Whew
If he doesn't have money tell him to get lost Maybe you can work for him
Don't make my woman work for free ever again
But I think you're too ugly for an actress
- Let's go
Excuse me
Who, me?
You dropped something
You bastard
Hey!
Let go of me
I stayed quiet outside because my girlfriend might feel ashamed but Did you say ugly?
Take that back
Hey I'll kill you You little bastard
Do you want to die?
Let go
I'll kill you
Take it back Take it back
I won't
You know I was quite a fighter in school
They called me 'the killer'
You better run away
Hey you
Oh my god
Don't ever come back here
You are looking for Pilbo not Taeyoung
I'll sue you, too
I don't care
Oh, and my girlfriend is damn gorgeous
Okay?
Where did you go to buy your eggs?
Hey did you trip again?
You know my legs are so long they always get tangle up
How about the eggs?
Oh you know
I had left my wallet at home
No pumpkin fries then
Hey move I'll do it
You know what
Let's just go out for a drink
You're paying for it since you asked me to go
Okay Drink up
Wow
Why is an eel called eel?
Is it because it's an eel?
What about sea squirt?
What about saury?
Because it's a saury?
Very funny
Did you see those eggs back there?
Someone must have dropped them
They should have given it to us
Why do you look so sad when you smile
Do I look sad?
Then maybe I'll look happy when I am sad
That would be funny
Why are you so happy?
Because we have so much food
It's great
You know what
You must be very rich, too
- I'm not
- Yes you are
If the father is rich so is the son
It the uncle is rich so is the nephew
The whole family must be rich
Never have any debts
And have so many cars
I envy you
You are drunk
Are you sleeping?
Taeyoung
You know
I sold my ticket to Paris today
I can never go back
I'm really sad
This really reminds me of the wine we drank in Paris we were looking at the Sienne
Hey stop the drinking You've had a lot
Hey I'm going to drink all I want
You never listen to me
It's mostly dirty but
The corners are clean
Use it
Hey I have heard of this line before
You won't remember
Who remembers a man who lent a handkerchief to a woman who was crying on the road because her bike was broken
Hey, wait a minute
Was that you?
Really?
Was that why you always asked if I remembered?
What a coincidence
So you better not turn me down
Well, I'll see about that
Hey
I used to ride on my father's back
Can I?
No matter how sad
Hey, am I too heavy for you?
Yeah your head is as heavy as a rock
And your iron arms and legs
You also had five dishes of food
No No No
I am not getting off no matter what you say
I will not cry
- Taeyoung
- Yeah?
You are really pretty
Yeah I know
I am very pretty
I sometimes surprise myself
You know boss
If you stay an hour late
We have two stay two hours late
So
You sound like you missed a date because of me
I never have time for a date I have too much work
Wasn't she Congressman Moon's daughter?
Isn't she pretty?
Do you mean it?
She has pretty clothes on, doesn't she?
Hey, you really are a joker
Isn't this Taeyoung's camera?
I want to ask you something
Why are you so nice to her?
Am I?
Oh yeah
I never thought about it because
No one asked me that
But I'll think about it
Taeyoung
I'll sleep over tonight
I'll count to 3 and If you don't answer
I'll take it as a yes 1, 2, 3
Thanks
Hey I'll just live here
I'll count again 1, 2
Thanks
Huh?
Very funny
Are we meeting with the officials today?
Yes, 10 am at the meeting room
I'm not interested in shaking hands and having shallow conversations
I should just have a meal with them
Ask them where to have lunch
Okay
I believe you've never dined in the employee cafeteria
I thought this would be nice
Director Choi
You must eat here often
Yes in fact
It's a place where I can get to know the employees better
Is that so?
Let's enjoy our meal
Thanks for your help, Director Kim
I hope I didn't cause you any trouble
It was fine
Payments have been made and she shouldn't have any problems
I'm glad to hear that
Director Park, I heard good news that your daughter is getting married
Yes, she was getting too old
Late 20's is not old for marriage nowadays
Director Choi
Am I the only one to think that everyone looks very uncomfortable now?
Does someone here not know that I am the only son of the chairman?
Everyone looks as if they are having digesting problems
We should enjoy our meals
'The son is very stubborn'
'He looks very lazy'
'He's just a lucky man' You can say whatever you like
A humble president eating in the employee cafeteria
Isn't this too much of a hypocrisy?
I'm finished
You're just like 2 years ago
You really don't like Director Choi, do you?
Do you like him?
He looks like he's up to something
He's very good at faking
And staying at one place for a long time using that fake talent
He has everything that I despise
I don't think your father thinks as you do
I want you to research about Director Choi
Who he meets Where he invests.
What he does
As much as you can
Yes Sir
This really is
Wait wait
Where in the world is this?
How can I find my route in a place like this
Whew
Why don't you just throw it away?
It makes you look poor
Hey it's my son
Is Taeyoung home?
Don't tell her that I was here Okay?
I won't say it
She says you really are making many suffer
You know son the life of an artist is long and tough
Is she feeding you alright?
And you aren't sick?
My mind is sick
And I have bad dreams
Your mind is sick?
You are the only one that understands me, my son
Keon, I have something really precious to give you
If you need anything buy it with this and listen to what Taeyoung says
I'll be back soon.
Okay?
Hurry and put it in to your pockets
Hurry up
Hey you
I don't believe this
Why are you robbing a little boy?
An old man such as yourself
I know life is tough But don't do that
Go home
Dad
Buy food for yourself
Hunger is the toughest thing
So em
How is this?
I bought it just for you when I was coming back from Paris
How is it, Keon?
Isn't the mixture of the colors fantastic?
It makes me dizzy
So did you just let him go?
How should I have known that it was your uncle?
I didn't know who he was
Did he really look like he had no money?
And did he look ill?
Hey can you ask at least a little about me?
Do you think I came from somewhere close?
You know I came all the way from Paris
Yes I know
Why did you come all the way here from Paris?
Jacques that bastard
He's dating this blonde girl
He was saying all this stuff about orientalism and he just changed all of a sudden
Do you know how many cigarrettes I gave him for free?
If I knew this would happen
I would have asked that drummer guy's number
Did you receive your luggage?
Yes
And that drummer man
He's living here you know
What did you say?
Don't you know that I have a crush on him?
It's great though
We can just all live here together
Do you think my house is an orphanage?
Don't even think about it
Remember I let you stay at my place in Paris
Hey don't you have any beer here?
I am your guest
I knew it I just knew it
He looked very rich
Hey, but don't you think that man likes you?
I mean, why would he treat you that well?
From Paris all the way to Seoul
Bought you dinner, took you to a party now gave you a job
No it's not that
Why would he like me?
You may be wrong
He gave you a job which means that
He wants you to stay by his side
You like him, don't you?
No no
But when I heard that he had a marriage meeting
I felt kind of jealous
I don't know Maybe it's because I hate Yoona or maybe because I like him
So you like him then
By the way, when is the drummer guy coming?
I want to see him
Give me some money
Are you a thief?
You are about to shoot me
What do you want to buy?
Is it expensive?
Of course
A house so that I don't have to pay rent
I want to buy a car
I want to pay the debts for a woman I know
Who is this girl you are dating?
She must be keeping you out of the house
But grandfather hates me playing in the band
He'll want to make me work in his company
Okay.
Do whatever you want
But stay in touch, okay?
Let's go get a drink Where do you want to go?
How about listening to your performance?
Hey where did you find him?
What was he doing?
Is he going back home?
He came himself and I don't know what he did
- and he's not going back home
- Well, he should
Since you found out
He got so much better
Paris is a good place, huh?
Taeyoung I want to see you
Come to the bar we met before in 1 hour
I don't want to Why should I?
Didn't Kijoo get you that job?
I could cancel that you know
So you better come out
Bravo
Do you have any problems?
Your drums sound different
It's probably because it's been a while
Does mother know that I'm here?
I told her
She acts as if she does not care but
She is always waiting for you at night
Really?
She waits for me?
Of course
Hey, lsn't your girlfriend coming today?
What is he talking about?
A girlfriend?
I met Taeyoung by coincidence A lot of things happened
Oh
If you came to the company You should see Kijoo
Why come to me?
I came to see you today
Why?
Does he mistreat you?
Does he say he is busy?
No I can understand him being busy
So I was thinking
Could I work here?
We are going to marry soon and
It'll be great to be next to him
That is a good idea
So where do you want?
Well
Uncle, Suppose l'm in love with a girl
What would you do, If you don't like her?
What do you mean?
I like whoever you like
Uncle
You were always on my side
No matter what I do
You'll always be on my side, right?
Of course You don't need to worry
What have you been doing?
You look pale
What's the matter?
Nothing
You have to keep your word
Okay?
You have time to drink here and no time to see me?
No
You are being too honest
I am meeting someone here
May I join you guys?
Episode 16

Hello
Father, we're here
Hello.
Thank you for inviting us
Don't thank me I only invited you so that
You can realize where you really belong
Sit Sit down
Please speak casually
I will when I feel comfortable about you You don't need to worry
Okay
I didn't bring it from the car
I left something at the back of my car
- Could you bring it here, please
- Yes, sir
Are you nervous Or are you always careless?
I'm usually forgetful but I'm also nervous today
I didn't invite you because I wanted to meet you
It's part of the procedure and formality
We can't let you tell everyone that you weren't treated properly
I don't think that way at all
If you didn't invite me I would have come here to meet you
And I was glad that you invited me
If you frighten her before the meal
Would she be able to eat, grandfather?
Take your time until after dinner
Madam, here
Is dinner ready?
It's not ready yet
You can take it
We have a small family and we don't like traditional cookies
- Hey
- I didn't know that
I'll bring something else next time
Don't bring anything to this house
Do you think your taste would suit ours?
Let's go upstairs
Just a minute
I will help prepare for dinner
May I?
I'm a pretty good cook
Is the kitchen this way?
Excuse me
Mrs. Kim
Since when did we set our dinner table this way?
Take away the spoons and chopsticks
- I will do it
- Leave it
And Ms. Kang
In our house, we set spoons and chopsticks at the end
We wait until the end because they go into our mouth
I'm sorry I will remember that next time
Why do you remember that for?
This will be your last time here
Don't make things more difficult Stay out
Mrs. Kim, let me taste the soup
It tastes flat, put more salt in it
Don't bake the fish too long
And serve old and fresh Kimchi separately
Kijoo doesn't like old Kimchi
So many!

As long as we live together I'll have to face them
Soohyuk
I know it bothers you but please be patient
If I endure it
What's in return?
Let's talk about it next time
Dinner is ready
It's that room
No, it's not that
Then have a sit
OK
No offense but
Don't pretend to be a nice girl when you're insulted
Be yourself
Are you trying to help me, or inducing me to get scolded?
I know, you are trying to help me
The dinner is ready Let's go downstairs
Let's go
Yes
Kijoo showed up at the golf course
Really?
I will meet him, and
Find out about what Mr. Moon is hiding
It's better to find out as much as we can
This is really delicious
This is so hard to make how did you do it?
I tried this so many times but I failed
I saw a walk on the way here
Do you go out there often?
I think it will be good for your health to go out there often
Oh, Is father from North Korea?
There's even eggplant Kimchi
It's so hard to find them in Seoul
Father doesn't like to talk during meals
Uh, I'm sorry
Do as you please
There's no such a rule
Quiet
Mrs. Kim
- Yes Madam
- Bring a pair chopsticks
And who put this in here?
I put it there
Take it away, food should always look tasty
You don't have let us know how you grew up
Father
So when are you going to move?
Move?
I know you are living in a wreck
How long are you going to live like that?
Move to a place where it's more decent
I don't think I need to We aren't married yet
It doesn't matter Move out get a maid quit your job
Prepare yourself to be a good housewife
You will be able to get a decent place with that money
Excuse me?
What money?
Didn't your uncle tell you?
I sent some money through Mr. Choi for a new house and a car
Is it still not enough?
Do you want more?
I don't understand
You're misunderstood That's not true
You think I'm lying to you
Mr. Choi is here
I don't feel like eating anymore
Father, what are you talking about What money?
Mrs Kim clear the table I don't feel like eating either
How could you treat her this way?
Why did you invite her?
Carry on with your dinner Skipping meals don't do any good
But it can't be There must be an misunderstanding
Pres.
Han Nice to finally meet you
Uncle!
Taeyoung
How did you come here?
Why did you come?
Well, Taeyoung, I was on my way to work and Mr. Choi...
Did you receive money again?
Is that why you didn't come home?
Well, that's why I came here to return the money
You know, I couldn't sleep at all after I got the money
I should return it
So I came over here
Taeyoung
It's gone
Uncle!
What a family!
Father, what did you do?
Mr. Han.
I mean Kijoo it's...
I'm sorry father
I was mistaken
As you can see, we don't have the money right now
We cannot move to other place We can't return it
It's too much for me pay back but
I will pay back by living earnestly and
If you are going to give us money please give it to me directly
Then I will take it thankfully as a member of your family
This was the hardest dinner that I've ever had
I will be glad to come over again if you invite me
I will leave now
Uncle, let's leave
Taeyoung!
But we can't just leave
Pres.
Han, I'm sorry I'm sorry
Taeyoung!
Did you invite her for this?
You said you didn't want her to tell others that you mistreated her
What do you expect after this?
I'm moving out tomorrow
It's true, Taeyoung!
I'm sure that I put it in my front pocket
I used it only to pay back my debts
It's true, trust me
Uncle
It's not your fault
I'm sure Pres.
Han would have somehow made you receive the money
So that I feel ashamed
I am the one who's sorry
But why didn't you tell me?
Taeyoung
So are you coming back home?
How could I
I failed to lead my family and to be a good father
That's why you should return
Keon is waiting for you desperately
Keon
Is he really waiting for me?
Oh, I almost forgot I've got an urgent business
You go home first
I wanted to tell him goodbye
But he's taking off in a hurry
He's done a lot of things wrong
We shouldn't have come here today
Can I drive your car?
Slow down, hey!
Hit the breaks
Get off if you're scared
Slow down
This is life!
Shut up!
How was I today?
I even bought new clothes for today
I didn't get any compliments
I said you were pretty
If you are angry hit me, or bite me
You know, my uncle
He should have at least made one movie
If he ran with that much money
Don't hate my uncle so much
He's a good man
I understand him
If I had money I would have helped him
Although I'm not sure whether he has an artistic soul
My father is also a good man once you get to know him
Please understand him
I know
No one is born evil
It's the surroundings that make people bad
Are you interested in working?
What?
Be my house maid
House work...
Then what will you do for me?
I'm really expensive
Just tell me, anything is possible
You always say everything is possible
Is everything so easy for you?
Does it have to be difficult?
It's just a business Did you sleep during economics class?
I heard that from somewhere
But, are you really going to hire me?
Yeah, arrange a meeting at 10
How did the talk with the French?
- Yeah?
OK, I got it
- Where do I put this sofa?
On the left No no no on the right
- This way?
- No wait a minute
Mr. Han, where should I put the sofa?
There
Oh OK, to the left
That's good
And this
Mr. Han, Where should I hang this picture?
There
There, Oh there, OK
Where should I put this?
- What is this?
- It's a console
A console
Mr Han
Where should I put this console?
Put it next to the shoe rack
Put the cupboard in the back and the floor lamp on the right side
And the bed in the small room
Refrigerator in the bathroom
Put some tape over Taeyoung's mouth and make her stand here
No, wait wait wait a minute
So but the floor lamp should go to the front
The cupboard in the living room the bed in the bedroom
And the refrigerator should go into the kitchen, right?
I said that on purpose so that you will do it properly
Ma'am!
We have a meeting
Do you have good news?
You look good
Is it because of the ring?
It's bigger than the one he gave me
Is it proportional to love?
If it was to be measured that way
I would've never made this far Especially someone like me
Aren't they tough?
That family
Anyway, is it okay for you to work here?
I'm sure they'll be talking about it that you are still working at...
That family is blah blah
But I don't have anything for them to gossip with
Now, each of you tell us about your ideas
Let me start
How about having a preview with amnesties on indepedence day?
How's my idea?
I agree
Amnesties should have at least 3 convictions
We need to show our interest to prevent serial murders
What do you mean by 3 convictions?
Aren't the amnesties people who fought for our independence?
Forget it
In my opinion
How about giving tours to projection rooms?
You know for children
That sounds good
What about you, Taeyoung?
How about selling discount packages on Friday night?
Since people started to work 5 days a week
I agree
You agree with everything, don't you?
OK, bring me more specific plans
What about the free movie event for the handicapped?
How is that coming?
I agree
I've called the press and prepared the press materials already
Everything is set
It's for a pure cause Why do we have press materials?
Can they just come over and enjoy?
That's right
Collect the materials and cancel the press report
Let's end the meeting
Wouldn't be nice to be close to someone you like?
And also your enemies
If I give you a solution that would make us both happy
Would you buy me a drink?
I won't drink with you
Well, assassins never drink with their clients
Because it'd be too personal
Who's the assassin and who's the client?
Of course I am the client and you are the assassin
I don't kill You're the assassin
Then can I kill Taeyoung?
I never requested that
I never asked you to kill Kijoo, either
So take it easy
You've been giving me scary looks lately
I don't want Kijoo to be totally trashed
Anyway, it's Kijoo Han that you want
And I will let you have him
- Here is this month's company magazine
- Yeah?
The publications manager transferred to another department
So I had to finish the work
Good job
I will have to take the manager's post for a while
Well, do as you please
And I thought maybe
I could a staff to take my place
There is someone I want to work with
May I recommend her?
Who?
Taeyoung Kang
It's better to have an experienced worker
It'll be easy to work with her
Oh it's you Mr. Choi
Good to see you again
It must be hard Did you have dinner yet?
You come here everyday
Yes
Please report to Pres.
Han what I said
I got employed here as a house maid
Bye
And
This
Drink it
Don't skip your meals
Drink this while you wait
And while you're working
If you are too hot, or hungry feel free to come upstairs
It's air-conditioned
And
I bought little bit too much for two people
It's burning
- Burning?
What's burning?
- It's overflowing
Overflowing?
What?
Hey Mr. Han
Did you invite someone?
Well I kind of did
But I'm not sure if he's coming
Didn't you see a handsome guy on the way?
Who?
Who are you talking about?
Well men can't just resist my beauty
We have a big mirror here
Look at the mirror and check out yourself
You always talk about mirror
Did you leave the door open?
Is someone coming?
I'm sorry
For coming here without a notice Door was opened
Is this who you invited?
No
Isn't it rude to barge in like this?
Think it as an interview for the company magazine
The life of Mr. Han and Cinderella after their engagement
Do you still have your shoe?
Our female workers are very interested
Yes I still have them
Tell them that I have it glued on my foot
Why don't you come and write yourself?
Why don't you leave if you have nothing to talk about
Hello
Yes, sir
Yes, I will visit you tomorrow
Goodbye
Why does want to see you?
We should go together
No
I think he wants me to come alone
I will be fine
I just stopped by to say hello
You are so rude you never asked me to sit
I will come back next time
Goodbye, Taeyoung
OK Bye
- Pardon me?
- I said work here
Shouldn't work in such a public place where everyone can see you
And you told me that you know Seungkyung
Why are you working there?
Don't disgrace your man and his family
I'm not ashamed of my workl and I don't think I disgrace Kijoo's reputation
But I know that it's only my opinion
And I admit that you have a point
Just answer me You talk too much
You should watch your words
Yes
Then I will think about it
And decide after discussing with Kijoo
Kijoo might be uncomfortable with it
You just do what I say Leave now
Yes
Then I will leave now Goodbye
Soohyuk
Where are you going?
I just met your grandfather
It seems like you're making an excuse
You don't need to
You'll be his daughter in law It's normal
Bye
I'll be out in the afternoon for a while
I'm not going to answer the phone so don't call me
Are you the boss here?
Where are you going?
- What is it?
- I will tell you after I come back
It will be very interesting
Well my life already is interesting
I'm sure it is
Even just looking at your fiancee would be interesting
Hey
If you were having a conversation I will be back later
No, I was about to leave anyway
- I'll talk to you later
- OK
Did you see my father?
What did he say?
He told me to work again for the publications team
Really?
He must have a reason
My job at the theater must have bothered him
- I understand him
- Understand what?
Anything can be a reason
But
If I work here, I will be able to see your father more often
And we can work nights together
We'll be a company couple
It's OK with me What about you Mr. Han?
It's fine by me
OK?
Confirmed
We're the new company couple
I'll go now Keep working
- Work
- Okay
Clean up the house well
I'll cut your wages if it's dirty
Did I ever clean badly?
Bye
What's going on?
I was surprised you called
Does Kijoo treat you well?
Let's jump to the conclusion
Work for me
You can bring me something informative
And I'll pay you twice what you're getting now
How much is your salary?
The salary itself isn't that much
But he helps me in various ways
I am very liberal and flexible
Kijoo lacks them He always so stuck up
And I was surprised that you had a 450 dollar club
Aren't you the head secretary?
So what do I get besides the money?
Are you kidding me?
I'm paying you twice as much
Do you think I'll bring just some little information?
I've worked with Kijoo for years
I know this company
And I heard you are developing a new car
I'm selling information to a competitor
Don't I deserve more for taking that risk?
Are you rejecting my offer or just bluffing?
Think as you like
And how can you call me to a chinese restaurant?
You should get a vip room at a nice club Then I might give it a thought
Yes, hold on please
It's Soohyuk Yoon He said you'd know
Yeah it's me What's up?
I want to meet you
Then let's talk when we meet
Yes, I will see you there
Are you busy?
No, why?
How about a drink after work?
Maybe next time, I already have an appointment
How long has our boss gone for this meeting?
It's almost finished
I told you it'll just be two of us
I don't think so
Among the designs presented by Team A and B
These are the final drafts
Yes, it was worth the wait
This will be our final selection
Director Kim, report this to Pres.
Han
- and get started with the clay model
- Yes
Did you get a call from Daehan Bank?
They said it is still under evaluation
It seems like J Motors is putting their hands on it
We don't need to call them first, do we?
Well it's easier for me but...
Yes, it's easier for you
And what were you going to say after that?
- It's nothing
- Okay then let's end the meeting
I was just wondering
Which one was selected?
Yours
Did you change your mind?
I thought you hated sedans
What can I do?
I have to please my boss
What about funds?
You always said that all ideas need financial supports
Well, I'm glad you changed your mind
But that is beyond your authority
Hello
Hi Soohyuk
You are always busy
There are so many things
You know Junghak?
I met Junghak
Did you finally get recruited?
Or did he give you money to poison me?
Well it's not the poison
He offered to double my salary but I rejected.
I wanted more
Double your salary?
What more do you want?
I must get going I have an important appointment
Bye uncle
Keep your eyes on Director Choi again
Why?
Did Soohyuk tell you something?
Soohyuk?
What does Soohyuk have to do with Director Choi?
Nothing I was mistaken
Don't worry about Director Choi
And if you still have the disk of restricted documents
Please return it
Oh, I left it at home I will return it tomorrow
Okay
- Have a drink
- I'm driving
Your attitude is just like that of Kijoo
So why did you want to see me?
I heard you met my uncle in the golf course
I'll be darned
You don't need to remind me of it I've having trouble raising funds lately
I was almost there But then Kijoo came and ruined it
You better not talk about that
Do you want my help?
Did Kijoo send you?
To make fun of me?
What a great family plan you have?
If I raise the fund
Your won't have any problem with the new car development, right?
Are you kidding me?
How will you help me?
How will you raise the fund?
You can't even eat with your own hands if Kijoo doesn't help you
If you are not going to drink Get lost
You're ruining my night
Daehan Bank will choose J Motors
Hey!
They will call you tomorrow
What are you doing?
Let's say you are saying the truth
Why are you doing this?
What do you want?
You don't have to know why But there is a condition
That J Motors will raise enough fund and release the new car earlier than GD Motors
I'm leaving
Wait
I'm not sure why you are doing this but
I think you are on my side
While you are at it can you help some more?
I heard they just selected the final design
We're having problems
I think one CD will do
I haven't crashed to that far yet
But I will give it a thought
It's always difficult at first but it gets easier later on
It's funny
This is Soohyuk
I need you to Meet the president of Daehan Bank
This is the first time I'm asking you I'm very disappointed
If it's beyond your power you should ask the ministers
Do whatever you can
No
I received some useful information about you from Director Choi
You understand
No politicians are clean these days
Thank you for your help
Would you come home early?
Your grandfather is...
What are you doing?
Let me stay like this for a while
I'm too tired
Maybe I talked too much
I feel empty inside
Did you eat dinner?
I will make you some food
Just for 5 minutes
No, 10 minutes
Mom
Why did you hate me so much?
Why
Why did you only like uncle?
No one in this world can split their love
You have only one heart
And you gave all to uncle
Why not me?
What's wrong?
What are you doing here?
I left something
It won't take long
Mom
Don't regret later
It's your fault as well
How does it feel to live alone?
You thought you had an appointment
Aren't you curious who I met?
There aren't many people I know in Seoul
Is it something that I should know?
Well
Uncle, aren't you going to invite me?
You don't need an invitation You're always welcome
Okay, I will stop by
Oh, does Taeyoung come often?
I saw a movie
I started thinking that my life is just like a movie
Before I met you, it was like a mystery, action, thriller type of life
There were incidents after incidents
And so many failures
What about now?
Now it's like a drama, a romance
And of course you are the main character in my life
Actually I think it must be a horror then
Just kidding
When the ending credits go up
I'd want to see your name right next to mine
I will leave now Mr. Han
Good night
Keon, where's your dad and Yangmi?
I'm going to see them now
You are going to see them?
Yes, they are helping with the local development or something
We will see once we get there
What?
local development?
Where are you going?
Cut!
Cut!
Don't you see?
Yangmi!
Express your feeling!
I am so full and my teeth hurt
And my clothes are all smelly What a mess
This is so hard Gosh!
Gosh?
What did I tell you?
When you eat beef-ribs
Don't nibble like that
Look!
You hold this and
Take a bite deliciously
That's what I did
I should have known this earlier when you said you'd buy me ribs
How stupid of me
How much do I have to eat I'm so full
Will it really help if this commercial goes on the cable?
Of course it will, Sir
You know this place will be full of customers
All you need to do is just wait
And I'm trying my best to make a great commercial
Trust me and let's do it again One more time, OK?
OK Stand by

Scene number 3, one three
Action!
It's so greasy
It was so greasy It was disgusting
It's cool
Dad!
You were so cool today
Me too, uncle
You were kind of cool today
Is it tough?
Well, not much
From now on, with this korean restaurant
I will try to work with bath house and optician
To show my mise en scene
Or my artistic world, they're too short
Oh by the way Did Pres.
Han say anything?
I'm sorry for to put you in such trouble
Don't worry about it It's all settled
Uncle, I hope you're always like how you were today
I got you
Yangmi, let's go
We still have some time I'm night shift.
What about you?
Me?
I'm off today I'm quitting tomorrow
- Quit?
- Tomorrow?
Why?
I'm returning to GD Motors
Was it your decision?
Yes, Pres.
Han proposed But I made the decision
I know that
Pres.
Han didn't propose that on a good intention
But I thought that this could be a chance to get recognized by him
Yes, I didn't have good intentions either when I hired you
But now I recognize that you are a very good woman
Although it did make me jealous
Thank you for your help
Take care
Okay
Come and visit us
And try to convince Han's sister I think you're capable of it
Why are you quitting?
That means I have to quit
Hello ma'am
Hey!
Did you already tell them?
Thank you for your help, supervisor
You never said anything
If I knew it earlier, I would have at least bought you lunch
Thank you, I will visit
Hyunwook, Take care
And please take care of Yangmi
Why are you asking him to take care of me?
Well in fact my standards are very high especially with women
I only like the hottest girls
But if you insist
- We will live happily
- What are you doing?
I will come see you guys
Today, I want to leave as if I'm just calling it a day
I'm not good at saying goodbyes because I slept at the end of classes
- I'm leaving now, Aja!
- Aja!
- Aja
- Aja
Hello
Isn't this so pretty?
It also has a great scent
Have a seat
Okay
Is this your way?
Sorry?
of winning an approval?
By torturing and exhausting your opponents and make them give up?
That's not what it is
I thought maybe
If I visit you often and talk to you you might be able to like at least one
- or two things about me
- Do you want the truth?
Let me tell you something
If Kijoo likes someone
I would approve without a doubt
Why do you think I rejected you?
What about Soohyuk?
I first heard about you from Soohyuk Kijoo told me much later
Soohyuk showed up after 4 years with a happy smile telling me 'mom I'm seeing someone'
I don't know how you are going to take this
But I do like Soohyuk a lot
But I never thought of him to more than a friend
Soohyuk is just a nephew and I am her aunt-to-be That's all
Soohyuk also knows that
I've got an appointment Please take the flowers with you
After I get plenty of rest in peace
I will challenge myself again Ok, aja I can do it, aja!
Excuse me
- I want to ask you a question
- Sure
I had trouble finding a few books
'How to win parents-in-law's hearts'
'Successful marriages despite objection'
'How to become a daughter-in-law of a wealthy family'
We don't have any of them
I know
I will write them later
I need a bag for these books
How does the industry react to our new project?
Well, there is a..
Why?
Is there a problem?
People are saying that Daehan Bank has turned its back
- to J Motors
- There are always rumors
Yeah
What?
What happened?
Tell me in details
Daehan Bank and J Motors have officially signed a contract
I don't understand at all
- When?
- This morning
Where's Director Choi?
What was he doing?
Go find him Bring him here
Director Choi is here
Director Choi What's your job?
What have you been doing until now?
I think we should find another bank
Are you out of your mind?
If our main bank doesn't lend us
Who would?
That's something I wanted to ask you
What?
I heard that you were harsh at the golf course
Your behavior worked against us
You are not eveyone's boss
And they don't get intimidated by your blank shots
You were the one who caused this mess
Get an appointment with the presidisent of the bank
Right now
Yes
So this is your first win
Congratulations
I will take care of the rest
I never saw that look on his face a desperate and anxious look That's sad
So is that it?
Yes
Is that the only reason?
Yes, I only handled it according to the principles
That the bank prefers J Motors because the mortgage is more secure
This is very strange
And you only mention the principles
Except mortgages
GD Motors is rated higher in all other categories including credit rating financial statements, development status customer recognition, and market share
So are you saying that you are turning your back on us just because of mortgages
I only handled it according to the principles
I've got nothing else to say
There's something wrong
Did Junghak say anything else?
It was just a coarse trick
He wanted materials on our project
Should I meet him again?
No, you don't need to
There's an internal leakage
I'm sure But who?
Is it Director Choi?
He always confronts with you and he is capable of it
Would you do it when people are already suspicious of you?
You have a point
Stretch out your search including Director Choi
Let's go in
Wait a minute
When will you let me in?
Come in.
Come in
Kijoo is not here yet
That's good I came to see you
It was very hot Do you want something cold?
I want to talk first
OK, we can talk while we drink
What do you want?
I make good iced coffee
If you don't want iced coffee How about lemonade?
OK, that'd be better Just a second
Soohyuk
Why are you ignoring me?
I said we talk first
What are you doing?
Move!
I won't move
I'll never move away from anyone from now on
Especially in front of uncle
Soohyuk
I'll take you I'll take you from him
And I'll never let you go
Episode 7
Let's sit down and talk about what is so humiliating and why you're so upset
My privacy?
My pride?
That's not the big problem
What's the bigger issue?
His father found out about it
What if something happens to Kijoo because of me?
He might get into trouble for helping me lt's all my fault He doesn't deserve it
- lt doesn't
- Taeyoung
What?
Don't you see me?
Don't you?
Did you think about how I would feel?
The girl I love cries before me
And I can't do anything for her
How would I have felt asking another man to help you?
What do you mean?
Don't understand?
No
You are in here
I don't know who is in your heart
But you are in here
I don't know who you are thinking about but I only think of you
You should know that
Because I plan on staying this way
There's one more thing
I really like you
And I hope you like me
I need to go meet someone Sorry I can't take you home
Be careful

He can't be clean
OK
Pres.

I'm finished
Why?
Do you have something to tell me?
No I will leave now
You look perfectly normal
And I know you get plenty of sleep
Why was he so worried about you?
What are you trying to say?
I heard you were flirting with him in front of the elevator this morning
They are all talking about it
What exactly do I need to do to flirt with someone?
Tell me I should try sometime
Taeyoung
Yes, that's me Here

Wasn't it just few days ago when you were hiding away from grandfather?
I've decided not since last night I've changed my attitude toward life because of someone
You said you were busy but Do you have time to meet my uncle?
No, no that's not the truth
What?
What did you change?
I told her to come I had something to tell her
You said you had an appointment was that with Soohyuk?
Well lt wasn't really an appointment I asked her to meet me because the weather is so nice
She rejected me And here she is
- Why are you dissing me?

You're not here to see me but her?
Why would I not see you?
Ladies go first That's why
Anyway, let's have lunch together I shall escort the lady

Would you like to order?
Here's your water here
Ah, well l would like to have Korean beef soup, please
Three pastas, please
Didn't you hear her?
She wants the beef soup
No one haves the beef soup here
They make great pastas Trust me
The same thing happened when we went to
Moulin Rouge in Paris, remember?
It's not the same I've changed I told you, I've changed my attitude toward life since yesterday
What are you saying?
I'll take what I want Say what I want to say
And I'll stop hurting myself from now on
Don't I don't want you to change
I like how you are
Just like when I first saw you in Paris
Wow, I still cannot understand what you're saying lt's OK whatever you do with your life a man sometimes needs a change lt's OK
He must have been very lonely l never expected him to barge in like this
By the way, didn't Soohyuk act strangely today?
Wh...
What?
I'm not sure
How did you meet Soohyuk in Paris?
I, I cannot tell you
Yeah?
Then don't
OK, OK I'll tell you
To be honest
You know the pink dress that you bought me I sold it
I'm sorry I almost got swindled when I was selling it
Soohyuk helped me out to sell it for a good price I'm really sorry
Um, no you don't have to be sorry lt was yours
Even if you gave it back to me
What would I do with it?
But, about Soohyuk
What is his reason for not returning home?
Well, I don't know he's hard to understand including today
By the way, how's your work?
It's hard Thanks to your future bride
Anyway, are you really going to engage with her?
Why?
If I do Will you come?
I will go if steaks are served l won't if beef soup is served
I think noodles will be served
I think, they met in Paris I sent him there to work lt doesn't bother me, but I'm afraid it will tarnish Kijoo's image
There're already bad rumours spreading in the company
Sir, it's not very comfortable working in the same office with her
You should've told me I was hoping to have dinner with you
Don't make plans then I'll give you a call
Oh, I made an appointment with your father to play golf

What's going on?
Well, I'll find it out when I get there
Drink this coffee
Here's your coffee...

Hey!
I'll ask you something
You
- Are you going to eat the eggs?
- No

Ah, could you leave us for a moment?
Pardon?

Sir, I'll leave for a moment
Why are you fawning over Mr. Moon?
I'm not
Mr. Moon's daughter is a great match for you
What are you trying to get out of this marriage?
Eat Your food is getting cold
Oh, I heard that
You gave a job to a woman
Director Kim told me that you even paid for her debts
And that even our head lawyer went to the police station because of her uncle
Why am I hearing so many things about her?
Get her out of there lf you don't I will do it lf l do it, she will be hurt badly
As you already know I handle things my way
- Father
- How much money does she want from you?
Enough for a car?
Enough for a house?
It's not what you think Don't do that I don't care what it is I'll do it my way
Don't do it lt's me, get me Director Ahn
You're fired I don't want to hear it
How can you employ such a girl?
How can you employ someone who is unqualified?
Don't blame it on Han
Aren't you the director of personnel management?
You're fired Go home
I got the keys
Your father left
He told us to have a good time I know I am childish
Do you?
There's nothing I can do I know what you'd think of me but this is all I can do
I don't care what you do Move I can be worse
Who do you think will get hurt?
If you don't want Taeyoung hurt and make me a bad person
Get over with her I'm saying this as Taeyoung's friend
Ah, what a touching friendship
Anyway, move
Kijoo!
Don't you understand Korean?
Hand
Give me your hands
Why do you want to see my hands?
More than just a movie
Our CSV, Korea's largest multiplex cinema requires that every personnel wash their hands and wear hairnets
Let me see
Oh my god, oh my god
What is this?
Get them off
Wow, You speak English very well
Don't people say that you are weird?
What did you say?
Miss Choi!
Let's talk about it next time
Hello, are you here to see...
Excuse me, do you remember me?
Ah, yeah
Yes, I do remember
But why are you here?
I work here now
By the way, do you come here often?
Sometimes
Well, good to see you
Oops, do you know Mr. Han?
How do you know him?
Are we friends?
- What?
- Watch your words
So tell me
Don't people think that you're a weirdo?
Miss Choi!
Uh?
There goes an actor
Uh, where?
Do you know where Ms. Baek's office is?
It's a parcel from Manhattan
Manhattan?
Ah
Manhattan!
Give it to me I will give it to her
- l need your sign
- Sure ln English?
Did the sun rise from the west today?
Um?
The sun always rises from the east
Do you want a glass of wine?
No lf you want to be alone I will leave
No
Should I leave you alone?
What was the worst thing when we lived together?
That was fast
You didn't ask that even when we were divorcing
Did you ever cry while we were living together?
Are you seeing someone?
Seeing someone?
How do you do that?
Having meals together
Taking her home
Trying to help her even whenever she's in trouble
Trying not to hurt her feelings lf that's what it is Yes I am
You are so bad
That was exactly what I needed
Who is she?
Hey, why are you making a mess?
It's already clean I have to open soon
Summer days are long l will finish it up quickly I'm trying to help, you know
Hey, lf you are angry get some drink
Cleaning won't help
What're you doing?
Are you out of business?
I just wanted to some cleaning
Cleaning?
What's up with your clothes?
Living away from home is like this
Aren't you supposed to be busy?
Why are you out so often lately?
Why don't you get a hotel room and stop bothering Jonggeun?
Ah, that sounds good I don't have any money so book a room for me for about a month
Hey what's wrong with you?
You said you were going to change lt must be true ls something going on with you?
Did you think I was kidding?
A person changes when something happens lt must be something really big
Tell me what it is
No I have secrets
Help me move my stuff in a few days
Aren't they here?
- They're somewhere else
- Where?
Hey Soohyuk, you...
What, what're you doing here?
Were you two meeting here?
No, I was just passing by I was on my way home
I'll leave you alone lt wasn't really important
See you later
Hey , Taeyoung!
Ah, since you are already here
Uncle!
Shall we go somewhere?
The three of us
There's a place I want to go
Yeah?
OK, I will take a day off
Where do you want to go?
Why haven't you changed yet?
Hey, do I have to wear this?
I don't even know who wore it before
Then, are you going to enter like that?
Hurry up
Nobody got killed from wearing this
Hey, what kind of detergent do they use with this?
Oh, do you want me to undress you?
I'm sure this used to be white right?
Uncle!
Stay here I'll go find Taeyoung
OK, hurry
- Uh, you were here
- Uh
You need to wear that on your ankle
Yeah?
This?
Ah yes, ankle?
Yeah OK here
OK?
Everyone is wearing them on their ankles
Yes, you look good where's Soohyuk?
Here I am
Shall we enjoy the sauna?
Ah that sounds great Where's the hottest one?
But...
Do you have to wrap this towel around your head?
- Ah
- Whew
Ah, this is the perfect time to eat an egg
Right?
It's not very expensive
How can I go outside looking like this?
What?
What are you talking about?
A food stand is right there
It's his first time
Ah, it took an hour to make him wear that I can imagine
By any chance, do I make you uncomfortable?
Hey, even if I do, at least smile when our eyes meet
Does uncle bother you?
Don't mind him I won't mind him, either I'm trying
Anyway, this is really fun the three of us together
Hey, were you hungry?
You wanted eggs
Why did you buy so many?
What're you saying?
Who's going to eat all this?
Why didn't you buy just three?
There are three of us
- Can I buy them separately?
- My goodness
Hey this...
What do you want me to do?
Ah I see
- One more?
- No no
Then have the eggs I'm taking a nap
I'm watching a movie
- Scoot over
- What the heck?
This was my place
Get her out of there lf you don't do it, I will if I do it, she will be hurt badly
As you already know I handle things my way
'Make room for my honey' ls that what you wanted to say?
I can't do that anywhere
True, true
Did your father say anything?
For having lunch with anyone
Does it bother you?
A little
But what I said in front of your father was true I'll really really work hard I'll work hard and pay back all the debts
And get my camera back
And thank you for
Not ignoring me but introducing me at the lobby
So hot
Uh, I'll take the subway
Ah, why?
I'll take you home
No uncle, go with me We're going the same way
No no, I really have to say no I like the subways
Bye Thanks for the eggs
Uncle, Do you know why I asked to come here?
Well, I was actually curious
You seem to have something on your mind but you're holding it
Actually, I had some trouble with Taeyoung I didn't have the courage to see her by myself
It's nice being all together I don't have to be curious about what you're doing with her
Were you curious?
I was also curious when you were with mom I wondered what you two were talking about
I also wondered how mom treated you
Good morning
Yeah
What're you looking at so seriously?
Ah, it's strange Director Ahn is retiring
Retirement:
Personnel Management Director Youngsoo Ahn
This can't be true He still has so many years
Hurry up The meeting is about to start
Yeah
If everyone's here Get started
What's the most urgent agenda?
Lack of a talented designer is the most urgent
Our competitors aire also developing new models but they usually adopt foreign designs
Did you think about headhunting?
That's good way but
Mr Han, give us your opinion lt's not just the problem of the design
Raising funds for the development for this project is more urgent I gave this task to Director Choi
You haven't yet answered me lt's still under consideration
How long are you going to consider it?
I gave you the proposal long ago What were you doing?
The proposal itself has some faults I don't think it's appropriate to go on a project that may take years to complete
Quiet!
Stop it
How would you get fundings if it has faults?
Brush up the proposal and we'll have another meeting
That's it for today
Director Choi lf you are not busy, see me in the afternoon
Hello, I'm Taeyoung Kang from the Publications l'd like to ask you few questions about bad debtor cases I don't work here
Oh, sorry
Excuse me Do you remember me?
Ah, you again
Ah!
Hello ma'am I apologize for not recognizing Mr. Han I'm so sorry
Ah, yes, it's OK
Well, you can't just forget about it
Today, I came here for an official purpose
Yes, I know I took care of the allotment so don't worry lt's completely paid
What?
Paid?
Um, I returned the camera to Mr. Han
Didn't you get it from him?
I heard you are an excellent Baduk player
You don't seem to have interest in trap shooting I didn't have the chance I was too busy
Did you finish your military obligation?
I was discharged when you just finished toddling
Really?
I thought you had something to tell me
My army base was in Yang-Gu
My shooting instructor once said
'Your left hand only helps' I think 2 years gap was too much I've just started to see how the company is running
For the past 2 years, over 10% of our company shares drifted into your pocket
is there anything wrong with me buying stocks?
What's wrong with that?
Ah, there's nothing wrong with that
The only problem is that you have 5% of our stock in another account with a different name
Well, I can tolerate that, but I heard that you go around and ask other stock holders to alienate their stocks
Director Choi, it is the right hand that pulls the trigger
Left hand only helps I'm the one who pulls the trigger in our company, not my father
You've got the wrong hand lf you stop now I'll let you go this time
I only fire one blank shot I fired that today so next time it will be a live shell
- How did I look?
- What do you mean?
I was imitating Al Pacino Did he look nervous?
Didn't you see his face getting pale?
Ah, when did you learn to shoot so well?
In the arcade, when I was in high school
Give me a minute if your are finished with your business
How did you find me?
I asked your secretary lt was so hard to find you
How could you do that?
I'm calling it a day Get a hotel room
Soohyuk's going to stay there Get one near my fitness center I want to see him on the way
Yes I will
Let's go, I got something to tell you, too
OK
I just stopped by to say hello
Kijoo came back with a lot of confidence
Does your company call your boss by the name?
Of course it doesn't
Leave Kijoo alone
Don't help him, Don't hurt him
You mean leave him alone lt doesn't last forever
How long do you think my father would be there for you?
Don't come here ever again
When did you come?
- Get out
- Long time no see I thought you were studying in the States
Did you hear me?
Get out
Get out of here
You must be feeling assured with a brother and a son
Don't get sick
You have misunderstood
Don't misunderstand me
How are you mom?
How have you been?
- Where are you staying?
- Don't meet Director Choi
- Why aren't you coming home?
- l don't like him I left your room just like before Come back
Mom, home makes me sick lt really does
I'm not interested in cars
And I don't have the courage to live like uncle
You know I'm still young
Can I just enjoy my life?
You're just like your father That's why I don't like you I'll regard that as yes
Ah mom, there's a girl I like
She's smiling outside but sad inside
Same as you right?
Different inside and outside
That's why I like her
How is she like?
She's a girl that looks pretty to me
Why did you bring me here?
You said you wanted to talk I come here once in a while when I want to be alone lt's quiet and nice
I figured it would be better to talk if it's quiet
Yes
What's with the camera and the complete payment of allotment?
I paid for it ls there a problem?
Are you kidding?
You deceived me
Yes I did I know you don't like it this way lt is so easy to settle if you have the money I'm like my father lt's not because you resemble your father lt is because you think that way
If it bothers you that much you can earn and pay back
You are so bad
Women always tell me that I am bad
Because you don't consider other people's feelings
You make them angry before they can thank you I cannot thank you because I am angry
Do it one by one, get angry first And thank me later I'm already angry
I will earn the money and pay back Don't reject it I'll leave now, bye
Let's have a drink
Have a drink with me
Just as friends
I saw this movie there's a wine called 'the wine of forgetfulness'
If you drink it it erases your memory I poured it in here
No, you drink it first
OK
Who are you?
I really don't remember
Uh, then
You won't remember me being angry earlier
Were you angry?
No, no I was not angry l thanked you for getting my camera back
What camera?
You really don't remember?
You know
This is our first time having a drink together
Phew, you just said you don't remember anything
Did you just call me by my first name?
Why, don't you like it?
No, no lt's just feels weird
Ah, usually, you called me by my last name or 'hey' I don't have to call you by your last name anymore
Huh, do you treat your employees this way?
I always called Mr. inside the company
You don't have to call me that anymore
- Yeah?
- l want you to stop working
You are getting fired right now
Do you understand me?
You are fired

Excuse me Mrs.
Take care of your child You don't want to lose her, do you?
You are mistaken
- I'm not her mother
- Mommy Mommy
Sweety, where is your mommy?
Hey sweety Where is your mommy?
Sweety!
I said I wasn't coming Why are you waiting for me?
I figured you'd come
I lost an important contract and you ruined it I don't know what you were selling out there
I never pressured you
I know you didn't
But you just needed my help
My help
I'm thirsty
My legs are aching
Did you come to Korea because of the incident in Nice?
If you're asking if it hurt me The answer is yes
But that's not why I came back to Korea
Why did you want to see me?
To jump to the conclusion
I want to repay for the help that you gave me
The contract worked out well thanks to you
I'll give you the necklace like a promise
And if you want anything else let me know
You said you sell cars
How many did you sell?
Did you sell around 50?
More
Then maybe about 100?
No, More than that
Wow You must have made a lot of money
So you want to pay me back in cash?
I always pay people back
And I also have a promise to keep
Don't you think an apology should come first?
I thought you wanted to see me because you wanted to make an apology
Isn't paying back another way of making an apology?
Look, Mr. Kijoo Han
If you're sorry Just say it
If you want to thank someone Just tell them
Stop playing with your words
Fix it
You can't apologize without feeling sorry
Whew
I'm leaving
I'm sorry
I went to see you on the day I was coming back to Korea
I think I wanted to tell you something
Maybe I wanted to tell you that I'm sorry
I am sorry
And thanks for coming today
Okay
Thank you for your apology
And thank you for your thanks
Whew
Is my apology accepted?
Yes
I am leaving for Paris in a few days
This'll be our last meeting
Goodbye
- Oh my god
- Oh, no

- Are you okay, honey?
I am very sorry
What are you thinking?
Honey, are you okay?
Look at my dress

I am so sorry I'll pay for the laundry
Mrs. don't you see the dress?
That won't solve this problem
Look at this dress
What is this, huh?
Darn
What am I going to do?
Hey Mr.
Don't you realize you're scaring my honey?
Hey, don't you see this dress?
You can buy another one for your honey

Why are you looking so scared?
Come on, tell me
- He's my boss
- Really?
Are you getting fired?
No
He gave me a vacation
And he's giving me money to buy you a new dress
What did you tell him?
You told me to apologize if when I'm sorry so I told him
Oh, okay Thanks
No problem
What is that you always keep in your arms?
Is it your lunch?
Do you go to elementary school?
No no, It belongs to my cousin
He's kind of busy you know
Did you get used to the time difference?
Yes I'm okay
I sleep when it's dark and wake up when It's bright
Why did you come to Seoul?
Because of my father's sacrificial day
He passed away a year from yesterday
He was a film director
He visted Paris for a week when he was young
And he always told me stories as if he had lived there for 10 years
And he always said at the end that
I would understand once I visit Paris
That's why I went there
Isn't that funny?
My bus arrives over there
Oh I'll drive you home
It's okay
I'll just take the bus It suits me better
So, are we never meeting again?
No
Aren't you glad?
What?
Not seeing you again?
No. because we are not parting badly
I want to thank you
Including everything at Paris
You let me do things I could never have done
It was great
We'll never meet again but I might think of you in Paris
Oh okay
You take care and fix your amnesia
Until you find a man who can take care of you
Okay
Goodbye
We had more good memories than the bad ones
But I'll never see him anymore
Don't you realize you're scaring my honey?
Hahaha, my honey
That was really funny Whew
I am sitting here thinking about him like a fool
- Give it to me
- Keon
Give me the camera
Who are you?
What are you doing?
Why are you taking this?
Do you know Pilbo Kang?
I'm taking this because he didn't pay his car allotment
Allotment?
Then just take his car
Why are you taking my father's camera?
We want to take the car
But he disappeared with the car Move out of the way
No I won't You can't take this
This has nothing to do with him
This is my father's camera
We don't care about that Take it when you get the money
Stop Give it back
- Give me the camera
- Wait
Keon, Just stay here Wait Wait
Sir!
Sir!
Sir!
Hey, You can't just take things this is robbery
Miss, We are handling this legally
If you want it, bring the money
Wait!
If I bring the money I get it back right?
Are you sure this isn't illegal?
Yes
Get out of the way We are busy
Wait
If you make one scratch on that camera You'll really get it
I'll bring you the money Keep it in good shape
Hey miss, that's enough
If you break it I'll really get you
I swear I will
I really will get you for it
The phone is turned off If you want to...
The phone is turned off If you want to leave a message
This is making me mad
Keon, did your father tell you where he was going?
Did he tell you when he'd be back?
He's not coming back He was waiting for you to come back
He owes a lot of money
He's driving me mad
I am tired
Good you are here
I am the owner of the house You have 3 months rent to pay
I was told to get it from you
Hey, wait a minute
It wasn't deposit basis but monthly rent?
I told you
When are you going to pay?
I have to pay my bills
I can't wait any longer
And you
Why are you bullying my son?
Why did you hit him, huh?
Mrs. He must have deserved it
And how much am I supposed to pay you?
How much is it?
1500 dollars That's three months
Pay until this weekend If you can't pay, get out of the house
Whew
Keon, you really don't know where your father is?
What's this?
I'm going to film out of town
We are only 3 months in debt for payment so don't get fooled
I'll pay you back after this movie succeeds
Take care of Keon for me
The phone is turned off now.
If...
Uncle, you are really mistaken about me
I can't take care of Keon because I'm going to Paris
I can't take care of him Why should I?
I don't care what happens to him
So you better get back here
I'm going to Paris
Keon I mean
I mean
Keon
You know what I mean
All I said was a lie
You know what I mean I know you are smart
I said it because I was just mad at your father
Don't cry, okay?
Aren't you glad?
We aren't parting badly
Thank you
Including everything at Paris
You let me do things I could never have done
It was great
We'll never meet again but I might think of you in Paris
Are you studying?
The room is just like before 2 years since I've been here and a lot of things to do
I'm sorry I made you come all the way here
You don't have to be I'll have you pay me for this too
The company records are in this disk
How's the atmosphere of the company?
There are rumors about you
He was a playboy in Paris
He had an affair with an actress
And that he also bought his degree
There are a lot of sayings
Wow, they're quite accurate
Now that everyone knows
You can tell me
How was the actress?
How much was your degree?
Do you want to be fired and rest at home?
I was just kidding
Didn't you say that you have a friend working at the airport?
- You mean Sukhyun?
- Yeah
I called him yesterday.
Why?
Tell to check all lists of the entries to the country
And see if Soohyuk is on the list
I can't get in touch with him
Let's go out and buy a car
How should we do this?
I'll be your brother In law
What?
Hey, how's this?
You know I like jeeps
Oh, jeeps are over there
Jeeps are expensive We'll buy it when we get rich
Do you have an affordable and efficient car with a great design?
Well, sir
Our company is planning on releasing a car of such
But you can take a look at these other cars
This way, please
- Secret inspection?
- Well, I was kind of bored
Hello, may I ask you something?
I really don't know about this
What does this legal management refer to?
I have nothing to do with the contractor
I went through this car seizure
- Can you take a look at this?
- You haven't paid your allotment
It's all written here take a close look
I have already read it all
But I don't understand anything
I don't know cars nor law
How am I supposed to know what this means?
Did I write it like that?
Why don't you complain to the company owner?
What are you doing here?
That's what I want to ask you
What are you doing here?
Why didn't you go to Paris?
Well
I had some business to take care of
I can't help you here so go to the main office
You may have a chance to meet the owner
Yeah, sure That's just what I'm going to do
Okay.
So where is the main office?
You said you sell cars right?
Help me
What did you say your plan was?
Why did you come here?
Didn't you hear what I said?
I'm going to see the owner
Are you sure about that?
Yes
I'll tell him that he shoudn't confuse his customers
And not to take things away from them
Don't be afraid I was just saying them
I'll never get a chance to see him
You have to be right next to me okay?
People in these places really ignore women if they are alone
If you want to help me you're more than welcome
I know nothing of this business
You probably know much more than I do
So you might be of help
You can use those professional words here and there
I forgot what I learned in employee training
It's okay.
Just don't get scared
Don't get scared Stay confident
Aja.
Say it.
Aja
Aja
Hey, wait This tie is expensive, right?
You should look rich
You look good Let's go.
Aja
Are you really going with her?
What if they recognize your face?
Not many people know my face around here
You have to keep quiet
So
I can get the camera back if I just pay back the debts right?
Right?
We have to recover the car
You have to pay the allotment
But Mr. Kang is missing, right?
Then the guarantor has to pay
If you can't do so There'll be more seizure
No way
That's not even my car And I'm not the guarantor
But It says you are in the papers
We just act by the law
Isn't there any other way?
That camera is not his
It's mine
How many times do I have to tell you?
I have told you all the resolutions
The next person is waiting
Just 5 more minutes
I really have to get that camera back
Hey miss
Well, I think...
I don't care what you think so stay out of this
Okay then
What's wrong with you?
Why didn't you say a thing?
Don't you love arguing?
You told me to stand by you
And I don't think that person said anything wrong
What did you say?
Whose side are you on?
I asked you for help
I think you should bring your uncle here
That would be the fastest way
Don't you think I know that?
I can't find someone who has made up his mind to hide away
The next best way is to pay the money
Hey, don't you think I know that?
You really don't understand
I'm going
Hey wait
In fact, I kind of know the owner of this company
Yeah so
If you want I could arrange an appointment
I also work here you know
My God How could you not know the owner if you work here?
Hey Wait
- Huh?
Why
- Wait
This is my number
I don't have my business card with me
If you need help, call me
If I had the time for that
I would go find my uncle
You really didn't help me but thanks for coming anyways
So are you going to stay in Seoul then?
Unfortunately yes
Goodbye then
The allotment delay has to be questioned to the banker in
Why are you still here?
Excuse me for a minute
I explained to you already
Yes, but where can I find Director Changryul Kim?
What do you want with him?
- I just...
- What's the problem?
- Oh
- Director
Mr. President
- Hello
- What a surprise
- You look good
- Thank you
I heard you came back to Korea
But I thought you were working from the day after tomorrow
In fact
This man will tell you what the problem is
I want to ask you for a favor
Why did he have to write it here?
Why didn't he tell me that he works there?
He could have helped me
Darn
Uncle really shouldn't do this to me
He's always lying
I leased it Rental
I didn't sell the house
I'll do it, Madam
Are you concerned that I'm old fashioned?
It looks great to me I would definitely buy it
How much is it?
When did you come?
I'm hungry Let's get something to eat
Is something wrong?
You always said you were hunrgy when something was wrong
No, you're wrong I really am hungry
Okay, after I finish this
Your father...
Oh he's coming?
When does his flight arrive?
We don't have time then Should I go to the airport now?
He arrived in the morning
I think he went to the farm
Does he know I'm here?
Yes Are you going to see him?
- Father
- Oh, you're here
It's been 2 years since I've been here
But you talk as if it's just been 2 hours
I was never going to see you if you did not come this time
You had plenty of rest Get back to work
I wasn't on a vacation
Are you talking about the contract you made?
That's the least you could do in Paris
Start working next week and dress up
People working for you will think of you in 2 ways when you say you came from another country
Really capable or just a waste
Do they still have that kind of prejudice?
It's not prejudice.
It's the truth
- Bumsoo
- Yes, Sir
Feed them well.
It's getting hot
And make sure they don't get dehydrated
Don't worry, Sir
Do you still hate dogs?
You really have nothing in common with me
Go home I'm waiting for a new dog
I'll wait
You don't need to You can go
I'll wait father
Ok then
What do you mean by deposit?
I'm the owner
What?
Are you sure?
How many times do I have to tell you?
I am the owner I bought this house
It can't be true
He couldn't sell the house alone I'm co-owner
I don't know Maybe faked your sign
I am very frustrated
This is the second time today
Did someone else come?
When?
He came early in the morning and asked me to lie that it's by deposit
And to collect his mails
This is making me crazy Now go
Wait
There's a cherry tree that I planted with my father
Please take it It's really a pain
How did you grow up so big?
All these leaves
What should I do with you
I have no place for you
Everything is such a mess
I have nowhere to lean on
No one to talk to
Dad
I'm worried that I might have to stay here
I want to go back to Paris
And get the camera back
And the house
What if I can't get them back?
What am I going to do?
Is this Yangmi?
It's me
Yeah, I'm sorry
I don't think I can go
I was planning to go after my father's sacraficial day but things happened
So I have a favor to ask you
Can you send me my luggage?
Okay, Thanks a lot
Hello.
I was waiting for you
Taeyoung called me a while ago
Really?
How is she?
- When is she coming?
- She isn't
She wanted me to send her her luggage
I think something bad happened
Something bad?
I don't know She wouldn't say
She had a tough life after losing her parents
I don't know the details
Anyway, about your performance
Could you give me her luggage?
I'm going to Seoul
Oh really?
That's good news
Don't you need her address?
Yes please
I really shouldn't do this
Bon jour Mademoiselle
Baguette sucks
I want to eat Kimchi
I'm hungry
I have to admit she's really cute
That man drinks wine and watches classic movies
People who watch classic movies at night are either romantic or lonely
What is he longing for?
First love or kiss?
Excuse me?
Is there anyone?
Anyone here?
Taeyoung Taeyoung
Who are you?
Who are you?
I asked first
You're very smart
I'm looking for my friend Taeyoung Do you know her?
How do you know her?
How?
I'm her boyfriend
How about you?
I'm someone who knows whether she has a boyfriend or not
You are not her boyfriend
You have the same accent as she does
So you must be Taeyoung's brother?
Where did she go?
- Oh I'm sorry
- What is this?
I'll explain so listen carefully
There're waves in this dark beach
Surging it's head powerfully to the rocks
Water splashes everywhere
And a bird cries breaking the silence
From the pain of the broken heart
Okay?
Continue
Let us
Love each other, please
Look Look
'Please' is the key point
Can't you say it better?
Like this
Please?
Like this
Hey come here
Try it
Let us love each other, please
Can't you do better than that?
Do you think this can lead us to the Cannes
So terrible
Practice while I go to the restroom
I'll be right back
Hey hey
If someone looks for me tell them I'm out of town
And go on a diet
Excuse me
I'm looking for someone
Pilbo Kang
He's our director, why?
Did you came for the audition?
No I am just...
But you look not so good
Excuse me?
I'm not here for that
I'm Mr. Kang's niece
Where is he?
Do you have his number?
His niece?
He's out of town
He's not that far away but we can't reach him
Let us love each other please?
Love each other please?
Love each other please?
Let us love each other please?
What's that pot for?
You told me she planted this with her father
And that she cried all night
We are giving it new house so that it can live long
Will the cherries bloom?
Uncle told me that he'd give her cherries when she gets married
Let's give a lot of water and help it grow
When do cherries bloom?
I don't know Whenever they feel like
Excuse me
Do you know where Mr. Kang might be?
Are you good at drums?
I really don't like to brag but I have to say
I am really good
Then you are not qualified
For what?
I don't like artists They are poor and really stubborn
Our family is kind of like that
What?
Huh
Hey
Bonjour Mademoiselle
I asked Yangmi to send me the luggage
Did she make you bring all this?
No, I asked her So that I could see you
Thanks
You look just like your father
If I knew I was going to meet my father in law
I would have worn my suit
Should I go change?
Don't worry You look handsome
Did you eat yet?
If I knew you coming I would have bought groceries
- Wait
- Taeyoung
I'll give you ten minutes Make it fast
You know the 7 main dishes rice, soup, vegetables, and so on...
Let's have that 7 main dishes?
What's that?
I didn't have much time so this is all I could prepare
It's not a lot but help yourself
How would I help myself?
There's nothing to eat
There's nothing to eat Nothing
How long are you staying here?
Forever
You have to take care of me I followed you all the way here
If I took care of all the men who were after me
I would have 3 kids by now
It's no fun if you are that hard to get
You are not even that pretty
Not much of a degree and old
And fatally no money
You'll never get a chance to meet someone like me
I agree
Don't break my little heart
Little?
How about flat
He's listening
This neighborhood is too noisy
It must be so difficult to study brother in law
I know
Did you see that?
He bought a flower pot
It was on a big sale
That tree...
I know No problem
I already know You don't have to say it
I'll consider it as heard
It's not that
Did you make sure you planted the roots well?
You should have used leaf mold and also a vitamin injection
Why are you looking at me?
Because you aren't looking at me
Yeah right
I really missed you
How is Yangmi?
I couldn't even say bye to her
She was bored because you weren't with her
She'll be even more because now you're here
She really loved your music
Why didn't you come back to Paris?
And you don't look well
Is there something wrong?
My uncle caused trouble
And I'm really tired of covering up for him
If that was the case you should have told me
Tell me more I'll take care of it
Later But thanks
Just saying that helps me
Did you meet your uncle?
No, not yet
Have you met my uncle?
Yes, a few times by coincidence
Just like in Paris
Don't tell him that I'm here
My mother and grandfather would kill me if they find out
I'm not good at keeping secrets
Don't look at me like that
You are my only friend in Korea
Don't make me lonely
Uncle Kijoo
Mom
You're getting prettier
The inauguration will take place this week
Listen to your schedule and get prepared for it
I'll make it short I want it to be informal
If you treat them informally they'll treat you informally
Especially for young people like you
Congressman Moon wants to see you
I'll be busy for a while
His daughter finished school and coming back to Korea
We'll be having dinner with them Keep that in mind
Don't waste your time
You better be there
What are you looking at me?
That doesn't do any good
I'm short of money, too
At least pay for electricity
Okay
Wait a couple of more days
And could you stop talking about money when the kid is around
Hurry up then Understand?
Hey, Heesoo It's me, Taeyoung

Could we meet?
Not now but maybe in the evening
Do you remember the bar we used to go to?
The one where all those men asked my number
I'm seeing some friends there See you there
Can we just meet at another place?
I don't think I'll have time then
Ouch
What is it?
You can just tell me now
I'm kind of short in money
Really?
We should meet
See you there They are people you know
It's just a casual meeting Don't worry
Okay I'll see you then
Kijoo Han
Why did I write this down?
Because I could ask him Why not?
I sure am calling a lot of people today
Hello?
It's me Taeyoung
I know I thought you had it all figured out
- Taeyoung I'm here
- Quiet
Yes, I'm listening
I don't have much time
Why don't you come and see me?
Okay.
I will
At 6?
Okay, fine
Okay
Hey.
What is it?
I came to see you
What's the problem?
Nothing
Tell me I can take care of it
I know you can
But you don't have to
I'll take care of it
And I'll tell you every detail later, okay?
- Should I go with you?
- It's okay
Who are you meeting?
Is this man going to help you?
Maybe
Wow that makes me mad
Who is it?
Who is helping my woman?
Who is it?
Tell me
Well
I'll be back Take care of Keon for me
- No hey - lt won't take long
Hey Taeyoung
Miss Kang is here
Come in
You are 10 minutes late
I'm sorry I was caught up in traffic
This room is really big
I was expecting
You must be a person of high position
My office is on the highest floor
- Have a seat
- Okay
Did you find your uncle?
No, not yet
That's why I really need your help
I'm not very good at finding people
Not that
I heard that the seized things will be auctioned
If I don't pay them back soon
Could you prolong the time for me?
Or maybe
I don't know how but please stop the camera from being sold in auction
I'll get a job and pay all the debts
A job?
Aren't you going to Paris?
After I pay back the debts
Why are you taking things the hard way?
I already told you that
I would pay you back for the contract in Nice
I am asking you for the third time but if you want I can
I said I don't want to
I don't understand you
I really don't
I don't understand you
I went to Nice not because of the money
But because my heart wanted to
Then how much are you going to pay me for my heart?
Your pride won't solve this problem
It's better than doing everything with money
It is the fastest way
There are other ways
- Like what?
- Like
You said before that you know the owner
If you can't help me
Arrange an appointment
I'll talk to him myself
What are you going to do after you meet him?
Tell me
Tell what to who?
You are with him you know
What?
I am the owner
That was really funny Really funny
Hey, what is it now?
Okay okay
I know you have a good position
But the owner was a bit too much
You aren't even that much older than me
You know I'm trying to think
I would have believed you If you told me that you were a director
Come with me
- Hey, where are you going?
- Come with me
Where are you going, Sir?
Where are you going?
Let me go
- Hello, Mr.President
- Hi

No No
Mr.President
Episode 18
That Kijoo and Soohyuk are brothers
Don't they look alike?
Have you lost your mind?
What are you saying?
Do you want me to explain?
Kijoo and Soohyuk are brothers with different fathers
Kihye Han gave birth to Kijoo when 17 as a single parent
And Pres.
Han made him to be his son because he was ashamed
No I don't believe you
I didn't hear anything from Kijoo
Of course you didn't He doesn't know either
Why are you telling me this secret?
For you to break your engagement
What?
Break your engagement
Or I'm going to tell the whole world
He would probably go crazy
His sister is actually his mother
His nephew is his brother and his father is his grandfather
And what if everyone finds out?
Koreans love family gossips
If they find out about this
GD Motors will go down in no time
Before what other people think
The shareholders would want to change the President
His career would end
In and out
So break the engagement
If you really love him do it
No?
Then shall I tell him?
If I can't have him I might as well make him crazy
I don't want to see you two happy together
Make up your mind
If you break up I'll shut my mouth forever
If you don't want to see the end of Kijoo
Break up with him
What is this?
What is that design?
Tell me what this is about
What's wrong?
What is that design?
It's our design
Why are you angry with my design?
Shut up and answer my question
Why don't you let me go first Look at all the cameras
Calm down
You are going to hit me?
Go ahead.
Let me sue you
Hit me
Hit me
You better be ready I'll really pay you back big time
You better be ready
Executive Producer Jungsoo Moon
Producer Yang Kim
What is it?
Is there a problem with the design?
No it's nothing serious
Please don't worry and have your seats
Take your seats
Why did you grab him?
- We will make another room for you
- Did your design flow out?
We don't know exactly Would you stop?
Tell us some more
It's a lie You are lying right?
What did you listen to?
I don't believe you
I don't believe a thing you said
Don't believe it if you don't want to
All I have to do is tell Kijoo Han about it
You can ask Soohyuk about it
He knows everything
What should I do?
I already told her everything
That hurt I was expecting this
It's over with you
Tell me.
She said you know
What?
Are you really brothers?
Did she tell the truth?
It's not true, is it?
Is it true?
It is true, isn't it?
- Don't get over-excited
- Since when?
Why doesn't Kijoo know?
I want to hear it from you Tell me
- Soohyuk
- Yes it's true
It's true.
It is, okay?
It was that day when you got engaged
I thought that everything was over But everything started
I was sick for one whole day I thought I would be okay if I slept
But I couldn't help being distressed
Everything that I gave up as I lived started to depress me
My mother My life and you
Wouldn't you?
I don't believe you
I don't, either
I don't want to believe
Why didn't you tell anyone?
Why did you suffer alone without telling Kijoo?
Could you do it if it were you?
Do it if you have the guts You won't be able to
It's too frightening
Call the Directors and Design Team for a meeting
Yes
Have you been somewhere?
Did you cry?
No
Did she cry?
- Yes
- Why?
Cinderella can't always be happy
I'm going
Wait
- Why?
- We have a problem.
We need to talk
What problem?
Our design has been flown out
See you later
What do you mean that the design has been flown out?
That's what I want to know What happened?
J Motors had a press meeting and they had our design
Everyone sit down
The security was executed highly I do not understand
It could have been done from someone inside like the funds problem
I'm saying that someone here is working for J Motors
In what phase was it flown out?
It was in the 3D state as a file
Has the design been registered?
We were planning to do so after the exhibition
We can go to some extent but opposition by law is not possible
I think that the funds are the biggest problem
You have to take care of all the rumors going on
It is hard to get rid of rumors
Director Kim, call Lawer Kim and ask for legal assistance
Mr. Seo tell the design team about this and find a counterplan
Director Choi start the investigating on who is behind all this
Where are you going?
Home
Are you going to go home and think about it?
Why are you hiding?
What are you doing?
Show me your face
I'm not hiding
It was just a joke
It wasn't very funny
How did the work go?
Those guys are really bad
Why did they do that?
Let's get them and make them pay
Okay We should do that
They are all going to pay dearly
I have a lot of work today I'm going to be late
Okay I'll go home and work hard too
If you work hard at work and even at home
I'll have to pay you more so don't
Anyways see you later
He would probably go crazy His sister is actually his mother
His nephew is his brother and his father his grandfather
If you don't want to see the end of Kijoo
Break your engagement now
Are you sleepy?
Huh?
No
What's wrong?
You aren't even going home
I just want to stay by your side
Go and work
Isn't it boring for you if I do?
What if you don't marry me and run away because I'm boring?
Well then what will you do?
I'll go and get you
I'll get you and lock you up in a room
And then?
Then I'll play with you for about 10 days
Until you say that you'll marry me
That's when I'll marry you
Then I'm going to run far away
Didn't I tell you that I had a good secretary?
I'll find you wherever you are
Yes
No rather than that
I want you to get me the list of the clients of J Motors
Make an appointment with them Starting from number 1
The bait is that
Mr. Han of GD Motors wants to see them in secret
Okay
Do you still have it on?
Didn't you make up your mind?
I'll choose what to do so don't mind
Don't waste your time on something already over with
There is only one thing for you to do
Take that ring off already It's tiring for me to shut my mouth
Good morning
Are you here?
Did you hear Taeyoung?
The design was flown out
I heard it was someone from the company
He must have got real rich with one CD
Is it really that expensive?
Of course it is It costs tons of money
Do you know what this is?
Do you know what's in this CD?
I don't care
I don't care so just go
Seeing you makes it hard for me
It's difficult for me too
I wish someone would stop me I wish it were you
Please can you stop me?
Is Taeyoung Kang at her place?
Okay
Huh?
Well I was going to meet you too
You did it, right?
Yes
- Why did you
- I told you
Are you the only one suffering?
How about Kijoo?
It's too late Tell him if you want
I went too far I have nothing to be afraid of
But then why is your face like that?
- What about it?
- It looks like you are regretting it
- I don't regret
- Don't lie
How could you feel comfortable?
What if I do regret?
Does anything change?
If I regret it and stop here are you going to come to me?
- No
- Then why do I have to stop?
I asked you to stop me and look at me but you just ignored me
Does it hurt you now because uncle is hurting?
Yes it does
But you are hurting me too so stop it
If you continue to stay by his side I'm not stopping
I can't stop myself
So come back to me
I wasn't lying when I said I'd break uncle and get you
You are scaring me
Hello?
Okay I'll be there
So what are you going to do?
Did Yoona tell you?
Yes she did
It was a hard decision for me too
But I can't ruin something that has been kept for 32 years just because of you
You'll know because you heard but
The threat from the Moon family is great.
I can't help it if the world gets to know this by any chance
The situation will get too serious
It would hurt Kijoo the most
You wouldn't want that to happen
The sooner the better Make up your mind
I won't try to hurt you
Uncle you have mom and the company
You haven't even asked someone for a favor
You don't even know the meaning of pain and endurance
Not me though
I'm sorry Soohyuk
Like you said I have a lot of things but only outside
But if I had to give up everything and just have one
I would choose Taeyoung
I would have Taeyoung
Over me?
Over you
So why did you abandon me then?
The moment you lost me and took Taeyoung, I lost myself
Did you ask if sarcasm was my talent?
You really don't know me
I'll show you what kind of talent I have
Look forward to it, uncle
I wanted someone to hit me Thanks uncle
This is the list of the clients of J Motors They are waiting outside
But J Motors has to know that we are doing this right?
I learned that you have to fight until the end if the opposition wants it
I don't thinks that the saying Good is good works in business
If they feel bad about this J Motors will act
Okay then I'll make sure they know
- Come in
- Yes
It is my pleasure and honor to meet you like this Mr. Han
You are welcome Have a seat
I heard that you have been selling parts to J Motors
It's been about 7 years
- You should stop it
- Huh?
I was wondering if you would want to bargain with our company
Don't you have a bargain already?
The Yomiuri Giants of baseball scout players even though they don't need them
It's to block them from going to other teams
They just make them sit on the bench because they would be their enemies if they went elsewhere
I am trying to scout you in that kind of manner
And of course I won't keep you on the bench
Our company needs plenty of cooperation in the future
What will you do?
If you let me play
I can hit for you although it might not be a homerun
Good
My secretary will give you good explanation
- Yes Thank you
- Thank you
Yes
I know that the payments from J Motors are being very late
That won't happen with us
I'll make sure that your company grows in the stock market by putting it in our company in 2 years
Thank you very much
I need your help Sir Please help me
Thank you
Next is Shinhwa Tires
Give me 5 minutes
Let me ask you something
Everything is working out well but what are you thinking about while you gaze off from time to time
It's not your business
We are going to have a meeting after this appointment so get ready
Let him in
Yes Sir
It's Youngchan Seo of the design team
Right now?
Okay
Soohyuk you'll have to come with me
The president has called up a meeting
It looks like It's about the design outflow
First of all the fund problem has worked out well
- Right now two banks have...
- What do you mean?
I don't even know about
I thought that you were busy with something else so
I changed the person in charge of the funds
Director Kim
It seems that the rumor that our company was changing trading banks has turned out to be of good
There have been calls from other banks saying that they will work with our company
We are making deals with 2 banks right now
Good and about the outflow of the design
After this time the outflow of the design is to be totally forgotten about
From this day on we will have a change in plans of our new car
Sorry to Soohyuk Yoon who has been deeply troubled by this case but we are going to go with the design that the B team has worked on
And I am planning to fight against J Motors in my own way
I have already started
Well then what about the person who has drained out the design
Aren't you going to find him?
Didn't I tell you to do that Director Choi?
Did you investigate?
Don't
That person won't be happy about himself for the rest of his life
That is enough for that person
I'll end the meeting
Aren't you going home?
I have work to do
Soohyuk
- What
- I hurt more after I wounded you
You are like that too, aren't you?
If you wound me it hurts you
Don't try so hard I'll go
[Taeyoung]:
Where are you?
I'm dating
- I'm dating another woman
- Hurry up and come on in
You are late
What kind of company makes you work that much?
Who's the boss there?
This jerk
But is it a special day today?
No
I just bought it because it looked nice
And then I felt like lighting some candles as I was setting the flowers
So I lit some candles
And I felt it would be better with some wine
So I got some wine and then I felt like wearing a dress
So I put on this dress and looked in the mirror
And then my neck felt kind of empty so I put on a necklace and looked in the mirror and there was still something missing
What?
You Mr. Han
Cheers
Is this why you ruined my date?
Well then go back to her
How can I go back now?
I should just invite her here
What?
Isn't that too much?
Hey I got candles and wine and am really in the mood
Other people say things that they never did in this kind of mood
If being pretty is a sin you should be put to death
Or
You are a thief aren't you?
A jewelry thief
Then what are the two jewels is your eyes
Things like this
What do you want to say?
That was pretty early
I really want to do something
Let's dance
Let's dance like we did in Paris
Did I tell you this?
What?
I love you
Make a wish
Do you carry coins now?
Didn't you know?
After I got the pink pig
I carried all the coins that I got
I'll get you a lot next time
Throw it
What is it?
Are you impressed?
Throw it
Please let this man believe me
So he won't hurt
What did you say?
I asked for a really rich guy
What?
Am I not enough for you?
Yeah I'm tired of you I have gotten guts you know
Not only that but I have gotten plucky too
Well then let's take a picture then
No I won't
I'm not going to take a picture I'm mad
Just one
Let's just take one
Say what I say Hawaii
What?
Hawaii Waikiki Huskey
Huskey
I want to eat some ice cream Can you get me one?
Where do they sell it?
There
- What flavor?
- Strawberry
Okay
You lost me, didn't you
You won't be able to find me
You are alone now
Because I'm leaving you
Let's break up
It's too hard for me
The chairman, your sister and Yoona all make it hard
We have hurt Soohyuk too much
I have hurt so many people for my own happiness
I was really a fool
I thought that love was something that would feed me, take me to sleep and make me happy
But now I know that there is something that even love can't fix
I don't what to be miserable anymore
I can't live like that
I am leaving to make myself comfortable.
Forgive me
You will be fine soon
- Hello
- Hello
Did she come home?
No
I heard about the design story
Don't get so disappointed by that
Why do you look so upset by it?
You don't have to be
Why don't you answer me?
I'm sorry Grandfather
I'm sorry
For what?
The person who drained it out is the one who is bad
Sir, Taeyoung Kang is here
Let her in
Well then I'll go
Just stay here It's not going to take long
Well I'll just give you this and go
I told the desk how to do so Take it each morning
Today is the last day I will do this
Last day?
I am sorry to have troubled you until now
I will break the engagement
Break the engagement?
What do you mean?
I'm breaking the engagement
- Don't you know what I mean?
- But why?
Why am I?
Are you joking?
Isn't this what you wanted?
You got over it
You have acted smart
That's why I told you not to start it
Don't blame me It's your fault
You better forget him now
Yoona
What
We can't erase each other
Not until we die
Even after death
I'm saying that he'll never be your man
You better start knowing that
And if you still have to
Shut your mouth until you die
I heard about the break up from Taeyoung
Come out
I have nothing to say
It's not like you to grab a woman who is leaving
- I told you to come out
- Let me go
I said come out
Explain to me about yesterday
Didn't you see the ring?
it's on your desk
Explain so I can understand
I already did
I suddenly got to realise that love wasn't so special thing
I am sick of feeling bad whenever I see your father and sister
Is it because of Soohyuk?
Do you think that he changed because of you?
He has nothing to do with this
Well then why did you do this?
I know that Soohyuk drained out the design
You don't have to feel responsible for it
Was I mistaken about you?
Was I, Taeyoung?
Yes. all the woman are the same
Well since you know I'll tell you everything
You are right.
It's mostly because of Soohyuk
He'll continue as long as I am beside you
I know that you can overcome that
But how could I be happy when you two are like that?
How could I smile when I made you two like that?
That's why we should end it
No I will never
Don't you know me?
It's over when I say something like this
I'm going
Taeyoung
I know there is another reason on why you are doing this
There isn't a reason on hating people
- I just don't like you anymore
- Stop lying
Do you want to break up with me in a bad way?
I told you not to lie We aren't breaking up
I'm going to go to a place where you can't find me if you continue
I don't want to do so
I just want to stay at work
I want to see you when this is all over with
Are you joking?
A relationship between a man and a woman can be like this
Don't make it harder for me
Even if I die?
Are you going to act like this even if I die?
If you are going to die because of this we should break up already
And I don't care what happens to you now
Kijoo Han
I didn't know it when you were with me but you seem to be happy now
You don't have to do what you don't want to now
Was I that bad a man?
You weren't a good man
You don't know what woman want
I really couldn't figure it out
Can't you just tell me?
Well then you are going to have to live with me again
That's not bad
You seem to not have met another person
Have you ever bit your lip after you broke up with me?
It means that you regret it
I should have done it before
I regret it everday nowadays
Were you here?
What is it?
I just skipped work
It's good to drink at lunch
But why?
Is there something wrong between you and Kijoo?
That's why I'm here I have to ask you something
When you said that you were going to break up
How did he react?
Did he accept it at once?
No
He always wants to understand the situation
Well then how many more times will I have to tell him?
Did you break up with him?
Why?
So that we won't hurt each other
That's why I wanted to ask you
How am I supposed to totally break up with him?
He's been heartbroken twice
No one would believe it, right?
You are brave to not even cry
How could I when I was the one to say it?
The one that heard it is the one who cries
He might be crying
Aren't you having lunch?
I want to be alone
Well it was enough news to make you full
- I mean get out
- Soohyuk
Aren't you misbehaving to me?
We did have the same purpose but you should know that I hold the key
If you keep acting like that
Stop fooling around
I said stop the fooling around in front of someone who has gone down to the drenches
I was surprised
Are you out for lunch?
Why is your face like that?
You are pale
Are you sick?
My heart is sick sister
What is it?
I didn't know that breaking up with a love would be so difficult It is very hard for me
Break up?
Who?
Taeyoung wants to break up
Maybe I'm being punished
I'm receiving the pain that I have caused to others at once
I don't know what I am supposed to do
I was really firm with my work no matter how hard it was
I was sure that I could do everything well
But I don't know how to cope with this
This is too difficult
I am hurt so much
Keon, Keon
I brought you a present Look at this
Do you know what this is?
Look at this
It raises it's hands
It's going to dance soon Look at it.
Look
It's cool huh?
Do you like it?
It's cool
Did you drink?
- Yeah
- Why?
Well I broke up with Mr. Han
Why?
Did he dump you?
Hey
Of course not I was the one who dumped him
You can't do that to your fiance
Why did you?
Well because
He was always making fun of me
He's the one who is a scrooge
And do you know how he yells at me?
And if you look closely his dimple is really weird
And his bragging is outrageous
Whenever we go to eat
He orders all the things he likes and forces me to eat it
Hey
I can see that you are lying
I'm going to sleep Good night
This is why I didn't want you to see me off
I can see you smiling and waving at me
Even though you are not there
I can still see you
I have got a bad habit because of you
Get up Get up
I knew that you did it and I just went over it
But why did you go there?
To do what now?
- Let me go
- Why did you do that?
Did you hate me so?
Did you want to take everything away?
Was it because of Taeyoung?
Can't you even see your family?
How far did you have to go, huh?
Come on let's see you ruin me Hit me
- No
- Why not?
You want even if I hit you like this?
Hit me bastard
Okay.
Let's see how much you can take
You are going to really get it today you bastard
Come on I know that you want to hit me.
Try it
Stop it I don't want to hit you
Why not?
Well then I'll hit you
I said I don't want to hit you
Why?
Why don't you want to?
Because you're my brother
I don't want to hit you because you are my brother
Please stop
What did you just say?
That you are my brother
What?
Uncle, you are my brother
You are my brother lsn't that funny?
We are half brothers
Mom is our mom
Our mom
Episode 17
What are you doing?
Move
Move
I won't move
I'll never move away from anyone from now on
Especially in front of uncle
- Soohyuk
- I'll take you
I'll take you from him
And I'll never let you go
Should I say it again?
I'll never let you go
- You are mine
- You are crazy
Let me go
No I won't
Not until I beat uncle and have you back
I'll never let go
Why are you doing this?
Are you here?
What's up with your shirts?
Well I was ironing this
- Soohyuk is here
- Is he?
What brings you here?
You said I could come any time I had the time
May I have a cup of tea?
Of course you may
When did you come?
We should have come together
I broke it by an accident I am sorry
Don't touch them I'll clean it up later
Taeyoung, can I get my tea?
Oh, sure
Wait
What happened to your face?
Did something happen at work?
Daehan Bank suddenly turned it back to J Motors
It is very strange It doesn't make any sense
Yeah?
I'm starting to doubt everyone
What I need is assurance
It's hot, isn't it?
Taeyoung, I heard you were returning
I'm glad We'll see more often
Yes
Soohyuk
Listen
I like you as a friend and as the cousin of a person that I love without those reasons
I wouldn't feel sorry when I see you
You are not someone that I am supposed to fight
But someone that I will always have to see as long as I am with Kijoo
But don't take it further
Not everything goes as you wanted
- We'll see about that
- You don't need to
You'll get hurt
So make up your mind
Do you want me to be your friend or your enemy?
I don't need no friend I'd rather be alone
But remember this
I don't give up easily
I would at least try a 100 times before I give up
- That is your obsession
- To me, it is love
You are wrong
Why is it love if it hurts me?
Who says that?
Why is it not?
I'm hurt so much.
I can't bear it
I'm going crazy Is this not love?
You said you don't like me anymore
You said that you would stop
Where is the real Soohyuk that I used to know?
How can someone be cool in front of love?
There's no one
Especially those lost it become hopeless and pathetic
That's what I am
I have to cry ten times to smile once
That's what I have to do
Why did you change so much?
Say something
I can't
I can't tell you anything
I lost everything because I didn't have love
But uncle has everything because he has love
Whether that is from you or my mom
You don't know how it feels
You don't know because you are in love
And uncle of course doesn't, either
He doesn't know how it feels to be hurt all alone
Don't be.
I'll help you
Don't change like that
Then come back to me
You can't, can you?
Then I'll have to make you
What are you doing there?
Well I thought you would be late so I came to pick you up
Why?
Did I surprise you?
Can you hug me?
The night was so long and I missed you so much
And I came out thinking that I'd be able to see you at work
Hey don't act like that in the morning
You neighbors will make fun of us
I don't care what they think
Let's go
We look like a husband and a wife
Let's work hard and live happily
We'll apply for an insurance
We'll record all of our spendings and only buy what's on sale
Stingy Mr. Han
Stingy?
You're miser
Anyway were you okay last night?
I was worried because you weren't looking well
It's nothing
And you didn't look so good yourself
What is it?
Are you having troubles?
I always have troubles
What is this?
Well it's a present for your father
Am I being too servile?
No, no You're doing just fine
Miser
Stingy
Let's go miser
Thank you
- I feel uncomfortable
- You'll get used to it
They both were yelling and were screaming
People were looking at them
Should I keep on watching them?
I'll do it
It's okay.
I'll do it
I heard that this was good for health
What does he drink in the morning?
He drinks green tea, ginseng tea and...
Good
Try this
Try it.
Come on It's really good for you
It makes you healthy
Do you mind if I take this?
Good morning
Good morning I've come to work
I thought it would be better than coffee
I will serve one every morning
You must have seen a lot of TV shows
You know that I have Mr. Choi on a stake out, don't you?
Yes
He won't be following you anymore
Excuse me?
Which means I've seen and heard enough of you
You can go
Okay I will
I'll be back tomorrow morning
What is it about the funds?
You must have upset the President of the Bank?
I don't consider feelings in business, father
Then what is it?
This is the first time in last 10 years, something like this has happened
Don't you know what this would cause?
Shareholders start to think we're bankrupt
- We have plenty money
- I know that
But rumors are dangerous
Will you wake up when our company is ruined?
Make up for it
Go to the president and beg if you need to
Okay

She would do anything not to hurt Kijoo
Find a good time for it
Use your secrets wisely

- Sit down
- Let me go
I'm not done yet
Well I am
What kind of interview is that?
Isn't it nice to be next to her?
Isn't it nice to be next to your enemy?
Of course.
I don't worry about what they might be doing
I once said the same thing to my uncle
But trust me It's worse
I know I bother you Why did you come?
I won't let go
Not until I beat uncle and have you back
Lazybone

You'll become bald
Okay I'm going
Mr. Han?
I just wanted to say Aja
Aja
Aja Lazybone
You make me laugh
And you help me forget my worries
Mr. Han
My love
I thought we were finished talking
I don't pass on things that I do not understand
It has already been decided
If you're here to ask for a favor
I'm not going to
Then why did you?
You are making a mistake
I came to tell you this
And I understand you
I wanted to tell you that as well
I am a business man
I'm sure that J Motors has gotten some help and I'm sure you were under pressure and since the decision wasn't made logically
You keep on making illogical excuses
What are you talking about?
I will get loans from other banks
It's not easy because there already have been rumors
But I think I can handle it
If you stop making mistakes
It won't be impossible
Aren't you talking a bit rough?
Since you understand
I admit that it was an unfair decision but I think you need to control your young temper
I am finished You can go now
How did it go?
I've been getting phone calls from everywhere
Yes, hello
It's a rumor
Don't worry about it
I'll make sure to call you when things settle down
Yes
The rumors have spread into the stock market
Get up
Whoever caused this would know why
Where are you going?
Are you practicing?
I'm glad you decided to practice
Is it you again?
Well I was kind of shocked the other day
So I decided to practice
I tried to get 450 dollars club
But I couldn't find it anywhere
They were actually 250 dollars
I didn't know you could be so influential
What is he saying?
Tell me the truth What did you do with Daehan Bank?
Daehan Bank?
I didn't do anything
You did
Don't think you can get out of this
Who's behind you?
I know you couldn't have done this alone
Are you the only one who can do it alone?
You have to fix that arrogant mind of yours
I trust and assure my decisions
I don't make dirty moves like you
I don't care what you say But I got the loan and you didn't
You shouldn't depend too much on others
Try it though
You know you'll get paid
And whoever that is behind you
Don't forget
Stupid jerk
Yes I mean
Yes we are taking care of it
Don't believe the rumors and wait until...
Am I wrong?
Have I made the wrong decisions?
He has met the President again
I'm sure nothing helped
Mr. Moon would have done his job
Shareholders have begun to have doubts
They should be receiving many calls
Yes it's me
I met Kijoo He looked scared
I don't know what this is about But I stayed quiet
And he thinks someone is behind me
Don't blame me if he finds out
Okay.
Bye
You have a long way to go Don't feel guilty
She was trying so hard this morning
I could never have done that
She is unbelievable
That's why she could marry him
I know what you mean
She has the nerves and the brain
I'm sure she hit on him at first
Don't make assumptions
She is a nice woman
Taeyoung, I'll go Goodbye
- I'm leaving
- See you tomorrow
I heard his family is treating you like a nobody
You really are something How do you live with that?
Patience and sacrifice It's called love
I hope that you learn someday
Sacrifice
Well then can you even sacrifice your life for Kijoo?
Why not?
Why would you?
You don't even know him that well
I know more than you do

Nothing Nothing
Suffering and happiness from this painting touched me
Eat all of it It will make you strong
You said that your desk seemed kind of empty, right?
I have a confession to make I lost your remote control
I don't rembember where I put it
You are fired
Really?
Are you working as a maid again?
So that's why you were always late
It's really fun.
I like it
Hey this color looks really good on you
- This orange color
- Okay
Hey are you really a maid?
Or are you just living there?
- Huh?
- What do you mean by that?
It's not what you think I only cook and clean
Why do you only do that?
You should kiss
And make plans for a child you know
We aren't even married yet What children?
I am late for an important interview
Bye
Don't forget that we're having a pajama party
And there'll be a farewell banquet
I was going to go anyways See you
Look at her face That's not the face of a maid
You could pay for this
We are ready for the presentation
Did the President of Daehan Bank call?
No
How many shareholders participated?
About 5 of them
Rumors must have spread fast
Okay.
Let's go
This model which resembles an eagle taking off has new two circle headlamps and crome side moldings
And this will be the first and the best equipped sedan and we will...
We don't know what you're saying Somebody turn the lights on
Turn on the lights
Who asked the question?
I did
If you have any questions you can ask after...
None of us are patient enough to wait Get to the point
What is going to happen to GD Motors?
Is it true that there is a shortage in the funds?
It is not true
It has been exaggerated and distorted
We don't go bankrupt just because one of our banks reject us
We always have options
I think this model which you are looking at now proves that our company is worthy enough of investing
Many of the stockholders asked to arrange a general meeting
We'll certainly arrange one
It is my duty to clear your misunderstandings and doubts at a general meeting
But I am sure that everything will be in order before the meeting
This is the first time I saw you work
You must have been disappointed
No
I swore that I should never give you a hard time
I never knew that the President had to work that hard
I won't cause any troubles
Should I record this?
Do you want to have fun?
It's my turn to entertain you
Are you going to sing for me?
Well if you don't like it I can dance for you
I could feel worse if you mess up
Thank you for such a great farewell party
I really thank you
I really went through a lot but there was always someone there for me to cheer me up
Now it's my turn to cheer him up
I hope that this will make him smile
I hear the love song through the passing wind
The song about
my love telling me good bye
My heart is beating
I will not cry anymore
Parting hurts me so
Even though you leave me
I will give you my love
I don't remember
But I don't forget
Longing after sadness
Time goes by
Stay with me
Like you did
I will not cry anymore
Parting hurts me so
Even though you leave
I will give you the my love
I don't remember
But I don't forget
Longing after sadness
Time goes by
Stay with me
Like you did
Time goes by
Stay with me
Like you did
Encore Encore
She is a cute woman, isn't she?
It's been a while.
How are you?
Yeah, I'm not in love but am trying to be happy
Forcing yourself doesn't make you happy
You should date someone
I will when I forget you for good
I'll come to visit Stay well
I liked your song
Is that the best you could sing?
But you had the biggest smile, Mr. Han
Hey but when are you going to stop calling me Mr. Han?
Then what should I call you?
Well you should call me Darling
What?
No way
Okay then
Darling
Stop it
Hey you told me to do so I'll do it
Darling Darling
It's scary, don't
Why do you stop me?
Darling
Do you know that that is my favorite?
What?
Your dimple
I like it better than a truck of diamonds
So you want me to cheer up, right?
Yes Darling
Okay
Let's go
Go ahead
Good night darling
Give me that smile
If you do
Then I'll stop
Taeyoung, I have gone too far
Before I go even further
Taeyoung
Please stop me
What are you doing here?
I asked you what you were doing here?
I had something to say to you
Taeyoung
I don't have anything to say
You are making me uncomfortable Would you leave?
Do you know what this is?
Do you know what's in this CD?
I don't care
I don't care Just leave
I suffer when I see you
So do I
I wish someone would stop me I wish it was you
Please
Can you stop me?
Don't get closer
I told you not to get closer
I don't understand what you are saying and I don't want to know Please leave
I made a promise that I didn't want to keep
But I think I'll have to keep it
Soohyuk
Why didn't you smile for once?
If you did...
If you did...
You seem to regret it
People don't know but I'm like my uncle
I don't regret
I don't
Okay.
How is Kijoo?
What are you asking?
I'm not asking how he is
Does he still not know that it is you?
Still?
He's not supposed to know forever
You are right
Don't worry about me and tell me what you want
You wouldn't sacrifice for nothing
What is it that you really want?
I told you before
I want J Motors to release its new car before GD Motors
Is that it?
You are not someone who could just run away
If Kijoo fails So do you
If GD Motors goes bankrupt you'll have no money
Why are you doing this?
She doesn't smile
She doesn't smile at me
What?
Nothing
Prepare for what I told you and let me know
Send me and uncle invitations as soon as possible
Can you do it?
You started it but It's my war now
He said that I could never beat him forever
Arrogant Jerk
Hello It's Taeyoung

If there is no one available to go to the theater with you
Would you give me the chance?
Have a nice day
Why are you here at this hour?
I was going to out.
Get up
Mom
Did you drink?
Mom
I know how you feel Just forget it
I know
You don't know anything
They've already engaged It's too late
Forget about her
Mom, did you know?
How can I not know of my son?
Know your son?
You don't know
If you did you wouldn't be on his side
Soohyuk
You don't like me, do you?
What would happen If I do something bad when you already don't like me?
Something bad?
So bad that you can't even imagine
But you are bad, too
How did you live with that?
What are you talking about?
How did you live with that?
What are you saying?
Don't ask me You would know

I know you saw me Why do you just leave?
Am I a ghost or an invisible person?
I know that Taeyoung is all that you see
But this is too harsh, isn't it?
It's not nice but it's not too harsh
Take a seat I have to tell you something
I'm busy I'll go
About the funds
I know there are problems
Mind your own business
Why don't you ask my father for help?
He knows a lot of people
If you ask him for help
I'm sure that he will help you
Why?
Are you asking me why?
Because we are engaged
This is my engagement ring, understand?
This is my one and only engagement ring
Don't you ever get tired?
- You are here
- What is this?
J motors is having a press meeting for their new car which is very rare
It's held at CSV Theaters and open to public
He is up to something
I'm sure
He's supposed to hide everything but a presss meeting?
This is strange
Kijoo, you made a mistake
I was going to tell her much later
What do you want to say?
Just say it
Are you sick?
You are really pale
Is something wrong?
Something should be wrong with you
What are you saying?
I'm fine
Well look at your relationships with the two brothers
Brothers?
Who are you talking about?
Kijoo Han and Soohyuk Yoon Don't they look alike?
Have you lost your mind?
What are you saying?
Do you want me to explain?
Kijoo Han and Soohyuk Yoon
They are brothers with different fathers
Kihye Han gave birth to Kijoo when 17 as a single parent
And Pres.
Han made him to be his son because he was ashamed
Are you writing a book?
You are making up things
Why do you think Kijoo and I were engaged?
Why would the Pres.
Han a daughter of a stupid Politician who had me after having an affair?
Did he mention movies about family?
My mother is just the same
Why would he not want you but want me?
Well you should explain more
My father made a deal with Pres.
Han which was my marriage
I was glad
Kijoo is handsome and rich
It was a deal between someone who knew it and someone who wanted to hide it
He would probably have given half the company if he was asked
I don't believe you
I didn't hear anything from Kijoo
Of course you didn't He doesn't know either
Everyone said that I was crazy
Because I was holding this press meeting
It is true that in this business the designs are meant to be kept a secret until the end
Unlikely however I'd like to show you our new model
I'll answer questions after we have seen the design
Well then off with the lights and let's watch the screen
This is the new weapon of J Motors, the New Sedan A5
Why are you telling me something he doesn't even know?
So that you can break your engagement
What?
Break up with him
Or I'll tell everyone

The reason why your mother...
You must be getting old
You're talking like my mom

Yes, please
I'm on a business trip
I helped him a few days ago and he had asked for help once again but I don't want to go to Nice
Why aren't you eating?
I thought you liked here
I don't know I've lost my appetite
You should be enjoying or I wouldn't be feeling good
Doesn't uncle seem a little strange lately?
I was thinking about it
He came here without his secretary
It's not a business trip
How could you know Kijoo's business?
I Ieft him a message
He'd call us
Ouch my feet
These sandals hurt so much
Ouch
Look who's here?
Are you on business?
How did you come here?
Found a rich man?
What is he saying?
Who is this guy?
I... don't...

Now do you remember?
You embarrassed me that night Now it's your turn

What are you doing?
Let go of me
Hey, get up

- Why don't you ask them?
She is Mr. Han's fiancee
Fiancee?
No, she's a prostitute

What's going on?
What did he say?
She was hooking in the streets
I thought you were wise You picked the wrong partner
Street...
No wait
He is mistaken
I have guests here Why don't you go someplace else
What happened?
There is a misunderstanding
But I'm not a prostitute
No way
- Be quiet
- But
We're not engaged I lied
I apologize
My goodness
I trusted you
I don't know what the truth is
She's not his fiancee
How could do this?
I'm so sorry
I'II make no excuses
Since I've ruined your party
I'II take the responsibility
My company will not be competing for contranct any more
I'II leave
No.
But wait
Not everything was lie
- please tell us
- Stop
I've met him once in the street but never knew it'd end up like this
But the way you handled it makes everything a lie
Whatever the truth is it is true that we lied
Yes, we did
I wore this expensive dress and necklace
I was glad acting like your fiancee
And I forgot the fact that I was Iying
But I treated Mrs. Beaudire with sincerity
I wanted to tell her that
Why is that so important?
Are you regretfuI?
I lost an important contract and you ruined it
I don't know what you were selling out there
But I don't care, ok?
Stop the car
Stop the car
What are you doing?
You know I'm just a house maid
I slept at your house
I went to dinner with for money
You could have seen me wrong way
Maybe it's my fault
I shouldn't have come here
I never pressured you
I know you didn't
You just needed my help
My help
Get in
Get in
What do you need?
May I see Mrs. Beaudire?
Bedroom lights are out please leave
Just for a second I need to give something to her

I don't know whether you are listening
But I don't think I'II have this chance again
I came to Paris because of you
I know that I've been a failure in your life
But 2 years are enough
There are too many people waiting for you
After you came here alone
people started to blame me
I don't want to hear that
Did my father send you?
To convince me?
Why would I listen to him?
I wouldn't fly here just for him
I don't know what happened but be cautious
Don't hesitate to apologize
- I'II take you
- No, it's okay
I'II take you
You have another place to go
That woman
Weren't you worried about her?
I've lived you only for a year but I know a little bit about you Kijoo
You never do what you don't like and do what you Iike quick decisions with no regret
But you look different lately
That's why I'm deciding for you
I'm not a machine
You look like a real human being with a heart
My legs

Food from the train was too horrible
And I need my jacket
What is that mark?
Birthday?

So did you make a girlfriend in Paris?

Taeyoung
Hey, well it's not here Let's go
Uncle, so good to see you
Why are you out here?
What do you mean?
I came to pick you up
Oh my I heard Paris was unhealthy
Look at your face
Did you carry this all along?
- Let's go
- Where?
We're going home
But this is our house I leased this house lt was too big and hard to clean too many bills and
What's this car?
Did you buy it?
- Oh this car?
- Yeah
Let's talk on the way home
You are leasing our house and living here now?
Don't you like it?
Taeyoung, you should see inside lt's very nice and cozy
And you know lt was too big for me and Keon
to live in you know
The economy is going under depression and I should save all I can
And a great film maker like me needs to be a role model you know?
But I lived there with my father for so long l said I leased it
Rental!
R E and whatever it is I didn't sell it
Go in, it's very nice
- my bag
- Ok, don't worry
Look around the house
These reminder mails
Isn't it cozy?
What are you doing?
Come in
You're here
Keon!
Aren't you glad I'm here?
I am.
So how are you?
How am I?
What happened to you?
- You talk like an oldie - l've grown up
Get young then You've grown too much
Where are my father's stuff?
Oh that I've kept them safe in this room
All very safe Go see them
I missed you so much Did you miss me?
Did you listen to the tapes I sent you?
This is the last tape of my life in Paris
Are you happy?
Just like you wished I went to Paris and visited and saw nice places
Like you did
Look at the pictures
This is Notre Dame
This is Montmartre Cathedral
This is Seine I went to every place you've visited
Do you want to see your camera?
Huh?
Uncle, where is the camera?
Why is this empty?
Oh that, well l kept it at a safe place
And you need to thank me for my work
Those tapes you sent us l've kept them all
And played for my brother
Do you have something to tell me?
Where is the camera?
Do you think I'm hiding it from you?
Stop lying Tell her the truth
Keon, what did you say?
Never mind
He's been sick lately
Do you know what you are saying?
Stop pretending lt's in his car
Why are you keeping this inside your car?
is everything alright?
Well, in fact I was going for the Cannes I was asked to make a movie
Since you were in Paris
You might not have heard about me
But I've become famous
Everyone wants me and I love making movies I made some great movies
is this what you've made?
How could you do this with my father's camera?
It's not just a camera lt has his soul
You know that!
Yes l. but why should we leave the soul locked up?
It's a cultural tragedy
There are underground film makers like us
We need to compete with our visuals
We need to move on with the various culture where we co-exist...
Didn't you study film?
You shouldn't be subjective.
Whatever, I feel bad about this
You're driving me crazy
Don't be, we need to go on with our lives
Didn't you tell me that you were filming weddings?
is this a wedding video?
There is a wedding scene actually
Between the main characters
The guy who only loves one woman
His heart is very fragile
But his body is very powerful and explosive but the woman marries a rich man...
- he grabs her and tells her...
- Let's go, Keon
...Let's go Keon
Yes, it's Kijoo Han
He crosses the blue line
Nobody marking him and he shoots
Oh but he looks at the fans
He's looking at a beautiful lady
He should not do this
He needs to focus on the game
How do I look?
Don't I look cool?
Yes, you do look cool
Come on.
You kept these Thanks sister
You loved them.
Drink this tea.
Mercy
So tell me about the strange girl you've met
Did you date her?
No way I just made some mistake
What mistake?
Anyway Why aren't you asking about Soohyuk?
I'm sure you're taking care of him
Well I was but he left again
You look like his stepmother I left a message at the bar that he works at that I'm returning to Korea
Well then he'll be here any day
Soohyuk always follows you
He only does whatever you do I should say you raised him
Me?
Yes I did
And this is the part where you confess the mistery of our birth history that I'm not his uncle but I am his mother
You cleaned the room very nicely
New bed sheets
Hello
Hi
Why are you drinking early in the day?
You're early
Well I have no friends left I go to bed early and get up early

Go ahead, father I will be right with you
Where are you going?
Did you see Taeyoung off well?
Why didn't you go if you were so worried?
I'm sorry for making an ugly scene
Yeah, I would have done it differently
How would you have done it?
That's for you to decide, uncle
Watching you is already painful lt'd cause even more pain if I have to tell you what to do
Such a question causes me pain
Why don't you eat?
We must never skip our meals at this age I don't think I can until I hear what your son has to say
So why did you want to meet me today?
I wlll marry your daughter
What?
Are you speaking the truth?
Yes I am
But before I must know about all of the secrets
Secrets?
What secrets?
Tell me what you two are hiding from me
What does my family owe you?
is it money?
Or something else?
Whatever it is I'll repay it and marry
This marriage is the only way to repay
What do you think Mr. Han?
Do you have to do this to me?
If you don't tell me I will not marry I won't be bothering you anymore
You do not have to tell me I will not ask again
Do as you like I will marry a woman that I like
Enjoy your meal
Hey there
Kijoo Han lt's me uncle
Why are you answering?
She gave it back to me today I think the phone number was bothering her I'm going to get rid of this You should buy her a new one
Bye then
I was wondering why he called me
You really have a very smart son
He won't marry even if we tell him What should we do?
Since this marriage is not going to work out I might as well say what I have been hiding for 33 years
Jihwan Moon lt's true that you know the secret
Do you think you can get me down that easily?
You can try but you better be good
Otherwise you'll get it I'm just trying to say... lf you are still interested in this marriage you better shut up
And tell her to keep her mouth shut before she marries I'll take care of the rest
Okay

When did I?
Remember in Paris?
When Mr.Han ruined my cigarettes

No.
He cancelled all the meetings
He said he'll be doing the most important thing in his life
How can he not tell his own secretary about it?
He's really changed after he fell in love
Taeyoung is much better than the Congressman's daughter I really approve it
But his father is against it You could help him out
You always agreed to whatever Kijoo did
Did I?
Of course you did
How is the new project going?
What do you think of it?
We are spending a lot of money
Pres.
Han and Director Choi were against it at first
And don't get close to Director Choi
What do you mean?
He owns a lot of the company's stocks
He's in charge of the funds and is very ambitious
- What else?

Huh?

Don't touch that
Oh this yeah

This car is so big but my legs are short
Well then I'll go now
Okay then
Aren't you going?
Do you have something to say?
Huh?
No.
No
It's kind of strange for me to say this myself ln this kind of the day this is the time when the man opens the door for the woman, you know
That?
It's easy
No no
You don't have to do it Just because I said so lt's okay. I'll do it myself
- l'll go then
- Taeyoung
Stay 5 more minutes Wait until this song ends
So was it a tough day with hardly no money?
No, it was fun We have 1 coin left
Save it
You should not let our pink piggie starve to death
Pink piggie
You didn't forget our promise, did you?
What kind of women would forget her promise for an engagement?
- Are you here?
- Yes
Father, I am home l don't care if you are here or not
Father does not even deals with me anymore
He's been grumpy all day
What happened at work?
Do you want to meet my girlfriend?
Did you make up your mind?
Why don't you meet her?
Okay. I will I was getting curious
Do you have time tomorrow?
Yes.
She's a great woman You'll like her
You are home early
And you are late I didn't see you at work though
The most important thing in my life happened today
What a day you had
- Give me 5 minutes if you're not busy - l'm busy
Don't you see I'm working with my injured hand?
Okay then
If you can't give me money find me a man with money
Did that fountain really grant my wish?
What do you think, coin?
Did the fountain do it?
Did it Huh?
Tell me Tell me
You don't want to?
Why not?
I want uncle to come with me
Why does it have to be your uncle?
Did you call me?
Introduce Soohyuk to the directors He says it has to be you I heard that you hold trigger of our company, uncle
What does that mean?
A trigger?
What trigger?
Most of you would already know who he is
But this is the first official meeting and I want you to meet
- a new member of the company...
- l'll do it myself, uncle
My name is Soohyuk Yoon I'm sure you all know that I'm the grandson of Pres.
Han and the nephew of Mr. Han I'll get to the point I admit that I got the job easily
But I can assure you that I am qualified and talented
And I don't need your special attention I am unlike my uncle
And I apologize for failing to meet you personally
But when it comes to work there will be no mistake I wll work hard So keep an eye on me
You must be very proud
His eyes, personality and the way he talks resemble you Mr. Han
Director Kim was looking for a talented designer I should say I'm so relieved
Okay we're finished
Director Kim, are you in charge of TFT for this project?
Yes I don't mean to be rude but who fixed the design?
One out of the three final designs was selected
And of course the decision was made by Mr. Han
Why?
Do you see a problem?
It takes at least 5 years for a new car to be released lt's not released the next day lt could look old after 5 years
Just forget what I said
Let's talk about it after I do some more research
How did you bear your eagerness for work until now?
Why?
Did I do something wrong?
Soohyuk
Sarcasm is not a talent You're here to work hard I can always fire you
You are not the same cousin that I once knew
So why did you abandon me then?
The moment you lost me and took Taeyoung, I lost myself
Did you ask if sarcasm was my talent?
You really don't know me I'll show you what kind of talent I have
Look forward to it, uncle
Are you in charge of the pajama party?
Yes I will prepare for all the preparations perfectly I hope that we don't run short on food like last time
Don't worry I'm not using my money you know I'll make sure there is plenty of food
And please don't take my jokes seriously lt'll hurt my feelings
You are dismissed
Hello
You must be Seungkyung Baek My name is Yoona Moon
Yoona Moon?
You must be the woman who tried to get engaged to my ex-husband
Yes. I have something to tell you May I sit?
Do you know Taeyoung Kang who works here?
Yes, I know my workers
Do you know that she is going out with Kijoo Han?
Could you call Taeyoung for me?
Wait
Listen to what I have to say first I know what you want to say
That I should kick her out because they're going out
Did you know?
Did you call me?
Wait a minute here lt's a small world but don't you have a life?
Why do you always follow me?
Since when did I look so different to you?
It's funny that the three of us are here lt really is
Mr. Han is a lucky man
Ex-wife, a broke up fiancee and current girlfriend
Should we meet regularly?
What do you think of it?
I was mistaken I'll leave
You don't have to be thankful
You sometimes make me mad, too lf you two get married I don't know if I would be your friend or enemy
So don't trust me
You are dismissed
Yes ma'am
You really are impudent
Yeah, I know.
Working for Mr. Han's ex-wife lt bothers me somethimes
But so what?
Am I out of my mind?
Maybe But you should also ask yourself
How could I be sane when a man like Kijoo says he loves me?
He's handsome and rich went to a great school and is also a good fighter
He sings well, too You didn't know that, did you?
This really is making me crazy you know I'll go now Don't say anything
Oh yes yes. I almost forgot
Your mother was quite strong But so am I
So tell her not to come to my house again. I'll go now
You won't last long with him I don't need you But you need me
So don't start something that you know is going to end
Thanks for your advice
But from now on I'll be the one who decides
Let us love each other!
Please?
Aja!
Ya!
Director Kim is here
He wants talk to you about the last meeting
Tell him I'll talk to him later ls something wrong, sir?
is it about Soohyuk?
is there a problem?
You should take good care of him Keep checking on him I'm going out
You were wrong
You were in a hurry
Power is not something you obtain but something that others believe you have
That's what your uncle is good at
You have a long way to go
- Mom
- Do you have time?
Come and visit me
I was on my way to the farm
Did you see a ghost?
What are you doing?
Let's take a seat
Go have your lunch
Yes Madam
You are getting old, too lt seems like yesterday when you were 17
I never regretted for not having a son
Father
Kihye, I do not want my child to suffer I don't want Kijoo to get hurt
He should marry Mr. Moon's daughter I am sorry, father
But I don't want him to
Let's just tell the truth No scerets can last forever I don't want to see you always being dragged around
You can't Think of Kijoo
Don't even think about agreeing with him
They love each other so much I'll go and meet this woman
Then what of Soohyuk?
- What?
- They really have a lot in common
Even with women
Kijoo and Soohyuk are in love with the same woman ls that true?
Marrying Mr. Moon's daughter will help many I have everything planned
I have always thought of Kijoo as my son I know how bad you'd feel
But we should endure until we die
Calling your son a brother...
Father!
Don't say that I am afraid someone might hear
Afraid about what?
Grandfather Why are you here?
I was on my way to the farm I'll be late so don't wait for me
See you then
Mom, did you cry?
Why did you cry?
Did grandfather say something?
Why?
What is it?
How is your hand?
My mother worries about me lt's okay Why did you want to see me?
I wanted to get you a suit I got one for your uncle on his first day of work
It's okay I don't want to I'm going to stop copying uncle
You said there was a woman that you were going out with
Can I meet her?
There isn't anymore. lt's over Someone took her from me
Did you see the woman that uncle is seeing?
No
Why don't you?
She's a great woman
She is kind and tender And she has a great smile
Have a nice time
Thank you .Have a nice time
Really?
He proposed to you at the bus stop?
Hey, are you stupid?
What about all the movies you saw?
How could I?
He was really stubborn
Well, I liked it though
But it shouldn't be that way
Why he could have put the ring in ice cream
Or the ring should have slid down on a string like in Step Mom
Or maybe a ring inside frozen cocktail
Anyways tell him to redo it I mean.
Hello
- Which seat please?
- Front row
Okay here
Here you go Have a nice time
Was the bus stop kind of disappointing?
Yes. lt was very disapponiting
Customer164?

To meet my sister
Your sister?
Customer 165?
Customer 166?

Come with me
Why are you acting like this
What do you mean why?
We're going somewhere
Why didn't you tell me ahead of time I can't meet her like this
Don't worry.
She's going
Maybe you should wait outside
I have decided
Me too
Ah
More
What's the matter?
I wonder
Hey, wait I have to stop by somewhere
Follow me
Do you know what she likes?
No.
Should we get one of each?
She'll at least like one
Hey wait.
What are you doing?
One of each again?

- Yes
This is Taeyoung Kang I was curious about you lt's good to meet you I wanted to meet you, too I am Taeyoung Kang
I don't know if you'll like this or not but
It's expensive
Thanks you Let's order
We are going to get engaged
We agreed to do so
We are going to do it as fast as possible and nicely
Did you tell father?
Yes. plenty of times But he's ignoring me
That's why we need your help You're on our side, right?
is that what you think, Ms. Kang?
Yes I also want to get engaged
I'm sorry
Yes lt's Kijoo Han Yes
They have many things in common even with women but how could this be
Kijoo and Soohyuk are in love with the same woman
Can I ask you a favor?
Yes of course.
What is it?
Stop this engagement
Miss Taeyoung please stop I ask you I don't really like you
You have no money no education and no parents
There isn't a thing I like about you
Even the clothes you have on and the color of your lipstick I don't think you are the one for Kijoo
I'll talk to Kijoo You just change your mind
Hey I'm sorry
Did you have a nice chat with her?
Be good to her She's feeling really uneasy
Why is she?
Well father was kind of hard on her
Episode 19 I said I don't want to hit you
Why don't you want to?
- Why don't you want to?
- Because you're my brother
I don't want to hit you because you're my brother
Please stop
What did you just say?
You're my brother
What?
Uncle
You are my brother
You are not my uncle lsn't that funny?
We are half brothers
Mom is our mom
Our mom
I don't understand what you're saying
What did you say?
I didn't believe at first
But
Mr. Moon and Director Choi knew it, too
That you are my brother
Everyone except the two of us knew
After I heard it I just got so angry
because if we were brothers I might have
had what you have right now I couldn't stop thinking that
Mom always took care of you you know
I know that you'd be angry because you never got to call her mother I always called her mother But she was always your mother
And I couldn't stand that
Taeyoung always loved you no matter how much I loved her lt was so painful
That's why I did it
That's why I did it I'm sorry uncle
I'm sorry uncle
I am not in a position to forgive you
Nothing changed
Because I wasn't here today

Why do I have to call you uncle?
She's a mother to you
But a sister to me, fool
And I am your uncle
You always smiled
But I made you cry I made you cry
I made Taeyoung cry I must be a bad person
You were right uncle I tried to hurt you
But it only hurt me I am so hurt
So hurt that I can't do anything
There's a big story on the newspaper saying that the cooperating companies of J motors have all started working with GD motors I saw it
Junghak is going to be shocked
Has Soohyuk come to work?
He is sick
Did you not know?
Okay
Taeyoung
I am really tired right now
So don't just get up and leave
I won't ask you to look at me
Just stay here like this for a while
Are you crying?
You're crying again
Why do you leave me if you're always going to cry?
You can't really become distant from me just because you say so
And I have never let you go I won't let you go
Stop it
- Taeyoung - l said stop it
Stop what?
I have just called your name and you are already crying
Make sure you take care I'm going
- Are you here?
- Yes
He is waiting for you
Soohyuk is ill
That's why I look worried
Don't worry
Were you passing by?
Why?
What's wrong?
Kijoo
Sister
Why don't you say anything?
Do you have something to say?
Soohyuk I heard that he was sick
He's sleeping
He had a fever but he's gotten better
He was always like that you know
He had a fever even when he sprained his ankle
Take good care of him
He's hurt
I'll go
It's late but I want to take everything back I was worried because I heard you were sick You must be okay I want to take everything back lt's too late now for you to take it back I told uncle about everything
You probably did
You always hide behind him whenever something happens
You will always stay behind him I don't care what you say
Stop troubling him I make that decision I think you have forgotten but we did that together
How could I forget?
- So what?
- l could tell the truth lf that's the only way to stop you I don't care what happens to me
We're brothers after all
Excuse me then
There are a lot of bride sets Which one should I get?
Where did you get your make up for your engagement?
Would you recommend some?
Do you hear me?
I do
- Then why don't you answer?
- Well I was just wondering why you'd do that
Don't you know why?
You're not wearing your ring What should I wait for?
I don't care if you wait or not but you should do a little thinking
You are acting strangely You are out of your mind
Are you trying to give me an advice?
Worry about yourself
Yes this is...
Hold on
is it for me?
Who is it?
Yes, Hello?
Kijoo
Okay I'll be out for a moment
Kijoo wants to talk to me
What could it be?
Hello?
Who is this?
The studio
We have sent the engagement album and the video ls Chumdam the correct address?
Did you send it to the apartment?
I need to receive it
You should have asked first
Well, we are sorry lt's going to arrive in 30 minutes
Okay
I must have had a good dream yesterday
Why did you want to see me?
Did you make up your mind?
- Em
- Well good I think Taeyoung made up her mind
Now, we should talk about us
is Mr. Moon busy nowadays?
He always is
Why do you ask?
He must be busy but I want you to tell him this
Tell him to stop his third rated punk style of threatening because it's not going to work anymore
What do you mean?
Don't you know what I'm saying?
How greedy do you have to be to live like you or your father?
How rich do you want to get by threatening other people?
Why did you think I would never find out?
How did you?
That doesn't matter anymore
What's importatant is the that I know it and since I know you will have to face me not my father nor my sister I'll pay back exactly the same way worse than a third rated punk lf he still wants to be re-elected
Tell him to stay out of this
And that goes for you, too
Understood?
I'm through with you so get out of my face
There are no secrets in this world
Your brother found out
Did you know?
You really have a big mouth
Well it seems like you do know
Well then tell this to your brother I'm not stopping here lf l can't have it No one will
Well now that I've become a third rated punk l'll tell it to the world
Tell him I said that
How are you feeling?
You must have hit me really hard
Hard enough to make you ill?
- Sit
- Yesterday I forgot to tell you
Taeyoung
She also knows about us
Yoona must have told her
Over here
- Goodbye
- Goodbye
Hey not now
- Don't
- Come on I said don't
- l'm going to take the camera
- Huh?
Let me do it
No No No I have to
Are you bragging that this camera is yours?
Wait a minute
This camera is yours
And you are mine so this camera is mine
Hey careful
Come on, would you stop?
Find some other guy to do this
Why does it have to be me?
Are you questioning my past?
Are you trying to induce me to say something?
What?
Your past?
You don't look at the mirror do you?
Your face doesn't seem to be one with such a past
Are you serious?
Well then let's break up
You should go out with a girl who has been through a lot of men
Okay fine then
Break up.
Break up
That's what I wanted to say
Well but everyone in the world knows that Taeyoung Kang was once Kijoo Han's woman
Everyone knows
Everyone saw your picture in the paper
Who do you think will like you?
It was a small picture
But your face was huge
Turn it off
It's like a cave
Engagement of Kijoo Han and Taeyoung Kang
I have left something
- Bye
- Why didn't you tell me
All you could do was run aways from me
Why did you go through it by yourself?
What do you mean?
This is my problem and running aways from me is not going to help
I have heard it, too
And I heard that you know
If that's the reason Don't
- l don't care
- Why don't you?
What I am afraid of is that
Everyone else knowing about it not you
Yoona said that she'd tell everyone lf l don't break up
She will tell the whole world
So what?
What's the big deal about that?
I don't care what they say
Are you crazy?
People aren't as nice as you think
They'll treat you differently no matter what you do
And it'll stay that way all your life ls that all?
is that why you wanted to break up with me?
I don't care about others I could give up everything
- ls that what I need to do?
- lf you do and come to me
How are you going to live?
Get a job?
Wait tables?
What else can you do other than being a company owner?
And your workers
You said there were over 20000 employees in this country
What would they think if you give up on them?
The things that you were born with and
The things that you have accomplished until now don't just vanish because you want them to
You can just give up on me
Taeyoung don't talk like that lt's over lt was supposed to end
Don't make it difficult for everyone I can't let you give up your family and your company to stay with me
Bye
Taeyoung
Wait
Just a minute
Please move I'm about to faint
Just listen to me for a moment I don't want to talk right now I
I really have to tell you something I am so tired
Please stop
- Please go
- Taeyoung
Please if I don't tell you right now I might regret it forever
- So please...
- Please go
Just leave I really don't care how you live the rest of your life I have nothing to hear from you or say to you I don't want to see you I want you out of my life I don't even care if you die
So please just go away
Taeyoung I really
wanted to tell you something I wanted to tell to you directly
Come on Come on
Excuse me ls something wrong?
Chinese?
Japanese?
Do you see this or not?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I lied I know how to swim
But I thougth that you lied, too
You said you didn't want me near you I knew it was a lie
I don't cry
Am I too heavy for you?
I'm scared I'm so scared that I can't go in
It's going to be okay I told him to go away
He was standing in front of me
He was right before me about to cry
But I just ignored him I got angry and told him to go away
Maybe that's why he got mad That's why he had an accident
- l'm so sorry - lt's okay lt's okay
Don't worry He'll be fine
He fell into a coma
His outer injury is not severe but it seems as if the patient himself does not want to wake up
All we can do right now is wait
Why is his hand so cold?
He should have been careful
He never even had a crash with his motorcycle
What happened?
A car has four wheels
I have so much to tell you
Soohyuk
Your brother
Your brother has a so much to tell you
So please wake up I know that you are stubborn
But please just wake up
Wake up
Open your eyes
Soohyuk, why did you?
Kijoo, what happened to him?
What happened?
Soohyuk
Are you the Soohyuk's guardian?
Yes
He was holding this in his hands I thought I should give this to you
Taeyoung I really wanted to tell you something
I wanted to tell you directly
All I needed was just a moment
But you didn't give me the chance
I'm sorry I'm sorry to have hurt you
I didn't know that I was hurting you because I was hurt myself I'm sorry
Please be happy I wanted to say this to you
If I could I want to forget everything
And I wish you could forget the bad memories about me
Soohyuk
Do you know what day it is today?
Please stop having a dream and wake up
Open your eyes
Your mother is right here
Please wake up
I brought some food
Please eat some I don't deserve your kindness
Have some or you'll get sick I'd rather get sick
Don't say that He can hear you
Really?
Can he hear me?
Did you see that?
He moved
Soohyuk
Can you hear me?
Soohyuk, wake up Soohyuk
Soohyuk
Are you okay?
Mom?
Yes it's me
Can you see me?
Am I hurt?
No No Not anymore
Not anymore lt's okay now Kijoo
Soohyuk
Do you recognize me?
It's good to see you awake
Soohyuk, are you really okay?
Say something
Mom
Who are they?
What did he say?
He still doesn't know?
Can't he remember?
He can't remember
He recognizes me
What happened to him?
What are we to do?
How could this happen?
It can't be so
How can it be?
How could he not remember you?
I'll talk to see the doctor and ask him about it
Director Choi has finally done it
He's gathering the shareholders for a meeting
For what?
It's...
For what?
For the dismissal of the CEO
You don't look well
- You must be worried about...
- Cancel the meeting lt's not your business lt's about my son
You are now saying it so openly I told you not to mess with Kijoo
- Did you forget?
- Your sons both have great ambition and strong jealousy
Soohyuk came to me because he and I had the same jealousy
But not Kijoo
He is too daring
That is why I like Kijoo
He has to be strong since I can't take care of him
But Soohyuk is different
You didn't have to bring Soohyuk into this to for your own greed
Greed... lt was love at first
Yes I have never admitted it
But I think it was love
I can't say I thank you
But I want to say I'm sorry
I'm sorry that I could not accept
I'm sorry that I broke your heart
while you were looking over me
And that I made you lonely l'm sorry
But please
Don't take it out on Kijoo
Please
Help my son
It's too late
You are the only one I could ask
I've gone too far
is Soohyuk still the same?
Yes
He doesn't remember
How about Director Choi?
- ls he staying quiet?
- Seems like he's just waiting for the meeting
He doesn't seem to go anywhere
Don't we need to make plans?
We don't have one All we can do is just face it
We are going to lose if we do so
He already has 15% of the company's stocks
He's aware of the fact that he has the strongest voice
He's going to try to finish us
We have to meet the other shareholders and persuade them I have really tried everything that I could have done
Let's just face it
I'll get back to you after 10 minutes
Settle all the payments that were not finished
Your workers will get worried if you stay here like this
Don't talk about the workers
Talk about what you think
You're right
Cheer up Everything will be alright
I'm always talking and never being of any help
I'm sorry I was never worried about the company
There is always a way to a problem
What makes it hard for me is you who went far away from me so suddenly
I'm sorry
Don't say that and don't stay far away from me like that
Would you look at me when you're talking to me?
Why can't
Soohyuk remember?
It's my fault I made Soohyuk that way
I'm scared that he might forget us forever
I made him lose all his memories I'm so scared
Kijoo
You made a big mistake I can't even tell anymore whether I love you or hate you
What are you looking at that for?
Do you still like him?
No, I don't
Then don't act like that
How could he treat us this way when we helped him so much?
He is going to regret it
There is going to be a big news after the general meeting tomorrow
- Don't worry
- Don't make any mistake
Why would I?
All I have to do is go and agree on firing Mr. Han lt's so depressing because your father and I went through so much
But they caused all this
So just forget him if you still like him I said I don't
I wish it would end
So that I can see Taeyoung and Kijoo totally ruined and messed up
They will be
Don't worry and go to sleep
I don't like him I don't

Director Choi
Why are you doing this?
Wasn't it your goal to put me down and take over this company?
You were next to my father waiting for your chance
But why are you stopping now?
I realized that I've become too old
It's too late for me to be ambitious
Come to think of it this company wasn't what I wanted lt was a woman
I hope that Soohyuk comes back without memories of mine
Director Choi
You made me stay alert and cautious
It wasn't bad
Please take care
I'm glad that everything worked out
Em ls there something wrong?
Show me a smile
One thing didn't work out yet
What about us?
I don't want you to make things difficult for me
Will you answer me?
Do you want to visit Soohyuk tomorrow?
He'd love to see these
Well lf he doesn't remember anything there is no reason for him to like them
But he's so used to these
Wouldn't he remember?
He might even recognize us l wish that happens
So do I
Maybe not me but I wish he could remember you
No maybe I was the one that he wanted to forget

I've been living here for so long and I meet people from time to time but never met such a beautiful woman like you
Really?
I'm so flattered
Gangneung is a nice place
You remind me of my high school years
Don't you remember in high school we always had to iron the uniform and wear the magnolia badge on the left pocket
Did you... go to Gangneung Women's High School?
Yes I did How did you know?
I went there too
We had to wear the magnolia badge and they always checked in the morning
Yes, we got detentions if we didn't wear it I always borrowed it from my friends
Yes so did I I've kept that badge for a long time
But I lost it one day and I was so mad
Those were the happiest times
What are you ladies talking about?
We were talking about high school years
My goodness Not again
Oh do they still have Shin Young Theater?
I used to there with my friends
Of course I went there, too
You know during exam week everybody went straight home after school but I went there and watched movies and ran home all the time
I remember so clearly about the movies I saw there I'm so glad to meet you
We should meet again...
You should invite them more often
Of course
She loves talking about her hometown
You should be happy
You're living with a beautiful woman and a high school girl anyways
Why are you still single Mr.Han?
You have this gorgeous lady with you
Oh we are... I'm taking my time I don't like to rush things
I think she is preparing herself to be a CEO's wife

How should I know
But you acted pretty well
What?
Act?
Well, yeah I did act
Could you tell?
I could see it from Soohyuk
I didn't mean to
It's not your fault
Soohyuk probably asked
No
Hey
Where were you?
Why didn't you answer the phone?
I was worried
- I was just enjoying the wind?
- Huh
Hey there's plenty of wind here
We could have come home together
I didn't want uncle to know that I was staying here
Did you tell him?
No You know I'm good with secrets
But don't I need to tell him?
That's for you to decide
If you don't want me here tell him
Don't say that
And even if I did I'd tell you, not him
Go to bed I want to enjoy the wind
What?
Didn't you do that already?
The wind is better here

Interview of Director Changryul Kim
Are you going out again?
Are you meeting with Kijoo where I can't see you?
Why don't you mind your own business?
You are giving quite an effort
I'm sure they'll love to have you at a car repair shop
What?
You'll really get it if you act like that
I'm so scared
What are you going to do?
Try whatever you can
And dress something better
Are you a fisherman?
Why are you wearing a fhishing net?
It sure looks cool though
This is the magazine department Did you print them yet?
Did you?
Okay
I'm here At the lobby of your company
You didn't have lunch yet, did you?
I'll buy you lunch
I'll be right there
Hello, sir
What are you doing here?
I came to see to Kijoo because it's his first day of work
Don't you have anything better to do?
I just came to have lunch with him
Please don't be mad
You are always so proud of yourself
That's what you said when you wanted to divorce
'Please don't be mad'
But I could never understand you
We divorced but stayed friends
That is probably your idea
Don't meet him from now on
He is getting re-married
Aren't you leaving?
You're in my way Don't you realize?
What is it?
You won't believe what happened to me
I was kicked out of the lobby
What else could I do?
I can't tell him to stay out of my business
Should I?
So you mean
You were kicked out?
Stay with the subject
Do you really not know or are you just acting?
He is just dreaming again
I'm not getting married
But he wouldn't dream without your partner
She's from a rich family?
I'd never marry her
I'd rather marry the third woman
I see starting right now
Why the third?
You were the first
And I should have a break with the second one
I deserve three choices
And I like the number 3
Really?
Are you sure about that?
How about that woman the one you met in Paris?
I came to see you because I was worried
Let's eat next time
Let's watch this It looks great
Is it for free?
Of course
My company will pay for the tickets
Very nice
Why don't we go clubbing to celebrate your first day?
I don't think so
Maybe I should get a job
I should stop dreaming and get back to real life
How much could I earn?
Hello ma'am
How was she?
She was the second
Maybe I should have said the second
Does that mean you the third?
That's why I'm not looking at you
Huh
Aren't you the one I met in Paris?
Yes, nice to see you again
Hey
Aren't you supposed be at work?
This is my work
I write movie columns in the company magazine
Let's go
Hey
I know you were kidding but what a coincidence
Why the third?
I'll leave.
Go work
That man is strange
He went on a marriage meeting and he has another girlfriend
What about you?
Don't get hurt okay?
You know how the rich people are
What do you expect?
He'll go nowhere
This is why my parents always told me
Never trust the rich
He'll regret for what he did
Don't be upset
You should have gone home if you had come
I was worried
Don't you know me?
Home makes me sick
There's a condition
If you get in an accident I'll take it away
He asked me to tell you
I think it was my sophomore year
He told me the exact same thing when I got my first bike
I'll be right back
Are the magazines printed?
How is it?
Let me see
Taeyoung Are you trying to get me fired?
What are you talking about?
I thought you were a hard worker
Look at what you've done
What are you talking about?
What's wrong?

You know I have to paste this
I made some mistake

Nothing
She doesn't want my help
Oh really?

I left you a helper I must go
Good luck
Seungkyung is his girlfriend?
- I saw her earlier today
- Ask him yourself
Okay
You want some coffee?
There is ice, too
You always ask my uncle for help
No, I don't
You never said anything when I called you
That means you don't need my help
I didn't say that
You never told me but I found out
I am sorry
I didn't know that you might think that way
I always make mistakes you know
So from now on...
Ouch
Are you hurt?
Let me see
Huh?
I'm okay
Why don't you be careful?
Is this hard?
You're not making an art project
It's only a piece of paper What's so hard about it?
This is why I can never leave you alone
Give me your hand
Okay
Why are you getting so angry?
Ok, I'm dumb Happy now?
Well, then fix it!
Hey don't scream at me It hurts
Who is calling late at night?
This is Taeyoung Kang
Yangmi
What?
I am not afraid of the law
I worked so hard as film maker and contributed so much to our culture
I am not ashamed at all
You're still lying
Let's see how far it goes
Will you shut up?
- I'll find out who the villain is
- Okay okay
Can I ask a question?
Uncle
Taeyoung
I'm ashamed to meet you here but you know but
They must be mistaken
And don't believe what these people say
I am innocent
I really am
Let me tell you what happened
I heard everything and you deserve it
What's up with your hair?
They permed it too much
Oh, how is Keon?
Why did you leave him if you were so worried?
I didn't leave him You're with him
Who is that man?
I am Taeyoung's friend
Friend?
A man and a woman can never be friends
You must be the family of the suspect
He has been accused of fraud
And has been caught after hiding out
We'll arrrest him unless the confronters withdraw the accusation
First you need a lawyer
- Of course
- When do we...
I can't
Uncle, I cannnot afford a lawyer
I have no money for counsel
I am not going to help you
You got that?
- Let's go
- Taeyoung, Taeyoung
Don't leave me here
I didn't eat anything
They'll feed you and it's free
Hey I said let's go
Taeyoung!
Taeyoung

You look to be just about my size
I think you can get me your size
I'll be back
- I'll see you again
- Hey You
Now I remember you
You're the one who hit me
Remember the eggs?
How could I forget your ugly face?
And your ugly necklace
You are busted now
I was in the hospital for 3 weeks
Officer, I'm sueing this man, too
You better let me go You're in a police station
And if you want to sue me you need your medical record
Who'd believe you when there is no evidence?
Don't worry I'll go talk to Taeyoung
I knew you would cry
Why were you so harsh back there?
I could have said worse
I really could
I wanted to tell him what a bad person he was
I wanted to
No you don't
I know you
Lean on me
Lean on me and cry all you want
Just cry
I really really hate him
How could they sue him?
What should I do?
They just want the money
Money problem is the easiest thing to take care of, you know
I'd like to order beef soup
What's the address?
- Do you know the police station nearby?
- Yes
Deliver it to Pilbo Kang
- Please hurry
- Okay
You should go home now
I have to go finish my work
Why didn't you tell me you fought with him?
You should have told me
What are you talking about?
I heard him
Oh, did you?
I was just going to throw some eggs and run
But he saw me
By the way, that guy is lying
My punch would make him stay at the hospital at least for 5 weeks
Have I gotten weaker?
Hey Let me see
Hey hey
Don't lie Are you kidding me?
I should say 8 weeks
I'll take care of your uncle's problem
How?
I'll find a way Don't worry
Wow You look really great
Kijoo said I look much younger than when I was married to him
Maybe I made the right choice?
Yes, Good indeed
You also seem to look better than before
What?
What am I saying?
Well, enjoy your food
Enjoy your food?
What am I thinking?
I am not waiter
Let's finish what we were talking about
Why did you hire her?
To get my money back
She needs to make up for it
What?
I've never seen that look in your face
What look?
A look that says you like someone
Being so excited thinking about someone
Did I look like that?
I'd hate to yes but you do
I am jealous
You never gave me that kind of look
Okay that's enough
What?
You are overreacting
Don't be embarrassed
You look happier
When we met her at the theater I had a weird feeling
Did you find Soohyuk?
So is she still at the police station?
No, she went back to work
Why didn't you go with her?
Because I need to talk to you
Help her
I don't have anything
I know you'd help her even if I didn't ask, right?
It all depends on the situation
She may not want my help
- What about her job?
- That's different
I don't think so
Did I make a mistake?
No, I'm the one who made a mistake
I hope you'll help her
Bye

It might be too dangerous chase me
Are you opened?
No, not yet

Hello, Lawyer Kim How are you?

Officer Kim
You did a great job
May I use the phone?
- Of course
- And you know
When my new movie is releases
I'll give all of you a copy
Hello?
Is this GD Motors?
May I speak to
Taeyoung
It's me your uncle I was set free
I knew they couldn't do anything I told you I was
What?
Come where?
Come home?
Are you scared?
Very
You are?
Let's go
Hey I'll
- go out for a while
- Where are you going?
I have an inverview for a job
See you
Did you hear from Soohyuk?
No, he hasn't called
Keon, it's time for your academy Come on
Beg for forgiveness She might beat you up
Why did you sell the house?
Uncle
Do you know how much trouble you caused me?
I couldn't go back to Paris And they took father's camera
Well, that's not the point I won't say much
Take the car back
The car?
You mean my car
Well, that car...
What should I say...
Well, it kind of went through an accident. so it's scrapped
What?
Then we can't give it back
Where is the rest of the money?
I used it for my film production
It was for my last movie after 10 years with film industry
It's called 'Young Boy'
Ok, that's enough
I am sick of that 'Young Boy' I am sick of it
Why?
You don't like the title?
Taeyoung Look at this
Isn't this your friend's clothes?
What was his name?
Soohyuk?
Is the manager not here yet?
Yeah, he is kind of late toay
How did you get so many tickets?
I don't know
- Two boxes?
- Yep
- You can leave them there
- Ok
As if I could have helped
I can't give her any help
- What are you doing?
- Hey
I was worried
Where were you?
What were you doing?
I had somethings to do
- ls someone at home?
- Yes
But it's kind of scary
Did she cry again?
You must be worried about her
I know she'd be very upset
Let's go I'll take you
Who me?
Are you getting a job here?
I can work and watch free movies
I used to study film, you know
I was thinking...
Good luck Bye
Hey
Are you not coming home anymore?
You can sleep in the livingroom
I can sleep at the bar Don't worry
But I do worry
You know I mean
My mother once told me that I shouldn't sleep somewhere cold
Thank you
You want to restart the entire project?
We can't always sell similar-typed cars
I prepared a long time for this
You must rethink this matter
The economy is in a bad state
We can't afford a new model
It doesn't make any sense
A risky decision could turn out to be a better decision in the future at a time like this
This could result in a serious damage
I believe it's wise for you to be rational
Director Choi
I heard you but I agree with Director Choi
There is always a reason for not taking a risk
I'll report the specifically after the development team is set up
He is so stubborn
Did you get Director Choi's information?
He's very clean except some gains on stock
But he goes to Baduk club twice a week
- That is suspicious
- What do you mean?
He is a very good Baduk player Almost professional
But he stays there for only about 30 to 40 minutes
He must be doing something else in there
Find out some more He's smarter than you think
And about Taeyoung's uncle It's all taken care of
- Good Job
- Thank you
Okay
Lawyer Kim
Welcome
Thank you so much for your help
- Thank you - lt was no problem at all
I don't know who he is he must be a very important person to you
He was someone I really wanted to help
So, how is your work going?
I make a few mistakes here and there
But it's enjoyable
I learn a lot
Sir, Lawyer Kim is here
Tell him to come in
Yes, sir This way please
Hello, Mr. Han
I was meeting your son on the way
She'll be my daughter in law
She's Congressman Moon's daughter

We were just taking about you
Don't worry about your uncle
It's all taken care of
My uncle?
I don't have an uncle
What are you talking about?
I have no time
Get to the point
You are really out of your mind
Why are you so stupid?
What are you talking about?
What do you mean by a lawyer?
Are you sure you don't know?
Kijoo's father just found out that his only son called the company's head laywer to help with your uncle's problems
What do you think?
What are you talking about?
You heard what I said
Are you taking advantage for being poor?
Quit it It's disgusting
Ms. Taeyoung Kang is here
She wants to see you
- Let her in
- Excuse me
Can I speak to you for a moment if you are not busy
You're going to yell at me, aren't you?
Pardon?
If it's something my secretary doesn't have to know
Why don't you close the door?
Oh door door Okay
- Now, if you are not busy...
- But I am
Yes I knew you were I'll talk to you next time
No, wait
- Yes?
- What is it about?
Why do you look so disturbed?
You should know
I was going to yell at you
But now that I think about it
Maybe I don't need to
- How about some tea?
- You said you were busy
I am
Are you always that easy to fool?
Or do you just believe everything that I say?
Why aren't you eating?
Did you really want to drink tea?
They'll give us coffee when we're finished
Why aren't you eating?
What's the matter?
What is stopping you from eating?
I'm getting worried
How did find out about my uncle?
Oh that?
Well, if you want to thank me you don't have to
But you can pay for this meal
I want something expensive
Can I have another one of these?
I didn't say I was thankful
I never asked for your help
I don't want you to know my family problems
I need privacy
Why do you always have to find out?
I'm sorry
I'm sorry to say thank you in this kind of way
Really
Is that the best way you can thank me?
You must have slept a lot in school?
During PE class?
I heard that your father found out
Didn't Yoona say anything?
I didn't think it could cause this much trouble
Actually, Soohyuk asked me
Soohyuk did?
Did I ever ask you?
Did I ask you to go tell your uncle?
Why did you have to tell him?
I know you wanted to help me
Do you know how humiliated I am?
I want some privacy with my life
Let's sit down and talk about what is so humiliating and why you're so upset
My privacy?
My pride?
That's not the big problem
What's the bigger issue?
His father found out about it
What if something happens to Kijoo because of me?
He might get into trouble for helping me?
It's all my fault He doesn't deserve it
- lt doesn't
- Taeyoung
What?
Don't you see me?
Don't you?
Did you think about how I would feel?
The girl I love cries before me
And I can't do anything for her
How would I have felt asking another man to help you?
What do you mean?
Don't understand?
You are in here
I don't know who is in your heart
But you are in my heart
I should go now
Oh, good afternoon, sir i'm from the Publications team used to be, Taeyoung Kang
There were a few thing I needed to deliver to him I must go now
Good bye
Tell me if you have anything to say I saw it all What more should I say?
Father I know what you're thinking
Then you'd know it's too late
Please don't talk like that I hope you don't I never take back on my decisions

Please I like this woman
I like her I never believed but I realized that like her
So, what are you saying?
I'm trying to like her more
Do my best with this woman
Do what?
It's ok, don't be nervous I know that you wouldn't approve of us
But I'm still going to see her
Men always see women
Could be ten or even more
But
Do you know that Kijoo is getting engaged?
Yes I told you I'm not engaging with her
Well, I told you to
Why are you so serious?
Do you happen to be pregnant?
Sir
Father
Well that's the cheapest trick they use
No, I'm not sir
Father you're being cruel lf you are, don't worry We'll take the baby
But Leave Kijoo alone
Do you want money?
Tell me, how much?
I'm sorry sir i should go
Wait
Father, please
She's no match for you
Don't be hard on her
You know that I'm very much like you I'll protect her Let's go
Are you here to see my father?
Yes, see you later
Soohyuk
Do you have anything to say?
I believe I just heard enough
Take care of her She's about to fall down
I haven't got much time
What is it that you were going to tell me?
Don't you already know?
I'm not working, grandfather
Just give up on me I would have given up already if I wanted to
Your uncle is working on a new model
Help him I'm not good enough lf you're finished, I'll be leaving
Do you know her, too?
That girl, do you know her?
Yes
You idiots
She's very nice and pure
But grandfather
Don't approve her
New model development is speeding up
You know Han studied abroad
He's very passionate
Are you upset?
No, I'm not
Are you leaving?
Then what should I do?
Good bye
Thank you for bringing me home Should I say more?
I'm sorry for taking you to my father
Why did you?
I want to ask you a question
Why did you take me there?
Why did you make me hear things I never need to hear?
Because I wanted to break the engagement
Are you serious?
Are you using me for the break off your engagement?
Why didn't you tell me so?
I could bear a baby for you
'Yes sir, I am pregnant' I could say that I'd get my money You'd be free
Stop I'm not finished
Well I am
Wait, listen to me
No I don't want to hear a word from you
You still have to listen I really meant what I said to him that I want to see you and that I like you Do you understand?
I don't know how others do this I'm not so good at it but this is what I feel
I'm finished You may go
Are you serious?
Kijoo brought a girl?
There was more
He was telling me that he's going to see her
See her?
Forget it and just get him away from her
Why don't you leave him, father?
What?
Let him make his own decisions
What?
You know him
Yoona isn't the right woman for him I don't know this woman that he brought to you but I'm sure that he loves her
Love?
Mrs. Moon visited
She came to threaten me
What if she makes a disclosure?
We shouldn't be caring about love
What's so great about love?
It that worth 33 years of my work?
What work?
Kijoo
What was that about Mrs. Moon?
Are you hiding something from me?
No, he's just not feeling so good
Don't worry I don't care if he knows
We shouldn't fool around with Mr. Moon
He's a congressman for god's sake
He'll make us pay
So what exactly are you trying to do?
Kijoo, stop
Please, Father I'll talk to him
What a pity
This is all because of that stupid girl
Father I don't want to be a disobedient son
Please let me make the decision
Good night
The only child of mine is the biggest trouble in my life
Father is very upset lt seems like it'll last long this time
But you know I'm always on your side I know
Does she have a pretty smile?
What?
I heard that you showed her to father
Does she have a pretty smile?
She smiles and cries I made her cry today
He told me about it He looked very surprised
What kind of girl is she?
Well, she's a girl that looks pretty to me
How so?
She just looks pretty to me

Why?
I heard you gave Taeyoung a job here
Why did you?
How did you know?
What was the reason?
It was Taeyoung who wanted the job I gave her an opportunity I asked why?
I was concerned
About what?
About you liking someone
So I wanted to put her where l could see I wanted to know what it is that's attracting you
She wanted the job
Let me ask you for a favor
What is it?
Give her easy tasks
Nothing tough
Come on man
What's so special about that comb?

But I never saw anyone fighting because of a comb
You must be the first one in history
Good to see you Kijoo
Give this guy some energy He definitely need a recharge
Why didn't you come home last night?

Do you want some?
You must have been surprised

I don't know I didn't go home last night
Don't leave things anywhere
How did you get this?
Were you following me that day?
Soohyuk, you're a good friend I don't want friends
Let's stay friends
You told me you had no friends I won't make you lonely l started to get lonely Since last night
Let's not be sarcastic I know where your heart is
But don't go any further

I hope it's me that you choose
You're lucky you know
Uncle and I are both great guys
Why is everyone drinking alone tonight?
Who else is?
Taeyoung
Was it Taeyoung you were seeing?
You should have told me
Uncle I'm asking you as a man

Don't you already know?
It's not just to get away with engagement?
No
Ok

Do you know I told her about how I feel?
Did you?
In a very romantic way
But I was kind of rejected

Why is she being so tough?
She is not even pretty I know, she's so ugly and too loud and never remembers a thing
She lies, too
Her head is very big
Her nostrils, too
You know as well as I do
Does that mean we're rivals?
Do you think you can compete with me?
Why not?
You're richer than me but I'm better looking
And you hardly dated a girl
Don't know what women like
But I know women I know but are you sure?
Can you compete with me as a man?
No taking back I never do Let's drink

Academy Awards in which it was named the best film
You should know these things
- What?
- lsn't it the 27th?
Don't you listen?
I said the 27th
Anyway, this is not that important
What I'm trying to say is that lt's my regret to tell you that Marlon Brando has passed away and in memory of the great actor
Hey you Sit down
Hi
How surprising!
How did you get back again?
Who hired you?
Are you a staff?
Yes
You said the 28th, didn't you?
Yes
Boss, let me talk to you as friend
What's up with you?

Have I changed?
Don't you know?
You look like someone else

Great
Keep checking on Mr. Choi
Don't worry and you watch out for Yoona
Your father's secretary told me that
Yoona's mother visited him yesterday
Something must be going on
Did you?
I heard that, too lt's very strange I don't understand why
He's so careful with her
Can't you knock?
Why are you making things complicated?
Well, excuse me
You have a meeting in 5 minutes
Tell me, what's all that about Taeyoung?
Why are you making things complicated?
I know
Why are you making things complicated?
Bringing your mother here How old are you?
How about you, Kijoo?
What are you trying to do with Taeyoung?
You'd be sad if I told you I don't know what you're up to but I'm very patient
very patient and devoted I'll keep trying no matter what
So it'll be easier for you to accept me than me giving up
Keep trying then
But be careful with what you are doing
Please continue, Mr. Kim
Okay
We've set plans for a new mid-sedan after we get a new design concept and complete customer surveys new design teams will be added for exterior and interior designs
And you, Mr. Choi
We're finished talking to the Daehan Bank
All you need is to meet them and sign the contract I'm not interested in reducing the cost for the new car lf we delay on this project for a few dollars lt'll cost us more later on
Do you understand, Mr. Choi?
Capital always floats lt's always safe to insure enough capital
Not always I want no delay Let's do this fast
Meeting is over
Get an appointment with the bank and leave my schedule free from 1 to 3
Meeting someone for lunch?
Oh and put two guards in front of my office and keep Yoona from breaking in

and he would never have walked looking down
This is cool lsn't it?
And stick it here lt's a sticker
How is it so far?
It's very fun
So am I
Excuse me?
Working with you I am the boss of my ex-husband's girlfriend lsn't that funny?

Did you see Kijoo today?
He's just like you I'm so sorry but
I wanted to stop Kijoo
They are both my sons lf Kijoo is happy Soohyuk is not
If Soohyuk is happy then Kijoo is not
It's better for them both to be unhappy
I told you earlier that your reasons are not logical
Have you read the book I gave you yet?
It's the 22nd rule of the marketing rule
Look again and then we'll talk later
Mr. Han lt's Kijoo Han

Can't you read it for me?
Okay then
Hm
Congratulations on your engagement I wanted to go and congratulate you
But I didn't want to surprise your family
Be happy
I have a question
Why did you break up with such a great woman like her?
I didn't know what love was then

But he is still my son I don't want Kijoo to get hurt and it's same with Soohyuk

What are your favorite books?
Crime and Punishment The red and the black
The Capital The unchanging law of marketing
The world economic yearbook
What do you do in your spare time?
I don't have spare time
What would you do if the world ends tomorrow?
It won't I know but what if
What if it does?
You don't trust me?
I would plant an apple tree like the rest of the people
Apple tree
Three things you would take to a deserted island with you
A computer, a car and this year's financial statements
What if you win the lottery?
I don't buy lotteries
Why do you keep saying that?
I said what if
What would you do if you win a lottery?
Well I would give it all to you
Who?
To me?
Really?
You better keep your word
- Here promise
- Okay
Ok I'm rich
And lf one day is 25 hours long what would you do with the extra hour?
Then I would work
Whatever
Okay Okay
What would you do with a worker that you do not like?
Well I would go to trap shooting with him and shoot him
Wait I'll ask you now
What if
There is a jeep and a car What would you buy?
That is boring
What about the enjines?
I don't know Something else.
Something else
The happiest moment in your life?
Right now
The times I had with you are the happiest moments of my life
Look at the stars
1 2 3 4
Why did you tell me that?
Because there is something I want
Get to the point I want this company
What does that have to do with me?
I don't have any power in this company I am only a grandson of the President ls that of any use?
Your anger and jealousy I want to use them
Are you going to let Kijoo take over the company?
I don't care about that
What do you care about?
You need plans for your goals I only need to put down one person
He has to feel my pain that I had to go through and lose someone that he truly loves
You can have all the rest
Well then we can work things out
Would you do anything?
That's what I want to ask you
- Would you do anything?
- That is not difficult
Firstly you need to make people to be on your side
Should I tell you how?
That's enough I don't need your help
Don't try to command me
How was it?
It was great Thanks
Did you have any trouble?
Did father come to work?
Yes, he came very early
Okay let's go
- You're here early?
- Yes
Was the trip okay?
Yeah
Okay then I'll go
Mr. Han is here
We're back, father
We are here
Did you ask her?
No I just did what I thought was proper lt sounds very discomforting
Don't call me that way
You're just not use to it
You can go now
- Father
- Father lf you don't mind could you give us some tea?
We know that you are busy but we will not take too much time
Could you give us some tea and spend some time with us?
Please
You have the courage but I do not have any time nor tea for you
Father give her a chance lt's okay Well there is always a next time I'll go then

Your chair is very comfortable I just wanted to know what it feels like
I'll get up I could never sit here
Do you have something to say?
Uncle
Yeah tell me
Uncle
I called you uncle for 26 years but it doesn't sound familar anymore
I am not paying you to fool around like this
Go and work I will
You should work harder since you were on a vacation
Did I ever not work hard?
I'm just saying You should do better than me I got nothing else to do you know
I'll go
Soohyuk
Let's have a talk lf it's about uncle I don't want to hear it
It's about you I saw you meeting Director Choi in the morning
Why did you meet him?
What does he say?
Nothing important He just asked me how work was
Really?
Don't get close to him I am still investigating
He seems to be making a team of his own
What would he want me in his team?
A coward like me who always hides behind his uncle
Bye
A coward That's why I need many people on my side
is Yoona Moon here?
I told you that you'd come for me
Don't misunderstand I'm not being used by you lt's the other way around
Doesn't make a difference So we've finally become allies
Did you talk to your brother?
If you are going to be that careless get out of my face I was just checking if you knew
Now let's talk about what we want
Why are you so surprised?
The abandoned were having a chat l have no business with you Can you go somewhere else?
Okay
But your eyes are very deplorable right now I'll see you next time
I looked for you after the engagement But you weren't there I couldn't even say goodbye to you
And I just barely saw you in the morning I just came to see you and say hi
You saw me now You can go
- Soohyuk
- Do you have something else to say?
Do you want me to live like how I did before?
I won't I have talked to uncle about it, too lf he and I were not related I would have done worse
You said that we should treat each other comfortably l take that back
Everything changed on your engagement day
Do you know how I feel right now?
You'll never know I think I can do anything
No, I will I don't care if you or uncle get hurt
Why are you doing this?
is it because of me?
You don't have to know I don't want to see you Go
What did I do?
I didn't want to hurt you I really didn't
Hello
We are back We arrived in the morning I have never approved of you two
So you don't have to come and tell me what you did
Why do you keep coming?
You once told me that you don't like the fact that I am poor have no education and have no parents
I'll save all of my money
And I will continue to study but I can't do anything about my parents I hope you understand
But my feelings for Kijoo is...
Miss Kang
My house feels like graveyard because of you
But why are you so dignified?
Do we look easy to you because Kijoo is always on your side?
No, no, it's not that I am so regretful that I could not stop him
Because I didn't want him to get hurt
So don't come here and act like you're a good woman lt makes things worse
You can go now
Okay then. I'll go
Goodbye
It is very hot Take care
How would I believe you?
A man and a woman alone left in the woods spending the night together and you're telling me nothing happened
- Have a nice time
- Have a nice time
There were rabbits and squirrels watching lt's for free
Then you should have...
Hey hey
- l'm sorry
- Hey I am sorry I'll get you another one

Thank you I envy you
Why did you tell them?
I didn't lie you know
What's wrong about that?
I would tell everyone if I were you Hey are you mad?
Hello
Why are you here?
Pres.
Han told me to keep my eyes on everything you do
Are you trying to see if I do anything wrong?
He's not interested in doing something wrong
He wants me to tell him about whom you meet what you say how you disgrace his family
Okay I understand
Keep a good eye on me I have to go
Yangmi, Let's do some cleaning I am sorry. I am sorry

Everyone in the world knows that she is our family
Might as well have a meal with her
You can leave
Did you see the newspaper?
There's an interview of Junghak here
J Motors having a hard time with their new project
He looks really bad even on the newpaper
Did he ever call you after that party?
He looked interested
Aren't you supposed to be worried?
I know a lot of the company's secrets
- So?
- Huh?
If you are planning on selling them don't get ripped off
How about the apartment?
We got it all ready
The door lock numbers are the same
Are you going to live alone?
You can call it a runaway from home l'll go and meet Soohyuk
Why are you eating here alone?
What's wrong with here?
I'm not you
Soohyuk, if you have time...
Stop
Stop pretending like a good uncle lt really ruins my appetite
Soohyuk!
Act like a man
Why did you change?
Look at yourself
We are different after all I would never think of hitting you no matter how mad get
- What?
- Thanks, uncle I wanted someone to hit me Thanks
Thanks, uncle
You gave a reason to get started
This is Soohyuk Yoon I'd like to meet you
Do you have to do this?
That is my goal from now on
What do you think, Keon?
The title is not eye-catching
A popcorn girl becomes a Cinderella
Take it off before I get mad
It's me
Wow, it's huge
It's very nice
Why did you call me here?
To see if you like it I'll live here
and you'll be living here later
You are separating from your family?
I think that would be the best way
I've wanted to ask you ls there something wrong?
No lf l ask you what it is
You're going to say 'Don't ask' right?
I hit someone today
But I am the one who is hurt And it makes me sad
Who did you hit?
Don't ask
Hello Mister
Do you want to dance with me?
No thank you
I dance with only one girl
She must be very beautiful
She is more beautiful inside
How did you know?
Can you see her heart?
I see it
She cries for wounds not hers
And she asks me for a dance when I'm wounded
She cries when she wants to dance?
What kind of girl is that?
Do you want a hug?
You need someone to hold you I'll be the one for you
Did you read the paper?
There was a really interesting article today
You know J motors right?
It says that their new car development isn't going well
So?
Junghak Park is the owner He's my uncle's friend
No we're getting somewhere
Yes we are
But I want you do the work
You don't want to get dirty?
Not bad
That would make me and Kihye feel a lot better
Don't ever talk of my mother in front of me again
Okay I won't
So what work do I need to do?
If they have financial problems we should give them money
But not from your own pocket lt's not my pocket lt's uncle's
Let's drink
What did you say?
Daehan bank wants to reserve the payment?
Why?
J motors must have pulled something off
Get the banker
He went golfing with Junghak Park
What are you doing?
Get the car ready
And take your golf clubs
It's good to be out of my office
So much fresh air I own you for this Mr. Park
But I don't know if I can still play like before
You're making me nervous
- Shall we?
- Let's go
Here you are
How did you come here?
It's a great day for golf How are you?
I'm fine You look fine yourself
Well I would have been better if I didn't have to come here
Good shot You are better than I heard
New driver is certainly making a difference lt does what it's worth
Of course The more you pay, the better you get
I just got these clubs I should get used to it
Jack Nicalaus said that he doubts his skills but he never doubts his clubs
A player should never blame his own faults on something else
That is cowardly
You speak well
What is that?
Did you find that from a trash can?
How much are those?
How much are these, Seungjoon?
They are second hand lt was 450 dollars
Oh my god Are they really yours?
Well, Mr. Han doesn't really play golf
The club hits the ball
Good shot!
But I control the club
That was close lt seems like I am the winner
Aha
Yes
I am sorry but I think I won
- Congratulations
- Thank you
Did you play golf all day?
Well it's the first time in 2 years I'm not that good at golf but I know one thing for sure
A bad player takes risks go get out of hazard
But a good player always goes for the safest places
You have reserved our loan
I hope that you do not find yourself in the hazard and taking risks
Well then
Hey, are they really 450 dollars?
No, they're 250 dollars I doubled the price because I was embarrassed
Who cares?
It beat 4500 dollars
Money doesn't matter
Hello?
Are you done with your work?
You didn't forget about the dinner today right?
Okay get ready I'll pick you up
The entrance is huge
Are you nervous?
Yes a little
Wait A, B, C, D A, E, I, O, U
- What are you doing?
- Relaxing my face I used to practice it for a beauty pageant
Do you want to see?
Hello?
I am Taeyoung Kang from Changshindong
Was it a pageant for a big mouth?
- Let's go
- Okay
I am so nervous lt's okay
Wow

She left without looking back with huge smile on her face hoping that
Mr. Han would maintain the top position in the Korean motor industry and to revive our stagnant economy and moreover contribute to mutual prosperity of mankind
Tell him that
It's too long for me to remember
That's true
Give it to me I will carry it to your cab lt's heavy
Thank you

No?
We're finished recruiting and I don't do favors

No, my manager told me that they're still recruiting l'm sure of it
is she being jealous?
Who would hire a woman who is close with her boyfriend?
Me?
No way

This is like the ugly duckling and swan
The ugly duckling can become swan
Well, OK then
She's crystal and I'm a rock

Or you saw this hot woman on the way
You know Taeyoung
She was asking me for a job
She said you fired her I did
So I rejected her
Don't look at me like that I don't know why I did that I'm such a cool person I was jealous of my ex-husband's girlfriend
But why did you fire her?
What is it?

Hey, whose place is this?
A girl I know
Keon!
Keon Kang!
What're you doing here?
Uncle, Suppose l'm in love with a girl
What would you do, If you don't like her?
I've decided to change I've changed my attitude toward life because of someone
Take what I want Say what I want to say
And I'll stop hurting myself from now on
How did you find my place?
Did you see the personnel record?
Why did you come?
Do you live here?
It sounds you're being sarcastic that how could I live in this poor neighborhood
Soohyuk!
Did you come with him?
Don't be surprised I wanted to show him who was taking care of me I thought he would want to know
I'll be down there
I'll stay here for a while Stop by when you have time
Are you ever coming back?
You said you liked my cousin
Yeah I like your cousin a lot So I will come here often
Take care
So Soohyuk lived here?
I didn't mean to...
Well, I did I'm sorry

Long time no see!
Where are you coming from?
I'm back from work The cinema that you took me before I got accepted after the interview
Are you coming back?
No I'm not coming back I'm leaving for good
Leaving?
Why?
If it's because of Taeyoung's uncle, You don't have to worry
Take care
Hey
Please take care of Taeyoung She must be very hurt
Yeah I will
You know Taeyoung's place lt was not a penthouse but it had terrific view I'm not sure about the hotel though
What floor is my room on?
I prefer a high place I got the highest one
That's great I will stay there forever
You don't have to take care of everything like you did when I was in high school
Just take care of the hotel bills lt sounds like you want me to stop minding your business I didn't mean that
is that what you want?
Why did you ask me to come with you?
There was no reason I needed your help like I always did
Why?
did it bother you?
That's not what I'm talking about
Why didn't you tell me before?
You mean that I was staying at Taeyoung's?
Well, I don't know lt didn't feel like it
Then why did you show me today?
You're strange
Why do you think I tried to show you?
Are you okay?
No I'm very hurt inside
Very
- Why didn't you call at that time?
- l had something to do
Sorry
I'm sorry
Hey!
Why are you laughing?
I'm not laughing
You are right now
Watch your words
Yeah I'm laughing What're you going to do?
What a lunatic
Playing with a comb like a sissy I am a lunatic but I'm not a sissy
Look at yourself
Don't get on my nerves Just drink and go home
What's your problem?
Are you crazy?
You were laughing I know you were
Come on Laugh again
Excuse me, I'm a friend of Soohyuk Yoon
Go ahead
Do you want me to talk to your back?
If you are so worried about Taeyoung
Let's talk about business What is it?
Director Choi is here He says he's got a report
Would you like to see him?
Don't make him wait Let him in
GD Motors
It's the financial report of the first half of this year
Does it include the funds for the new project?
As I told you before it's not easy
You're not here just to do some easy work, are you?
I thought you were very good at rasing funds
You worked 20 years next to my father
I'll take that as a compliment
Did it sound like a compliment?
Director Choi lt's tiresome to see me, isn't it?
Get the funds
- Yeah it's me
- Uncle, I'm in trouble
What?
Why did you call me?
I needed your money to settle it I thought you were through with the police station since high shool
What's wrong with you?
I couldn't help
Why not?
What's bothering you so much?
I was just trying to let off some steam
He wasn't your target, was he?
That's right I got angry at myself But I can't beat myself up
Soohyuk!
Don't go around and fight with anybody lf you get hurt, your mom is worried and so am I
I'm leaving
Uncle!
Buy me lunch I'm starving
Let's go
Why here?
There're better places
Someone said that food near police staions is great I saw everyone eating here yesterday
How many hits did you get?
Who counts such a thing?
Do you remember how much your mom was worried because you always got beaten up in the high school?
She met your teachers because she was so worried
Did you know that?
I know, that's why kids hated me even more they hated rich kids
But technically speaking I'm not one of the Hans
You were the rich one
You were too famous
Handsome, rich smart and athletic
Moreover, you were even popular among girls I regretted so much for following you to the same school
Thank you for helping me today
Don't thank me Thank the money
And sorry about yesterday
Thanks, I didn't know that you thought of me this much
Enjoy and don't forget to bring back the lunch box
Bye
What?
I'm not eating here all alone
Wait until I finish I'm so tired I'll see you at home ls it because of Soohyuk?
He wasn't going to stay forever anyway
Well at least he took care of everything before he left
What?
He asked me to take care of you I'm not your nanny
Did Soohyuk say that?
I'm not a foster mom
He's a strange drummer
Where are you coming from?
What's wrong with your face?
Did you fight with 17 guys?
He's totally wrecked His face looks awful, awful lt's OK Your cousin will still like me
Did you have a picnic?
What's that lunch box?
None of your business
Why did you come?
Did you forget something?
Very good I thought I took everything But I forgot one thing
Then take it and go
Hey, Can you find it for me?
I cannot find it
What is it?
My heart I left my heart here
Soohyuk!
Let's go somewhere and have a talk
So corny, corny
Sorry, lt took me an entire night to come up with it
Was it lame?
I'll be back
Let me summarize what you've said so far
You really like me, right?
Yeah I knew this would happen one day
Well, how would anyone resist my beauty?
I made my decision
Keep your feelings
You can like me all your life You better not change
But don't force your feelings on me ls this your way of rejecting?
You told me you only see me and that I should keep that in mind
OK. I will
Should I also keep in mind that you'll like me forver?
OK. I will
But that's where it stops
No taking further Okay?
I have another one I will like you until the day I die I'll never change
Why are you keep telling all this stuff?
I really don't know
Why do you like me?
There's a saying that there's no reaon for love lt's a lie
How could someone love without a reason?
I can tell you at least 100 reasons why I like you
Your voice, your fingers
Your scent, your shadow I even like your amnesia I like everything about you
That's my reason
You thought my shadow is pretty?
It is pretty
But this I don't think I deserve this
If I need it I will buy one or maybe you can sell it to me later
OK?
Then should I call you to your office?
- No
- Why not?
Your uncle fired me
He doesn't want me to be around lsn't that a lame excuse to fire someone?
Hey!
I'm leaving
Hey!
Don't walk me home l want to go by myself
Bye.
Don't come Bye
Why are you out?
is father home yet?
Don't get angry Don't show your feelings I won't ask you to smile but at least don't scowl
What're you saying?

He said that women must learn to be patient So I learned
Calligraphy, handicraft flower arrangement I like everything that requires patience
Hello

I already have plenty of money I want you
Do you know my mom?
She used to be a popular actress
At the top of her career she met my dad and had me
She raised me secretly I was 3 years old when my mom and I were registered as his family
They might call us a dirty family
But I understand my mom That's what love is
They might not like my mom But I'm still the daughter of the Moons
Did I ask about your family history?
What do you get ouf of this marriage?
You father would have great advantages which eventually will be yours
If you are planning to run that company
Then you better consider this offer I'm a wonderful woman
What're you doing?
You should eat rice in the morning
Why don't you quit school and go to the traditional school?
Wake up your cousin!
Good morning Ah I'm hungry

You don't care about your family I don't want to see you Get out
Father, please go in
He knows very well that you are bluffing
You have days to yell at him

Go in
You have talent for surprising people
Were you surprised?
You are not someone who is surprised at this kind of thing I mean this is my home after all
Then why didn't you come earlier?
Aren't you glad that I came back?
It doesn't seem like you are back
You only brought your body back not your heart I don't know why you came back but
Don't make it hard
Not for me but
For yourself
You said you don't want me near you I think you're lying
Soohyuk!
- l need to go somewhere
- Where?
To see Taeyoung I brought something that I should have given to her
Let me borrow your car You once told me that I shouldn't drive motorcycle when there are too many thoughts on my head
That's today
- Drive carefully
- Thanks, I'll be back
Do you understand?
You are fired
He's really cold He still hasn't callled me
After playing with my heart calling me honey and all

I'll talk to Kijoo You just change your mind
Hey I'm sorry
Did you have a nice chat with her?
Be good to her She's feeling really uneasy

Are you okay Miss Kang?
Well I am... I think she is nervous, that's why
Then let's leave We can eat together next time

Script by Eunsook Kim, Eunjung Kang
Hey Kijoo
Why is it so hard to love you?
What's so special about you!
Are you that great?
Directed by Woochul Shin lf there were five in your family I would have died
Aren't there more?
Come on.
Let me see them all Bring them on I'm sure none of them will like me I hate you Kijoo I hate you
What?
What did you say?
I couldn't hear you Say it again
Get in Make some room Mr. Kim
Pretty face and lots of money
There was nothing she thought she couldn't do
Well she did it and then hid it for 30 years
Really?
So they are
Don't they resemble each other?
If the younger one knew he would be really disturbed
Because Kijoo always had everything
What about the stock holders?
Their boss is not a son of the Hans I heard it was some kind of teacher lt was really hard for your father back then
Covering up for them while not even making much money
Why are you telling me this?
Pres.
Han thinks well of you Do you know what I mean?
Mom just forget everything you told me
Forget it and be quiet I am the only one who knows that fact now lt's my secret and my weapon I'm going to marry him no matter what
Ouch it hurts Go easy on it
Why is your hand like this?
Did you fight with someone?
- l fought 17 to 1
- What?
I know it's a joke but it still should be more realistic
Oh well em I fought with a person but I lost
That guy had these muscles
And his legs were like... that really makes me suffer
Oh you fought with Mr. Kim in the arcade
Who's that?
is he the owner of the arcade?
You know that punching machine Mr.Kim
Well I thought
Didn't uncle call?
He's back to his movie business again
After he got a touch of that money he couldn't even use
He probably couldn't even sleep well
Anyways be careful
He looked as if he would go back to the Pres.
Han to get it back
We can't make that happen
Let us not make sins Okay?
Okay
Why don't you say something?
I don't really know about her yet
Well but what do you think of her?
I understood why father was disagreeing with you I don't think she'll be proper for our family
What do you mean by that?
Improper in what way?
You two are coming in together Did you go somewhere?
The two of us had a dinner with Taeyoung
Did you have supper?
Should I make some for you?
No I don't want to eat
Don't worry
You go and take a rest, too I don't know what you mean by improper
But if you meet her one more time you'll like her too
Let's talk later
Are you going to watch this?
Why?
Let's have a talk
Okay
Do you want a drink?
I don't know what it is that you want to say
But say it when we are not drunk
I'm going to get engaged with Taeyoung
- What?
- l'm also going to marry her
After we get engaged
Don't look at me like that lt makes me think I have sinned
You have
What?
If it was that I should have had a drink I feel drunk right now
Soohyuk, your such attitude makes both of us feel bad
Should I make you feel comfortable even after you marry her?
- l hope so
- No way lt won't be that way That's just your wish
Then what should we do?
Are you going to listen to me if I say it?
If I tell you to stop loving her?
No
You won't quit but you still want to feel good about it
And you don't want to feel as if you have sinned
What else do I have to do?
Why should I listen to you?
Are you going to hate me forever?
Think about it What would be the best way?
I can't think right now I am not in that kind of state I am not someone who only follows logics
My sensibility acts before it So I can't
Soohyuk I am tired, too
Even my sister is against it No one is on my side I am tired of making it tough on everyone to protect the girl I love
- Good.
Then you should stop - l won't.
And I won't regret it either
Then don't try to make me do anything
You say you like her and that you will get engaged to her I heard everything you said So don't try to force me on anything
Whew
It's me Let's meet
Soohyuk I hate you
Soohyuk I don't like you
You do?
I love him I'm going to get engaged to him
You met my mother
Yes
Did she approve?
No
That means that everyone in the world disagrees with you I don't care about it I have never seen a happy marriage with the family disagreeing I'm still doing it. I can do it
You'll regret it.
Just stop it here
He's not a person who can live with someone else
Don't say that And I don't regret
People are strange
How are they so confident that they will not regret
Look here I was hurt by rashness and I am still hurting
No one regrets when they get hurt but afterward
Well I think lt's better than not facing it
You really seem like a different person
I seem crazy to you, right?
We weren't even that close
But why do I want to hear it from you?
We weren't even that close
Yeah!
We weren't even that close
We haven't done anything together Why are you acting like this?
Why do you have to be like this?
But why is it hurting me so much?
This is the my first time I touch your face
But the very first thing I touch is your tears
You were crying like this when we first met
I don't have a handkerchief with me so don't cry
I'll go I don't want to congratulate you
I don't like you anymore
Hey Soohyuk
How could you call a bar owner to another bar I have plenty of drinks
You don't only eat at home, do you?
Here take a drink
Since when were you here?
Did you drink alone?
Hey Look here
You drank 2 bottles?
You don't even know the taste of this
Taste?
Isn't it the same if it makes you all drunk?
I'm going to have another after this so
You just pay for me
And I might cause trouble today
So if I get drunk don't send me anywhere else
Get me a hotel room and put me there
And make sure you go after I fall asleep
What's wrong?
Aren't you already drunk?
Of course I am Cheers
I've been watching you and you are acting very weird
Did someone break your heart?
I knew this would happen
After I saw you with that comb of yours
Yeah.
Why did I fight because of that lt's funny
Yeah Very funny
You are the first guy I have seen fighting because of...
Are you sleeping?
- Hey Soohyuk?
- Hey
Have you ever loved a woman without a reason?
You just look at her and you suddenly fall in love
Well I have
There wasn't any reason when I was starting to like her
But after that her everything were my reasons I liked everything
But I lied to her I lied that I didn't like her anymore
Hello?
Were you waiting for someone to call?
No no Weren't you sleeping?
Today's dinner kept me worried
How are you feeling?
Are you okay?
I was a little nervous I am okay now I told Soohyuk about our engagement
He came to see me
Really?
We talked in the park He said that everyone was against it
Oh Okay lsn't he back?
He left long ago
He'll be back.
Okay then
Sleep well l'll call you tomorrow
You must be really upset Yeah well try to forget it now
Hey Soohyuk I asked the front desk for a wake up call, Okay?
I have to go and take care of my bar
Soohyuk, Okay?
Take care
Why didn't you look at me then?
You would have seen me before you saw him
If you saw me before you saw him I would have been there for you
What an excuse
We weren't even that close Why should you like me?
And why should I like you?
We weren't even that close
We really didn't do anything
Nothing
Hey you already woke up?
- What's the time?
- lt's still dawn.
Go back to sleep
Where are you going?
Exercise
What exercise?
You never did
Just go back to sleep Okay?
Soohyuk This is why you ran
This is why

Doesn't it hurt?
- Huh?

Strange person
Then is Taeyoung getting married to our boss's ex-husband?
Hey you shouldn't talk like that lt's her first wedding you know
You are a real fool
She is very a lucky girl
Why do you think?
I agree ln those movies about a woman who marries a divorced man
- The man always tries to...
- Quiet
Let's all go to the event
They are really rich There'll be a lot of food
Ther are getting engaged?
This is really working out
That's way Oh my
Soohyuk Did you go home safe?
I was worried How is work?
How is work?
After that I told you right?
You are very cool
I was worried How is work?
Yes?
Soohyuk Did you have breakfast?
Whew
- Hello?
Are you listening?
- Yes
Okay I called you to say that
I went to the spring resort today
- So?
- Huh?
Well I was worried about you
Your worrying is a torture to me I wish you would stop
Just ignoring me is helping me I'm kind of busy right now
Hey boss wants to see you
Okay
Did you call for me?
I want you to give this to Kijoo for me
But why give this to me?
Because I can't go there
Why?
The Pres.
Han doesn't like it
He really dislikes a lot of people
He is very picky
He never understood me when I divorced
And he couldn't understand us staying friends
He doesn't want me to see Kijoo
He told me to stay out of the company
That's why I can't go
Yes but it's kind of...
Can you think of it as an order from your boss?
An order of business from your boss to Mr. Han of GD motors
Or you can think of it as a favor ls there a reason why you can't go?
No no there isn't
is this all I have to give him?
Anything else?
There's a note in there
Go and have a date I'm sure you'd miss him
And one more thing
Pick up a cake on the way Take that, too
Okay
But is there something to congratulate today?
You'll know when you get there
You know what I mean right?
Try to persuade him
Okay Sir
Did you call for me, sir?
Did your father tell you?
Yes I heard it from my father and also from my mother lf you have any thought at all
You should know that you shouldn't behave like your mother
Of course Don't worry
Let's see about that lt doesn't matter whether I like you or not
But you have to marry Kijoo I want to keep my secrets until the day I die
And whatever decision Kijoo makes follow it for a while
Yes, sir i hope you keep your promise
You talk too much I told you not to act like your mother.
You may go
Yes
Soohyuk is coming soon This is all the papers you wanted
Sir
No I'll tell you when it is all clear
Whatever
You're here
How are you feeling?
I drank all night What do you think?
Why did you want to see me?
Are you checking on me?
Do you still think the design need to be fixed?
Yes Don't you look at marketing research?
A luxurious european style sedan Not much are going to sell
Whatever their size it they won't sell
Even the sales to the top 3% of the country have dropped for the first time this year
- So?
- We should lower the level
A mid size and bright style
You have to study a bit more
A designer is about imagination not about analysing facts
A drop on the top 3?
That's right but
Let's say this car is released after 5 years like you said
Do you think the economy of this country still will suffering?
Use your head for your designs Don't use it something else
And don't believe what the reserch say
The top 3% of our country live well no matter what happens
Oh?
Like you are living well, uncle?
Hello?
Hello
Soohyuk lf you came to see uncle go and see him
Who's this?
Did you come to see Kijoo?
Yes
What should I do Miss Moon?
We see each other so much Now I'm actually glad to see you
What's this?
Do women just love me?
There are only two
We once even met with your ex-wife
Does your father know about us?
No.
Anyways why don't you leave?
Don't worry I will I just came by to see your face
Huh?
Why do you want to see my man's face?
Because he looks very different from yesterday lt's swollen because I didn't sleep well
Anyways you should leave I will I was just about to
You smile a lot, don't you?
You have a pretty smile
Smile while you can
You'll be crying soon
What's she talking about?
I don't know and I don't really care But what's that?
Oh lt's a delivery
From Ms. Baek She wanted to give this to you ls today some kind of special day?
It's an engagement gift
Just to let you know that I heard that you were getting engaged I'm sending your fiancee with it
Why do you always seem to be so happy with her?
You never were when you were with me I am kind of mad today
But still Congratulations
Can you stop working for Seungkyung?
I was thinking about it But can you wait?
I know that I like movies
But I haven't made any specific plans for the future I'm still thinking I'll quit when I'm finished
But I've been thinking
Maybe I should be an actress
- Please don't
- Huh?
Don't you look at the mirror?
By the way take this lt drives me crazy when I can't reach you
And it's not for free You have to grant my wish
Wish?
What is it?
Please stop me from marrying someone else
What?
Well
That's a little too much to ask
But don't worry I will
You better not cheat on me, okay?
Okay
Hey Look here This is you are ashamed
And this is singing
And this is a fist lt looks very similar I use it when I get angry And this is my character
It's easy.
Try it
Making cars is easier than this
This is too difficult for me
Why can't you do this?
Hey Mr. Han, tell me the truth
You weren't really smart in school, were you?
Use your brains
You're supposed to use them Okay?
What are you doing?

If you have nothing else let's go out for lunch
There is something I want to tell you

I am just going to go like this
And show them the way that I am lf he says something I'll just listen to him
Would it be okay with you?
Of course Wait a minute please

- Yes
A book I read once said that love hurts I must have loved my dad

People who love someone must all hurt
But now that you're here I feel much better
Who gave you rides when you were young?
My uncle used to give rides

Mr. Han.
What do you like about Miss Kang?
I like the way she eats her cake
You've became a Cinderella
Would you tell us how you feel?
I'm not a Cinderella I am just a woman in love with a man
The fact that the he is rich is just a part of who he is
Such as being tall or being a good singer or having a pretty smile
They are all parts of him
The world has not ended yet
You must learn to smile when you want to cry
Just go away
You have to smile on a day like this one lt's your brother's engagement
Brother?
I think it's about the time
You won't believe me
What are you talking about?

Why not for you?
Why for me?
'He's my man'
'He is my boyfriend' Why can't you say it?
How can I say that looking like this?

I can't embarrass you for my little pride
How would I?
Did you see that?
What?
Didn't you see them?
Who?
Are you sure?
Did I miss something?
If you're finished, excuse me

Just trust me
There may be hard times but I'll make you a promise
I won't make you cry

Much more than you think I gave up so many things for you all my life
But I don't want to give up Taeyoung I want you to let her go
You have everything my mother and your company
You never have to ask for anything
You don't what pain is what waiting is
You don't know any of that
But I do
You can never be a good man
Your life is too busy Taeyoung will feel lonely
But I only got Taeyoung in my life
I love her
Please, uncle
I'm sorry
Uncle I'm sorry Soohyuk
Like you said I have a lot of things but only outside
But lf l had to give up everything and just have one I'd choose Taeyoung I'd have Taeyoung

Ben-Hur, Roman Holiday East of Eden, Waterloo Bridge
Some like it hot These are all classics
Somebody likes them ls Taeyoung Kang here?
I am Taeyoung Kang Who are you?
Who is it?
He's Pres.
Han's secretary
He wants to see me but I told him to wait
We're working right now, you know
Are you crazy?
You must be out of your mind I wouldn't be talking to you if I was out of mind
What if he offers me money?
and tries to get me off of Kijoo?
People would normally say
'You are mistaken I love him'
Well, then what are you going to say?
I'll say 'l love him You're mistaken' I'll switch them
Should I cry when saying it?
Looks like you need some rest I'm sure you were having a hard time
No, sir i have no worries I believe in Kijoo And I believe in you
We'll skip the engagement and jump to the wedding
Let's set a date later on
You mother said that she'd be getting ready
You helped me all this time I won't let you down
Don't worry about Kijoo I'll take care of it
You watch out for yourself
Yes, sir i'll be on my way
Don't be too harsh on her I'm okay
So your family made movies
Low class movies
Your father made third rated movies
And your uncle made erotic movies
There was no more need to find out
There's no reason why I shouldn't accept you
But then there's no reason why I should either I have no interest in someone like you
Do whatever you like with Kijoo I don't want to interfere with my child's love life
But after he gets married I don't want to be hearing about you
You don't know who you are dealing with
You think it's easy
But if you don't stop I have my plans
This will be the last time I warn you
Leave
Get your face out of my sight
Yes, sir i'll be on my way
But my father is not third rated
He made great films
And died while making them I am very proud of him
My uncle is also a good man
There were times when we had trouble living
But my family have done nothing wrong I'd like to tell you more but I'll finish for today
Excuse me Bye
Let me talk to you this time Follow me
What happened last night doesn't make you any special
What about last night?
Let me ask you a question
Why did you call me there?
What was it about Soohyuk?
You two looked good together at the theater
Looked like you two were going out I'm a woman I can see it all
Soohyuk is a handsome man
But you shouldn't hit on two guys
What are you trying to say?
I don't know yet I'll be fun to see how Soohyuk reacts
Don't even think about it I have nothing to be scared of
You're seeing two men Are you scared?
Watch your mouth
Watch your mouth I'll blow anything whatever that gets into my hand even Soohyuk's jealousy
And your jealousy will bring you down someday
You shouldn't fool around with Soohyuk anymore
Men go crazy when they get hurt inside
You were not the only one I invited
It's me
Where are you?
Why aren't you talking?
Where are you?
The theater
What's wrong with your voice?
Hello
Can you hear me?
Yes
Are there a lot of people?
Yeah, there were so many of them
What's wrong with these people?
Giving my girlfriend a hard time
How many cars did you sell?
About a hundred?
It must worth more than a grand
A single car certainly costs more than that lt didn't go well though I had other things to think about
Do you want to have lunch together?
I'm sorry I already had lunch
How could you?
I'm busy right now I'll call you back
Hey you
Where is Seungjoon?
How many times do I have to tell you not to let anyone in?
I'm sorry
- Bye
- Am I anyone?
You are acting like anyone
is this the best you can do?
Yes, this is what I can do I only try to have you, Kijoo ls that wrong?
Are my feelings bad?
Tell me, are they?
Yes, I'll say it again lt is bad
Because you make me suffer
So do you
You make me suffer
Yoona, do this with a better man
Someone who can love every part of you
Do you love every part of Taeyoung?
I'm sure every part of her is hurt today
What are you talking about?
Ask your father
Did you meet Taeyoung?
Why would I meet her here?
I saw her at the lobby I thought she was meeting you I'll be right back
Boss, boss
They didn't tell me directly
But I'm sure they felt uncomfortable
Mr. Han should take things rationally
He shoudn't treat buyers that way lt won't hurt to make a change
Unexpected changes bring unexpected troubles I admire his passion and the new system
But I am concerned
You and I are both getting old
We can't always take things the old way
Sir I'm not saying my son is right Let's see what he does
He might be right You never know
I need to talk to you father
She was so quiet in front me
But I guess she told you already
Would you excuse us?
Stay
You need to thank me that I waited this long
You know what I'd do
Your wedding has been planned
Why are you making it complicated?
If you have something to say say it to me
But you don't listen
Then let me decide lf something like this happens again I won't just be watching
Mr. Han reminds me of his father
Shut up Don't say anything
What's wrong?
Why are you looking down the ground?
Soohyuk
What happened to your hand?
I'm hurt and I missed you
I want to take you somewhere I was just about to call you
Let's go to the common room
Didn't you hear what I said?
I want to take you somewhere
Why did you get a car?
When a men turn 20 they want three things a job, a car, and a woman
It's kind of late but I got my car lt's always easy to find a job
But I don't know if I'll get the last one
Where are we going?
There's a place I want to show you
Do you come here a lot?
I came here with uncle last night I always lost but last night we tied I wanted to beat him
I tried so hard but I couldn't
Soohyuk
I met your grandfather today
He called me in
He said my family is third rated
But I didn't get mad I tried to understand him
And then he threatened me
But I didn't get upset
I thought about what'd happen to Kijoo if I did
So I didn't
What do you mean?
Do you remember hope torture?
Stop
Listen to me, Soohyuk I'm not listening
Sorry
But you are not in my heart
My heart is filled with someone else I hope you were the nephew of a man I like
You shouldn't be sorry for liking someone
Don't feel sorry for me
And I don't feel sorry for you
Uncle is a tough man to live with
You chose the tough one lt's your call
Soohyuk lf l only meant this much to you
I'll wait right where l am I won't go further
Let's go I'll take you home l'll go by myself I'll go by myself I want to
Ok leave
Leave
Leave, you fool
Don't look and just leave
is this yours?
Yes, it's mine
Did you buy it yourself?
No matter how lonely l get
Am I too heavy for you?
Just cry
Money problem is the easiest thing to take care of, you know
You are in here
I don't know who is in your heart but you are in here
Let me see
You must have walked
Don't look
I sold my plane ticket to Paris
Hello Mrs.
Hello
What brought you down here?
I was worried after you left us that way I had things to discuss with you
Pres.
Han has told me to decide myself
But how could I?
Mr. Kim, come in
Yoona, have a seat with her
Ok
Take your time and look
It would be better to go to the shop
But I know you're busy
I like this color
What do you think?
Since you are a designer yourself you'd have a better taste I wanted the costumes to be simple but not the wedding jewelry I don't know what Mr. Han likes
Take a look
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
We're looking at the wedding jewelry
You can't force things like this
Take a look I respect Kijoo's opinion
He doesn't want this marriage I understand I know how parents feel for their child
But you're a little different I'm busy Maybe some other time
How did you endure all these years?
Look, watch what you're saying ls it because of the girl?
I've seen her once I'll take care of that
Mother, I want to quit I don't think I can do it
Be quiet
Do you know what this family is worth?
I don't care I don't think I deserve it I wouldn't try so hard if you didn't deserve it
Don't worry, lt'll be just fine
What do you mean?
Are you hiding something?
It's better not to know
You just watch
What was the girl's name?
Are you in movie business?
Yes, but who would you be?
I cleared off all my debts I just have a small amount of unpayed bills
Pres.
Han has sent me
President?
I don't know any president
He would like to invest in your business
It's not much I am glad
that he decided to
but I don't know who you are
And this is way too much to accept
We have a condition
I heard that your niece couldn't finish studying in Paris
Yes, but why?
Do you know Taeyoung?
I found the right one
Don't you know me?
How did you get my address?
You look just like him
Aren't you Director Kang's daughter?
I worked with him in two films ln both movies you played the rich wicked daughter
That's how I got famous
They were for me
Ok I know you didn't come here to talk about the past
Why did you come here?
How cunning
Don't you know why I'm here?
My father used to tell me not to hit anyone even with a flower
which means anyone can be special for someone
You bad, evil, wicked, bitch
Taeyoung
Keon
Who are you?
Why did you hit my cousin?
Why?
Keon, be polite Calm down
What a family
Don't meet Mr. Han ever again
Otherwise we'll have to meet again
So filthy
Are you okay?
I'm so glad you came I'm okay don't worry, ok?
Keon, can you stay home by yourself?
I need to go out for a while, ok?
is that you?
Where is your cousin?
Don't you remember me?
Are you Mr. Han?
Yes I am
You're bad Who was that woman?
Why did she hit my cousin?
It's your fault
What?
Who hit Taeyoung?
Tell me Tell me who hit Taeyoung?
Nice drawings Did you draw them?
Mr. Han, please don't talk to me
What?
When did you come?
Keon, did you say hi to him?
When did he come?
Ask him yourself
What's wrong with him?
Did you try to talk to him?
Kind of
You should have asked me first He hates it
Why are you here?
Did you skip work again?
That's bad
You can't skip work just because you're the owner I know
Good, you know
You don't look so happy today
What's wrong?
Nothing I don't think so
Tell me What is it?
Guess
Because you didn't sell a lot of cars today?
Don't worry I'll make a lot of money
And buy hundreds of cars okay?
Aja!
I've had a really long day I want to have some fun
I'm a good friend with the manager here
And I asked him if I could sing a song
That's why I'm sitting here
But I'm not a good singer
Don't hesitate if you want to leave
Hey, lady in pink You sit down
I'm seeing a woman
And she wants to have fun I told her that I'm not a fun person then she said that I should at least sing a song I'm very nervous

' l would have run with the money
But he never did lt could change my life you know
And I met Soohyuk I hurt him again when he was already hurt
But you came to me and I had fun
Thanks Let's go now
Taeyoung
Why don't you live with me?
Let's live together I can't see you living like this

I'm a woman I'll have to see if you're good enough for me I'll save my answer for later
You're being too hard I like it that way I'll be the toughest

You made a mess
This is my only job
You stupid car is taking my job away
Come out if you heard me
Hello?
Hey!
Hey!
How much does this cost?
Why are you so surprised?
Aren't you getting engaged today?
That's right
Then why are you here?
Well while I was engaging I remembered that
I didn't wash my car l can't get engaged with this dirty car ls that a joke?
Frankly, I was looking at the menu
And they were serving beef soup not steaks
Anyway, how much is car wash?
Stop looking at me Eat
No, I'm fine I can't swallow
- Why?
- Because I'm so curious
Why did you come to see me?
You fired me and now you're here
My father would have done it if I didn't I can't let him hurt you
But I would get fire either way
And I don't get hurt easily I don't know what I'm doing here
I'm leaving Enjoy your meal
Let me finish I said let me finish
Can you wait and not talk?
I don't want to eat alone
It's a habit I become hungry when bad things happen
Try some I've run off from my engagement
Ran off?
Why?
I thought they were serving steaks but they served beef soup
What do you want to do after you eat?
I never said I would eat I know you would What should we do?
Well, go home l guess
Do you want me to drive you home?
I will drive you home
Let's make today a perfect one
Go somewhere crowded and sit like a withered flower
Then I will hold your shoulders and touch your hair
Since I know where you live I'll take you home ls that perfect?
No
Before we get started
Let's take a walk
This is what you call a date, right?
Drink
Thanks
It's been long time since we came here
We were talking about your job
This is only the second time
Liar
- What?
- Were you worried after you made me cry?
What do you mean?
If you are going to follow me again
Don't do it yourself Hire someone
Why am I here?
How should I know?
I look terrible I'm keeping this
No, it's mine That's the only one I just don't like someone having my pictures
Anyway, did you earn a lot?
Well, I was actually worried about how I should give this to you
This is not a lot I got my salary yesterday I'll pay back the rest later
This is not I wanted I told you I always pay back
What if I don't take it?
If you persist I will shove this into your pocket
Here
Thanks
I know you hate to answer
But I'll ask you one more time
Why didn't you get engaged?
I was afraid I was afraid but I couldn't run away
I couldn't think of a better way
So I chose to be a coward I was a coward
After I ran out I thought to myself
Where should I go
Then one person came to my mind
Soohyuk must have occurred in your mind too
He's a good guy
Yes
Hello
May I speak to Kijoo?
He's not home
Not home?
His cell phone is turned off I don't know where he is either lf you are not busy could you meet me for a while?
Thank you for coming I came to return this
I never said that I will break off the engagement I didn't hear from Kijoo yet lt's not finished yet
I want him to return it
OK
Do you know where Taeyoung lives?
- Why do you ask?
- Just tell me where she lives
Are you blaming her for this?
She's the reason lt's obvious
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you
That means you know I don't know what you're thinking but
Don't even think about hurting her
She seems strong outside but she's very vulnerable inside
Do you know her well?
It sounds like you know her very well l think you're over protecting her
I don't think I need to answer that I think you're finished I need to go
is this perfect?
This is more than perfect
I'll leave now Good luck
Can I sleep here?
No matter what hotel I go to my father will find me.
I got no where to go Let me stay
Stay where?
In your home
No.
Not my home
- Why not?
- There's no room
Then I will sleep on the table outside
Table?
Oh You mean the wooden bed lt's going to rain today
- lt's OK
- You will lose your hair No
You are awful l let you stay in my home in Paris when you were shivering in cold I even gave you the expensive cake
You said you will buy me another one but you never did
Let me just stay for one night
What're you saying?
You can't sleep there
Let me stay
- This way?
- No, no
Please let him stay just for one night lt's OK Not a problem
Make yourself home
Yes lt's very small and cozy
Don't try to be diplomatic You mean poor, right?
Keon
He's so honest
Well I heard a lot about you from Taeyoung
What?
When did I talk about him?
Your evening dress is awesome
By the way, if you are interested investing in movies I'll tell you about...
Uncle!
Forget about it Just make yourself at home
And tell me if you need any entertaining movies lf you're uncomfortable I have my favorite clothes in my room
- You can wear that
- Ah yes
Well, my son and I have an appointment.
Keon, let's go!
How can we leave them alone?
Who would be responsible if something happens?
No one will blame you my son
Then Make yourself comfortable
Taeyoung
Eh?
Go Go?
- My shoes
- Your shoes are outside
Hey let's go
What's that cheer for?
Your uncle's hair style is quite unique
Yeah, he permed it too much
His whole life is unique
Drink

Ooh lt's hot
Why didn't you make an iced-coffee?
It's summer I was going to but
But the freezer is out of order so we don't have any ice
Are you hot?
Ah, do you want me to turn on the electric fan?
Don't you have air-conditioning?
No, the electric fan is also cool lt also consumes less electricity
Wait a minute
Can you fix that in one direction?
You mean just this way
Why didn't you say earlier?
Better?
What did you do?
The button fell out
So we use it with this
Why don't you get a new one?
What for?
We can use this for 10 more years
Where is the rest room?
The rest room?
It's there On the right
What's wrong with this?
Not again.
Wait
This doesn't open sometimes lt gets out of order lt will open soon
There.
Get in
What do I do with this?
It's the door knob from inside Just leave it on the toilet I'll fix it later
Hey!
The toilet might not flush
Then don't panic.
Open the lid of the toilet bowl lf you put your hand in the water you can grap a round rubber plug
Pull that hard.
Then the water will flush completely
- Got that?
- Yeah OK
Yeah
But I can't turn on the light Try the switch

The light bulb is a problem againi Could you turn the light bulb slightly to the right Carefully

My sister likes it I'll get changed
OK
Boyfriend
Yeah it's me I thought you threw it away
Well it's too expensive to throw away
You said cell phone is just a cell phone
That's correct
How's work at the car wash?

It's OK
Hey Soohyuk, I'm doing something right now I'll call you next time
OK
- Taeyoung
- Yes?
Uncle can't sleep on hard pillows

Why?
Something going on?
- Don't come in Don't
- Just a minute
Open the door What's wrong?
- Do I look funny?
- Ah, I'm sorry I don't look good in blue
No you really look good in it lt looks really expensive because you are wearing it
Hey girl, why is Keon so upset?
That pillow is too hard
Take this one
Yeah, it was really uncomfortable
Nice
Sleep tight Even though it's uncomfotable
Thanks lt wouldn't have been comfortable anywhere else
Good night
GD Motors President Han breaking off the engagement
- Why did you do that?
- Let's talk about it some other time
- Did father show up for work?
- Of course
He didn't say a word since yesterday
He came to work at dawn and is waiting for you
Where did you hide?
We had to run around to stop it from being published
Well it already is
I brought your clothes
Thanks Was everything okay yesterday?
This isn't something I can take care of
You have to take care of it I tried to return this
But she wants you to return it
How's your mother?
No one is fine in our family
They spent the rest of the day talking to the relatives and reporters
They're exhausted
Well, you look just fine I'm leaving
Thanks
I went there because I was worried
Me?
Or Taeyoung?
Both of you
Change your clothes, I'll leave
What is this?
I told you to stop them
- l'm sorry
- Take it away
Collect all newpapers wherever they are
Yes
You fool
How dare you stand in front of me?
You must be out of your mind I don't care about our family
But you disgraced Mr. Moon
Why didn't you ask for more time if you weren't ready?
How could you do this?
Speak if you have something to say
Why are you doing this to me?
- What?
- l was forced to marry Seungkyung I thought once was enough
Why are you doing this to me again?
How do you expect me to understand this?
You need to get married lt's all for your sake
What is Mr. Moon holding on you?
Am I making a rough guess?
You don't know what you're talking about
- What is it?
- Mrs Moon's calling
Get out I'm taking care of your mess
Do you want to listen to every words?
I'm really sorry
No, I'll visit you
Yes, I'll be waiting
Director Kim, I'm sorry to cause you trouble every time I often forget things these days
Did something happen?
Children always win over their parents
My teenage daughter is my boss at home
Bye
Maybe I should have waited little longer I was on my way to see you I guess we wanted each other
You look like you had good sleep I couldn't sleep well
Did you see the news on the paper?
I don't like it I came out too ugly
I will personally meet your father later on
I'm returning this Let's not force our relationship
My father might get along with Mr. Moon
But I could never get along with you lt's all over
I don't see it that way
This is a new beginning to me
I have engaged yesterday I don't care what others say I did
You don't understand what happened yesterday I do but I'll never accept it
And I know I do have senses, you know
Wasn't that because of Taeyoung?
Taeyoung is a good girl I've known her since high school
She always smiles and also very nice
Has nothing but very brave
But she's not for you
You are not for me
I'm not going to see your back anymore
Even if we break apart I will turn back before you do
Although it'll never happen I will keep your ring
It's me
Finally, I can reach you
Do you know how many times I've called you since yesterday?
- Why did you call?
- Because I was upset I didn't let you go so that you could marry such a stupid girl like Yoona I'm mad
But then I read the newspaper And I couldn't believe it
Did you really run away from there?
Yeah, that's what they say lt's about you Not about some stupid guy lf you're not talking about the stupid guy I must go
You sound very uneasy
Soohyuk said that you didn't go back home yesterday
Where were you?
The first person
that came to my mind after getting out of there
The first person lt's not me for sure I'm curious.
Who is it?
Do I know this person?
Let's talk about it later I have to go see my sister
Yangmi
Yes Ma'am
Do you know Taeyoung Kang's number?
Would you tell her that I want to meet her?
What is this?
Did she find out that the rich guy slept in our place?
Don't sit there so absent-mindedly
You are making me scary
I'm sorry lt's all my fault
Why didn't you call and just scream at me?
Father and Soohyuk have already done it
You are just so silent lt's scary
Look at me
Are you crying?
Stop it
I'm sorry I'm sorry There was nothing I could do for you
Don't say that I came here with my own feet to get scolded
You are supposed to yell at me and spank me I'm supposed to be sorry
I hope that my father and I die soon
So that you and Soohyuk can live happily
With just you and Soohyuk alive you can do whatever you want with your life
Was I really that bad?
To make you think that way?
No
They were, not you
This is insane
Yes come in
Come Have a sit
Would you like to have tea?
No I'm sick of teas I've had so much lately
Well but, anyway
Why did you want to see me?
Do you know that Han broke off the engagement?
- Yes
- So you know
Did you find that out from a newspaper?
- No
- Then how did you know?
Did he go to see you after he ran off?
Do you know what kind of relationship he and I have?
Yes, lovers
Lovers?
So Kijoo never told you I was once a lover and a wife
Now, I'm his ex-wife We divorced 2 years ago
Divorced?
We decided to stay friends I hope it doesn't bother you
- ls it okay?
- What is?
For you to work for me here
Me?
But you said you were not recruiting
Did Mr Han ask of this?
No I wanted to hired you
Why?
Do you not like it?
No. I'll do my best
But right now I'm working at a car wash
May I come back after I finish the work there and say goodbye?
Sure
Thank you I will leave now
Hey!
What did she say?
Did she interrogate about the rich guy?
Did you tell her the truth?
I told you not to
Well I was going to but
- She gave me a job
- Really?
Why did she change her mind so suddenly?
This is just like 'Sleeping With the Enemy' I don't care what it is I'm going to do it I'll see you at home
Hiring boyfriend's girl?
I don't understand
Neither do I
Aren't you going to work?
Popcorn is burning
Then turn them over
That's your job
Let them burn then Gosh
Oh my god
Kong, your noodles are here
Yeah Noodles I'm coming
If Kong leaves us l'll be so sad I was just about to get to know you
I can't even hold you back since you got a better offer I'll visit you guys
Don't visit Come to wash your car lf you become rich and bring a big car l will give you a 50% discount
Really?
I'm not sure if that'll ever happen But I'll try lt's on me Help yourselves
And thank you very much I love it when you call me Kong I will never forget it
Why do you make her cry?
Don't worry.
You can bring a small car l'll still give you a discount I'm feeling good Let's eat
- Really?
- Of course you might even get it for free
- You must keep that promise
- Of course.
Let's eat
The noodles taste so good today
Anyway, did you hear about the GD guy?
He was on the newspaper
That's strange
He's got nothing to lose He owns GD
He's marrying only a politician's daughter
He deserves more than that
- There must be a reason
- Right
Kong, what do you think?
I don't think while I eat
And that I don't know that Han guy or whatever his name is
GD Motors President Han at his engagement
Uh?
He's here Right here
Move it.
Let me see
What?
What?
You said you don't know him He's right here
Move your noodles
Don't look lt's not worth looking I'm sure he looks like trash
Wait wait wait Let me see it
- Well he looks quite handsome
- Yeah
Maybe he loves someone else What do you think?
You know the stories like a rich guy and a poor girl I have no idea Why are you looking at me?
I really don't know this person I don't know him
Just a minute
Boyfriend
Yes, Soohyuk
Have some pickles lsn't it too greasy?
I don't like pickles
Hey, where are you?
Are you here?
Did you come to my house last night?
Why didn't you come in?
There were too many people in there
You are always welcome
Yangmi misses you a lot
Your uncle didn't have any place to go
Are you stupid?
My uncle is the president of GD Motors
There are over 20,000 employees in the only interior of a country
His words can change Korea's national income
Do you really think that he didn't have a place to go?
You know what I mean He needed a place to rest his mind
That's why I hate it
Why does it have to be your place?
Remember this?
You gave it to me
It has 20 songs in it
Do you know how many times I listened this?
6 times 20 songs I was sitting next to uncle's car all night long
I'm tired of waiting I'm not waiting anymore
Not after what happened last night
Soohyuk!
I need to go somewhere And I think I'm late
There is something I must return
I'm sorry I'm really sorry
We'll listen to the music together next time we meet
Bye
Hello
- Mom
- Yeah
Who is this?
Did you come to meet my daughter?
Who is she?
Your friend?
This is Taeyoung, mom I told you before
Hello
Let's go Mr. Han is waiting
Go ahead I need to talk to her
Don't you have something to tell me, too?
Mr. Moon stopped me but I insisted
Please understand me lt's not a wedding based on love lt's to benefit both families
So I was expecting a little trouble
But Mr. Moon took it very seriously I've already talk to Han
He'll be visiting Mr. Moon
You should not worry too much
We don't worry so much as you do
Congressman Moon is taciturn but
As you know I'm from show business and I'm not so taciturn
If you want to keep my mouth shut Please hurry this marriage I was wondering who Yoona was like
She must be resembling you
I have a meeting very soon
I'll be waiting for good news
Did you hear about the engagement?
Of course, everyone knows I will get to the main point
- See this?
- Yeah it's a ring
That's right an engagement ring lt symbolizes that I'm Mr Han's fiancee
So stop showing up near him
And don't come here
Hey Moon I see your point but
I'll meet Mr Han and come to this place whenever I feel like
So don't get stressed if I do lt's bad for your health
- Bye
- Let me ask you one question
Hurry up
The fact that he's the president of GD Motors and his name is Kijoo Han and divorced and rides a luxury car and a male
Do you know anything else about him?
Yes
He's man who has everything but also nothing
What do you mean?
He would never have saved coins in a piggy bank
Never eaten spicy rice cakes nor hotdogs off the streets
Probably never cried out loud in front of someone
Done many things but has no great memories
Never thought about any other life besides being the president of GD
He may not even know what his shadow looks like
Because he never walks looking down
You took so much of my time I'm leaving
Yoona, I hope we can smile next time we meet
When did you get here?
Aren't you here to see me?
Why didn't you come directly to my office?
What were you talking about?
Let's go
Did he hear what I said?
Do you want some tea?
Am I a drinking machine?
What am I?
A thirsty soul?
Why is everyone trying to give me tea?
If you don't want it Just say it
That's right
Why am I gibbering?
Did you hear what I said back there?
What?
Did you talk behind my back?
No I didn't I don't talk behind people's back...
Maybe, I do but I wasn't back there
No Never
What's that?
Why didn't you take it?
I came to return this
Did you come here to just to return that?
No
Actually, I was worried
You left without eating breakfast So... I used this as an excuse to come here
But you seem to be fine I shouldn't have worried
Keep on working I will leave
I left it intentionally
To use that as an excuse to see you again
Did Mr. Han really break off the engagement because of Taeyoung Kang?
- There are rumors
- Ms. Park!
What is your job?
There are times when you should stay quiet even if you know something Don't you know?
I'm sorry
Sir
He's in the middle of a meeting lt might take long l'll tell him as soon as he's finished
You forgot to say who he's metting with
Episode 11 I had fun
Take care of my piggie
Aren't you saving coins?
I'll bring them to you
Save them for me
What will you do when it's full?
Well, we'll get more snack
Directed by Woochul Shin, Junghyun Sohn
Soohyuk I came at the right time
Sorry uncle
Why do you have to come now?
I wanted to see Taeyoung
We have something to talk about
I asked him to meet I wanted to tell him something
Why are you making an excuse?
You don't need to
Then what should I do?
Just like you always did
No surprises, no excuses
Just like you did
Soohyuk
Do you know why I'm always carrying this?
It's because I have to wait for someone
Do you remember how many songs were stored in this?
20 songs But now there are 40
Because I need to wait a little longer
4 minutes for one song 40 for 10, 160 for 40 I listen to this for a few times and I can spend a whole day
I'm sorry
About what?
For making you lose your smile
You weren't like this before
You were always smiling
But you're not anymore I think I made you this way I'm sorry
Soohyuk, wait
Taeyoung I don't know why you are sorry to me
And I don't know why I'm sorry to uncle
Why should I be sorry for liking someone?
That makes me angry l'm so angry that I can't look at you
Because then I'll be sorry
I thought you were not coming here anymore I was concerned that you might be worried about Kijoo
Why are you concerned about it?
Kihye I've wanted only you all my life
Well you shouldn't I'm so regretful for what I did I thought I could have you I never knew lt'd end like this lt's my fate
And my fate
Let's talk for a second
Why do you keep coming?
Have your coffee lt's very humid I don't want you to see my mother
So have you decided to work for your grandfather?
Are you curious?
About me working there?
You've grown up and lt'd be nice for you to help him and help me
Do you need my help?
Help with what?
You and grandfather had fun playing around with that company
Your uncle is on it now I'm just an old man
You should use your talent
And be ambitious
Power can get you anything
Money, honor, women
Do you keep in touch with your father?
It's none of your business, and
Never look at my mother like you did back there again
I'm sure you'd hate it
But I'm not embarrassed about it
A Man only needs power to get a woman
You should give it a try
You can't always live behind Kijoo
Well you always lived behind my grandfather
Yes, and I had enough
What do you mean?
Think about working lf you want I can help you I'm leaving
We have guests coming from Japan
How long are they staying?
For a month
Mr. Choi is taking full charge for their everyday schedule
He always likes it his way lt seems like he's going to affiliate this project with them I make the decisions Let's go
Anyway, do you know Japanese?
Do you think I'm a superman?
Welcome to our company I received your mail
This is the new model
This is our company's new model
This is a photo
This is a color photo
Color photo
This man is Soohyuk Yoon
He is my nephew
Man only needs power to get woman
You should give it a try
You can't always live behind Kijoo
Are you still up?
What are you thinking about?
Nothing I had a rough day
Uncle
Have you ever asked anyone for a favor?
I'm not sure
Usually an order is much more affective I see I always asked for favors
If you're the son of grandfather and the owner of GD motors
You'd never have to ask for a favor, right?
I think so
Then I could never be like you
Let me ask you for a favor
Not right now but later
What is it?
Tell me I might not have to
But if I do please do it for me
You're the only one who could do it
Please uncle
Why should I be sorry for liking someone?
Kijoo I was going out for outdoor duty I'm writing the movie column Taeyoung used to write
You don't have to tell me
Did you hear that your parents and mine are having a lunch together?
I don't care
Since we're engaged
They'd be talking about the wedding date
Why don't we have lunch together and go over things?
Do you go out at night?
What are you talking about?
If you go home early
You'd have plenty of time to go over them
Don't you understand the situation?
I'm sure I went over mine Do yours
Enjoy your popcorn
No, no, no, no, no
Not that
Our logo must be shown, like this
Wasn't I right?
This is just the same
Hyunwook, look
This, and this How are they the same?
I'd like to ask you a question I think this and this looks quite the same I don't understand what the difference is
Good for you
When did you get a new job?
Do you have a GPS planted on me?
You're so good at finding me
No, I'm here for work I'm writing your column now
Ok I don't think you'd understand any movies here
But I personally suggest that one
That might bring you back the innocence of a child innocence You definitely need that
So do you
You steal someone's man You're not so innocent
Steal?
Watch your words
Hey, movie is over Let's hurry
Supervisor I'll go clean
See you later, Hyunwook
Could you go somewhere else next time?
Move, I need to go
Who is she?
The woman Mr.Han almost got engaged with I can see temper in her eyes I see more than that
She needs to make her eye line softer
- Definitely softer - eye line?
With a light touch on her cheek
She needs to learn
Why do we always have unwanted guests?
Isn't Soohyuk ever coming?
The drummer guy doesn't know I work here
Didn't you tell him?
Why did he come here then?
Was he here?
When?
After Mr.Han snatched you away yeterday
Really?
It's because you and Mr.Han are...
Let go in
Thank you for coming
Look at this
Please, don't do that
- Sweetie, would you let go?
- You shouldn't touch that
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing here?
I'm here to see a movie
What a coincidence!
We were just talking about you
Was Taeyoung talking about me?
No, I was.
Not her
You missed me I'll come more often since Taeyoung is here
Anything I can do?
- Yes
- No
I wanted to take a picture Just for a test I'll be cleaning the hallway lt was nice seeing you
It's that smile I was almost forgetting but I saw it again
How can I ever forget?
Gosh
Why did you leave like that?
I was so surprised
Why didn't you call me then?
I had your ice cream and had a stomachache I shouldn't have left it
Exactly
Did you hear about me from Ms.Baek?
Yeah ls that why you came to see me yesterday?
No, I heard that uncle took you out
And I got so jealous
So I went there but I had no excuse
But I didn't want to show my jealousy
That's why I started to argue with you
Forget about it
Didn't you ask me to listen to this together?
There were too many songs I listend to it all night
Soohyuk I read this in a book
Do know 'hope torture'?
What is it?
The best thing one can do for someone who loves her is of course loving him Loving each other
Right?
But if she doesn't love him
She shouldn't leave any hope for him
Because even the smallest hope can be a tremendous torture to him
That's why it's called hope torture
Isn't that so weird?
It just came to my head
Are you blaming her for this?
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you I don't know what you're thinking but
Don't even think about hurting her
She seems strong outside but she's very vulnerable inside
- Change that a little
- Yes ma'am
And move that sign to somewhere else
How are you?
What are you doing here?
I came to see you
And I want to buy my mother some clothes
You must be tough I thought you'd be crying
What's her size?
You don't like me, do you?
I know you don't
But I don't blame you I just want to do better
But that doesn't change anyone's mind I heard Kijoo showed a girl to his father
She's my classmate I know her pretty well l was just seeing her
But I think she's also seeing another man
Please tell Kijoo about that
Aren't you meeting my parents today?
They're looking forward to this marriage
Please be generous
I was busy at the congress and I thought you were taking care of everything so I waited but after talking to my daughter things looked a little hectic
That's why I asked you to come I should have called you ahead of time
People say I am benefitting from this marriage
But what do they know?
I had trouble keeping my mouth shut all these years and still hear these things
As you already know I am very good at taking care of things
How long has it been?
With the consent and the document work I had done a lot of things and that way you could
Laywer Moon
Not anymore He's a congressman now
How many years have passed by?
Kihye
Wait, father I should say this
What you're doing is nothing but a threat
Yes, it is.
A threat
What we know can be quite damaging to GD Motors
This threat is nothing
What would stockholders do if they find out the truth?
Do whatever you want
End everything right here
Kihye, would you be quiet?
Why can't you stand up to them?
I can't stand these people
Your daughter must have changed her mind I believe it'll be better for all of us to think over this matter
Welcome l received your mail l'm looking forward to your visit
They want to thank Mr. Choi for his unlimited hospitality during their last visit I don't know what he did in the past
But lt'll be different this time
How much do they know about our new model project?
Since today is their first day We should give them a rest
Tell them
Since it's a long visit
You should take time and talk about business later on
This is an urgent matter for us
The purpose of this visit has to do with our new project's affiliation
Aren't they being too relaxed?
They believe you are rushing things
They say that they visited us many times
But they never started discussing on the first day
Aren't Korean women pretty?
Korean women pretty I see what kind of hospitality you're talking about
Well then, enjoy the sightseeing!
Seems like we won't be talking until the last day
But what you are spending here is costing me You should remember that
And hope you don't make this visit a worthless time ln addition, I don't feel the need to continue this project with such relaxed people
Tell them
Yes, sir
You shouldn't
What did you say?
Japanese companies have been our partner for a long time lt's not something you can throw away and switch overnight ls that an advice?
It's something I've learned from my own experience I surely know you have done a great job maintaing a relationship with Japanese
But we don't always need the same partner
We tried Japanese How about French?
Call France
Yes, sir
How did it go?
What does that mean?
Aren't Korean women pretty?
It took me all night to memorize
Yes I'm at your company I want to go in there
But I'm afraid I might see your father I was passing by and wanted to see you I wanted to tell you that I was disappointed
Because you'll be coming to see a woman which kind of makes me sad
Don't be I thought we were good friends
Why are you acting differently?
Friends have jealousy, too I want some attention from my ex-husband ls that wrong?
Yes, it is
We share same phone number I should change that
Yes, you should I was going to tell you that
Are you going to share it with your girlfriend?
Come on
What are you doing?
I thought you were through with cars
Well I am just testig my skills
See if I can still handle it
Sure you can Look at this drawing
So will you give me one of the new cars?
One of them?

We should be helping each other
This new car is giving me a hard time
Do you know what I mean?
I do
Think about it
This is Yoona We should meet I don't think we need to
There is someone I want to show you I think you've called the wrong person I'm not interested, bye
Taeyoung is with me Are you sure?
Am I drunk?
You've only had two cocktails
Then why am I seeing Yoona?
I asked your assistant where you were
Why don't you introduce me to your friends?
You're the one who almost engaged with Kijoo
Yes, we had an unexpected delay
We're setting a new date
Nice to see you

You two enjoy And we'll enjoy our time
Let's go upstairs They have quiet places
Get your hands off

Why don't you take care of your fiancee?
Didn't I tell you?
I told you to get your hands off my woman
Did you just hit me?
You're dead
You'll never beat me
You never beat me for 33 years You never will I was going to break your hands
But this woman saved you
Be careful not to run into me when you are alone, ok?
Stop, why are you following them?
What more do you need to give up?
Why?
Why were you just standing there?
Are you dumb?

How would I among those people?
What would they think of you?
I can't embarrass you for my little pride
How would I?
CHANGING TIMES
Where's everybody?
-You know, it's Sunday.
-What do you mean, it's Sunday?
You know we need to get things moving.
Why aren't they working?
Let's go!
Hurry up!
Thank you.
Welcome to Tangiers.
I am Nabila Balouch.
Hello, Nabila.
-Did you have a good trip?
-Yes.
Things didn't go well in Marbella.
They disagree with the estimate.
Is that your only luggage?
Yes, I am not a tourist.
I am a traveler.
One of the issues we had with this project was to design a perfectly insulated building.
It's only 550 yards from an airport supporting big commercial airplanes.
So, the facade is insulated with double-glazing windows, the interior has false ceilings made of mineral flagstones, and, for the most part, the stones on the floor are carpeted.
Christian is better suited to tell you how things are going inside the building, on the technical side.
How does last minute information get broadcasted live?
Where are the teleprompters and the telexes?
Are they at the same level?
By the way, you haven't forgotten the flowers?
A daily bouquet since last week.
-No signature.
-That's perfect.
Roses every time, right?
Yes, but you haven't told me which color.
-I thought red was too daring.
-Be daring then, Nabila.
So light will go through the window anyway?
Yes.
There will be light, but it will be dimmed.
Behind the window, we'll have blinds, something like that.
This building must be able to function 2 4/7.
Is it facing north?
Yes, it is facing north, but its two main facades... .
The land we have chosen for MEDI 1 S A T is located in the northwest area of the Tangiers' Free Zone, bordering the airport.
It has a surface of 1 92,800 square feet, which gives us enough space for our main building.
Construction and equipment techniques chosen to build MEDI 1 S A T were designed to insure the durability of the investment.
Walls and curtains built with lacquered aluminum structures, mounted with double-glazing dimmed windows, full walls or covered with plastic coated sheet metal cladding.
In the western wing of the building, an 820-square-feet set is dedicated to live news broadcast.
It communicates with a control room, processing sound, image, light, and external broadcasting.
Cecile, I don't want to show my face.
Or at least not yet.
I am afraid you won't recognize me.
It would be nice if you closed your eyes.
That way you would only hear my voice.
Every night, I hear yours on the radio, I look at the city, and to me, you and the city become one.
Now, the moment has come to...
Shit.
That's bad.
You cut your hair?
Good idea.
You look better that way.
With or without curls My style is right
You know, I didn't come alone.
I came with Nadia.
You could have told me.
I thought you would be happy to know her.
It's been so long.
Well, sure, but not like this.
You're impossible.
You put people in front of the situation, and you let them deal with it.
Anyway.
It's all right.
Where is she?
She's afraid to come out.
Come on.
Hello, Nadia.
It's very nice meeting you.
Better late than never.
Hello, Rachid.
How old are you?
Nine and a half years old.
My name isn't Rachid, right, mom?
His name is Said.
I didn't know you were coming, but let's celebrate.
Nadia came to see her sister.
Are you sure she's coming?
Of course she is.
I'll wait for her.
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.
I feel bad leaving you here.
I'm fine.
Go ahead.
Seriously.
We'll go have an orange juice.
I'm sure her sister won't come.
Do you mind if she stays with us?
Honestly, Sami, I would have preferred if it didn't happen this way.
It's very simple.
Just say yes or no.
I am the one who has to make the decision?
Well, ask your father.
It won't be a problem, then.
He has always respected my freedom.
Right, and to you, freedom means imposing your whims on others.
Don't start, please.
We'll end up doing what you want anyway, as always.
I'll go get her, then.
Don't stay here.
It's ridiculous.
Something must have come up.
It happens.
I have her cell phone number.
She'll answer the phone at some point.
Stop it, Nadia.
You've been leaving messages for a week.
If she wanted to talk to you, she would have done it already.
Don't say that.
I know her better than you do.
Fine.
Meanwhile, come to my parents' house.
It'll be easier.
No way!
I've already told you that.
At least for tonight.
We'll figure it out tomorrow.
Where's the lady?
She's waiting for us in the car.
Is she your mommy?
Yes, she is.
Why did she call me Rachid?
She made a mistake.
What's her name?
Cecile.
It was a floating island, surrounded by an indestructible bronze wall, with a smooth rock pointed at the top.
Twelve children were in the palace.
They were born in Eole.
Six boys and six girls in their blooming youth.
What does "blooming" mean?
It means they were opening like flowers.
Like you.
I am not an opening flower.
I'll continue reading.
On the island, Eole's daughters had married his sons.
The most diverse meals...
Why aren't you coming?
Are you hiding?
I am not hiding.
I didn't want to interrupt.
It's 8:00 pm, anyway.
I have to run to the station.
I left the window open.
The eastern wind has calmed down.
But if you would rather close it... .
No, it's okay.
Above all, make yourself at home.
You promise?
Yes, madam.
Madam?
Don't call me madam!
Come on, Nadia.
Don't be anxious like this.
I am very happy to have you here.
Good night, Said.
Well, I am going out for a bit.
Can you give me a ride to town?
If you want to.
See?
I told you things would go well with my mother.
She's overdoing it.
It makes me uncomfortable.
She's always distant, so she's making an effort to be affectionate.
It comes off as clumsy.
Did you see?
Your parents put us in the same room.
So?
We've slept together before, right?
Okay, I'm taking off.
Already?
You didn't even unpack.
You want me to stay with you?
No, it's okay.
I feel a little uncomfortable to be alone in this house with your father.
Don't worry.
He doesn't talk much.
You don't even have to greet him.
-What is this?
-My toys.
We could give them to Said.
What do you think?
You don't want to dive in?
No, thank you.
Actually, I'll just walk.
Come on.
Stay a little longer!
You're always running away.
Shouldn't we try to talk a little?
Talk about what?
I don't know.
Talk about you, your life.
It's only normal.
You call once in a blue moon.
You're exaggerating.
I always tell you what's going on.
I'm not mad at you, Sami.
I just want to understand.
There's nothing to understand.
What about Nadia?
Said?
This is news to me.
I told you we lived together in Paris.
It's not a surprise, is it?
What time is your show?
In 1 0 minutes.
I'll never get there on time.
Just walk.
I'll take the car.
I'll leave it on the parking lot.
No, keep it.
I'll take a taxi to go home.
You didn't tell me how long you were staying, you and your friends.
Is ten days all right?
Last time, you didn't last a week.
May I remind you that you were never around?
You want people to be here, and you're always somewhere else.
I hate you!
Wait a second!
Nadia?
Aicha?
Hold on.
I left a ton of messages.
You could have called me back.
Calling cell phones is expensive.
I can't afford it, especially foreign cell phones.
So, are you here?
Yes, Sami took me to his parents' house.
But I would much rather stay at your place, because...
You can't stay at my place.
It's too small.
Hold on.
Nadia?
Nadia?
What's going on?
Are you ill?
No, I'm fine.
So what's new with you?
Not much.
I need to pay for mom's hospital treatment, so I work overtime at McDonald's.
I sleep.
I work a lot.
What about you?
Did you bring your son?
Of course.
I can't wait for you to see him.
Please be discreet.
Don't come by my work.
They don't know I have a twin sister.
Besides, I don't want them to ask questions about you or your life.
You know how people are over here.
This is not Paris.
Don't worry.
What time do you get off?
It depends.
Never before midnight.
That's late for a child.
Listen, I think we should do this some other time.
What do you mean, "some other time"?
I haven't seen you for six years, and that's all you can say?
Listen, I just got off work.
I only get five hours of sleep.
I'm completely exhausted.
I understand that you're tired, but still... .
Listen, Aicha.
If you don't want to see me ever again, please be honest about it.
Well, okay, then.
I'll be honest.
I don't feel so well, and I don't have the strength to see you.
I am afraid it will hurt me.
I need to learn how to live without you.
When I succeed, I promise we'll see each other.
I'm sorry, Nadia.
I love you very much.
I'll call you back.
You have oversized the structures.
We had to, because of earthquake hazard.
-What level?
-Level three.
What's that?
Is this how far you got with the drilling?
-Yes.
-Get going then.
We've already lost two weeks.
All right.
Look, here.
I trust you to get things moving.
Give me the number.
Okay.
Let's check the measurement.
That's no good.
Follow me, my friend.
To my wife and all my friends in Algiers.
To my fiancé, Youssef, who went to work for an insurance company in Casablanca.
Dedicating this song to my love.
I want to dedicate this song to all my friends who will recognize me.
Walid, Karim, Omar, as well as my whole family.
Even if I don't see them often because we're far away,
I hold them close to my heart.
Walid, Karim, Omar, as well as my whole family.
To all Reggae fans and to the Tangiers soccer team.
To all Reggae fans and to the Tangiers soccer team.
After listening to this song, we will listen to the news with Patrice Martin.
After this song, we'll give you the news.
It's better to think of nothing Than not to think at all
Nothing is already something
It's already a lot
We don't remember a thing And since we forget it all
Nothing is better
Nothing is better than anything else
I say "he," but maybe it's a woman?
I don't know.
Give them to someone, sell them.
But, please, dear, stop talking about it.
If I were you, I would die to know who it is.
Are you sure you don't want me to ask the flower shop?
Are you crazy?
Anonymous gifts are like anonymous letters.
It's blackmail.
Give them to me.
It's too bad.
How is Sami?
It's hard to know with him.
Resolution 1 546 was voted earlier at the UN headquarters in New York.
Iraq is scheduled to recover its sovereignty on June 30th.
Where are the dogs?
It's lunchtime for them.
So you finally made up your mind?
Hi, Bilal.
-Don't just stand there.
Come in.
-Am I interrupting?
What are you talking about?
You woke me up in the middle of the night.
I was afraid.
I didn't know if you were allowed to have friends over.
My bosses don't live here.
I see them once a year in July.
I didn't know if you wanted to see me.
I told you to come in.
Are you deaf?
The garden looks beautiful.
Can you take me on a tour?
Is that why you're here?
No.
I came for you.
Why aren't you looking at me?
Well, there.
I am looking at you.
You want one?
No, I quit smoking, drinking, and going out.
I quit everything.
Even sex?
That's the only thing you have in mind.
I don't care.
I could do without.
I don't believe that.
See?
I don't need anything.
I live like a king here.
I make 2,000 dinars a month.
A garden, a swimming pool, a view of the sea.
That's true.
I couldn't give you all that in Paris.
Don't start again with Paris.
It's nice to visit, but I wouldn't stay there.
I've always told you.
I don't want to depend on you.
Sorry for talking about Paris.
Always apologizing.
Like all Europeans.
The "love of my life" trick, is that European, too?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You know how it goes.
They pick a guy, they take him home in their luggage, and if there's a problem, they send him back to his village.
I would never do anything like that to you, Bilal.
You're too suspicious.
You need to learn how to trust people.
Trust?
That's right.
You're not honest, Sami.
What about that poor Nadia?
I don't understand what you're doing together.
I need her.
Of course, you don't know anything about connections between people.
You despise everyone.
You're wrong, Sami.
I am not looking for love.
I just want respect.
You don't know what you want.
You don't make decisions.
It's understandable, though.
Half Moroccan, half French.
Half man, half woman.
It must be hard for you to figure it out.
Where are you going?
It's time for me to go take care of the garden.
How's everyone?
Well, I'll let you work, then.
No, wait.
I want to show you something.
Look at this.
40,000 dinars.
I got a two-year financing plan.
-Isn't it beautiful?
-Yeah.
What are you waiting for?
That's why you came, isn't it?
I thought you didn't want to have sex anymore.
I don't miss it, but if I have the opportunity... .
Come on, take your clothes off.
Is this all you have?
Is it for a ring or a necklace?
I don't know yet.
I am here to help you.
But it is difficult without knowing the person.
Wait.
I have a photo.
It's an old one, but she's about my age now.
Too bad it's a black and white photo.
The color of her eyes is very important.
She has green eyes.
I need to think about it a little bit more.
Thank you very much, sir.
Why didn't Said come with us?
He prefers watching television.
Watch out with the bottles.
Double the bags.
Do you need help?
You know children don't like shopping.
Don't move.
Don't strain yourself.
I am a doctor.
Let me see this.
It doesn't seem broken.
It's only the cartilage.
You need to get some X-rays.
Breathe slowly.
With your mouth.
How do you feel?
My stomach hurts.
Does your head hurt?
I'm telling you, my stomach hurts.
I am... .
You're what?
I'm emptying my bowels.
I have the runs.
Stay back!
Don't lower your head.
Keep your head back.
Where's my savior?
Your savior's name is Nathan.
He's my husband.
He had to go.
You're not his only patient.
He really wants you to get an X-ray.
It's nothing.
I'll have a bump on my nose tomorrow.
Still pretending to be a brute?
Yes.
I am a constant guy.
That's my nature.
What are you doing in Tangiers?
I am overseeing the construction of a broadcasting center in the Free Zone.
Yes, I've heard of it.
It's an ambitious project.
It's very involved, politically.
You know, I only handle the construction part.
I need to give them the building in six months.
I don't care about the rest.
It's a TV channel that will serve all of North Africa, as a rival to Aljazeera.
It will promote moderate Islam.
Sir, may I remind you that you have an appointment at the consulting office?
And I'll remind you that the appointment is in an hour.
Yes, but you wanted to talk about the contractors' estimates before the meeting.
Very well.
I'll be right there.
Why are you laughing?
When I first met you, you were skinny and you were always talking about how you were broke and proud of it.
So?
So, it looks like you've made it, as they say.
Your family didn't come with you?
No, I'm single.
I'm the same as when we met.
You never got married?
No.
Why?
Oh, nothing.
Well, Antoine, I have to go, because I do have a family, and I need to take care of them.
I can give you a ride.
That's very sweet, but I don't need it.
I have Nathan's car.
But we're going to see each other again, right?
Of course, if you're here for six months, there will be other occasions.
Tell me when.
It will be easier.
I would love to have you over for dinner, but I work every night after 8:00 pm, so it's not very practical.
I know.
I listen to you every night.
I used to be the news host.
That was more appropriate for me, but I need to make a living, so...
So, when do we see each other?
Listen, Antoine, I'll let you know.
I know which hotel you're staying at.
I promise I'll call you.
What should I plan for Sunday?
The company has agreements with the Yachting club.
Would you like to go on a boat ride?
No.
I'd rather stay in the hotel.
If you refuse all entertainment, you'll end up being depressed.
There are many things to see.
The Phoenician tombs, the Caves of Hercules, Cape Spartel.
Don't bother, Nabila.
I am not interested.
What are you interested in, then?
I am paid to organize your leisure time.
I don't know what to do anymore.
You really want to do something for me?
Tell me about witchcraft.
Witchcraft?
Well, yes.
It is still practiced in your country, isn't it?
Parallel activities are not included in my job description.
I would be too scared to get fired.
Nobody will know about it.
It will be our secret.
Of course, your price will be mine.
It's not only a question of money.
It's a question of belief, knowledge.
Well, precisely.
Teach me, Nabila.
I only know the most common rituals.
Put a spell on someone or break that spell.
That's exactly what I need.
I would like someone to fall in love with me.
In the name of God... .
God is great!
God is great!
God is great!
What are you doing here, Nabila?
This is a documentary about the Gnawa Brotherhood.
There are other brotherhoods.
The Issawa, the Hmadcha.
In this one, you'll see a Lila.
It's a therapy that exorcises the demons within us.
I don't need therapy.
I am not sick.
It could set you free from that person.
I don't need to be set free.
I want to cast a spell on her.
Most spells are evil acts.
Let's be clear.
I mean no harm.
You can't possess someone without hurting him or her.
Fine.
Well, I thank you, then.
Listen, Nathan.
You should really talk to Sami.
Did you see that poor Nadia?
She's completely lost.
I don't know how you can be so unperturbed.
You didn't have to invite them.
You're impossible!
What did you want me to do?
What would you have done?
I would have welcomed them.
I would have accepted them the way they are.
That's called controlling yourself.
Nonsense.
I call that cowardice.
You're always over-dramatizing.
It's just a matter of behavior.
You should reflect on that.
It would give everyone a vacation.
The law of silence.
As always.
You're not working today?
I am.
At 1 1:00 am.
You start working later every day.
It's not my fault.
Clients don't come rushing at the door.
You have no excuse today.
Did you see the weather?
You have to make an effort to go out.
It will do you good.
I don't feel like going out.
What's wrong, Nadia?
You don't want to tell me?
It's nothing, madam.
It's just a little down phase, as Sami would say.
He's something else.
Never around.
Always out and about.
It's only normal.
He hasn't been here for a long time, so he's enjoying himself.
I hope he takes care of you a bit more than this in Paris.
I don't need anyone to take care of me.
Do you like it there?
Do you have friends?
Look, don't worry about me.
It's not a problem.
I am used to being alone.
Besides, I have Said.
You know how children are.
You don't have time to get bored with them.
Stretch your arms and push with your legs.
There.
Push with your legs.
Come on!
Come on!
Like that?
Is that okay?
Are you cold?
No, I'm fine.
So, how was it?
It was awesome.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
Can I watch television?
Yes, but take a shower first.
Quiet!
Sam has agreed to do something for Norreddine, in order to help him with the issues tearing his soul apart.
Everything is blessed with incense.
Norreddine is wrapped in various cloths bearing the colors of the Gnawa.
Each color stands for one of the spirits living in our world.
Sam tries every color, because he doesn't know yet which spirit has entered Norreddine's soul, disrupting his existence.
He has also chosen a multicolored rooster for the same reason.
Sam calls the various spirits, inviting them to move away from Norreddine.
At one point, he threatens them with his knife.
Two terrorist attacks and four hostages were liberated in Iraq today.
We'll start with information given by a Polish general to the judicial authorities in his country.
Four hostages were liberated by elite units of the Coalition forces.
Soldiers were buried last Saturday with one of their compatriots, Pietro Petrucci.
I don't mean to be a party pooper, but we do need to work.
Jerk!
"To people who listen to Baid escata."
"To students at the National Business School in Agadir."
"To Rose, my dear wife, mother of the beautiful Ines."
Hey, you're lucky to have your little tribe around.
That's true.
I'm lucky.
I didn't hear from you, and it's Sunday, so I thought... .
I'm sorry, Antoine.
I completely forgot about you.
I'm sort of busy these days.
How is your nose?
Look, it changes colors.
You're exaggerating.
It's almost gone.
Would you have a glass of water?
It's so hot.
I'm really thirsty.
Sure, come in.
I'm warning you, the house is really messy.
We sort of live like nomads.
This is Rachel Meyer, my work partner.
Antoine Lavau, an old friend.
An old friend?
I don't really like that.
Antoine was my first love.
Is that better?
It seems more accurate.
It's nice to meet you.
You said you wanted a glass of water?
Yes, a glass of water with a little scotch, if you have some.
I told Cecile how much I liked your show.
All those people sending signals to each other in the night.
It makes my imagination wander.
It's always the same messages.
It's a little monotonous.
Not for me.
People's love life is the only thing I am interested in.
It's so refreshing to meet a man who isn't afraid of feelings.
Right, Cecile?
Tell me, do you think the first love can become the last love?
Don't pay attention to him.
He's crazy.
Here, take this.
You need it.
So, how's the cripple doing?
I apologize for showing up at your house like this, unannounced.
You're welcome here.
My wife's friends are friends of mine.
-Thank you.
-Don't stand like this.
Come here.
Can you serve me a drink, too?
Do it yourself, honey.
I need to work on the show with Rachel.
I married a feminist.
She doesn't let anything slide.
So how is my head?
Everything's normal.
Let me see.
Tell me, Nathan, do you receive patients in your bathing suit, now?
Please go ahead, doctor.
It doesn't bother me.
I have to say, I like to spend my Sundays naked.
Your friend is less of a conformist than you are.
What kind of lotion are you using?
"Morning Care" by Clarins.
The pharmacist recommended it.
That's just cosmetics.
It doesn't heal the bruise.
So?
Not too disoriented in Tangiers?
Oh, you know, I travel a lot.
I've worked on construction sites in Mali, Turkey, in the Philippines.
I even lived in Chile for two years.
Well, if you're staying for a while, it's silly to stay in a hotel.
There are plenty of houses to rent around here.
Cecile didn't tell you about it?
It would be nice, but I don't want to abuse your generosity.
I'm sure she could help you.
Right, Cecile?
Thank you.
You're embarrassing me.
What do you do in the evening?
Absolutely nothing.
May I use the restroom?
They're at the end of the hall.
Pardon me.
Your friend looks a little lost.
Should we have him stay for dinner?
Don't you think there are enough of us already?
Listen, Cecile.
Is he your friend or not?
Of course he is.
But we don't have that much food, and we're not done yet.
We have to be at the station in an hour.
As you wish.
Would you mind putting some clothes on, Nathan?
I'll jump in one last time.
"To students at the National Business School in Agadir."
I like the one from Montreal.
I want to dedicate this song to Moroccans living in Montreal.
"My brother, my sister... . "
I don't understand this one, but if you do...
"I miss the family a whole lot."
"To my neighbors and friends in the community."
Come swim with me, Said.
No, I don't want to go.
You're scared!
I know it.
You're scared!
Come on.
That's it.
Let go.
There you go.
You like it?
How far are we?
Two or three miles.
It's beautiful.
You'll see.
It's worth the effort.
If you like it so much, why don't you rent it yourself?
I can't afford it.
The windshield is filthy.
It really doesn't matter.
By the way, how old is your husband?
He's younger than me.
-Why are you asking?
-No particular reason.
How is the retirement situation here?
What kind of question is that?
You want to know if we make a good living?
Not really, Antoine.
Well, with your job at the radio...
You know, my job at the radio... .
They give priority to Moroccans, which is understandable.
Besides, I don't speak Arabic.
Well, what... ?
That's all we needed.
Are you trying that old trick on me?
Please, Antoine.
It's not funny.
Doesn't look like there's much traffic on this road.
Nathan probably tried to work on the car again.
Look at this.
He replaced the fuse with a piece of wire.
-Is it serious?
-What an idiot.
I shouldn't have washed the windshield.
The water created a short circuit.
I could have ruined the wiring harness.
Well, I didn't know you were such an expert mechanic!
I had to learn, Antoine.
I don't have a driver.
I feel like you're giving me grief for having money.
It's tiresome.
Are you going to be able to fix it?
No.
We need a mechanic.
Can I use your cell phone?
For once that we were alone, I didn't want to be interrupted.
I don't have my phone, either.
I always forget it.
So what do we do?
Well... .
I'll show you the house, anyway.
Come with me.
We'll take the shortcut.
What are you thinking of?
Nothing in particular.
I'm thinking I would like us to get lost, where nobody could find us.
No risk of that over here.
You can always find your way by looking at the sea.
Look, right over there.
It's strange, but I have the feeling you completely forgot about me all these years.
It's only normal.
I don't live in the past.
I have a life, Antoine.
You saw that.
Alas, I did.
For me, it's the opposite.
Absence brought me closer to you.
As time passed, I missed you even more.
You want me to believe that you have missed me for 30 years?
3 1 years, eight months, and 20 days, to be precise.
But I always knew I would see you again.
It's a coincidence, Antoine.
Oh, no, it is not.
I looked for you.
What do you think?
One day I found out that you lived here.
The hardest part was to be sent to Tangiers.
It took some time.
I did everything I could.
Anyway, I couldn't come any sooner.
I don't really understand what you're getting at.
We said we would love each other all our lives.
You don't remember?
What are you talking about?
I am sure you loved other women.
I am not talking about sex.
It has nothing to do with it.
Love doesn't change like one changes partners.
What do you want from me, exactly?
I want to grow old with you.
You're completely nuts, my poor Antoine!
I knew you would say that.
It doesn't matter.
I don't want to force it on you.
I will wait.
Did you send those flowers?
Yes, I knew you liked roses.
I am happy you understood.
Listen, Antoine.
If you want to see me again, don't talk about any of this.
We're not 20 anymore.
Passion is behind us.
All right?
Fine, as you wish.
What's ahead of us, then?
Nothing.
It's like this forest.
It stops here.
Beyond, there's a cliff.
There's nothingness.
That's not true.
It isn't nothingness.
There's the sea.
And look, there's a ferry crossing.
Over there, there's some fog.
Behind the fog is Spain, and Spain is the beginning of Europe.
Stop it, Antoine.
You're tiring me.
I even forgot why we came here.
You wanted to show me the house.
That's right.
The house.
It's that one.
Don't look at them like that.
They'll feel obliged to do something.
You knew they were there?
Of course.
I saw them.
They know they have nothing to fear from us.
We're just two lovers.
Between police raids and robbers, I don't know how they survive.
Maybe they survive because they have a goal.
To reach Europe.
This is the last stop before paradise.
Is Cecile home?
She went shopping with Said.
Is Sami still asleep?
You want me to wake him up?
No, I came to see you.
Did you write this?
Are you out of your mind?
The pharmacist knows my handwriting.
There aren't that many doctors here.
She refused to serve me.
I'm not surprised she called you.
Do you often take that kind of crap?
I am an adult.
I can do whatever I want.
Let's talk about this with Sami.
Let me go!
You're hurting me!
Listen, Sami.
Either you keep an eye on your friend or you leave.
What the hell is going on?
Don't yell at me.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Come with me.
Go ahead.
That girl is a wreck.
And she has a kid, on top of it.
You're completely irresponsible.
Calm down.
Tell me what's going on.
What's going on is that she's loaded on pills.
It's dangerous.
She steals my prescriptions, too.
I'm tolerant, but this goes beyond the acceptable.
Are you all right?
Don't ask me if I'm all right every five minutes.
Yes, I am all right.
Mommy's hands are cold.
Then let me carry you.
So how does it feel to be tall?
The lady read me a story about giants last night.
I'd like to meet one.
Giants don't exist anymore.
Only midgets still exist.
Otherwise, humans are the same height.
How tall do you think I will be?
As tall as you?
I don't know.
It's too soon to know.
When can you know?
You know it when it happens.
Come on.
Let's fly!
You don't want to play soccer?
No, I don't know these guys.
That way, you'll get to know them.
You want to play on the slide?
No, that's for little kids.
Why don't we go to the beach?
Your mommy can't handle the sun.
Why did we come here?
So you could have fun.
I prefer watching television.
Vacation is not for watching television.
I can't believe you still haven't been to the sea.
I don't want to go with the lady.
Why don't we go?
Just you and me?
Don't bother him with that.
He doesn't have time.
He has things to do.
It's the same in Paris.
You never do anything with me.
Can I go over there?
Yes.
Be careful not to fall.
Do you want to go back to Paris?
I don't want to stop you from seeing Bilal.
Bilal is just a fling, you know.
He's not essential.
You're the most important thing.
Seriously.
Would you rather stay or go back to Paris?
I am unable to make any decisions.
Okay, let's go back.
I'm making the decision.
Sometimes, I feel like I'm ruining your life.
Are you kidding?
If I didn't have you, I don't know what I would do.
You would live with a boy.
Don't say that.
I'm happy with you.
Seriously.
Why are you wearing this much makeup?
I looked dead this morning, so I added a little color.
What are you doing?
Cleaning the swimming pool, as I do each year.
So you'll put a tarp on it, and we won't be able to swim anymore?
There are still some nice days in September.
Once again, I do something, and it's wrong.
I was surprised, that's all.
I'm sorry.
I need to give an answer about Casablanca.
Go ahead, if you want.
I've already told you I didn't want to live there.
It could be a good thing, you working in Casablanca and me working here.
At least, we would see each other only when we wanted to.
Routine destroys relationships.
Don't use that old tired argument.
All I see is a better financial situation.
This month, I am completely broke.
What do you mean?
I gave Sami some money for Nadia.
She needs to go to rehab in a proper institute, where they can do a good follow up.
What about the kid?
Will Sami take care of him?
Yes, the time for her to recover.
Do you see Sami raising a child?
He will learn.
He'll figure it out, like everybody else.
Sure, let him deal with it.
I think you don't really care.
I do care.
I talked about it with him.
We get along well.
I noticed.
You keep smiling at each other.
We understand each other.
It looks like it bothers you.
It bothers me because it's fake.
You don't know anything about Sami.
You don't even know he likes boys and you're talking about understanding.
What?
He likes boys?
Did he tell you that?
No, but I've known for a long time.
And how do you know that?
You've seen him have sex with a man?
Don't over-dramatize.
I know because I watch him.
I pay attention to him.
It's important to know these things.
Maybe we should talk about it with him.
I don't want to talk about that crap.
It's pointless.
You're not going to cop out?
It's your son, after all!
My son, my son.
What does it mean?
Don't get on my nerves with this!
Stop yelling!
We can't even have a simple and direct conversation in this house.
Listen, Cecile.
This is simple and direct.
If you want to get involved in your son's sex life, it's your problem.
I consider that it's none of my business.
I'm going out.
I am not sleepy.
I am dedicating this song to all my friends in the neighborhood.
Youssef Borki, Issam, Adissad Gaza, Younes, Aissa, all my family, and my friend Salma.
To my love, Ghizlane, I love her very much.
-Absolutely.
-It's not the first time.
Hello.
I hope I'm not bothering you.
Not at all.
I just wanted to see how it's done.
-You want some coffee?
-No, thank you.
Come here.
I dedicate this beautiful song to my mother, my father, my sister, Anna, and my little brother, Zacariah.
You're lucky.
We have great songs tonight.
... ifyoudon'tknowmyname.
Thank you.
And here is a song requested from Germany.
-Get out of here, Antoine.
Out!
-But...
There are no "buts."
I am tired of you imposing yourself.
You come to my house without warning!
Now you show up when I'm at work!
That's harassment!
You seem on edge.
Shut up, Antoine.
Leave!
I don't want to see you anymore!
Never!
This song was requested by Aydan, to all her family and friends.
Now we're going to listen to "Okam Bale" by Angelique Kidjo.
And here is the song by Angelique Kidjo.
It's the fourth version of the British-American resolution presented to the UN.
The Americans hope for a vote.
They're hoping, but nothing is done.
It's the fourth reunion...
On site, two individuals were found dead.
Cecile!
You see, he's not here.
Look, Rachel.
I know him by heart.
He won't give up so easily.
The only thing he's interested in is making a mess of my life.
I'm sure he's hiding somewhere.
As you can see, there is nobody out.
Where's your car?
I took it to the mechanic.
It broke down.
Can you give me a ride?
No problem.
I can't believe you're so nervous.
All this for a ghost.
A ghost.
Do you think you can safely see a ghost you were madly in love with?
I don't know what happened between you two.
You never wanted to talk about it.
So you were madly in love with him?
Yes.
It was both lust and love.
I never found that with any other man.
I have desired Nathan.
He gave me a lot of pleasure, but I could never really love him.
I see him as an enemy.
-Let's close it.
It's cold.
-Thanks.
One, two, three.
Come on.
You should sleep with Antoine.
That's the only way to end it.
It happened to me in New York.
Some guy I hadn't seen for 1 0 years.
We met randomly, we spent a night together and after that, we realized that it was over.
There was nothing left between us.
We said goodbye without pain, feeling a great relief.
It has nothing to do with Antoine.
It's not about sleeping with him.
It's something else.
I have the feeling that after all these years, he came to find me in Tangiers to claim what he is owed.
Place your bets, please.
Four.
Six.
The bets are placed.
Thank you.
2 1, red.
I'd like to cash out, please.
Thank you.
Good evening, sir.
20,000.
Here you go. 20,000 dinars.
Thank you.
Good evening, doctor.
I didn't know you were a gambler.
I never gamble.
I am absolutely not suicidal.
Then what are you doing here?
As you can see, nothing special.
I am drinking.
It's the only place open day and night.
It's strange how things close early in this city.
It's the same everywhere when it's off-season, isn't it?
September is still summer.
That's what my wife says.
May I?
Did she tell you how we met?
No, she just said you were in love with her when you were kids.
Kids?
Really?
She also said you were possessive and jealous.
It's only normal.
She was important to me.
She left me to marry a psychiatrist.
That guy was definitely not a kid.
He was 1 0 years older than her.
Dr. Bertrand Ferry.
Do you know him?
Yes, she lived with him when I met her.
She followed you to Tangiers.
That's not surprising.
No, first we lived in Casablanca.
That's where I am from.
I have a lot of admiration for you, doctor.
You managed to settle with her.
That was my dream.
It still is.
If I may be frank, I came to Tangiers hoping to take her from you.
I am not sure she agrees.
Did you talk to her about it?
Of course.
That's why I came.
And?
She said no.
At least for now.
She even told me I wasn't allowed to see her.
I don't know what to do.
I am not sure I can help you.
In fact, I think I'm the wrong person for that.
Obviously.
Do you love her?
After 20 years, couples are not madly in love anymore.
It's something else.
Do you ever cheat on her?
Of course.
She knows, and she has no problem with it.
That's right.
Polygamy is part of the culture.
That's not it at all.
I have one wife and several mistresses.
I also have more than one culture.
She was always in my mind, even when I was with other women.
For me, it's the opposite.
Since I live with her, I sometimes need novelty.
I don't understand why you've waited so long without writing or calling, without contacting her.
I was afraid.
You can't imagine how much I was afraid.
-Afraid of what?
-Afraid she would reject me.
Then I tried very hard to forget her, but it didn't work.
I did a lot of thinking and I thought:
"When I see her again, she'll be older, her children will be married.
My coming back may be good news, you know what I mean, some kind of resurrection."
I was wrong.
She prefers staying with you.
No.
Here you go, sir.
Let me pay for it.
I'm sorry.
Cecile, what I feared has happened.
I didn't find the words to convince you.
I thought a miracle was possible, but the miracle didn't happen.
I don't have a reason to stay in this country anymore.
I will ask to be replaced on the construction site.
I'll never be able to replace you, because the more I tried, the less I succeeded.
Today, I feel happy after seeing you again.
I managed to steal a few moments.
The time marked by the clock doesn't count, because in one look from you, one move, in the timber of your voice, I found eternity once again.
...recognize me.
It would be nice if you closed your eyes.
That way you would only hear my voice.
Every night, I hear yours on the radio, I look at the city, and to me, you and the city become one.
Now, the moment has come...
Let's not stay here.
I don't want people to see me with a stranger.
Especially not a man.
Nadia told me to give you this.
They're CDs.
Why do you refuse to see her?
Because it's not good for me, Sami.
You know, I saw the Taleb last year, when I was sick.
He told me that twin sisters have to separate once and for all, if they want to have a life.
Said and I could come eat at McDonald's.
Children love that.
That way, you'll meet him.
I am not allowed to talk to clients when I work.
You won't talk to him, but you'll see him.
Does he speak Arabic?
No, Nadia, and I speak French.
We live in Paris.
It's expected.
Is he circumcised?
You know, Nadia.
She doesn't care about religion.
What does that mean?
He's not Muslim?
He has a Moroccan passport.
I handled it myself.
Everything's fine.
Does he have your name?
No, his mother's name.
Why don't you get married?
Wouldn't it make things easier?
I don't know.
We never talked about it.
Nadia needs a real husband.
She waited too long, and she was very unlucky with men.
I disagree.
She just experienced life.
Besides, it gave her Said.
That's good, right?
I know that she's unhappy.
I know her better than you do.
I have my mother's car.
Do you need a ride?
No, I'm fine.
I am used to walking home.
It's healthy.
It was good to see you.
Take good care of her.
Now that she doesn't have a sister, I'm glad she still has a brother.
Aicha!
Nadia wanted to know how your parents were doing.
Tell her that our father went to Agadir to work during the season, and our mother stayed in the village to rest after her operation.
Here.
It's not much, but it would make me happy if you took this.
It was her idea or your idea?
Both of us.
You know what the Taleb says?
A piece of meat earned by working is worth more than a lamb offered out of sympathy.
Does that mean you don't want it?
Yes, I'll take the money.
I need it.
Thank you.
1 2 dinars, please.
One Coke, small fries.
Okay.
And a cheeseburger.
For here or to go?
Bilal!
Bilal!
Go away!
Go away!
It hurts.
You're not going to burn my leg?
It's the only way.
To do what?
You don't heal a dog bite by burning the wound.
That's torture.
I'm telling you, I've already done it.
You always think you know everything, and you know nothing.
My father taught me how to do it.
It stops the bleeding, it kills the germs, it dries the...
I don't know how to say it.
Cauterize.
You have to do it with the house key.
The house key?
What the hell are you talking about?
It keeps the bad spirits away.
Who cares about spirits?
I hope your dogs don't have rabies.
No danger.
The vet comes to check them every month.
My boss likes to do things well.
Let me see.
Stop it!
Don't do that!
It's bad enough as it is.
I don't believe in your stupid remedies, anyway.
See, you say I'm suspicious, but you're the one who doesn't trust me.
It's not the same.
I hope they won't need to amputate.
Would you sleep with me if I only had one leg?
Stop it, Sami.
If you could change one thing when we have sex, what would it be?
Sex is something we do but don't talk about.
Your motorcycle is a beast.
How fast can it go?
1 25 mph on the freeway.
But you would have to go to Larache.
Around here you can't go that fast.
How did you pay for it?
Your loan story is phony.
It's a gift.
You won't tell me?
Stop it, Sami.
I don't owe you anything.
What time do we meet?
We won't meet today.
I'm going back to Paris.
Nadia's not feeling well.
She's never well.
Why do you live with her?
I told you.
Because we get along.
You always like to invent chores for yourself.
She's a burden.
She's nice, but she's a burden.
Give her a kiss for me.
Here.
It's an open plane ticket to Paris.
It's round trip.
Come see me whenever you want.
I can't leave my job that easily.
Besides, remember last time?
It was a hassle to get a visa.
It took a while, but it worked.
You just need to do it ahead of time.
If you have proof that you're going to stay with someone, it's easy.
I don't know.
I'll think about it.
I can't promise you anything.
You know how I feel about Paris.
I would much rather be a prince here than a bum over there.
You won't be a bum.
I should go.
I wish you many good things.
See you next time.
How come you're already up?
I can't sleep.
Well, it's a good thing.
Look.
A dog bit me.
I took a taxi home.
I wanted to walk home, and bam!
Is it serious?
No.
Let's go to the pharmacy.
I'll give you a shot.
-You want some coffee?
-Yes.
What time is it?
Almost 7:00.
You still don't have a watch?
Said should wake up soon.
That kid always wakes up early.
I noticed.
He is very quiet, though.
He seems to be a very nice kid.
Not really.
He won't let anyone touch him, even his mother.
He's timid.
It will go away.
There are weather issues.
Don't wait here for two hours.
You should just go home.
I would like to talk to you for a while.
We barely saw each other.
It's always like that.
I hope you don't mind, Nadia.
We're going to the cafe.
Not at all.
How's your job?
You didn't tell me.
It's all right.
With overtime, I make a living.
You don't look too motivated.
No regrets?
No.
Two coffees.
I do regret having studied in France.
It would be hard for me to find a job here.
Every time I come back here, it's strange.
I don't know who I am anymore.
Why do you say that?
Look at your father.
He studied medicine in Paris and he works here.
It's very different.
He speaks Arabic, and he's at home here.
Besides, medicine is the same everywhere.
Whereas law... .
I heard he was offered twice his salary to work in a hospital in Casablanca.
Why don't you want to go?
When did he tell you that?
This morning.
When he gave me the anti-tetanus shot.
He's impossible.
I didn't know it was a secret.
It's always the same with you.
You want to talk, and when we talk you dramatize everything.
I am not dramatizing.
My job is here at the radio.
If I go to Casablanca, I lose it.
That's all.
I don't understand why you're clinging to this job.
Considering how little you get paid.
I'm sure it would be good for you both to have a new life.
You don't love him enough to say yes.
You think women always have to be the ones to yield?
Not particularly.
For instance, I am going back to Paris for Nadia.
She looks better just knowing she is leaving this country.
Did you notice?
It's not the same.
You're not attached to anyone here.
I do have someone.
Someone you don't know.
I don't know if you're attached to anyone.
How can you say that?
You don't think I am able to love?
I don't know.
Hello.
Antoine?
You look exhausted, Antoine.
Luckily, tomorrow is Sunday.
Unfortunately, we also work on Sundays.
We're late.
Do you have time to go have a drink?
Look at me.
I need to change.
We'll be more comfortable in your room.
If you say so.
Come with me.
You have a nice view.
I wanted to call you, but I didn't have your cell number.
Here.
Help yourself.
I really need to take a shower.
What are you doing?
I don't want you to disappear.
I won't disappear, Antoine.
I'm the one who came to see you.
I'm happy to be here.
But if you lock me in, that's not a good start.
I know you saw Nathan the other night.
Yes.
We just said hi, from far away.
Here is what I came to tell you, Antoine.
Your love story with me doesn't exist.
It's easier to love someone in your head and dream about them than deal with them on a daily basis.
You're like my friend Rachel.
Her lover lives in Rabat.
She talks to him on the phone every day, but they never see each other.
There's a song about this.
I love you even more When you're not here
Because I can dream of you
But see, I am here.
I don't like my body anymore.
My life is a mess.
But I'm still fighting, even though I lost control a little bit.
So what I'm suggesting is the opposite of what you're offering me.
I can't commit to spending my life with you, but I'd like to rest with you for a while.
Just a stop over.
And then, I'll go back to my life.
A stop over?
What does that mean?
That's what I like best in life.
You forget the purpose of your trip.
You don't think about the itinerary anymore.
You stop to rest for a while.
All right.
Let's stop over.
I would really like to change now.
Did you see my clothes?
I talk too much.
Sorry.
Turn the light off.
I couldn't miss you.
I mean, you really look like her.
Sami insisted that I see you, but he didn't tell me clearly what the disease was.
Come with me, I'll give you a ride.
That way, we'll talk about your mother in the car.
I don't want people in the neighborhood to see me with a man.
If they do, they won't respect me anymore.
Would you prefer going to a cafe?
I am not like Nadia.
I don't go to cafes.
Let's walk a little bit, then.
In the street?
Today is Sunday.
Everyone will look at us.
Can't we go somewhere quieter?
We'll try to find something.
Come with me.
Well, get in.
Help me.
With synthetic hormones, it's all about the right dosage.
Does she get her blood analyzed regularly?
Yes, every month, she goes to the hospital, in Tafraoute.
It's a little far, though.
Where does she live, exactly?
In Taouz.
That's where Nadia and I were born.
I hear it was quite an event.
They had never seen twins before.
Taouz?
I don't know where it is.
It's in the middle of nowhere, in the Ziz Valley.
Some people know it because of the stones falling from the sky.
-Meteorites, right?
-Meteorites.
There are tons of them in the area.
They've been there for millions of years.
Nothing has moved.
There's no life.
It's the desert.
This road isn't very good.
You wanted a quiet place.
-Do you have family in Tangiers?
-No.
I hope you go out, a little bit.
No, I don't like places where there are lots of people.
Nadia and I used to go to clubs.
She would dance.
I never had fun.
Now that she's gone, I prefer being by myself.
That way, boys don't bother me.
If you lock yourself up like this, you'll never meet anyone.
I don't want to meet anybody.
Men all want the same thing.
If you knew how much I hate them.
I see.
In fact, I see that you don't know them.
I don't want to know them.
Will you be shocked if I strip to a bathing suit?
No.
I like the way you laugh.
You don't want to go in the water?
No, there's too much wind.
Besides, I would have to take my clothes off.
Look around, there's nobody here.
Are you afraid of me?
No.
Look, the coast is clear today.
You can see Spain.
I'm starting to get hungry.
I thought you wanted to go for a swim.
I'll go, then.
Where's everybody?
You know, it's Sunday.
What do you mean, it's Sunday?
You know we need to get things moving.
Why aren't they working?
Let's go!
Hurry up!
Hello.
I have a meeting with Antoine Lavau.
I've been waiting for an hour.
Did he leave a message for me?
One moment, please.
-There's a woman...
-Hold on a second.
-Hello.
-Hello.
Mr. Lavau had an accident.
An accident?
After the rain, part of the construction site collapsed.
He's in the hospital.
I'll give you the address.
My son called me last night.
He's going to spend Christmas in a mountain cabin with some friends.
Otherwise, I still work with Rachel.
We've put together a new proposal.
I hope they say yes to this one.
I wonder if you can hear the rain.
It's my favorite noise.
I think he met someone, but I didn't ask.
He moved all his belongings to Casablanca.
I kept a bed, a coffee table and the sofa chairs.
That's why I can't stay for too long today.
I need to be back by 5:00 pm to wait for the workers.
They're going to put all that stuff in a storage space at Rachel's.
It will save me some money.
I'll have the same thing.
What's up?
They're taking him back to France.
Really?
I didn't know you could transport someone who is in a coma.
They won't keep him in Tangiers.
They're transferring him to a special clinic in Berck-sur-Mer, in the Pas-de-Calais area.
When do they want to transfer him?
As soon as possible.
They're saying it doesn't make sense to keep him here any longer.
Is someone going with him?
Yes.
I'm going.
He didn't have any friends of family?
I don't like it when you talk about him in the past.
I've never seen a man like him.
What do you mean?
Usually, women are the ones to fall madly in love like that.
Rachel decided to make a Christmas tree this year.
She wanted to get an early start.
This morning, we got up early.
The weather was nice.
We went to Missnana.
You remember?
That's the forest where I showed you the house.
The illegal immigrants were still there.
Maybe they were different ones.
They try their best to be anonymous, so it's hard to know.
You should have seen Rachel and me dragging the Christmas tree for 200 yards.
By the way, we had a hard time fitting the furniture in the storage space yesterday.
Especially the bed.
It was too big.
I found this underneath the box springs.
That was a crazy thing to do.
I wanted to tear it apart.
I didn't sleep all night.
Wake up.
They`re calling a roll.
Here we got a lot of time to work
Time...our work is better with time.
Our work looks good here.
Take a "mate".
Rest now.
Let me finish.
Ok.
"Zurdo" (=left handed)
Zurdo.
Eat.
Take it.
Zurdo.
Zurdo.
Zurdo.
Take it.
Zurdo.
Now I`m going.
Good luck Mr. Vargas.
Thanks.
Mr. Rene is here?
No.
Probably making some laundry.
Do you want a "mate"?
Ok.
Good.
-Taking a "mate".
-Taking a "mate".

Look, this is a letter for my daughter.

Ok.
So give it to her at Lavalle my daughter left a canoe for you.

I`m going.
Ok Buddy.
I wish you good luck.
Thanks.
Thanks.
-Don`t forget about the Maria`s letter.
-No, don`t worry.
There`s always a stumble in the life.
Men life.
It`s all paid now.
Going out, through the same door that put you in to stay for a while.
...do you cut your hair like this?
Sometimes I cut, sometimes not...
-Your hair is in good shape.
-Yes.
We`re running out of hairdressers
They will find someone.
There are many forms to cut the hair.
-Let`s go, Vargas.
-Ok.
With your permission.
Prisoner Vargas.

It`s been a long time!
They told me that you were in jail
No, I don`t remember anymore.
It`s over.
It`s all forgotten now.
I was waiting for you.
Maria left a canoe for you.
That one So you can reach her.
Ok
Bou how are you?

Yes, yes but I`forget it.
It`s all over...
I need some water.
Yes.
Sure.
Take it, Vargas.
It`s been so long...
And now you`re going back to the isles...
You`re going to see Maria.

-Can you help me?
-Of course buddy

Do you want some?
-Thanks...

On wood.
-Wood sells fine?
-Yes, yes.
So it`s good work...they pay you?
Nice work.
-They pay well?
-Yes, they pay well.
My father told me that you`re very good on wood.
Your daughter will find that helpfull.
If not, you can see Angel.
Where do you have seen my daughter?
I saw her fine.
How can I help her?
You have to go to Yacaré, so you follow down into the mouth after the curve you`ll find a path, there you follow the brook.
You`ll find her.
-Following the brook, the old one...
I will find her?
-Yes, the old brook.
So, can I borrow your canoe, Maria?
Yes.
Yes, take the canoe.
It can take me a while.
-It does not matter.
-Ok.
I`m looking for my daughter his name is Olga.
Do you know where she lives?
-She`s my mother.
-Ok
Tie it here.
There.
Where is your home?
Are you alone?
Yes.
I`m taking care of my little sister.
Your mother?
She`s gone.
The Houses of Parliament, home to British politics.
But you don't need to come here to see politics.
Politics is everywhere... everywhere... everywhere... everywhere...
Transport
Law and Order
N.H.S.
Education
Teachers moaning and that
Defense
So the next time you're walking around your town, open your eyes and see the politics that...
Sorry, mate.
Sorry...
Actually...
This illustrates my point
Look at this poor little fellow
He's really political!
Isn't he?
Let's take a closer look.
One:
He's a bit racial.
What sort are you?
What sort am I?
Egyptian by Bath.
Egyptian.
Now, you can't get more political than that, these days... 'round that sort of area.
- So, so you're wearing a fez?
- No, mate.
- Let's get him a fez.
- I'm not wearing a fez.
- Just put a little fez on...
- I'm not wearing a fez.
- It'll look really good, mate.
- I'm not wearing a fez!
I'm not wearing a fez!
So, right.
One: racial.
Two: handicapped a bit.
Is it rubbish?
Well, I'm disabled if that's what you mean.
What sort are you?
I had polio...
You can't catch it!
Ok.
So you're leg mental but not head mental.
So that's two.
Three: gay.
I'm not gay!
Well, no, no...
- You probably get what you can.
- I'm not gay!
And that's that.
Nothing to be ashamed of.
So that's three political hot potatoes all in one little weird fellow.
I'm not gay.
- Can I get you out?
- No.
Oh come on, let me see what it looks like.
- I want to see what it looks like.
- You're not right, mate.
You're not right!
- Please, come on, please.
- You're not right, mate!
You're not right!
- Let me just have a look!
- Get off!
- Come on, mate!
- Fuck off!
Come on!
- Can I have it back now?
- So you're out working for the BBC are you?
- Yep
- I'll tell you what...
- Do you want me to read you a little story?
- I'm 31, mate.
Should really be walking by now, then.
Aren't they grumpy, some of them?
Got a little hat and everything.
Still not happy.
Please welcome to the stage...
Ricky Gervais!
Hello.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Good evening.
I hope you enjoyed that little short at the beginning.
Or, Ash, as I call him.
They've got names, they've got names.
Individuals.
You're learning something already, 'cause that is totally factually accurate, that short educational film.
He is really Egyptian.
He is really disabled.
He's not gay.
He wanted me to point that out.
He is heterosexual.
In fact he's looking for a girlfriend, and wanted me to sort of do a shoutout, for any prospective wives.
How can I big him up?
The sex is shit but you can park up right next to Tesco's!
So, swings and roundabouts...
Every cloud...
Right?
I can't wait for him to see this show.
It'll be alright, he's a good sport... if the sport is table tennis.
They fucking love that, don't they?
They can't get enough of that.
You alright there?
That is high, innit?
I did the Royal Albert Hall last month and that's fucking scary.
That was good actually, 'cause that was a charity event.
And I don't do enough for charity.
I do a bit, but you can always do more.
But I look at it like this:
it's a pain, innit?
Nothing in it for me.
All the money was going to teenage cancer.
I say, all the money, after expenses, you know?
Shouldn't cost me anything, should it?
So, I went by helicopter.
Fucking brilliant!
There are so many charities these days.
I do do what I can.
But when I was growing up there was just Oxfam.
You knew where you were, know what I mean?
You've done well if you've got shares in that, that's gone from strength to strength, innit?
'Cause you're always out "famming!"
There are loads...
And you get them coming up to you in the street, with their little tunics on, and you have to cross the road, but then you get got by another set, you know what I mean?
And I've been caught about six times, and I filled them out.
Once you're caught, you fill it out.
Particularly now that I'm recognized.
So I don't get, "Oh, he was mean."
Or, spotted in Heat:
"Gervais says no to Alzheimer's!"
It's alright if it's for Alzheimer's, 'cause I go:
"We did this a minute ago, mate..."
That really worries them.
No, but you give your bank details and your telephone number.
I've had no bad experiences with that, I must say.
I have had my fingers burnt once, with a charity appeal.
It was actually in a broadsheet newspaper 'cause I thought it was quite reputable.
It was for sponsorship of a child, a Rwandan orphan.
And it had a picture of a little 10-year-old Rwandan girl and a picture of a Cabbage Patch Doll.
And I remember, it said, "Cabbage Patch Doll, 28 pounds."
"Little Zuki, just five pounds a week."
So I filled the form out and I sent it off.
And as soon as I posted it, I thought, "Fuck, if she lives till she's 18..."
"...it's costing me two grand!"
I'd have paid for the Cabbage Patch Doll outright...
But the way they worded it, they made that one look like the better deal!
It's confusion.
So, just look, be careful...
I don't want you to get stung like I did.
It can't be a con, like that one was.
Oh, dear, so yeah...
I warmed up at the Royal Albert Hall, for you.
Actually I did do a couple of Walmarts, before that.
And I just want to tell you about one of them, absolutely true story.
We did this little theater.
And we stayed in a place just outside Luton, called Dunstable.
Fuck...
It's good.
We stayed in this two-star hotel.
Me!
Full of white trash.
I don't want to deny my roots, but I'm out of that now.
I expect a little bit more.
The road manager came out and said, "I've booked you in."
"Just go straight in, just go straight through the bar, and your room's at the end of the corridor."
"Just hide out there.
No one will bother you, and I'll pick you up at 9:00 tomorrow morning."
"You'll be alright." He went, "Oh, I must warn you, there's a wedding on."
Oh, for fuck's...
And honestly, I walked in, it was loud, packed with people...
Bloke in a suit, could have been the groom, I don't care.
I walked in and he went, "Brent!"
Oh, for fuck's sake...
What's the best he thought could happen?
What was he hoping for?
That I'd hear him shout that and turn around and go, "Who said that, then?"
"That is brilliant!"
- "Was it you?" - "Yeah, it was me."
"Brent, you little sausage..."
"Did you just think of that?
Just shout it out?
That's brilliant!
Oh, God..."
"I was going to bed, but do you want to be mates?"
It's got better.
About a year ago-I work in XFM sometimes-and about a year ago
I got into the lift and just as the lift doors were closing, a bloke sort of made it.
And I think he was a workman there, a little logo on his shirt, and he clocked me and he went:
And I went:
And then he went, "Where's Monkey?"
And instead of going, "That's not me, mate, that's Johnny Vegas."
I went, "Oh, he's at home."
But he started going, "I think you were brilliant in those," and I was going, "Thanks very much!"
But I can't complain, I have had a good year.
Went to America at the beginning of the year.
Won a couple of Globes, thank you very much.
No, no, I'm not saying that to show off.
- "Brent!"
- Cunt...
I'm telling you to compare it with the week I had before I went to America.
And that wasn't such a good week.
I was sitting at home, and it was about the second week of January...
I was watching telly, and there was that program "Celebrity Stars and Their Doubles," with Dale Winton.
Yeah, sure, there was a Brent lookalike who won his category.
Just a fat bloke.
He had a tie and a goatee...
just a fat bloke.
The most like Brent in the world.
Unbelievable.
About 45, about 18 stone...
In fact he was so fat, that when he got up to get his award off Dale, he actually had that fat bloke waddle.
And Dale Winton said:
"You even walk like Ricky Gervais!"
Not even Brent anymore.
Just a fat bloke he was, then.
So I've started wearing black all the time now.
I've got a complex.
It's slimming.
It works!
Pavarotti always wears black, doesn't he?
And now you see him in pastel and he's a chunky little fucker!
So welcome to my new show.
A bit worried about what to charge.
25 quid's a lot of money.
And I looked at other TV comedians who were charging less than me and I thought:
Fuck it, you get what you paid for.
Some people charge 25.
Jim Davidson.
Live. 25 quid.
"Strictly no spastics."
Except Jim, they put him off.
That's a word you don't hear very often, innit?
"Spastic."
Again, in the '70s, all the rage!
No, but they changed their name.
Not individuals, I mean, the society.
The individuals, they weren't...
Well, you know what I'm gonna christen it!
It was called the Spastics Society.
And that was a normal word.
And they changed their name to Scope, because "spastic" had started being used as a derogatory term.
Particularly in playgrounds.
Bullies would pick on little disabled kids, and they'd say, "Oh, you're spastics." They changed it to Scope.
And now that doesn't happen.
It can't, does it.
I mean, what would happen now if a bully picked on a little fellow in a wheelchair?
"Oy, spastic!"
Little fellow in a wheelchair would just go, "I think you'll find it's Scope."
"Oy, Scopey!"
"Fuck!"
My impression of a wheelchair user.
Not Thora Hird, that's just that.
She had a plush one.
She didn't even bother with that.
Never off her ass, was she?
She could walk, I'd seen her walk...
She goes shopping in one of those things, all the way home, right up to the front door.
Key in the door, straight in the stairlift.
Feet haven't touched the ground yet.
Up to the bathroom, lowered into the bath.
Never off her ass.
Give her an award, she's up there like a fucking greyhound!
Same as that Steven Hawking.
Blazing!
The most intelligent man on the planet and I'm having a go.
Brilliant!
The most intelligent man on the planet, but not such a good judge of character.
Happily married, kids...
Nurse...
And now, according to some
(my lawyers have told me to say)
she leaves him out in the sun, she smacks him around the head for a laugh.
Isn't that terrible?
He must be thinking:
"What happened to all the fucking blowjobs?
!"
Spell the whole word!
But...
There's no evidence
The charges were dropped.
So that's not how he got the cuts and bruises.
It was probably all the skateboarding he does.
So...
Why politics?
Because...
I want to give something back to society.
Fuck off!
I do!
You don't know!
And I can't enjoy this life when I see...
Injustice
Suffering
Inequality
And I want to live and die if necessary by the morals I hold dearly.
Like Martin Luther King and Gandhi.
And...
Ben Elton.
People have a problem with Ben Elton now.
They think he's sort of sold out all his principles...
And just made as much money as he could, and he's just an annoying little twat.
That may be the case, but they never have a go at Gandhi, do they?
And that's what I'm here for, a bit of balance.
Never mind having a go at Ben, what about Gandhi?
He can be annoying.
I'll tell you a story about Gandhi, a true story.
When he came to England in 1930 or something...
I haven't looked up if it's 1930, I can't be bothered because I have to get ready for tomorrow...
Right.
It was 1930-something.
He got off the plane.
Pretty sure it was a plane.
Heathrow.
Terminal 1.
Oh God, Mahatma Gandhi...
In our little country.
Surrounded by journalists, photographers.
They couldn't believe their luck.
And one little journalist went, "Mr Gandhi?" Respectful, right?
"Mr Gandhi: what do you think of Western civilization?"
And Gandhi said, "I think it would be a good idea."
Ooh, you sarky...
For someone who doesn't want to get in a fight, he's a little bit...
Isn't he?
Fucking hell...
And what happened to sarcasm being the lowest form of wit?
Oh no, highest form of wit, when Gandhi says it!
If I'd have been that reporter I'd have said, "Hmm, very good.
I'm not putting that."
I'll ask you again: "What do you think of Western civilization?"
I told you, I think it would be a good idea.
Alright, ok.
I'm taking back your degree from London University.
Oh, and your National Health specs.
What do you think of it now, Mr Magoo?
Sarky bastard...
He went to the same university as me, University College London.
And I think it was there where I turned away from politics.
Because I'd been interested all my life, particularly at 15, 16, 17...
Becoming politicized, hanging out in the sixth form, discussing communism and stuff...
And I'd do things, I used to sell Anti-Nazi League badges and collect for the miners, 'cause it was noisy, mainly.
And I even had that poster of Che Guevara on my wall at home, to annoy my mum.
It backfired.
She thought it was Robert Lindsay.
And then when I got to college, there were people better at that then me.
Know what I mean, there were people that really meant it.
And I was thinking, "Oh God, was I like that?"
I'll give you an example.
I did Philosophy.
And after a few weeks, you had to choose your options for the three years.
Compulsory subjects were
Logic and Greek Philosophy, and you had to choose about six others.
And I chose Philosophy of Science,
Philosophy of Mind,
Morality.
And there was a Marxism option.
And I thought, that'd be great, I've always been interested in that.
And it was only a small department, about 25 people.
The tutors were all out and you had to queue up and take the thing you wanted.
And I looked over at the queue for Marxism...
And there were ten people in this queue.
Three of them were wearing berets.
And I thought, God, I can't spend three years in a room with what I used to call at the time
"cunts."
The first bloke I sort of hooked up with was the opposite of that.
He was this big, lumbering chemist called Pete Brown.
And I think he was about the first person I met, and he lived literally opposite me in the corridor.
Ifor Evans Hall in Camden.
18, like the rest of us, but the mind of a 55-year-old fascist cab driver.
"Society was going to the dogs" and
"God, the things I could do if I was in charge."
That sort of thing.
And I remember there was an advert at the time... for Strongbow.
And at the end of the advert, two arrows are fired from a longbow, and went:
and split the wood on the bar.
That gave him the horn, that advert.
Because he used to imagine executing muggers and rapists like that.
And it would come on and he'd go quiet, and he'd be watching it, like that.
And then ad's over and he'd go, "Ooh, that was in the head."
And he also used that to exorcise demons.
Like, you'd walk along the street, and it was like the early '80s.
So if he saw someone coming the other way, like a bloke with long hair and make-up or something like that, he'd just watch him and he'd go:
He'd be imagining killing him!
Once we were walking home from college and he used to go in every day and buy his Evening Standard.
And it was a little kiosk I think it's still there.
It was like just two piles of Standards and a little old woman selling them.
And he went in this particular day, bought his Standard, 10p, and the cover story that day was a big photograph of an old-age pensioner.
And she'd been mugged and there was a picture of her, cuts and bruises.
Awful story.
And the old lady, just making conversation-she probably said it to everyone who came in that day-she went to Pete:
"It's awful, isn't it?" And he went, "Yeah."
"Yeah, she's 93.
Scarred for life."
But you leave it, don't you?
Pete went, "Well, that's not scarred for life then, is it?"
She went, "What?"
"You scar a baby for life, don't you?"
"If she lives till she's 100, she's only been scarred for 7% of her life."
He did the maths for her!
Like this old woman's meant to go, "Yeah, you're right.
Fuck her!"
But politics starts from an early age.
You don't need to go to college to be exposed to politics.
I think it starts from year nought.
It's in little sayings and songs, nursery rhymes, fables.
They're charged with morality for kids.
And I remember, I must have been as young as 6 or 7 'cause it was infant school.
And the first Monday of every month, the deputy headmaster used to do a fable at assembly.
And it was his best day.
Now, he used to make it last about a half an hour to forty minutes and he thought he was Peter Ustinov.
And looking back, I think all the other teachers were going, "Look at that fucking wanker showing off for 6-year-olds."
He'd take his shoes off as well.
I'll tell you one that he told, a fable.
It was the fable of the two mice.
The lazy mouse and the industrious mouse.
All through the summer, there was lots of berries on the trees...
The sun was shining, it was lovely and warm.
The lazy mouse would be eating berries off the tree, taking a bite, throwing it away.
There was loads.
The industrious mouse...
He'd have a berry, sure.
But he'd eat it all and he'd save one as well.
The lazy mouse: "Ah, forget that, I'll just eat these berries." Running around, ok.
The industrious mouse says, "You know what, you should look forward to winter, 'cause those berries won't..."
"Oh fuck off, ya square!"
I'll adapt to it.
So anyway, you get the picture.
So all through the summer, he's eating berries, he's running around, sunbathing.
The industrious mouse, he's busy collecting berries, freeze-drying them, chopping wood
with a little axe that he's fashioned out of a twig and a tiny little sliver of flint.
And he's tied it on with a horsehair.
Thus making it easier for him to stockpile wood
for the much colder season.
He hasn't got a fire at the moment.
He's too hot, if anything.
Just lying there...
But come winter, burn the wood, make the fire.
So... summer.
So to cut a long story...
I'm making it last longer than needed, for fuck's sake.
So autumn comes, same pattern.
Lazy mouse, he's just fucking about eating the last of the berries.
The industrious mouse, he's collecting the last of the berries.
He's got... too much wood, if you want my opinion.
But it's not gonna run out.
The stuff at the back's gotta be damp...
Circulate it.
Doesn't know what he's doing, but he's doing his best.
The lazy mouse, he's just having a laugh, he's loving it all, he's just kicking through the leaves...
Underneath the leaves.
You can't see him, 'cause he's too small but you can see the leaves sort of move like that.
You sorta go:
"What's that?"
It's just Lazy Mouse.
You can't, but that's what happening.
Don't think it's a ghost or something like that.
If you could go in there, like with a really high-tech... you know like in Discovery Channel...
You'd probably see the lazy mouse going:
Winter comes.
The ground is cold and hard.
There's no berries on the trees anymore.
It's freezing.
The lazy mouse is out there, he's scrabbling around, he can't find anything.
The industrious mouse is in his cottage that he's built
out of just odds and ends.
Roaring twig fire.
Pipe!
Rocking chair.
Or a pebble.
Just a pebble.
Sort of modern.
Don't they hibernate?
This is bollocks, isn't it?
These mice didn't, anyway.
So he's there and there's a knock at the door.
"Who's that?"
So he goes over to the little door.
Tiny knob, obviously.
"What do you want?"
It's obvious what he wants, isn't it?
And he goes, "Oh, well, it's cold, and I'm hungry..."
"Well... " Definitely smokes now.
"That's not my porn mag." Right?
He goes:
"Well I did warn you, didn't I?"
"Yeah..."
"Never mind.
Come on in and share with me."
Where's the moral there?
What is the moral of that tale?
Fuck around, do what you want, then scrounge off a do-gooder!
It's a terrible lesson for kids!
Most of the kids in my class kept that up.
He also told the one about the boy who cried wolf.
A boy, looking after his sheep.
Gets a bit bored.
It is boring.
Probably tired as well, 'cause if you're counting 'em you're probably getting a bit drowsy, aren't you?
Anyway.
So, gets a bit boring.
He's got nothing to do here in...
The Bible.
Anyway, so...
Long time ago.
And he goes, um.
It's just a Monday, that's the worst day.
And he's just bored, and he goes:
"I know what, I'll have a laugh."
And he goes:
"Wolf!
Wolf!
Wolf!
Wolf!"
And the villagers come out and go, "Where's the wolf?"
"No, no, there's no wolf here."
"Oh, you fucking..."
So next day: "That worked a treat, I'll do that again."
He goes:
"Wolf!
Wolf!
Wolf!"
"Where's the wolf this time?"
Still no wolf.
"Oh, you fucking..."
Third day, there really is a wolf.
And he goes, "Wolf!
Wolf!
Wolf!
Wolf!"
But the villagers don't come 'cause they don't believe him.
And we were told, the moral of that is, "Never tell a lie."
No it isn't.
The moral of that is never tell the same lie twice.
A terrible lesson for kids.
Nursery rhymes...
Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water
Jack fell down and broke his crown
Which I later learned meant his cranium!
I thought his hat fell off or something!
and Jill came tumbling after.
And that is a true fable of the time, I think of the 16th century, about two illicit lovers who used to go up to the hill, out of the sight of the villagers, and have it off behind their spouse's back.
What's the moral there?
Don't fuck around with sluts or you get your head caved in?
I've never worked out what the moral of Humpty Dumpty is.
I can only think of:
Don't sit on a wall if you're an egg.
How is that applicable to an 8-year-old human?
You either go, well, what's the moral there?
"Don't sit on a wall if you're an egg."
What?
Of course I wouldn't.
"If you're an egg?"
It's not gonna happen, is it?
Are there eggs reading that, going, "Oh, I was gonna jump up there, not now..."
"Oh, God...
Wait, don't get on there if you're en egg!"
- "No, why not?" "Read that." - "Fuck!"
Don't send horses to perform medical procedures...
Of course they couldn't put him together again!
It's obvious.
They haven't got the dexterity.
It's obvious.
I wouldn't have sent them in the first place.
An experiment... it's not an experiment.
They can't...
They can't even scrub up.
They haven't got thumbs, let alone opposable thumbs.
They couldn't sew to save their life.
If I had to design a perfect egg-crushing device... it would be a hoof.
Doesn't matter if they're kings' horses or Steptoe's horse...
All the king's horses...
Certainly don't send all of them!
It's gonna be chaos!
What if we had been invaded by France that day?
Bloke comes running to the bloke in charge, goes:
"You in charge of all the king's horses and all the king's men?" "Yeah."
- "Well the French are coming!" - "What?"
"Where are all the king's horses and all the king's men?
!
The French are coming, quick, where are they?"
- "The egg..." - "What?"
"What?"
"It's, it's, uh... the egg!"
- "What are you talking about?" - "I sent them to mend an egg."
"Are you fucking mental?
Are you mental?"
"They can't mend an egg!"
Also...
I only know that he is an egg from pictorial evidence.
And he is clearly an egg.
An egg-thing.
An egg with eyes.
And other things.
Trousers.
But... that's not mentioned in the whole thing.
That would be the first thing I'd mention.
Nevermind, I'd go:
Once, right, there was an egg that could climb walls!
Left that out!
If... your surname is Dumpty, don't call your firstborn Humpty!
He's already an egg.
Like that's not enough of a stigma!
- "How's the baby?" - "It's an egg."
- "Just an egg." - "Oh really, what are you going to call it?"
- "Humpty Dumpty." - "Well, don't make it worse."
That is a wind-up there.
Just call him Johnny or something.
Just put a balaclava on him.
The worst he'll get is "Fatty Johnny."
Humpty Dumpty the egg?
He's gonna get the piss ripped out of him!
He probably jumped off the wall.
So, what is politics?
Politics is the art or science of governing
Governing people and governing society
What's the best way to live, how do we live in harmony?
That's what we're looking for.
Democracy is the closest thing we've got to everyone sorta just chipping in.
But even that's got problems.
Who gets the vote?
Should everyone get the vote?
Dangerous question.
The political philosopher Nietzsche said that not all people do deserve the vote and not all men are born equal.
This was classically misinterpreted by Hitler, who went way too far with it.
Imagine that: you're a great scholar, Nietzsche, and you write that, and you get called to Hitler:
- Alright, Nietzsche?
- Alright, Adolf.
- Yeah, just been reading your book.
- You like it?
Brilliant.
Love all that, love all that...
Man and superman, not everyone's equal, kill all the Jews...
Sorry?
What?
- Not everyone's equal, kill all the Jews...
- I didn't...
I didn't write that.
Yeah, I read between the lines.
You've totally misinterpreted the whole point of it...
- Yeah?
- Yeah, definitely.
It's awful.
It's dreadful.
Have you been killing...
...Jewish people?
What?
Have you been killing Jewish people?
How many have you killed?
How many have I killed?
- Six mill...
- Six million!
Yeah, I don't want to go on about it, I'm not going to do any more.
Leave it at six.
Move on...
Is it time for tea anyway?
Yeah, but be careful in the future.
I know.
You writing any other books at the moment?
- Well, I am but I'm scared to tell you about them.
- No, I won't do anything.
What's your new book called?
My new book is called:
"The Gyppos:
Do We Need 'Em?"
Not a traditional subject for comedy, the Holocaust.
I'll give you that.
Probably why Spielberg didn't put a laughter track on Schindler's List.
It would've ruined it.
When Schindler's List came out in American cinemas, they actually banned popcorn.
That's true.
And I think that's a great idea, but I think they should ban it in all films.
I don't want to go and watch a film with someone grazing next to me, you know what I mean?
Obviously, I did it in that because of all the people that died in it.
But what about all the people that died in Mad Max?
Let's keep it fair.
And that was more recent.
It was the future, so it was really recent.
I think Schindler's List is a fantastic film.
And I didn't watch it at the cinema actually.
I got it out on video, about a year later-by mistake!
- 'cause I'd never heard of it, and I was in Blockbuster, sorta late one night, and I was a bit drunk, and I thought it was a porn film.
No, 'cause I saw 18 certificate, top shelf.
I thought, oh, black and white.
Dodgy home movie, you know?
German sounding-they're the best.
And what swung it, it was that quote on the back from Barry Norman: "Have a box of Kleenex ready."
Rubbish.
I used about two.
There was a shower scene!
Shut up!
Lenny Henry, 30 quid!
Fuck off!
This lecture, as you've worked out, is about political change.
But how do you change things?
Well, we're not all in power by definition.
Some of us haven't even got the vote.
But, if you've got a voice, and in our country we've got freedom of speech, you can change things.
Slowly, but you can be heard.
And that's one way.
I used to work at University of London union.
And there wasn't a day that went by where there wasn't a march that started outside, or people giving out flyers and leaflets and stuff.
And I always used to take them, to read them, because I wanted to know what people were giving up their time for.
And I remember one was a leaflet boycotting Nike and some other designer labels for using third-world sweatshops.
Particularly China.
And there was a frightening statistic on this leaflet, I'll never forget.
It said that the CEO of Nike has amassed 5.2 billion dollars and for a female worker in one of his sweatshops, in China, to earn that, she'd have to work 7 days a week, 8 hours a day, for 10,000 years.
But they don't want to!
Lazy...
There's another thing on there, it's absolutely true.
One of the supervisors in one of the sweatshops in China has been accused of sexually assaulting one of the female workers and he'd been...
That's not funny, is it?
...and he was suspended, but fled the country before he'd come to trial.
And the CEO of Nike was asked an awkward question about this at a press conference
And he said, "No, he wasn't sexually assaulting her."
"He was trying to wake her up and must have touched the wrong places."
What?
That's a bad excuse, innit?
Touched the...?
Mrs Chang...
Mrs Chang...
Just shout!
Don't touch her at all.
Mrs Chang...
But I love bad excuses, when it's sorta embarrassing, sort of heinous, things like that.
A friend of mine I went to college with was a medical student, and when he did his degree, he did an internship or a junior doctorship at University College Hospital.
And he was working nights, it was about 1:30 in the morning, and this guy came in, and he had a bottle of sauce stuck up his ass.
As you do.
Completely disappeared.
He hadn't left enough out, he hadn't thought of the return journey.
Even Hansel and Gretel sorta left breadcrumbs, didn't they?
He hadn't thought it through.
He was getting so into it, the whole bottle up there, then he couldn't get any purchase...
You know, tie a bit of string to it or something, just think ahead.
Or... empty it out, fill it with concrete, put a broom handle in it, let that set, and then you've got the full length of the bottle, and a handle.
But he hadn't put as much thought into it as me...
Amateur.
And also, instead of going in there and saying:
"Excuse me, mate."
"You've got a sauce bottle stuck up your ass."
"I know what I was doing, you know what I was doing..."
"Get it out and I won't do it again."
Instead of saying that, he went through this whole face-saving rigmarole of filling out an accident report, just making it worse for himself, and this is the excuse he gave.
He said:
"Well, what happened was..." This is a great excuse, right.
He said, "I'd been shopping at Safeway"
"and I came home with my shopping and I realized that I'd locked myself out of my house."
"So I put the shopping on the doorstep"
"and I saw I'd left open a bedroom window."
"So I tried to climb up the drainpipe"
"but as I was climbing the drainpipe, my belt broke"
"and my trousers and pants"
"fell down."
"I went to grab them, I lost my grip, and I fell and I landed on this bottle and it went straight up..."
"And that's what happened."
Ok, so, got it out for him.
And when he left, they made an amendment to the accident report.
My mate put, "This story would be somewhat more believable"
"if Safeway sold their bottles of sauce with condoms already attached."
Oh, the condom.
Fuck.
He knows I'm lying...
Why'd he put a condom on it, anyway?
'Cause he was then gonna use it on his chips?
But how mean is that?
If you're into...
You know what I mean?
Shoving condiments up your ass.
Buy two!
They're only 79p!
I guess, I don't know...
One for chips and one for asses!
You know where you are!
You don't have to make bad excuses!
My favorite leaflet of all time...
I bet some of you haven't even got a favorite leaflet, have you?
Sort it out.
No, it really is...
You'll see why.
And I kept it with me for about three months and showed it to everyone.
It was a leaflet that came round the union, in about 1994, '95.
And it was a Terrence Higgins leaflet about safe sex.
And it was aimed at the last demographic of gay men that weren't taking HIV seriously enough.
So it was very hard-hitting and seen, and it used really, sort of, colorful language to get the message across.
And I remember it so well.
The title of this flyer; you know it's going to be a good leaflet when this is the title, this is the opening gambit.
It was called:
"You know, you don't always have to have anal sex."
Thanks very much.
Think of a couple of old-age pensioners just queueing for their flu jab.
They're just browsing, Reader's Digest...
What's this one?
"You know, you don't always have to have anal sex."
See, I fucking told you!
So, that was what it was called, right.
And it was a ten-point plan of alternatives to... you know... that.
So, #1.
Always started the same as well.
Always started with, "Why not?"
Why not.
Like, casual.
Like a recipe or something:
Why not throw in an onion?
#1 was this:
And it had these little diagrams, like little drawings like you get on safety things on planes.
Anyway, #1.
Ten-point plan. #1 was:
Think of this as medical advice.
#1 was:
"Why not just wank each other off?"
- I've got a new leaflet!
- Oh, what's it say?
Why not just wank each other off?
Ok.
Casual.
#2
#2 was great.
Again, just a casual suggestion.
#2 was:
Always the same, "Why not..." #2:
"Why not come on his back?"
Why not?
When is that?
It's so casual!
Why not?
!
Imagine you queue up to see a GP...
"The GP will see you now." And he's sorta waiting, "Come in, sit down.
What can I do for you?"
"I'm gay and I'm worried about HIV."
"Um... come on his back!"
#3
Whenever I show this to people, when I got to this one, people were laughing and then they went, "Oh..."
#3 is the worst one. #3 is:
"Why not come in his hair?"
Not the hair!
On the back!
Come on the back, sure.
On you go, go on.
Hurry up.
Where are you fucking aiming that?
Not on the hair!
Fuck off!
There!
Fucking better not...
I'm putting on a shower cap.
#4
Oh, #4.
I've not before, or since, heard such a great use of the term "e.g." as in this next sentence.
#4, I swear, was:
"Why not come into a piece of fruit?"
"e.g. watermelon."
What?
Like if they put it out without that people are going, "Well, what fruit?"
"Watermelon, thank you!
I need to know what fruit!"
I need to know exactly what fruit.
I don't want to get it wrong.
I thought asses were alright, I was wrong there.
I don't wanna make...
So watermelon, yeah?
Good.
#10, I'll just tell you #10 because #10 might be the greatest sentence of all time.
And I think the bloke writing it was under pressure from his boss.
He'd done nine and his boss came and said, "How's it going?"
- Done nine.
- We need ten.
I can't do ten!
I'm struggling.
I'm doing hair, I'm doing backs...
We need ten.
You've got till 5:30.
And this is what he came up with.
This is... #10, and I swear, right, was:
"Why not both come out of a window?"
Why?
Ready?
And it didn't even say make sure it's not a ground floor window!
Morning!
No, this is #70, #90's there.
I think they're out.
And that leaflet...
This is a confession, this is a confession...
That leaflet must have affected me, and that was ten years ago.
Last summer I was walking down Old Compton Street.
It was about 10:00 at night and just before I got to Mamma Mia a pigeon shat on me.
Obviously a pigeon.
Then I went:
What did I expect to see?
Two going, "Got him!"
That is the best leaflet of all time, isn't it?
But a serious message.
I think the last successful protest was to bring the gay age of consent down to 16.
It's what I was talking about earlier...
It forces the hand of democracy, being heard, and there was millions of people in that march saying, "This is what we want.
We want the law changed.
And the government, it was 1997, they said, "Yeah, if that many people want it, that's a referendum."
They changed the law and they brought the gay age of consent down to 16.
I didn't see many 16-year-olds on the march.
It was mainly 42-year-old men with leather trousers, shaved grey hair, and backpacks, but... 16-year-olds are busy, doing homework or watching it on telly probably, going:
"We're gonna get buggered."
No mothers on the march.
No 55-year-old women going:
"What do we want?" "For our sons to get done up the ass!"
"When do we want it?" "Well, soon, before they're 17, please!"
But I don't think it matters who fights for your right to take it up the ass.
At this point I just want to make sure we've covered gays and nazis.
Good.
Ok, we can move on.
Gays and nazis...
But enough about the Conservative Party.
Satire.
They have had their fair share of sleaze, haven't they, the Conservative Party?
And not like...
I mean, all parties get a little bit of sleaze, but it's not like cool stuff, like Labour, like punching a farmer or having two Jags.
Do you remember that Conservative MP, Stephen Milligan?
Found dead with a noose 'round his neck, amyl nitrate-laced orange in his mouth, bag on his head, ladies' tights.
I'll be honest:
I think he was wanking.
But again, freedom to do what you want as long as you don't hurt anyone.
I mean, he hurt himself, he went too far, accidentally strangling...
You know, that is the problem with the old asphyxia-wank.
You've gotta do it just right or you go too far and you actually die and then your wanking days are over.
So, you know, if I was into that, wanking it to an inch of my life, wearing ladies' tights and sucking oranges with a bag on me head,
I'd have a close friend, I'd just say, listen:
I love nearly killing myself whilst wanking, wearing all this stuff...
If I actually get it wrong one day and accidentally kill myself, come 'round, leave the noose, and get rid of all that other stuff.
Just say it was suicide.
And how do they know they're into all that?
How do they first...?
Was he getting ready one day, and he's tying his tie, went a bit tight, went...
Fucking hell!
And when they do that and they nearly die, and they survive, then they're swinging there when they finish and they get a glimpse of themselves in the mirror, do they ever go:
What the fuck am I doing?
The first apocryphal tale or urban myth I ever heard was about masturbation.
Not surprising, you hear those sort of things when you're 14, 15.
And that is a 14-year-old boy's main pastime.
And it was told to us by a guy called David Beasley.
I talked about him on my "Animals" show.
He's the one that said:
If you get captured by cannibals, they show you pornographic pictures
so you get an erection and there's more meat.
And usually urban myths start with "A friend of mine," right?
Not this one.
He said:
"I was wanking the other day, lads."
Go on...
He said, "I was on my bed at home"
"and I was naked,"
"and I had my eyes shut, and I was listening to music, I had my headphones on."
"And when I'd finished,"
"I opened my eyes, and my mum had been in and left me some tea and biscuits."
David?
Deaf...
Oh dear.
There's my firstborn.
Whacking away like a little monkey, isn't he?
Very proud of him, very proud...
If he carries on like that, he's gonna come!
I better leave this, so he knows his mother saw him.
Think of that!
Your mother walking in on you furiously masturbating.
The other way 'round is worse.
But we believed that at the time.
I think he believed it.
He told me another story which I have no reason not to believe.
He said his brother was going for a job interview and he had to change trains at Crewe.
And he was on the platform of the train and he shat himself.
As you do.
Just filled with diarrhea.
And he thought, "Oh, for fuck's..."
And he had to make the interview.
So he looked, he had ten minutes, before the train.
And he looked close by, he saw a Millets.
So he scrouched over to Millets and went in, and went, "Quick, mate.
Levis, 36!"
Got the bag, made the train, went straight to the toilet, locked himself in, opened the bag, took his trousers off, took his pants off, poked them out the window,
cleaned himself up, flushed it all away, opened the bag:
It was a jacket!
And when he told us that, we were going:
"Oh fuck, what would you do?
What would you do?"
And my mate, Bob, trying to be cool, went:
Just cut the corners off the carrier bag.
Are you gonna still make the interview then?
Morning!
Oh that?
Shat myself!
What's the pension scheme like?
- Made the interview?
- Yeah, phew...
Thank God for a carrier bag to hide my awful.
Unbelievable.
There are more drastic forms of protest though than marching and leaflets.
In 1963, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk, as a protest against the Vietnam regime, went out into a public place set himself alight and burned to death.
Did no good, 'cause that's not a threat or a deterrent.
If a little monk comes up to you and he goes, "You better stop all those things you're doing."
"Otherwise I'm gonna set myself alight."
You're going to set yourself alight?
Fill your boots, mate.
Then no one cared and I bet you don't even know his name, do you?
I do.
I've looked it up.
Absolutely true.
His name was Thich Quang Duc.
Or crispy duck, to his mates.
John Lennon, a less drastic form of protest against the Vietnam War:
The famous sleep-in.
He stayed in bed for a week with Yoko Ono, and that was it.
And people were going, "Brilliant."
Genius, that's excellent.
I bet that little monk was fucking gutted!
Hold on, what?
Burn yourself to death or shag Yoko?
I love it when rock stars get involved, I absolutely love it.
The political song:
Look out, mate, he's got a guitar!
He's saying what he thinks... in C.
It's ok when it's people like, you know, Bob Dylan, but I love it when pop stars have a go.
Do you remember Culture Club's classic?
They'd been singing "Karma Chamaleon" for too long and they came up with "The War Song."
And in that, they go:
War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
How's that gonna change your mind?
I mean, if you're into war, you're loving war, you love it, it's your favorite thing...
I mean, you're in a plane, you're gonna bomb the shit out of a country,
I can't wait to get there, I love bombing people.
Oh, nearly there.
Put the radio on.
War, war is stupid And people are stupid
We're going home.
Boy George there...
He piled on the pounds when he gave up the smack, didn't he?
There's a fable there, kids.
Every action has a consequence.
Billy Joel, after singing things like "Uptown Girl,"
he then revealed his classic, his protest song against the world.
"We Didn't Start the Fire"
And in that song, he...
it's basically a list in chronological order from 1949 to 1989.
And he just mentions six to eight things in each verse.
I'll just read it, he goes:
Harry Truman, Doris Day, Red China, Johnnie Ray, South Pacific, Walter Winchell, Joe DiMaggio
Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, television, North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe
That's not a song!
That's a conversation with Rain Man!
I think the first protest song that actually made a difference was, "Do They Know It's Christmas?"
And particularly poignant to us in Britain because we used to own and run Africa.
And then the end of the '50s, they won independence, and slowly we started giving it back to Africa.
By the end of the '60s it was totally Africa-owned and Africa-ruled.
Of course, in the '80s we get a phone call...
Thatcher answers. "Hello?"
- Hello, it's Africa.
- What do you want?
We're all starving and that.
Give me that phone!
You should've thought of that before you wanted independence!
Yeah, we didn't know there was going to be a drought.
Drought?
I'll give you a fucking drought...
In the long, hot summer of 1976 we had a hose pipe ban in Reading.
My poor mum having to make loads of journeys with a bowl of water for the lawn,
under the cover of darkness, with her back.
We've all got fucking problems, mate.
Drought...
And there was a government advert at the time that said:
"Save water.
Have a bath with a friend."
Which I did.
I say "a friend," he was more a friend of my Granddad's.
Ten quid's a lot to a kid in Reading.
We used to call him Granddad Charlie actually.
He wasn't our Granddad, he was just an old bloke who used to live across the road from us and used to always come 'round to play with us whenever he saw our parents go out.
What?
Lovely old man.
He used to play with us.
He taught me to wrestle.
And... what?
Lovely old man.
Lovely old man, old Granddad Charlie.
And he used to do magic tricks.
Oh, it was great.
And he used to have a magic hat and he used to sit down and put the magic hat on his lap.
And he'd show us there was nothing in it.
There was nothing in it.
And he'd put the magic hat on his lap, and we couldn't tell our parents, 'cause it'd stop the magic.
I think that's how it works.
We were only little.
And we used to have to queue up with our eyes shut and all take turns in feeling the little rabbit in that hat.
Whenever it got to me it was scared stiff, poor little thing.
And it was always in a bad way, didn't have any ears or any fur.
Poor little thing.
I made it sick once!
It's not true...
There is no Granddad Charlie.
I wasn't abused.
And if I was, I'd save it for my autobiography.
That's the way to do it.
So, anyway.
Thatcher on the phone to Africa, goes:
Look, I can't come myself, but I'll send you lead singer of the Boomtown Rats?
He's not doing anything.
- They went, alright.
- Yeah, don't call again.
See, the protest song about the greatest living African is The Special AKA's "Free Nelson Mandela."
That's what they said.
They said, "Free Nelson Mandela,"
and it worked, because like that, six years later he was out anyway, so...
Incarcerated for a quarter of a century, Mandela.
Released in 1990, so he's been out about 14 years, now.
And he hasn't reoffended, so I think he's going straight.
Which shows you prison does work.
I came here to change attitudes tonight, and I think I've done that.
I want to leave you with something now to show that knowledge is power.
It's a true story actually.
We were talking earlier about third-world sweatshops, and they really are awful places.
And there's women and children that are abused, and they literally get a few pence an hour and it's for big conglomerate companies to make billions of pounds.
And I was shopping with a friend of mine a couple of years ago.
His name is Rob, and he had a sudden death in the family and he had to get a suit for the funeral.
And he was in a band, he was on the dole, he didn't have a suit to his name.
We went to these sort of cheap places in Oxford Street and one bloke said, "I've got a lovely suit. 29 pounds."
And I thought, what is this going to look like?
I couldn't wait for him to have to buy this suit.
We went over to it, and it was alright!
And I was gutted.
It was a classic sorta dark suit, and it was nice.
It had an electric blue, sort of satin lining.
He was made up.
So just to piss on his bonfire,
I said, well, if it's that cheap and it's that well-made and it's not on a sale, it means someone's been exploited.
He went, "What?" And I went, "Yeah, it's awful.
Women and children exploited..."
You'd just be adding to the problem, right?
And he didn't buy it.
And he went and sold a guitar, at the record and tape exchange, and bought a suit for 150 quid.
And I felt bad, but then I thought:
Well, I was probably right.
They probably have used like really awful, cheap labor.
And so, just by doing that, even though it's one person's little change, if everyone changes, then we can all, you know what I mean, make a difference.
Still, 29 quid though...
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Has everyone heard of Karl Pilkington?
Yeah...
He's my producer, on my radio show.
For those who haven't heard of him, he's a guy-talking about attitudes-he's a man whose attitude hasn't changed from about the age of 5.
He's from Manchester and you can ask him anything and he's got an opinion on it.
It's usually rubbish but...
Right.
An example, ok.
I tell him about how I'm doing this show.
I said I'm doing a show called "Politics."
He went, "Why?"
And you can't answer it.
And he said, "You wanna talk about that David Blunkett?"
I went, "Why?
What's he doing?"
He went, "Oh, he's up to his old tricks again."
"He's only gone and banned people having sex in public, hasn't he?"
And I went, "Well, yeah, but surely that's a good thing, Karl."
And he went, "Yeah, but would he have done it if he could see?"
It is a twisted logic.
We once-on air, this was-we were talking about blind dates, have you had a blind date.
And halfway through, Karl just piped up and went, "I went on a blind date once."
- Really?
- Oh yeah.
- What'd you do?
- Went for a drink and that.
- Was she nice?
- Yeah, she was really good, really fun.
It was great.
- Did you see her again?
- No.
- She had a problem with her marrow.
- A what?
- She had a problem with her marrow.
- Her bone marrow?
Oh.
Yeah, she had a wasting disease.
So I thought, what's the point?
On air!
And so, flustered, I went, "Oh, Karl, if she's listening you're for it!"
He went, "She'll be dead by now."
Unbelievable.
I'll just tell you one more before I go, one more.
This was last year, during Wimbledon week.
Again, on air, he said:
Did you watch any of Wimbledon last night?
I went, "No..."
"They let some little wheelchair fellows have a go on Centre Court."
Little wheelchair fellows!
No irony.
And I went, "Alright, yeah.
Any good?"
"No, they were rubbish."
I went, "Why?" He went, "They couldn't get a rally going."
And I went, "Well, Karl, to be fair, they're in chairs, on grass..."
He went, "Don't put it on telly then."
And I...
On air!
And I went, "Oh wow.
Everyone's entitled to be, you know..."
"Yeah, well let them do something they can do, then."
And I-foolishly-I went, "Like what?"
And he said,
"Swingball."
POLICE LINE
- DO NOT CROSS
MY UNCLE KILLED A GUY
Does she have the receipt?
If she has the receipt...
But does she have it or does she say she has it?
No, mom.
But she may just think she does.
If she has it, they'll have to change it.
The blue one?
They'll change it, if she has the receipt.
Mom, you can't compare the price of clothes... with the price of dental treatment.
Duca!
Duca!
No... it doesn't hurt.
There's a little lump here.
It's uncomfortable.
- Uncle Eder is coming up.
- It's Eder.
No, he didn't.
Oh, mom!
So what?
OK.
The blue one.
Alright, mom.
I will.
Bye.
- Did he say he was coming?
- No.
- I killed a guy.
- What?
- What do you mean?
- I killed a guy.
- In a car crash?
- No, I shot him.
Fuck!
Where?
- In my house.
In the lounge.
- Who?
Is the body there?
You're sure he's dead?
Did you call the police?
- Why?
- Calm down.
- What happened?
Oh shit!
- Calm down.
- Who is he?
- My girlfriend's ex-husband.
He came after her.
She wasn't there.
He took his gun, started calling me names.
He called me a dirty nigger.
I... took the gun off him, we started fighting... he fell on the floor.
Then I shot him.
- It was an accident.
- Let's call the police.
Wait. it was an accident, self-defense.
- Sure it was.
- Does his family have money?
Duca!
Go to your room, son.
We'll talk later.
- We should call a lawyer.
- I don't know...
Calm down.
My mom always defends uncle Eder.
She says he's mixed-up, that's why he gets into trouble.
My dad, his brother, says he gets into trouble because he's an Idiot.
He always borrows money from my dad.
He lends him, but gets pissed off.
For a while he made a lot of money... selling a swimming pool cleaner.
It was called Robotclear.
It was automatic, it vacuumed the bottom of the pool.
Then some cheaper pool cleaners appeared.
So my uncle went broke.
He tried to put the price down.
He had a TV ad, with a child saying:
'Look, it moves by itself!
'
It was awful.
And he got seriously into debt.
If I know my mom, now she'll come in... give me a worried look mixed with a look of... don't worry, he's family but he's just your uncle, it will be OK'.
It's not an easy face to make or imagine, but she can do it.
- So?
- It was an accident.
I heard it.
Did you call the police?
Not yet.
Your dad called a lawyer, a friend.
Ask if he was lying down when he fired.
What?
He said they fell on the floor, fighting.
If he shot him lying, at close range, it was a fight.
If he shot him from a distance, he must invent another story.
OK, I'll ask.
Does he know where the guy's wife is?
I've asked, he doesn't know.
I'll go back in there.
Ask him if he's really the ex-husband.
OK, I'll ask.
Don't worry.
I'll be right back.
One time my uncle tried to open a barcalled'The Garden of Eder'.
And he asked me to create a website for him.
It was a sushi bar with computers on the tables.
It cost a fortune.
He closed the bar and my dad had to buy 3 computers:
1 for our place,2 for his office.
He did it to help uncle, because the computers kind of sucked.
The confusions he got into were a drag, they lasted months.
But I'd neverthought that he could kill anyone.
I think it really was an accident.
Come in.
Roger is here.
Let's share this?
Yes.
Did you ask?
He thinks it was as the guy was getting up.
It was an accident.
Did the bullet hit his belly?
He doesn't know.
It was an accident.
It was the guy's gun.
- The ex-husband's?
- Yes.
They weren't legally separated, but they weren't living together.
They must find out if she is his heir.
- What do you mean?
- If she's the guy's heir... they had a motive to kill him.
Right.
Well, Roger is a lawyer.
Let them talk.
- Are you going out?
- I'm going to Isa's.
They're leaving.
Roger, do you remember Duca?
- Hey, kid!
- Hey.
- Heard it?
- Yes.
We should go now.
- I'll come with you.
- Why?
You stay.
I'll go, call the police, then I'll call you.
Then you can come.
Shit, what a mess.
It's a... precarious situation!
His wife knows about it, right?
- Knows what?
- That the guy is dead.
Has anyone told her?
No.
No one knows.
I just came straight here.
- Did you call anyone?
- No.
- And the gun?
- It's here in my pocket.
Thank you, Roger.
- Fuck!
- Take it easy.
It was an accident, wasn't it?
Shame...
You should let the police tell the woman.
Yes?
Why?
They should see her face when she hears that her husband is dead.
Maybe.
Let's go in my car.
How will you explain why his car is here?
- I guess I'll take mine.
- Drive slowly, I'll follow you.
- Bye, uncle.
- Bye, Duca.
Don't worry, it will be OK.
It was an accident.
My mom says that uncle Eder never really fell in love.
My dad says that he really falls in love every week.
Mom says he chooses the wrong women to fall in love with.
Dad says it's the wrong women who choose to fall in love with him.
I think they're wrong.
You don't choose who you fall in love with.
You just fall in love.
There's no choice.
If it weren't like that, in this big city... why would I choose to fall in love with my best friend?
- Well, it was an accident.
- Hi.
- Is Kid here?
- He may come by later.
Are you going out?
- I don't think so.
Are you?
- No.
Is your mom in?
- No, why?
- My uncle killed a guy.
- What do you mean?
- My uncle.
He killed a guy.
- When?
- Today.
- In a car crash?
- No, he shot him.
- You're joking?
How?
What uncle?
- The Robotclear one.
- Was the guy old?
- I don't know.
Why?
Well, I think the older, the better.
I mean, if the guy was old already, he would die soon anyway.
How did it happen?
He says it was an accident.
He was dating the guy's wife.
They had a fight, the guy had a gun.
- And the police?
- They don't know yet.
- Where's the guy?
- Who?
The dead guy?
- In his house, I think.
- In the lounge?
I guess so.
- And?
- I don't know.
- Gosh!
- Yes.
Do you remember this bunny you made?
It's not a bunny, it's a cow.
Is it?
I always thought It was a bunny.
- Will your uncle go to jail?
- I guess so.
He almost did once, because of some checks.
- And your dad?
- He says he's an idiot.
I don't think he did it.
I think it was an accident.
- Why?
- Because he's really an idiot.
- How was it?
- Awful, honey, awful.
I'd never seen a dead man before, only from a distance.
He was fat.
He was lying on his belly, it kind of stuck out at the side.
The belt was tight.
I think he pulled in his stomach.
And he only let go when he died.
I'm hungry.
Have you eaten?
I had a sandwich.
What about Eder?
He's there, giving his deposition.
Roger is with him.
- Don't you want to eat anything?
- No.
- What about Duca?
- He's not back from Isa's yet.
- Was he frightened?
- I don't think so.
Why?
Well, his uncle, a murderer.
He may get teased in school.
- No one has to know.
- Right.
Sure.
- Hi.
- Duca's uncle killed a guy.
- Who?
- Duca's uncle, his dad's brother.
- The Robotclear one?
- Yes.
- Jesus!
Who did he kill?
- A guy, his lover's husband.
- His lover's husband?
- He's the guy's wife's lover.
- She was the guy's wife?
- Ex-wife.
- Gosh!
- Yes.
- And then?
- I don't know anything else.
- Have you eaten?
- I ate at home.
God, I'm starving.
Let's order a pizza.
- I'm leaving.
- So soon?
it's early.
- I want to know what happened.
- Will you call me?
- Depends what time.
- Call me tonight.
- I'll tell you tomorrow.
Bye.
- Bye.
- What about uncle?
- He's home already.
- Will he go to jail?
- I don't think so.
They'll just question him.
He called the police.
It's best to tell everything.
- Is the body there?
- I don't know.
I think so.
- Does the woman know?
- The police told her.
- And what did she do?
- I don't know.
- Did they have children?
- Apparently not.
Why can't the police know he was here?
- They may suspect.
- What?
He confessed.
Let's go to bed.
The problem with these stories that didn't happen... is not what you invent, but what you did not invent.
Someone may have seen him leave the house alone.
Or return with the lawyer.
The police will know that he came here before he called them.
And they'll suspect.
Suspect what?
He confessed.
Let's go to bed.
Suspect that something else happened.
If it was as he said, he wouldn't have to lie.
I read a story:
A guy said he drove home... and found his wife dead.
But it was snowing.
And they saw there was no snow under his car.
That meant that hed not been driving his car.
He was lying.
He was the murderer.
That's fiction.
It wasn't snowing and not every liar is a murderer.
People lie for many reasons almost all the time.
Maybe our police doesn't pay attention to that kind of thing.
They have so much to do that the wrong person is caught in the end.
True.
I don't think they'll suspect.
Suspect what, son?
He confessed.
Let's go to bed.
- Do you want a ride tomorrow?
- Yes.
In my school there are two blacks:
Me and Genéslo.
- Hi, Genésio.
- Hi, Duca.
In grade school there was another black kid, just for a year.
Kids are mean to each other in school.
They fight, call each other names.
But If you're black and someone calls you an Idiot... the teacher really goes forthem.
As If theyd called you an Idiot because you're black.
So here nobody calls me Idlot, only my real friends:
Isa, my friend since kindergarten, and Kid... who I haven't known very long, but already is my best friend.
The problem is I'm totally in love with Isa.
And, of course, she's totally in love with Kid.
And, of course, I can't tell anyone this.
You could have called.
We were watching a movie 'til late.
- What movie?
- We missed the start.
It's with Andy Garcia and the guy from 'Tootsie'.
- Dustin Hoffman.
- Yes.
A plane crashes, he saves everyone and loses his shoe?
That's it.
Cool, hey?
'Hero'.
I've seen it.
It's about a guy who thinks he's really smart but always messes up.
But it all works out.
He wasn't so smart, but he was very lucky.
It started at 12:
3O p.m. And it ended after two.
Funny that Isa remembered the shoe scene, it's at the beginning.
She said they missed the beginning.
And the title flashes on and off the screen during the film.
If they saw it, they should know the name.
Duca, hold this, man.
Hold it.
I saw that CD downtown for $ 22.
Here it's $ 35.
- How much do you get to do this?
- $ 2O.
- That's nothing!
- Better than cleaning pools.
What time did you leave Isa's place?
It was late, after 2...
We were listening to a CD I burnt there.
That's another problem with stories that didn't happen:
Everyone in the story has to agree about what did happen.
Duca, it's on the paper:
'Businessman Paulo Wolker, 53...'
- What's the headline?
- 'Businessman killed in fight'.
- Are there photos?
- No.
'...was murdered on Sunday night, shot in the chest.
The author of the shot, entrepreneur Eder Fragoso, 31...'
- 31?
Uncle Eder is 29.
- Your uncle is 31.
- How old is uncle?
- 3O.
He's 5 years younger than me.
- You're 36.
- Am I?
That's right, son!
So he's 31.
Go on, son.
'Paulo Roberto owned hotels and a food distributing firm.
The couple had no children.'
Was she your uncle's girlfriend?
I think she was, but not anymore.
I don't know.
- Is he in jail?
- No.
- Is he going to trial?
- I think so.
Did you see his uncle on the paper?
Yes.
Oh, this is a different one!
Let me see.
'Jealous husband eats lead.'
'The husband liked a brawl.
Last year he busted up Le Balcon... when he found his sex-pot two-timing him.
Now it got serious.
He took his gun... to confront his missus' new fancyman.
He ended up eating lead.'
- It says same as the other one.
- Look at your uncle's girlfriend!
- Cute, hey?
- What's up?
- Duca's uncle.
- He killed a guy.
- In a car crash?
- No, gunshot.
- Did he go to jail?
- No, it was self-defense.
Good morning, folks.
Let's study for the biology test together?
I wonder If she'll invite Kid.
If he goes, I won't.
- Maybe, I don't know.
- And when will you know?
They'll be alone... in her bedroom, studying biology.
I'd better go.
OK, I'll come.
Kid will sit next to her.
I'd better change the subject.
Talk about my new shoe.
- And leave him no space.
- And the biology test?
My uncle fired from a distance.
- What?
- The police know:
My uncle fired from a distance.
- Does it matter?
- He said it was a fight... and the shot was an accident, but it wasn't.
How do they know?
Easy:
A close range shot leaves traces of gunpowder.
- Wow, are those new?
- Yes.
Cool!
Ghetto wear!
Sorry.
- Want to study biology with us?
- Sure.
What happened?
- What do you mean?
- Why isn't the TV on?
No one's watching.
- Has anything happened?
- No.
Duca.
- Your uncle's been arrested.
- Why?
They didn't find fingerprints on the gun.
- Didn't they?
- No, none.
Not even his.
That imbecile cleaned the gun.
- Why?
- That's what they asked.
The idiot said it was because he thought of escaping.
He said that in his deposition to the police!
And worse:
The woman paid him.
- It was for a job.
- It's not hard to imagine... that the job included killing the guy.
She's a rich widow now.
- He won't be in jail long.
- I don't know.
He said hi.
Don't worry, it will be OK.
- Can I visit him in jail?
- I think so.
- It can be dangerous.
- Why?
Through the blood circulation, the organs get oxygen, aminoacids... water, minerals and hormones.
You know, hormones, right?
It pisses me off to see Isa showing off to Kid.
Pulling her hair behind her ear to show her face more...
Moving around on her chair all the time...
Smiling in a way she never does...
And making out like she's so smart.
- Antigen agglutinogen?
- That's not in the test.
You just need to know the others.
And the most annoying thing is, he doesn't get it.
And there are 4 blood types:
Type A, type B, AB and type O.
- What's the O type?
- Wait.
There's 2 types...
Now she's moving closer to him.
- Aren't you guys hungry?
- Yes.
Type AB has both antigens and no antibodies.
Type O has no antigens and both antibodies.
- I'm starving.
- Me too, man.
There's frozen pizza and ice cream.
Do you want to go visit my uncle?
Yes.
- Are you crazy?
- Why?
- A woman in a prison?
- So?
Most visitors are women.
- But it's dangerous.
- That jail isn't so bad.
- It isn't for serious offenders.
- What if there's a riot?
Yes!
I'm coming.
When?
Your mom has to give you written permission.
Do you think she will?
She may even want to come too.
Of course she will.
You are crazy.
The pizza is ready.
How much?
This is all.
It's expensive, Roger, but what can I do?
I'll send you the check tomorrow.
And the document for them to go visit him...
Yes, official.
Right.
OK.
Thank you, Roger.
See you.
Here.
Just show it, that's all.
- Thank you, uncle.
- What else did he say?
Your uncle will have to await the trial in jail.
- Why?
- It's not his first offense.
What?
- He's been arrested once.
- What happened?
A fight.
I was in it too, but he said it was just him.
He was in jail for a few days.
And now?
Roger will ask for a habeas corpus.
But it may take a while.
- Take a taxi, OK?
- We can go by bus.
No!
I don't want you walking around there.
- Bye.
- Take care you two.
Bye!
Frances lives near there.
I always take the bus.
- We can use the money on CDs.
- OK.
One original or four pirate CDs?
- What's this?
- A Pokémon pen.
- You must leave it here.
- Why?
- It could kill someone.
- I can't believe it.
Come on, let's go.
I never thought that a Pokémon pen could kill.
Do you think a CD could kill?
I don't know.
Only if it's a really bad CD.
I thought there would be bars separating us from the prisoners.
That's why they search you at the entrance.
Hey, Duca.
I've missed you, man!
This is Isa.
I invited her to come along.
- How's it going?
- Good.
- You devil!
- Mom and dad said hi.
How are you?
Well... fine.
The food sucks, but I'mfine.
- And you?
- I'm good too.
- So... how's school going, Duca?
- Fine.
I'm doing well.
Is there anything you need?
Could you do me a favor?
Sure, what?
- Give Soraia a message.
- Who's Soraia?
The guy's wife.
- Don't tell your dad anything, OK?
- OK.
Tell her not to worry.
Tell her not to come visit me.
If she asks you how am I, tell her I'm fine.
And that I know for sure it will all work out.
Will you tell her?
- But I don't know her address.
- It's Brigadeiro...
- I don't have a pen.
- We'll learn it.
- Good, Ciça.
- Isa.
Brigadeiro Afranio M. Souza, 731, building 1, penthouse 2.
- Brigadeiro Afranio M. Souza, 731.
- Building 1, penthouse 2.
- That's it.
- Brigadeiro Afranio M. Souza... 731, building 1, penthouse 2.
That's my nephew.
Tell your dad...
Brigadeiro Afranio M. Souza,731, Building 1,penthouse 2.
Brigadeiro Afranio M. Souza,731, building 1,penthouse 2.
731,building 1,penthouse 2.
What's the address?
731, building 1, penthouse 2, Brigadeiro Afranio M. Souza.
I learned it the other way round.
We have to catch the 514 to go straight downtown.
Brigadeiro Afranio M. Souza, 731,building 1...
The five fourteen!
My pen!
We shouldn't have got off here.
Bad place to be walking around.
You could get the pen next week.
Are you crazy?
They'd never keep it.
You should have come earlier.
- We didn't know.
- No, I said no, kid.
He won't let us in.
If he thought that a Pokémon pen could kill... now he'll think we're back to set up a mass escape.
You'll keep it, huh?
Only Isa can accomplish this mission.
The face she makes, like she's annoyed... and amused at the same time...
Is more dangerous than 1OO Pokémon pens put together.
- I want to keep this one.
- OK, but then burn it for me.
- This one too.
- But burn it for me too.
- You can keep that one.
- OK.
Hey, babe?
What's up with the gringo CDs?
Let's take a look.
That's a lot of CDs.
Can I have one?
Get lost!
What's up, man?
She's way off...
Isa!
The bus!
Stop, stop, stop!
Open the door!
Stop the bus, open the door!
Shit!
The 514...
- Remember the woman's address?
- What woman?
They ran after us, right, Duca?
I think they had a knife.
A big knife, and probably a gun too, right Duca?
They got on the bus, we escaped by the front door.
Isn't that right, Duca?
- Didn't you do anything?
- Three big guys against one?
- Three or four?
- Four!
it was 4 guys.
- I saw 3.
- Are you blind?
And the guy at the bus stop?
He did nothing to stop them.
He was waiting for the bus.
He didn't see any muggers.
That's why he did nothing.
I saw no muggers either.
- That's why you did nothing?
- Yes!
You run off... because a guy asks to see a CD.
Nice to know you don't believe me.
I'm an Idiot.
I argue with Isa just when she's all excited with ourstory.
Should I tell her she was right, that there were four guys?
No, I'll just act like nothing happened.
I remember the street:
Brigadeiro Afranio M. Souza.
Building 1, penthouse 2.
But I forgot the number.
Me too.
I'll look for the condos with 2 buildings.
Good luck.
I'll come with you.
Now it's Kid who'll have a story to tell without her.
And she must be dying with jealousy.
But she can't take it back so soon and say she wants to come too.
You take the even side and I take the odd side.
Right.
Just ask at the condos with 2 buildings.
- This street is about 3 km.
- How do you know?
We're at number 345O.
The numbers are the distance in meters from the start.
God, then this street has about 2 hundred buildings, man.
3450 meters...
Hi.
Is there any Soraia...?
If each condo has 20 meters... that's 172,5 buildings each side... or 345 buildings.
This street has many big condos, with 2 buildings.
Maybe 3O% .
3O percent of 345 is...
- Why do you want to know?
- I'm her boyfriend's nephew.
I need to speak to her.
- Just a moment, what's your name?
- Luis Eduardo.
Duca.
Kid!
- Is he with you?
- Yes, he's my friend.
- What's his name?
- What's your name?
- Leonardo.
- It's Leonardo.
Mrs. Soraia?
Luis Eduardo, Mr. Eder's nephew, wants to see you.
- Eder what?
- Eder Fragoso.
Fragoso.
Eder Fragoso.
OK, you can go up.
- Where's the light switch?
- I don't know.
Fuck!
Are you looking for something?
No, we just fell here.
I hated this vase.
Sorry, it was dark...
Honestly, I hated it.
- Is he Eder's nephew too?
- No, he's my classmate, Leonardo.
- Come in.
- Excuse us...
- Excuse us.
- Please.
Take a seat.
Would you like anything to drink?
- No, thanks.
- Take a sit.
Aren't you a little young to be his classmate?
No, he's too old.
He flunked twice.
So, why are you here?
- To give you a message from Eder.
- What message?
He said that you must not worry, Mrs.
'Mrs.'?
Yes, you.
He said you must not worry.
He's fine.
- Who?
- Uncle Eder.
Your boyfriend.
Oh, of course.
And that you must not visit him.
Everything will be OK.
That's good.
- And... what else?
- Nothing.
Good.
A Robotclear...
- It doesn't work. it's bust.
- It must be the chain. it locks.
Can you fix it?
My pool is turning green.
Yes...
Maybe.
Please.
It's working.
Thank you!
Let's go?
Sorry about the vase.
No problem.
If the doorman had seen the carpet, wed be history, man!
If a vase like that falls on you, It can kill you.
Am I right, Duca?
She was really hot, man.
Practically naked, you know...
Duca's uncle's girlfriend.
A real slut.
Really bad.
I knew she was trouble.
I kept well away, man.
It's disgusting.
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Sure.
I didn't tell Kid.
But I saw there was a guy at Soraia's place.
- And?
- It's obvious it's her boyfriend.
I don't think my uncle knows she has another boyfriend.
I don't think so.
Should I tell him?
- I don't think so.
- Why not?
I don't know.
It's humiliating.
If it were me, I'd rather not hear it from another person.
- Really?
- Really.
- Has she visited him in prison?
- I don't think so.
No, she hasn't.
How do you know that?
- He doesn't want her to.
- But why?
He didn't tell me that.
- I'm going now.
- Take a taxi this time.
Take some, son.
Hold on...
Don't you think it's strange that she hasn't visited Eder even once?
- He asked her not to go...
- But why?
If I had a woman like that, I'd hate to see her entering a prison.
- What do you mean 'like that'?
- Like that... that type.
- What type?
- Like that, honey... in tight-fitting clothes, vulgar, you know?
Vulgar?
I see...
Eder kills a guy because of her... and she won't even visit him in jail?
Maybe they have something to hide.
If they had anything to hide, he would tell her to go there.
It would be natural.
Aren't they together?
Only if he were a total idiot would he tell her not to go.
Honey, he is an idiot.
Yes.
- What's that?
- Nothing, just some guys were...
- Did you give her the message?
- Yes.
- So?
- She said 'that's good'.
- That's good.
- 'That's good'?
She said that?
- What else?
- 'What else?
'
- What else did she say?
- That's it.
She asked 'what else'?
- What else?
- Oh, OK.
And you?
- 'Nothing.'
- You didn't say anything else?
No, she said 'what else?
' And I said 'nothing'.
OK, OK.
I'mjust...
- How was she?
- What do you mean?
- Was she OK?
- She was great.
- Great?
What do you mean?
- No, uncle.
She was OK.
OK.
Oh, man...
You scared me there...
- She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Yes, very beautiful.
What was she wearing?
She...
I didn't notice.
You told her not to come visit me.
- Yes.
- And her?
She said 'OK'.
I'm afraid she may do something stupid.
Poor girl.
My dad's right.
Uncle Eder really is an Idiot.
- You must think I'm an idiot.
- No, uncle, of course not.
It will be alright, man.
Her husband was a violent creep.
He picked fights with lots of people.
He doesn't have a clue.
You know, some people just don't have a clue.
He was always armed.
He didn't accept their separation.
He came to my place.
I've never had a gun, never fired a shot in my life!
- Only one.
- What?
That one.
Right, that one I fired myself.
That was the first shot I...
Why did you clean the gun?
Yes.
That was a stupid, foolish thing to do.
- Why didn't you call her?
- When?
When you shot the guy.
Why didn't you call her?
I don't know.
I didn't want to tell her over the phone.
- He didn't do it.
- What?
My uncle didn't kill the guy.
- Who did it?
- She did.
- Soraia?
- Yes.
- Did he tell you?
- No, he said it was him.
Yucky sweet!
- How do you know it was her?
- I'msure it was.
Why?
I think she was there when the guy arrived.
They had a fight, but she shot him.
That's why he cleaned the gun.
And that's why he didn't call her.
- Is he going to prison for her?
- He doesn't think so.
He thinks it was an accident, or self-defense, I don't know.
- He must be crazy for her.
- He thinks she's crazy for him.
- Isn't she?
- It doesn't seem so.
- And now?
- What?
- What to do?
- I don't know.
- Can't you prove she did it?
- I guess not.
He says he's the one who shot.
Only if he tells the truth.
- And he won't.
- No.
Unless he knew she has another guy.
How can he find out?
Will you tell him?
No.
He won't believe it.
He's an idiot.
She should tell him herself.
It would be more honest.
You don't know his girlfriend.
So?
'Private Detective'.
- 2.9OO answers.
- Jesus!
I'll type 'infidelity'...
- 243.
- Still...
Hey!
Look!
'saturn Agency'.
Cool slogan:
d on't be in doubt:
Be sure!
'
'Proof of marital infidelity:
Films, photos, recordings in generals.'
'Recordings in generals'!
A detective doesn't have to be a grammar genius.
Look: 'Price negotiable.' The first appointment is free.
- I want to come with you.
- No.
It may be dangerous.
I guess you're right.
She agreed quicker than I thought.
It may actually be dangerous.
SATURN AGENCY, INVESTIGATIONS
- Yes?
- I have an appointment.
- This is a detective's agency.
- I know.
I called.
Luis Eduardo.
Just a moment.
It didn't open.
- It's not opening.
- Just a moment.
- Cicero will see you in a minute.
- Thank you.
STEAK
- Luis Eduardo?
- Yes.
Please, come in.
DON'T ENTER WITHOUT APPOINTMENT
- Did he ask you to see me?
- He doesn't know.
Why do you want to know if she has a lover?
Because he should know.
- Yes?
- I think he's innocent.
- So why was he arrested?
- He said he killed the guy.
- It was self-defense.
- So you think that it was her and he decided to take the blame.
- Maybe.
- And who's going to pay my fees?
- How much is it?
That depends.
- Depends on what?
- It depends how long it takes.
Lovers usually choose one day in the week to meet.
That's why I need at least one week.
- And how much does one week cost?
- $5OO, minimum.
- I can't pay that.
- Hold on, kid.
Take it easy.
Sit down.
- How much can you pay?
- $2OO, tops.
$25O, OK?
OK, I can do a preliminary investigation.
What's that?
A preliminary investigation...
is a prior investigation.
- $ 15O up front.
- OK.
No receipt for that price.
Oh, on your website it says 'recordings in generals'.
It should be 'recordings in general'.
Thank you.
My nephew made the site.
For free.
I'll get it fixed.
I'll call you when there's any news.
- This price is without a receipt.
- OK.
Bye.
- 'Preliminary investigation'?
- It's a prior investigation.
- What's his office like?
- Well...
Normal.
An office.
- How was he dressed?
- Pants, shirt.
Normal.
- Normal?
What color?
- What color?
- Yes, what color?
- Navy blue pants, red shirt...
- Navy blue with red?
- Yes, I don't know.
- Was there a glass door?
- What glass door?
It's in all detective movies, with a name on it?
No.
I don't think so.
I didn't notice.
- What's the secretary's name?
- I didn't ask.
- And her clothes?
- Her clothes?
A coat with polka dots, checked...
- Necklace?
- Yes...
With black beads like...
- And the hair?
- The hair?
Styled.
- Blonde?
- Yes, kind of.
- And the shoes?
- Shoes... high heeled, red.
- Make-up?
- I didn't notice.
Shit!
Next time I'll come with you.
Let's change the subject.
I'll see you there tomorrow.
Take care, man.
- What's up?
- Nothing.
Nothing?
What were you talking about?
- The biology test.
- Shit, Isa!
You said there would be no questions about agglutinogen.
And there were.
I think I bombed.
There's only one question on that, you bombed 'cause you didn't study.
What about the chemistry project?
- Can we do it on Saturday?
- No, not Saturday.
On Friday it's room 2O3's party.
- Are you going?
- No, I don't think so.
- And you?
Are you going?
- Are you inviting me?
It's not my party.
You do what you like.
- I'll think about it.
- OK.
- Kid's been a jerk.
- Are you together?
- No.
Why?
- No reason.
- Did he tell you anything?
- What's there to tell?
I don't know.
Why aren't you going to the party?
- Are you inviting me?
- It's not my party.
- Do what you like.
- I'll think about it.
If this angle is 6O, this one will also be 6O.
The sum of the internal angles of a triangle is always 18O.
Isa is really gone on Kid.
If she goes to the party, they're sure to make out.
And I don't want to be there to see it.
Ana Paula, tell me what angle...
Unless he makes out with someone else.
You come do it then.
So this angle is equal to this, which is equal to this one.
OK?
OK, thanks, see you next time.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Are you going to the party?
- Why?
- No reason.
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.
- Why are you asking?
- Don't tell that I told you.
- Go on!
- Kid asked if you were going.
- Kid?
- Yes.
- I don't know, but I think so.
OK.
- What's up with that hot babe?
- Nothing.
Please!
I saw her smiling at me.
- She asked me not to tell.
- Not to tell what?
- Don't tell her I told you.
- Tell me!
She asked if you were going to the party.
- Did she?
- Yes.
Man, Ana Paula is so hot...
- I didn't think you were coming.
- Well, I did.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
What do you mean?
What's up?
I don't know.
Tell me.
I'mnot in a party mood tonight.
- Then why did you come?
- I don't know.
I wanted to, earlier.
I never really know what I want.
Mom says when we were kids you never wanted one thing or another.
Youd always answer:
'I want one thing'and or'another'.
Do you think I'mvery childish?
You always thought I was childish.
Since we were children.
I don't think that anymore.
That's good.
Do you really think so?
Sometimes it's bad not being a child anymore.
Yes, sometimes it's bad.
Do you want a drink?
- Yes.
- I'll go get it.
- Let's dance?
- Let's.
Did he really kill the guy?
- Yes.
He confessed it.
- And what else did he do?
Nothing.
He killed the guy, that's it.
- What's the prison like?
- It's sad.
How do you mean, sad?
It's sad.
Very sad.
I'm leaving.
- Are you feeling better?
- Yes.
- So you're going to school?
- Yes.
- Drink a lot of water.
- Yes.
- How's it going?
- Better.
Are you going to school?
Yes.
But I'll skip religion class.
Oh, that's OK.
Let's go?
- Drink a lot of water, OK?
- OK.
- Let's go, let's go.
- Bye, son.
Hello?
it's me.
I can.
What time?
OK.
Did you discover anything?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- What happened?
- I over slept.
- I never saw you leave the party.
- I left early.
- What time did you leave?
- Around four.
- I saw you with Ana Paula.
- Did you?
- Did you make out?
- No.
We just talked.
- What about Kid?
- What about him?
- Are you seeing each other?
- I think so.
The detective called me.
- Did he discover anything?
- He took some photos.
- Of her?
- I think so.
- With the guy?
- I think so.
- When are you going there?
- Tomorrow, at 6.
Shit!
I have to go to the dentist's at 5!
But OK, after that I'll get a taxi and meet you there.
Wearlng make up.
No necklace.
Shoes...
The shoes were actually red.
Pretty.
Reading...
I couldn't read the title.
- Do you like detective novels?
- Not really.
I've read Agatha Christie.
That's nothing to be ashamed of.
- Come in.
- I'm waiting for someone.
It's 6:15.
OK.
The receipt for the photo development.
Pay the secretary.
Your aunt with the pool cleaning kid.
She wanted him.
Took her bikini off.
He went for it.
Who wouldn't, right?
Your aunt is hot.
First class stuff.
Just look at that!
- So?
Have you been there already?
- Yes. it's 6:3O.
Shit!
I paid $ 9 for the taxi!
How was it?
- The photos?
- Yes.
Of her?
With the guy?
Shit, let me see!
- No.
- What do you mean?
- Youd better not see them.
- Why not?
- I'll send them to my uncle.
- What is it?
Let me see!
- No.
- Let me see it!
- No!
- Why not?
- Because she's naked.
- Let me see the photos!
- No!
- Give me!
Why not?
I lent you the money!
- I'll give it back.
- No!
I want to see them!
It's not your business.
It's my uncle's stuff.
- You won't show me?
- No.
- Are you serious?
- Yes.
- You're a jerk.
- I don't want to show them!
Oh, Duca, you're so childish...
Duca!
Let's go!
I'm coming!
- Duca!
Duca!
- What?
- You didn't return Dulce's video.
- I haven't been back at Isa's.
- Luis Eduardo!
- What?
Dulce lent it to me on Tuesday.
Today is Sunday.
I'll have to pay 5-days rental.
- 6, if you count today.
- 6 days!
- I haven't been at Isa's.
- You could have told me.
Or given it to Isa at school.
You're right, I'msorry.
- Are you going there today?
- No.
- What is it?
- It's Duca.
He forgot to return Dulce's video, I'll have to pay 6-days rental.
Don't return it.
I missed the end.
You'll fall asleep again, I'll have to pay for one more day!
- They had a fight.
- Who?
- Duca and Isa.
- So?
They've been fighting every day for the past 15 years.
But now they haven't fought for a week.
That's strange.
It is, really.
Do you think they had a fight?
- Hello.
- Hi.
What are you doing?
- I'm listening to music.
- What music?
A rap CD.
- Can I come over?
- Now?
- Yes.
- OK.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm sorry for calling you childish that day.
That's OK.
We're going to the beach on Saturday.
- Who's going?
- Me, Kid, Ana Paula, Frances...
PHOTOS SORAIA
- MAXIMIZE
We're going to Frances' house.
Do you want to come?
I don't think so.
CLOSE
Ana Paula asked if you're going.
Did she?
MAXIMIZE
- Tell her I'm not going.
- Why not?
- I don't feel like it.
- OK.
Come in.
Lunch is ready.
- I'm leaving.
- Why don't you join us?
- She's leaving.
- I've made your favorite pizza!
Come on, son. it will get cold.
The staircase was like a maze.
It was a huge, old monastery... with secret passages.
The chief monk was James Bond.
- The old one?
- Yes, the old one.
And then a monk swallows a book and the library catches fire.
- You told her the end.
- It's OK, I'll forget it.
Each day a monk dies.
One by fire, another in water, one in ice...
Hello?
- You can come up.
- But the James Bond monk discovers...
It's Eder.
- Eder?
- He's coming up.
- Hello!
- Hi.
This is great.
Duca...
- What happened?
- I can wait for the trial in liberty.
- Great!
- We must pay Roger.
- He's a friend.
- Exactly.
- How's it going, Ciça?
- Hi, Eder.
- Oh!
it's fantastic...
- What?
A sofa...
I'd never realized...
One month without sitting on a sofa changes your life.
Look at that:
Napkins, real glasses, books...
Look, the remote control!
Everything tastes different to me.
What's for lunch?
Sardine pizza.
But there's also beans, shall I heat them up?
- Please.
If you don't mind.
- Oh, Eder...
This month changed my life.
I'ma new man.
- That's good!
- I'll start over from scratch.
Look... the things I had when I was arrested:
Chain, pen, key ring, my lighter...
- I stopped smoking in jail!
- That's great!
Man, I want to go back to school, get married, have children.
- Take it easy.
- I'm serious!
I'm the kind of guy who, in a way, wants children.
- You know?
I'm almost 3O.
- 31, right, Duca?
So, 31 is almost 3O.
31 is young:
Rodrigo Santoro is 3O.
But I'll tell you a secret:
Do you know what really changes a man?
A great passion.
A great woman.
That's what changes a man.
- You'll meet her, uncle.
- Will meet her?
I have met her.
Soraia!
- Soraia is the woman of my life.
- How did you get released?
The lawyer got me a habeas corpus.
OK, nice and warm:
Rice, beans and chicken breast.
What are those photos, Eder?
- What the fuck!
- Eder!
- That miserable slut!
- Calm down!
She already has another!
And I go to jail for her!
- What?
- I didn't kill him!
She did!
- Who?
- Soraia.
She was there!
We had a fight, I took his gun, gave it to her.
She fired it and killed him.
And now she's here...
- What the fuck!
- Laerte!
- You must tell the police!
- I'll kill her first.
Take it easy, take it easy.
- Calm down!
- I'll kill her.
Her and her fucking whitey!
- You're crazy!
- Eder, wait!
Come here.
Idiot!
- I'm going.
- Wait.
- I'll go get my bag.
- Wait.
Let's call Kid.
We should, shouldn't we?
Aunt Joan?
it's Duca.
Thanks, I'll come over, sure.
WHERE'S KID?
ANY1 SEEN HIM 2DAY?
Is Kid there?
Out?
Do you know where he is?
OK.
HE SAID HE WAZ CLEANING A POOL 2DAY
Alright.
I'll tell him.
KID
- POOL Alright, then.
Bye.
- Look.
- We have to go there.
- Where?
- Soraia's place.
- What if he's there?
- Who cares?
We must go there.
I will.
Imagine if uncle catches them together.
I am imagining.
Eder?
- Yes?
- I need to speak to Soraia.
- Are you a relative?
- Nephew.
- Nephew?
- My uncle's her boyfriend.
OK, you can go up.
He's here, he went straight to the penthouse.
He must be in the pool.
Let go!
Let go of him!
Who is this guy?
He's my brother.
Fabio!
Your brother?
- But who's this here?
- Are you crazy?
Stop it!
Stop it, both of you.
- Bastard!
- Slut!
Stop it!
What's this?
Did you have someone spy on me?
I did!
So what?
You don't fool me.
Is that your brother too?
How many brothers do you have?
- Door bell.
- Can you get it?
- Sure?
- Yes, it's alright.
Eder, you're an idiot!
These photos show absolutely nothing.
Nothing!
Look:
That's me, sunbathing, like I always do.
Then the boy arrives.
I go get the door.
He comes in, starts cleaning the pool.
Then he says he's finished, I go in to get the money.
He goes in too.
I go sunbathing again.
I undo the bikini top not to leave a mark.
Then I get tired of sunbathing and I go back inside.
I don't understand what the problem is.
Don't you love me anymore, don't you believe me?
Is that it?
- Brother?
- And who are you?
He's a nephew of Soraia's...
her boyfriend's...
- Is my uncle here?
- That idiot?
Yes.
Can I come in?
- Forgive me, Soraia.
- No.
You distrusted me.
I don't know what came over me.
The photos were out of order.
- Forgive me, my love...
- lf you loved me, youd trust me.
No, forget about it.
I love you so much, Soraia...
I love you too...
Hi, kids.
Hey, what are you doing here?
We came to see if you needed anything.
- This is Duca, my nephew.
- We've met.
Your dad is right.
Your uncle is an idiot.
I know.
Only an idiot would believe Sorala's story.
If things had happened like she said... that day, the sun traveled back and forwards.
And that cat learned to walk backwards.
I thought about telling him.
But he was so happy.
- Eder.
- I decided to leave it.
Take one.
Look, it turns.
He didn't tell the police that shed shot the guy.
It may have been self-defense, I don't know.
He says everything will be alright.
She's kind of funny.
Friendly.
- I think that's silicon.
- Is it?
I haven't noticed.
- She said she wants a baby.
- Eder is a complete idiot.
Sounds like a good idea...
Please...
Isa never found out how Kid ended up at Soraia's.
- And you?
- I wouldn't tell her.
My name's Leonardo.
Kid said that the woman was all over him.
She paid him $100 to go back the next day... to clean the pool.
He went back, of course.
The woman came on to him even stronger.
He was sure she wanted him.
Well, it seems that he was wrong.
- Why are you here?
- He worked all afternoon.
- Get out!
- He never got paid.
- At least, that's what he told me.
- I should call the police!
Crazy woman!
Oh shit, not this light again!
Isa came over to study maths.
But we hardly studied at all.
Why didn't you show me the photos that day?
I couldn't show you photos of Kid with another woman.
- It would be humiliating.
- I see.
Also, Kid is my friend, I couldn't snitch on him.
Your friend is an idiot.
We're not seeing each other anymore.
I'm sorry.
Are you really sorry?
She looked at me and smiled.
I smiled back.
No.
I think it's great.
We kissed.
And that's it.

Good run, everybody.
Don't forget to stretch it out.
Mr. Altman.
I wanted to come by.
If there's anything I can do...
There's nothing that any of us can do now.
She really loved this time of year.
You were really focused out there... speaking as one of the dozens you passed.
- I'm Lana.
- Jordan Cross.
I just started here a couple days ago.
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.
There's a lot more where that came from.
Hey.
Nice job out there today.
When are you gonna join...?
The team?
You all right?
Jordan.
The totally overwhelmed look gave you away.
I'm Clark.
Right.
The mentor guy.
Hi.
We were supposed to meet in the gym.
They said you bolted.
Is everything okay?
I'm still getting used to all these people.
I was home schooled up until now.
Allow me to be your lifeline.
All new students are assigned a mentor... mostly because they have a map.
Here's the lay of the land.
Would you mind if I checked with my dad?
Sure.
It happened again, didn't it?
Jordan, I know how much you want this to work... but I still think it's a mistake.
No.
Not today.
- Don't be today.
- Jordan.
- Mr. Altman?
Are you okay?
- Why did you stop me?
I just wanted to be with my little girl.
My daughter is dead, and it is my fault.
♪ Smallville: "Hereafter" ♪ Season 3 Episode 12
Original Airdate Feb. 4, 2004
Megan, could you go and ask the nurse if Mr. Altman's ready for visitors?
How's Mr. Altman?
He's pretty heavily sedated.
They want to keep him here until they can do a full psych evaluation.
I didn't know you and Megan knew Mr. Altman so well.
It's really through his daughter.
We were all in the cheerleading squad back in junior high.
Mr. Altman was never the same after she got hurt.
- I remember she was hit by a car.
- Walking home from our end-of-season party.
The doctors said there was no chance for recovery...
But Mr. Altman kept hoping for a miracle.
It sounds like that never came.
He took her off life support last month.
I wouldn't wish that decision on anyone.
It's hard when you blame yourself for everything that happened.
I'd better go.
If I could change that night, I would.
I don't even remember why Julia and I were fighting.
Megan, don't do this.
Julia left that night because she was mad at me.
If I had just stopped her...
I wish I'd gone after her too, but...
You know, neither of us could have known what was going to happen.
You can't keep blaming yourself.
I should've told him then.
He's under sedation.
I'm not sure he's even hearing you.
Come on.
Let's go.
I'm so sorry.
Hey, Jordan, it's just me.
Yeah.
Hi.
I'm sorry for dropping the mentor ball yesterday.
Mr. Altman's lucky you were there.
I just wish my dad hadn't seen it.
Just tell him that Smallville High is rarely that exciting.
Trust me, my parents wrote the book on being overprotective.
You'll be fine.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
I just don't like being touched.
Fair enough.
What?
Nothing.
You just had that look yesterday... just before Mr. Altman jumped in front of the car.
It's almost like you knew he was gonna do something.
I need some air.
- Good night.
- Bye, Lana.
Get it off me!
It burns!
Get it off!
It hurts!
It burns!
Adam, are you all right?
Adam, wake up.
Get off!
Lana.
What happened?
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
You were having a king-sized nightmare.
I guess.
Do you want to talk about it?
To be honest, no, not really.
I'll put some clothes on, clean up this mess.
Clark, we've been looking all over for you.
- Who gets to do the honors?
- What's going on?
Ready to hear the latest news about Lana's houseguest?
Actually, no.
"No" as in you're not interested?
No. "No" as in it's none of my business.
Lana and I finally reset our relationship to the friendship level.
I'm not gonna blow it by getting between her and Adam.
Clark's taking one for the team.
From now on, consider me an Adam-free zone.
Okay.
Now that we can scratch gossip off the discussion list... what's next on the agenda?
What have you guys heard about that new kid, Jordan Cross?
You mean, Mr. Pathologically-Afraid-of-Human-Contact?
I guess he made quite a first impression.
Look, this is gonna sound crazy... but I think he had a premonition about Mr. Altman.
What made you take that leap?
Let's call it a gut feeling.
- Maybe that's the same thing Jordan had.
- What do you mean?
Some people believe premonitions are just heightened intuition.
Maybe he overheard something or saw a look in Altman's eyes.
But given your past with Wall of Weirdness, we should look into it.
- Thanks.
- No thanks required.
It's kind of fun being Woodward to your Bernstein again.
- Lana, come in.
- Your message said it was important.
- Is something wrong?
- I was hoping you could tell me.
I understand there was an incident at the Talon last night.
Apparently some neighbors heard your tenant screaming?
I think that "incident" is a pretty strong word.
Adam had a bad dream, that's all.
It's no big deal.
If it had been the first time, I'd probably agree with you.
- What do you mean?
- I can read an invoice.
Let's see.
Charges for repairing broken windows... replacing furniture... all in the last week.
Is there a reason why you didn't tell me?
Maybe I thought you'd jump to conclusions.
You have to admit, Adam's behavior is unusual.
And when you're on the rebound, your emotions can outweigh your common sense.
Look, this isn't personal.
Adam's been a real help around the Talon.
Putting up with a few nightmares is a small price to pay.
Look, it's your call... but at the very least, you should be asking yourself... how much do you really know about your new friend?
Chloe, I think I found something.
Yeah?
You and me both.
I just had a mega-Real World moment with Ad...
Never mind.
Sorry.
Anyway, looks like you're hammering away at the Jordan story.
Yes.
I pulled this off the Ledger database.
Apparently when Jordan was six... he went ballistic outside a roller coaster, screaming someone was gonna be killed.
He dad pulled him away, but when they started the ride, one of the cars broke loose.
Killing the woman standing in line with him.
Mr. Altman wasn't Jordan's first premonition.
All right, well, cue the spooky music... because Jordan was born on the day of the meteor shower.
I took a quick trip to the courthouse and asked them to pull anything about Cross.
According to this, Jordan's mother died shortly after he was born... as a result of a direct hit from a meteor?
As one life ends, another begins.
Well, that must be the connection.
Yeah.
Mix that with meteor rocks, and you could be in John Edward territory.
- No, get away from me.
- Megan, please.
- This can't be good.
- Listen to me for one second.
Megan, please!
That's Jordan.
- Stop it!
- You don't understand!
- I'm trying to help you!
- Go away!
Megan, stop!
Please, I'm just asking you to let me walk you home.
You don't understand!
It's not what you think!
Leave me alone!
- What's going on?
- I have to help her!
Why?
Calm down!
What'll happen to her?
She's going to die, Clark.
Don't you understand?
She's going to die.
Jordan, hold up!
My father was right, Clark.
This was a mistake.
I should've never come to school.
Jordan...
I believe you.
You saw something when you touched Megan, didn't you?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Like a premonition?
I don't know what you're talking about!
I know about the roller coaster.
When you touched Megan, what'd you see?
I saw fire.
Smoke.
Megan was screaming.
She couldn't breathe.
Clark, I had to warn her.
Maybe we still can.
Megan's house is just around the corner.
These visions, when they hit, what are they like?
It's hard to describe.
It's like a curtain's being pulled back... just long enough for me to see the moment they die.
Have you ever been able to stop a vision from coming true?
Never.
My dad and I did everything we could.
We called the police, the paramedics... begged people to take us seriously.
But no matter what we did, the visions always came true.
That's how you knew Mr. Altman was gonna kill himself.
Except he survived.
Because of you.
How did you do it?
I had a vision of you too, when you grabbed me in the hallway.
What do you mean?
What'd you see?
Like, you don't have an end like other people.
It's like you live forever.
Come on, Jordan, you're wrong.
No.
Maybe that's why you were able to save Mr. Altman.
Nobody's ever been able to stop one of the deaths before.
Maybe you can do it again for Megan.
Excuse me.
Mr. Kent.
Why am I not surprised?
- Sheriff, what's happening?
- We just found Megan Calder's car... abandoned off the main highway.
There were signs of a struggle.
Are you Jordan Cross?
I'm told you got into an argument with Miss Calder today.
- I was there, sheriff.
It wasn't a big deal.
- I got a missing girl, Mr. Kent.
That makes everything a big deal.
We'd better talk.
It's a little early for your second triple cap, isn't it?
Actually, I came to talk to you about something.
- Is Adam around?
- I don't know.
I haven't seen him in a while.
You okay?
Well, I'm just having one of those "it sucks to be a reporter" days.
I know you and Adam have been spending a lot of time together, but...
Chloe, what's wrong?
They say music hath charms to soothe the savage breast.
Don't count on it.
You play?
I never really had the patience for it.
My parents would have killed for a piano like this.
I wound up learning on a second-hand junker.
It doesn't seem to have hurt your playing.
It's one of Rachmaninoff's most complicated pieces.
You didn't ask me here to discuss music theory.
No.
I thought we should meet.
- If it's about the lamp, I'll replace it.
- It's your behavior that concerns me, Adam.
- Lana's a friend.
- For what it's worth... we both care about Lana.
- What's this?
- Your colorful past.
These are my school records.
- They're supposed to be sealed.
- I'm not sure why you'd care.
They're exemplary.
Straight A's across the board.
- I was always a good student.
- Actually, I spoke with your teachers.
I believe the phrases they used were...
"a fine pupil" and "a joy to teach."
It's nice to be appreciated.
The strange thing is... they all said it.
Word for word.
Almost as if they were told what to say.
Don't worry, Adam.
I'll keep checking.
We all have black marks somewhere in our past.
Jordan.
Are you all right?
I had another vision.
I thought I could help.
It's okay.
Clark knows.
- Wait for me in the truck.
- Dad, please.
Jordan.
Excuse me.
Mr. Cross.
Jordan really wants to make a go of it at school.
- Would you give him one more chance?
- I really appreciate all you've done, Clark... but Jordan is... special.
If he's at home, at least I can try to protect him.
Jordan.
Oh, my God.
Jordan!
Jordan!
I got your message.
In case, you didn't notice, school's out.
I was at the Torch doing some research.
Adam, there's no easy way to ask this... but somebody found your needle in the trash today.
Technically, that's not a question.
Look, I'm trying to give you the benefit of the doubt.
Are you diabetic?
On some sort of medication?
Was that the research you were doing?
That would explain it... except diabetics leave their syringes with the school nurse.
Believe me, I am not trying to accuse you of anything.
Yes, you are.
You think I'm on drugs.
The truth is, you don't trust me.
Never have.
That's not fair.
You said you'd always be honest with me.
Why not now?
Look, I want this to work, but if you're not sure, just say the word.
I'm gone.
Adam!
Jordan.
- Are you okay?
- Fine.
- What are you doing here?
- Hiding from my father.
I think he wants to pull me out of school.
Running away isn't going to fix things...
It's changed.
- Jordan, what is it?
- Lana, please, don't leave here.
- What's going on?
- I can't explain it.
Something awful's about to happen.
We have to go find Clark!
Clark?
Wait...
What are you doing?
Adam?
Hello?
Last I heard, breaking and entering was still against the law.
I could say the same thing to you.
Except I own the place.
I take it you have some concerns about Lana's new friend?
I think that's pretty obvious.
So what caused you to go all cloak and dagger?
Rachmaninoff.
When Adam came to see me today, he was playing one of his most difficult pieces.
Is that a crime?
No CDs, sheet music... not even a radio.
According to his transcripts, he never took a single music class.
So computers, kickboxing and a master pianist.
Adam's a regular Renaissance man.
Like you said, that isn't a crime.
Though it certainly piqued your interest.
Lock up on your way out.
Clark!
Clark, you've been looking for Jordan all over town.
Time to call it a night.
I was supposed to help him fit in.
I took him to a crime scene.
I put him on the sheriff's radar.
- That is not your fault.
- Well, he was better off before he met me.
Clark, if he ran away, it's because he didn't feel like he had anybody at home to talk to.
- His dad seemed like a good man.
- I'm sure he is.
And I'm also sure he feels like he's doing the best thing for Jordan.
Look, when...
When your son has a gift... your first temptation is to hide him away, to shelter him from everything.
You didn't.
I sure as hell wanted to.
Look, your mother convinced me you needed to experience the whole world... not just this farm.
Ultimately, she was right.
So Jordan will come home... but not until he's good and ready.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
All right, why don't you come on inside, grab a bite to eat.
I'll be there in a second.
Okay.
- Clark.
- Jordan, what happened to you?
I was in school with Lana when somebody attacked us.
They took her!
- Who took her?
- I don't know!
I didn't see him.
Clark, I had another vision of Lana.
- What do you mean, "another"?
- I'm not sure.
The other day, she touched my hand on the track.
It was okay.
She was peaceful.
She was old.
It was her time.
- You're saying that's changed?
- She was trapped in a fire, just like Megan!
Okay, okay, calm down.
What else did you see?
Stuff on the floor, photos burning.
Lana and Megan were in one, but they were younger.
They were in cheerleading outfits.
Is this the girl?
Mr. Altman's daughter.
When I saved him, I changed everything... even what's supposed to happen to Lana.
Did you see anything that might tell us where she is?
- There was an old sign inside.
- What did it say?
- It said "Wandering Hills."
- I know where that is.
- Clark, take me with you.
- No way.
I've seen the house.
Maybe I can help you find it.
Please.
First sign of trouble, you back off.
Let's go.
Mr. Altman, why are you doing this?
Please, you don't have to do this!
- You're gonna pay for what you did to Julia.
- What are you talking about?
I heard you at the hospital.
Megan had a fight with her... and you let her leave.
You should have looked out for her.
- We didn't cause the accident.
- You might as well have.
My little girl was out there all alone because of you!
It wasn't our fault!
For years, I blamed myself for not being there...
Coach, this is not the way.
Now I know I wasn't responsible.
- You two killed her.
- No, we di...
- Please!
- No.
No!
Coach, don't!
No!
Help!
Help us!
Please!
Clark, look!
- Jordan, stay in the car.
- He's got them both.
You'll need help.
Stay in the car, Jordan.
Lana?
- Lana.
- Save Megan.
Get out.
Jordan!
I'll get Megan.
You stay away from me!
- I just want to be with my girl!
- Come on.
Come on, let's go.
Coach?
You've gotta get out of here!
You!
It's your fault!
- Where's Jordan?
- I didn't see him come out with us.
- Clark!
- Run!
Jordan!
Mr. Altman!
Coach Altman!
You've gotta get out of here!
Jordan.
Clark.
Clark, are you okay?
- Oh, my God.
Is he okay?
- He's not breathing.
Jordan.
Come on, Jordan.
You can't die on me.
Clark.
It's okay.
You're all right.
You're gonna be okay.
- Lex?
- Lana.
How you feeling?
Between the fire and my leg, I've seen enough hospitals to last a lifetime.
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.
Lex, I think you were right about taking a closer look at Adam.
Why the sudden change of heart?
Chloe caught him using some sort of drug at school... and when I confronted him about it, he almost lost it.
Lana, I've had people assume the worst about me all my life.
Trust me, it's hard to respond... when people always jump to the wrong conclusions.
Lex, the last time we talked, I got the impression... that you'd be happier if I kicked him out.
It's not my choice to make... but I've had a chance to ask a few questions.
Adam hasn't been healing as well as his doctors had hoped.
Apparently, he's part of a clinical medical trial testing a new drug.
That might explain the needle.
It doesn't explain why he was hiding it.
I'm just beginning to wonder who I let into my life.
You should trust your instincts.
Thanks, Lex.
I promise your second week of school will be easier.
The paramedics said if you hadn't given me CPR, I'd be...
- dead.
- But you're not.
I saw her, Clark.
- Who?
- My mom.
In that moment, right before you pulled me back.
She was beautiful.
I tried to run to her but couldn't.
Maybe it just wasn't your time.
When I woke up, they were gone.
The visions?
Maybe I was destined to lose them when I met you.
Mind if I interrupt?
Jordan, I brought your homework.
Why do I get the feeling you've got a new mentor?
I'm gonna help Jordan get back on his feet, and he's gonna help me get faster on mine.
I think you're getting the hang of this high school thing.
How you doing?
I know that look.
Are you sure you're okay?
Yeah, I'm fine, Clark.
I'll see you tomorrow.
So we've got a lot of work to do.
What's wrong?
Lana, it's about your friend... the one in the hall?
Adam.
He's from Oklahoma, right?
I don't know.
He's never really said anything.
Jordan, what's going on?
I think something really bad happened to him.
Well, he's been in the hospital.
He was pretty seriously injured a few months ago.
This is going to sound really strange... but I think it's worse than that.
I don't think he was just hurt.
I think he died.
You're awfully quiet today.
Having someone tell you you can change destiny is a lot to handle.
Jordan's visions really struck a chord.
Or just brought up questions I had all along.
Mom, by helping Mr. Altman, I put three other lives in jeopardy.
But you were there for them.
If it wasn't for me, he wouldn't have hurt anyone.
Clark, what's this really about?
I'm wondering if that's why I was really sent here... to change destiny.
What if I make a wrong choice, and I'm not there to make it right?
It's a huge responsibility.
You have to concentrate on the good you do.
Think of all the people you've saved, your dad, and me and Lex.
He's turned out to be a really good friend.
Sweetheart, you just have to do the best you can.
You can't save everybody.
I'll take some of these out to your dad.
I'll do it.
Well, could you please make sure at least a couple of them make it to the barn?
- Yes.
- Thank you.
Thanks, Mom.
Dad!
Dad.
Dad!
- Dad?
- Not now.
Not yet.
I love you, son.
Dad?
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Good run, everybody.
Don't forget to stretch it out.
Mr. Altman.
I wanted to come by.
If there's anything I can do....
There's nothing that any of us can do now.
She really loved this time of year.
You were really focused out there speaking as one of the dozens you passed.
-I'm Lana.
-Jordan Cross.
I just started here a couple days ago.
-Sorry.
-No, it's okay.
There's a lot more where that came from.
Hey.
Nice job out there today.
When are you gonna join--?
--the team?
You all right?
Jordan.
The totally overwhelmed look gave you away.
I'm Clark.
Right.
The mentor guy.
Hi.
We were supposed to meet in the gym.
They said you bolted.
Is everything okay?
I'm still getting used to all these people.
I was home schooled up until now.
Allow me to be your lifeline.
All new students are assigned a mentor mostly because they have a map.
Here's the lay of the land.
Would you mind if I checked with my dad?
Sure.
It happened again, didn't it?
Jordan, I know how much you want this to work but I still think it's a mistake.
No.
Not today.
-Don't be today.
-Jordan.
-Mr.
Altman?
Are you okay?
-Why did you stop me?
I just wanted to be with my little girl.
My daughter is dead, and it is my fault.
Megan, could you go and ask the nurse if Mr. Altman's ready for visitors?
How's Mr. Altman?
He's pretty heavily sedated.
They want to keep him here until they can do a full psych evaluation.
I didn't know you and Megan knew Mr. Altman so well.
It's really through his daughter.
We were all in the cheerleading squad back in junior high.
Mr. Altman was never the same after she got hurt.
-I remember she was hit by a car.
-Walking home from our end-of-season party.
The doctors said there was no chance for recovery....
But Mr. Altman kept hoping for a miracle.
It sounds like that never came.
He took her off life support last month.
I wouldn't wish that decision on anyone.
It's hard when you blame yourself for everything that happened.
I'd better go.
If I could change that night, I would.
I don't even remember why Julia and I were fighting.
Megan, don't do this.
Julia left that night because she was mad at me.
If I had just stopped her....
I wish I'd gone after her too, but....
You know, neither of us could have known what was going to happen.
You can't keep blaming yourself.
I should've told him then.
He's under sedation.
I'm not sure he's even hearing you.
Come on.
Let's go.
I'm so sorry.
Hey, Jordan, it's just me.
Yeah.
Hi.
I'm sorry for dropping the mentor ball yesterday.
Mr. Altman's lucky you were there.
I just wish my dad hadn't seen it.
Just tell him that Smallville High is rarely that exciting.
Trust me, my parents wrote the book on being overprotective.
You'll be fine.
-You all right?
-Yeah.
I just don't like being touched.
Fair enough.
What?
Nothing.
You just had that look yesterday just before Mr. Altman jumped in front of the car.
It's almost like you knew he was gonna do something.
I need some air.
-Good night.
-Bye, Lana.
Get it off me!
It burns!
Get it off!
It hurts!
It burns!
Adam, are you all right?
Adam, wake up.
Get off!
Lana.
What happened?
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
You were having a king-sized nightmare.
I guess.
Do you want to talk about it?
To be honest, no, not really.
I'll put some clothes on, clean up this mess.
Clark, we've been looking all over for you.
-Who gets to do the honors?
-What's going on?
Ready to hear the latest news about Lana's houseguest?
Actually, no.
"No" as in you're not interested?
No. "No" as in it's none of my business.
Lana and I finally reset our relationship to the friendship level.
I'm not gonna blow it by getting between her and Adam.
Clark's taking one for the team.
From now on, consider me an Adam-free zone.
Okay.
Now that we can scratch gossip off the discussion list what's next on the agenda?
What have you guys heard about that new kid, Jordan Cross?
You mean, Mr. Pathologically-Afraid-of-Human-Contact?
I guess he made quite a first impression.
Look, this is gonna sound crazy but I think he had a premonition about Mr. Altman.
What made you take that leap?
Let's call it a gut feeling.
-Maybe that's the same thing Jordan had.
-What do you mean?
Some people believe premonitions are just heightened intuition.
Maybe he overheard something or saw a look in Altman's eyes.
But given your past with Wall of Weirdness, we should look into it.
-Thanks.
-No thanks required.
It's kind of fun being Woodward to your Bernstein again.
-Lana, come in.
-Your message said it was important.
-ls something wrong?
-I was hoping you could tell me.
I understand there was an incident at the Talon last night.
Apparently some neighbors heard your tenant screaming?
I think that "incident" is a pretty strong word.
Adam had a bad dream, that's all.
It's no big deal.
If it had been the first time, I'd probably agree with you.
-What do you mean?
-I can read an invoice.
Let's see.
Charges for repairing broken windows replacing furniture all in the last week.
Is there a reason why you didn't tell me?
Maybe I thought you'd jump to conclusions.
You have to admit, Adam's behavior is unusual.
And when you're on the rebound, your emotions can outweigh your common sense.
Look, this isn't personal.
Adam's been a real help around the Talon.
Putting up with a few nightmares is a small price to pay.
Look, it's your call but at the very least, you should be asking yourself how much do you really know about your new friend?
Chloe, I think I found something.
Yeah?
You and me both.
I just had a mega-Real World moment with Ad--
Never mind.
Sorry.
Anyway, looks like you're hammering away at the Jordan story.
Yes.
I pulled this off the Ledger database.
Apparently when Jordan was six he went ballistic outside a roller coaster, screaming someone was gonna be killed.
He dad pulled him away, but when they started the ride, one of the cars broke loose.
Killing the woman standing in line with him.
Mr. Altman wasn't Jordan's first premonition.
All right, well, cue the spooky music because Jordan was born on the day of the meteor shower.
I took a quick trip to the courthouse and asked them to pull anything about Cross.
According to this, Jordan's mother died shortly after he was born as a result of a direct hit from a meteor?
As one life ends, another begins.
Well, that must be the connection.
Yeah.
Mix that with meteor rocks, and you could be in John Edward territory.
-No, get away from me.
-Megan, please.
-This can't be good.
-Listen to me for one second.
Megan, please!
That's Jordan.
-Stop it!
-You don't understand!
-I'm trying to help you!
-Go away!
Megan, stop!
Please, I'm just asking you to let me walk you home.
You don't understand!
It's not what you think!
Leave me alone!
-What's going on?
-I have to help her!
Why?
Calm down!
What'll happen to her?
She's going to die, Clark.
Don't you understand?
She's going to die.
Jordan, hold up!
My father was right, Clark.
This was a mistake.
I should've never come to school.
Jordan I believe you.
You saw something when you touched Megan, didn't you?
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Like a premonition?
I don't know what you're talking about!
I know about the roller coaster.
When you touched Megan, what'd you see?
I saw fire.
Smoke.
Megan was screaming.
She couldn't breathe.
Clark, I had to warn her.
Maybe we still can.
Megan's house is just around the corner.
These visions, when they hit, what are they like?
It's hard to describe.
It's like a curtain's being pulled back just long enough for me to see the moment they die.
Have you ever been able to stop a vision from coming true?
Never.
My dad and I did everything we could.
We called the police, the paramedics begged people to take us seriously.
But no matter what we did, the visions always came true.
That's how you knew Mr. Altman was gonna kill himself.
Except he survived.
Because of you.
How did you do it?
I had a vision of you too, when you grabbed me in the hallway.
What do you mean?
What'd you see?
Like, you don't have an end like other people.
It's like you live forever.
Come on, Jordan, you're wrong.
No.
Maybe that's why you were able to save Mr. Altman.
Nobody's ever been able to stop one of the deaths before.
Maybe you can do it again for Megan.
Excuse me.
Mr. Kent.
Why am I not surprised?
-Sheriff, what's happening?
-We just found Megan Calder's car abandoned off the main highway.
There were signs of a struggle.
Are you Jordan Cross?
I'm told you got into an argument with Miss Calder today.
-I was there, sheriff.
It wasn't a big deal.
-I got a missing girl, Mr. Kent.
That makes everything a big deal.
We'd better talk.
It's a little early for your second triple cap, isn't it?
Actually, I came to talk to you about something.
-ls Adam around?
-I don't know.
I haven't seen him in a while.
You okay?
Well, I'm just having one of those "it sucks to be a reporter" days.
I know you and Adam have been spending a lot of time together, but....
Chloe, what's wrong?
They say music hath charms to soothe the savage breast.
Don't count on it.
You play?
I never really had the patience for it.
My parents would have killed for a piano like this.
I wound up learning on a second-hand junker.
It doesn't seem to have hurt your playing.
It's one of Rachmaninoff's most complicated pieces.
You didn't ask me here to discuss music theory.
No.
I thought we should meet.
-lf it's about the lamp, I'll replace it.
-It's your behavior that concerns me, Adam.
-Lana's a friend.
-For what it's worth we both care about Lana.
-What's this?
-Your colorful past.
These are my school records.
-They're supposed to be sealed.
-I'm not sure why you'd care.
They're exemplary.
Straight A's across the board.
-I was always a good student.
-Actually, I spoke with your teachers.
I believe the phrases they used were "a fine pupil" and "a joy to teach."
It's nice to be appreciated.
The strange thing is they all said it.
Word for word.
Almost as if they were told what to say.
Don't worry, Adam.
I'll keep checking.
We all have black marks somewhere in our past.
Jordan.
Are you all right?
I had another vision.
I thought I could help.
It's okay.
Clark knows.
-Wait for me in the truck.
-Dad, please.
Jordan.
Excuse me.
Mr. Cross.
Jordan really wants to make a go of it at school.
-Would you give him one more chance?
-I really appreciate all you've done, Clark but Jordan is special.
If he's at home, at least I can try to protect him.
Jordan.
Oh, my God.
Jordan!
Jordan!
I got your message.
In case, you didn't notice, school's out.
I was at the Torch doing some research.
Adam, there's no easy way to ask this but somebody found your needle in the trash today.
Technically, that's not a question.
Look, I'm trying to give you the benefit of the doubt.
Are you diabetic?
On some sort of medication?
Was that the research you were doing?
That would explain it except diabetics leave their syringes with the school nurse.
Believe me, I am not trying to accuse you of anything.
Yes, you are.
You think I'm on drugs.
The truth is, you don't trust me.
Never have.
That's not fair.
You said you'd always be honest with me.
Why not now?
Look, I want this to work, but if you're not sure, just say the word.
I'm gone.
Adam!
Jordan.
-Are you okay?
-Fine.
-What are you doing here?
-Hiding from my father.
I think he wants to pull me out of school.
Running away isn't going to fix things--
It's changed.
-Jordan, what is it?
-Lana, please, don't leave here.
-What's going on?
-I can't explain it.
Something awful's about to happen.
We have to go find Clark!
Clark?
Wait--
What are you doing?
Adam?
Hello?
Last I heard, breaking and entering was still against the law.
I could say the same thing to you.
Except I own the place.
I take it you have some concerns about Lana's new friend?
I think that's pretty obvious.
So what caused you to go all cloak and dagger?
Rachmaninoff.
When Adam came to see me today, he was playing one of his most difficult pieces.
Is that a crime?
No CDs, sheet music not even a radio.
According to his transcripts, he never took a single music class.
So computers, kickboxing and a master pianist.
Adam's a regular Renaissance man.
Like you said, that isn't a crime.
Though it certainly piqued your interest.
Lock up on your way out.
Clark!
Clark, you've been looking for Jordan all over town.
Time to call it a night.
I was supposed to help him fit in.
I took him to a crime scene.
I put him on the sheriff's radar.

My little girl was out there all alone because of you!
It wasn't our fault!
For years, I blamed myself for not being there--
Coach, this is not the way.
Now I know I wasn't responsible.
-You two killed her.
-No, we di--
-Please!
-No.
No!
Coach, don't!
No!
Help!
Help us!
Please!
Clark, look!
-Jordan, stay in the car.
-He's got them both.
You'll need help.
Stay in the car, Jordan.
Lana?
-Lana.
-Save Megan.
Get out.
Jordan!
I'll get Megan.
You stay away from me!
-I just want to be with my girl!
-Come on.
Come on, let's go.
Coach?
You've gotta get out of here!
You!
It's your fault!
-Where's Jordan?
-I didn't see him come out with us.
-Clark!
-Run!
Jordan!
Mr. Altman!
Coach Altman!
You've gotta get out of here!
Jordan.
Clark.
Clark, are you okay?
-Oh, my God.
Is he okay?
-He's not breathing.
Jordan.
Come on, Jordan.
You can't die on me.
Clark.
It's okay.
You're all right.
You're gonna be okay.
-Lex?
-Lana.
How you feeling?
Between the fire and my leg, I've seen enough hospitals to last a lifetime.
-Have a seat.
-Thanks.
Lex, I think you were right about taking a closer look at Adam.
Why the sudden change of heart?
Chloe caught him using some sort of drug at school and when I confronted him about it, he almost lost it.

Well, could you please make sure at least a couple of them make it to the barn?
-Yes.
-Thank you.
Thanks, Mom.
Dad!
Dad.
Dad!
-Dad?
-Not now.
Not yet.
I love you, son.
Dad?
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Good run, everybody.
Don't forget to stretch it out.
Mr. Altman.
I wanted to come by.
If there's anything I can do....
There's nothing that any of us can do now.
She really loved this time of year.
You were really focused out there speaking as one of the dozens you passed.
-I'm Lana.
-Jordan Cross.
I just started here a couple days ago.
-Sorry.
-No, it's okay.
There's a lot more where that came from.
Hey.
Nice job out there today.
When are you gonna join--?
--the team?
You all right?
Jordan.
The totally overwhelmed look gave you away.
I'm Clark.
Right.
The mentor guy.
Hi.
We were supposed to meet in the gym.
They said you bolted.
Is everything okay?
I'm still getting used to all these people.
I was home schooled up until now.
Allow me to be your lifeline.
All new students are assigned a mentor mostly because they have a map.
Here's the lay of the land.
Would you mind if I checked with my dad?
Sure.
It happened again, didn't it?
Jordan, I know how much you want this to work but I still think it's a mistake.
No.
Not today.
-Don't be today.
-Jordan.
-Mr.
Altman?
Are you okay?
-Why did you stop me?
I just wanted to be with my little girl.
My daughter is dead, and it is my fault.
Megan, could you go and ask the nurse if Mr. Altman's ready for visitors?
How's Mr. Altman?
He's pretty heavily sedated.
They want to keep him here until they can do a full psych evaluation.
I didn't know you and Megan knew Mr. Altman so well.
It's really through his daughter.
We were all in the cheerleading squad back in junior high.
Mr. Altman was never the same after she got hurt.
-I remember she was hit by a car.
-Walking home from our end-of-season party.
The doctors said there was no chance for recovery....
But Mr. Altman kept hoping for a miracle.
It sounds like that never came.
He took her off life support last month.
I wouldn't wish that decision on anyone.
It's hard when you blame yourself for everything that happened.
I'd better go.
If I could change that night, I would.
I don't even remember why Julia and I were fighting.
Megan, don't do this.
Julia left that night because she was mad at me.
If I had just stopped her....
I wish I'd gone after her too, but....
You know, neither of us could have known what was going to happen.
You can't keep blaming yourself.
I should've told him then.
He's under sedation.
I'm not sure he's even hearing you.
Come on.
Let's go.
I'm so sorry.
Hey, Jordan, it's just me.
Yeah.
Hi.
I'm sorry for dropping the mentor ball yesterday.
Mr. Altman's lucky you were there.
I just wish my dad hadn't seen it.
Just tell him that Smallville High is rarely that exciting.
Trust me, my parents wrote the book on being overprotective.
You'll be fine.
-You all right?
-Yeah.
I just don't like being touched.
Fair enough.
What?
Nothing.
You just had that look yesterday just before Mr. Altman jumped in front of the car.
It's almost like you knew he was gonna do something.
I need some air.
-Good night.
-Bye, Lana.
Get it off me!
It burns!
Get it off!
It hurts!
It burns!
Adam, are you all right?
Adam, wake up.
Get off!
Lana.
What happened?
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
You were having a king-sized nightmare.
I guess.
Do you want to talk about it?
To be honest, no, not really.
I'll put some clothes on, clean up this mess.
Clark, we've been looking all over for you.
-Who gets to do the honors?
-What's going on?
Ready to hear the latest news about Lana's houseguest?
Actually, no.
"No" as in you're not interested?
No. "No" as in it's none of my business.
Lana and I finally reset our relationship to the friendship level.
I'm not gonna blow it by getting between her and Adam.
Clark's taking one for the team.
From now on, consider me an Adam-free zone.
Okay.
Now that we can scratch gossip off the discussion list what's next on the agenda?
What have you guys heard about that new kid, Jordan Cross?
You mean, Mr. Pathologically-Afraid-of-Human-Contact?
I guess he made quite a first impression.
Look, this is gonna sound crazy but I think he had a premonition about Mr. Altman.
What made you take that leap?
Let's call it a gut feeling.
-Maybe that's the same thing Jordan had.
-What do you mean?
Some people believe premonitions are just heightened intuition.
Maybe he overheard something or saw a look in Altman's eyes.
But given your past with Wall of Weirdness, we should look into it.
-Thanks.
-No thanks required.
It's kind of fun being Woodward to your Bernstein again.
-Lana, come in.
-Your message said it was important.
-ls something wrong?
-I was hoping you could tell me.
I understand there was an incident at the Talon last night.
Apparently some neighbors heard your tenant screaming?
I think that "incident" is a pretty strong word.
Adam had a bad dream, that's all.
It's no big deal.
If it had been the first time, I'd probably agree with you.
-What do you mean?
-I can read an invoice.
Let's see.
Charges for repairing broken windows replacing furniture all in the last week.
Is there a reason why you didn't tell me?
Maybe I thought you'd jump to conclusions.
You have to admit, Adam's behavior is unusual.
And when you're on the rebound, your emotions can outweigh your common sense.
Look, this isn't personal.
Adam's been a real help around the Talon.
Putting up with a few nightmares is a small price to pay.
Look, it's your call but at the very least, you should be asking yourself how much do you really know about your new friend?
Chloe, I think I found something.
Yeah?
You and me both.
I just had a mega-Real World moment with Ad--
Never mind.
Sorry.
Anyway, looks like you're hammering away at the Jordan story.
Yes.
I pulled this off the Ledger database.
Apparently when Jordan was six he went ballistic outside a roller coaster, screaming someone was gonna be killed.
He dad pulled him away, but when they started the ride, one of the cars broke loose.
Killing the woman standing in line with him.
Mr. Altman wasn't Jordan's first premonition.
All right, well, cue the spooky music because Jordan was born on the day of the meteor shower.
I took a quick trip to the courthouse and asked them to pull anything about Cross.
According to this, Jordan's mother died shortly after he was born as a result of a direct hit from a meteor?
As one life ends, another begins.
Well, that must be the connection.
Yeah.
Mix that with meteor rocks, and you could be in John Edward territory.
-No, get away from me.
-Megan, please.
-This can't be good.
-Listen to me for one second.
Megan, please!
That's Jordan.
-Stop it!
-You don't understand!
-I'm trying to help you!
-Go away!
Megan, stop!
Please, I'm just asking you to let me walk you home.
You don't understand!
It's not what you think!
Leave me alone!
-What's going on?
-I have to help her!
Why?
Calm down!
What'll happen to her?
She's going to die, Clark.
Don't you understand?
She's going to die.
Jordan, hold up!
My father was right, Clark.
This was a mistake.
I should've never come to school.
Jordan I believe you.
You saw something when you touched Megan, didn't you?
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Like a premonition?
I don't know what you're talking about!
I know about the roller coaster.
When you touched Megan, what'd you see?
I saw fire.
Smoke.
Megan was screaming.
She couldn't breathe.
Clark, I had to warn her.
Maybe we still can.
Megan's house is just around the corner.
These visions, when they hit, what are they like?
It's hard to describe.
It's like a curtain's being pulled back just long enough for me to see the moment they die.
Have you ever been able to stop a vision from coming true?
Never.
My dad and I did everything we could.
We called the police, the paramedics begged people to take us seriously.
But no matter what we did, the visions always came true.
That's how you knew Mr. Altman was gonna kill himself.
Except he survived.
Because of you.
How did you do it?
I had a vision of you too, when you grabbed me in the hallway.
What do you mean?
What'd you see?
Like, you don't have an end like other people.
It's like you live forever.
Come on, Jordan, you're wrong.
No.
Maybe that's why you were able to save Mr. Altman.
Nobody's ever been able to stop one of the deaths before.
Maybe you can do it again for Megan.
Excuse me.
Mr. Kent.
Why am I not surprised?
-Sheriff, what's happening?
-We just found Megan Calder's car abandoned off the main highway.
There were signs of a struggle.
Are you Jordan Cross?
I'm told you got into an argument with Miss Calder today.
-I was there, sheriff.
It wasn't a big deal.
-I got a missing girl, Mr. Kent.
That makes everything a big deal.
We'd better talk.
It's a little early for your second triple cap, isn't it?
Actually, I came to talk to you about something.
-ls Adam around?
-I don't know.
I haven't seen him in a while.
You okay?
Well, I'm just having one of those "it sucks to be a reporter" days.
I know you and Adam have been spending a lot of time together, but....
Chloe, what's wrong?
They say music hath charms to soothe the savage breast.
Don't count on it.
You play?
I never really had the patience for it.
My parents would have killed for a piano like this.
I wound up learning on a second-hand junker.
It doesn't seem to have hurt your playing.
It's one of Rachmaninoff's most complicated pieces.
You didn't ask me here to discuss music theory.
No.
I thought we should meet.
-lf it's about the lamp, I'll replace it.
-It's your behavior that concerns me, Adam.
-Lana's a friend.
-For what it's worth we both care about Lana.
-What's this?
-Your colorful past.
These are my school records.
-They're supposed to be sealed.
-I'm not sure why you'd care.
They're exemplary.
Straight A's across the board.
-I was always a good student.
-Actually, I spoke with your teachers.
I believe the phrases they used were "a fine pupil" and "a joy to teach."
It's nice to be appreciated.
The strange thing is they all said it.
Word for word.
Almost as if they were told what to say.
Don't worry, Adam.
I'll keep checking.
We all have black marks somewhere in our past.
Jordan.
Are you all right?
I had another vision.
I thought I could help.
It's okay.
Clark knows.
-Wait for me in the truck.
-Dad, please.
Jordan.
Excuse me.
Mr. Cross.
Jordan really wants to make a go of it at school.
-Would you give him one more chance?
-I really appreciate all you've done, Clark but Jordan is special.
If he's at home, at least I can try to protect him.
Jordan.
Oh, my God.
Jordan!
Jordan!
I got your message.
In case, you didn't notice, school's out.
I was at the Torch doing some research.
Adam, there's no easy way to ask this but somebody found your needle in the trash today.
Technically, that's not a question.
Look, I'm trying to give you the benefit of the doubt.
Are you diabetic?
On some sort of medication?
Was that the research you were doing?
That would explain it except diabetics leave their syringes with the school nurse.
Believe me, I am not trying to accuse you of anything.
Yes, you are.
You think I'm on drugs.
The truth is, you don't trust me.
Never have.
That's not fair.
You said you'd always be honest with me.
Why not now?
Look, I want this to work, but if you're not sure, just say the word.
I'm gone.
Adam!
Jordan.
-Are you okay?
-Fine.
-What are you doing here?
-Hiding from my father.
I think he wants to pull me out of school.
Running away isn't going to fix things--
It's changed.
-Jordan, what is it?
-Lana, please, don't leave here.
-What's going on?
-I can't explain it.
Something awful's about to happen.
We have to go find Clark!
Clark?
Wait--
What are you doing?
Adam?
Hello?
Last I heard, breaking and entering was still against the law.
I could say the same thing to you.
Except I own the place.
I take it you have some concerns about Lana's new friend?
I think that's pretty obvious.
So what caused you to go all cloak and dagger?
Rachmaninoff.
When Adam came to see me today, he was playing one of his most difficult pieces.
Is that a crime?
No CDs, sheet music not even a radio.
According to his transcripts, he never took a single music class.
So computers, kickboxing and a master pianist.
Adam's a regular Renaissance man.
Like you said, that isn't a crime.
Though it certainly piqued your interest.
Lock up on your way out.
Clark!
Clark, you've been looking for Jordan all over town.
Time to call it a night.
I was supposed to help him fit in.
I took him to a crime scene.
I put him on the sheriff's radar.
-That is not your fault.
-Well, he was better off before he met me.
Clark, if he ran away, it's because he didn't feel like he had anybody at home to talk to.
-His dad seemed like a good man.
-I'm sure he is.
And I'm also sure he feels like he's doing the best thing for Jordan.
Look, when--
When your son has a gift your first temptation is to hide him away, to shelter him from everything.
You didn't.
I sure as hell wanted to.
Look, your mother convinced me you needed to experience the whole world not just this farm.
Ultimately, she was right.
So Jordan will come home but not until he's good and ready.
-Okay?
-Yeah.
All right, why don't you come on inside, grab a bite to eat.
I'll be there in a second.
Okay.
-Clark.
-Jordan, what happened to you?
I was in school with Lana when somebody attacked us.
They took her!
-Who took her?
-I don't know!
I didn't see him.
Clark, I had another vision of Lana.
-What do you mean, "another"?
-I'm not sure.
The other day, she touched my hand on the track.
It was okay.
She was peaceful.
She was old.
It was her time.
-You're saying that's changed?
-She was trapped in a fire, just like Megan!
Okay, okay, calm down.
What else did you see?
Stuff on the floor, photos burning.
Lana and Megan were in one, but they were younger.
They were in cheerleading outfits.
Is this the girl?
Mr. Altman's daughter.
When I saved him, I changed everything even what's supposed to happen to Lana.
Did you see anything that might tell us where she is?
-There was an old sign inside.
-What did it say?
-lt said "Wandering Hills."
-I know where that is.
-Clark, take me with you.
-No way.
I've seen the house.
Maybe I can help you find it.
Please.
First sign of trouble, you back off.
Let's go.
Mr. Altman, why are you doing this?
Please, you don't have to do this!
-You're gonna pay for what you did to Julia.
-What are you talking about?
I heard you at the hospital.
Megan had a fight with her and you let her leave.
You should have looked out for her.
-We didn't cause the accident.
-You might as well have.
My little girl was out there all alone because of you!
It wasn't our fault!
For years, I blamed myself for not being there--
Coach, this is not the way.
Now I know I wasn't responsible.
-You two killed her.
-No, we di--
-Please!
-No.
No!
Coach, don't!
No!
Help!
Help us!
Please!
Clark, look!
-Jordan, stay in the car.
-He's got them both.
You'll need help.
Stay in the car, Jordan.
Lana?
-Lana.
-Save Megan.
Get out.
Jordan!
I'll get Megan.
You stay away from me!
-I just want to be with my girl!
-Come on.
Come on, let's go.
Coach?
You've gotta get out of here!
You!
It's your fault!
-Where's Jordan?
-I didn't see him come out with us.
-Clark!
-Run!
Jordan!
Mr. Altman!
Coach Altman!
You've gotta get out of here!
Jordan.
Clark.
Clark, are you okay?
-Oh, my God.
Is he okay?
-He's not breathing.
Jordan.
Come on, Jordan.
You can't die on me.
Clark.
It's okay.
You're all right.
You're gonna be okay.
-Lex?
-Lana.
How you feeling?
Between the fire and my leg, I've seen enough hospitals to last a lifetime.
-Have a seat.
-Thanks.
Lex, I think you were right about taking a closer look at Adam.
Why the sudden change of heart?
Chloe caught him using some sort of drug at school and when I confronted him about it, he almost lost it.
Lana, I've had people assume the worst about me all my life.
Trust me, it's hard to respond when people always jump to the wrong conclusions.
Lex, the last time we talked, I got the impression that you'd be happier if I kicked him out.
It's not my choice to make but I've had a chance to ask a few questions.
Adam hasn't been healing as well as his doctors had hoped.
Apparently, he's part of a clinical medical trial testing a new drug.
That might explain the needle.
It doesn't explain why he was hiding it.
I'm just beginning to wonder who I let into my life.
You should trust your instincts.
Thanks, Lex.
I promise your second week of school will be easier.
The paramedics said if you hadn't given me CPR, I'd be...
-...dead.
-But you're not.
I saw her, Clark.
-Who?
-My mom.
In that moment, right before you pulled me back.
She was beautiful.
I tried to run to her but couldn't.
Maybe it just wasn't your time.
When I woke up, they were gone.
The visions?
Maybe I was destined to lose them when I met you.
Mind if I interrupt?
Jordan, I brought your homework.
Why do I get the feeling you've got a new mentor?
I'm gonna help Jordan get back on his feet, and he's gonna help me get faster on mine.
I think you're getting the hang of this high school thing.
How you doing?
I know that look.
Are you sure you're okay?
Yeah, I'm fine, Clark.
I'll see you tomorrow.
So we've got a lot of work to do.
What's wrong?
Lana, it's about your friend the one in the hall?
Adam.
He's from Oklahoma, right?
I don't know.
He's never really said anything.
Jordan, what's going on?
I think something really bad happened to him.
Well, he's been in the hospital.
He was pretty seriously injured a few months ago.
This is going to sound really strange but I think it's worse than that.
I don't think he was just hurt.
I think he died.
You're awfully quiet today.
Having someone tell you you can change destiny is a lot to handle.
Jordan's visions really struck a chord.
Or just brought up questions I had all along.
Mom, by helping Mr. Altman, I put three other lives in jeopardy.
But you were there for them.
If it wasn't for me, he wouldn't have hurt anyone.
Clark, what's this really about?
I'm wondering if that's why I was really sent here to change destiny.
What if I make a wrong choice, and I'm not there to make it right?
It's a huge responsibility.
You have to concentrate on the good you do.
Think of all the people you've saved, your dad, and me and Lex.
He's turned out to be a really good friend.
Sweetheart, you just have to do the best you can.
You can't save everybody.
I'll take some of these out to your dad.
I'll do it.
Well, could you please make sure at least a couple of them make it to the barn?
-Yes.
-Thank you.
Thanks, Mom.
Dad!
Dad.
Dad!
-Dad?
-Not now.
Not yet.
I love you, son.
Dad?
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!

Previously on Without a Trace:
There was just this weird dynamic.
Between who?
Greg and Julie and Greg's brother Rick.
It's easy to confuse them being twins.
N.Y.P.D. Just found Julie Cochran's body.
How'd you meet Julie?
At the shelter.
Love at first sight?
For me it was.
The body?
Anne Mathis.
She's a homeless woman from the Canal Street Center.
I referenced Rick's travel records against unsolved homicides and disappearances.
I found six.
And get this, they were all homeless.
When we were 12, there was this girl, Patricia Payton.
I killed her.
They have the same DNA.
Fifty percent doubt is reasonable.
Rick made sure Greg was everywhere he was.
He's the perfect alibi.
You killed Julie and set it up to make it look like Greg did it.
Your brother is a monster.
No.
He killed your girlfriend.
He didn't.
Let's go.
I want to talk to my brother.
Greg!
Listen, he didn't kill anyone, okay?
Not Julie.
He didn't kill that girl when they were younger.
We cannot let Greg take the fall for this.
Do something.
There's nothing we can do.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Here you go.
Happy Thanksgiving.
That smells all right.
Nothing better than sweet potato pie.
Thank you, Ned.
You got it.
Hi.
Hi, Molly.
Can we talk?
I don't think so.
I love you.
Listen, do you want turkey or not?
Please, I need you to believe me.
I told you.
Why are you?
Give me your plate or step aside.
There are other people here.
Hey, Ned.
Hiya, Vinny.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Molly's been staying at the shelter almost two years.
Never missed a night.
Never missed a meal until Friday morning.
Come on, guys.
Let's move it.
Up and out.
Now it's four days and everybody here is really unnerved.
Come on, Roy, you know the rules.
Up and out.
I mean, we were just moving past Julie and Anne's murder and all of a sudden
I understand, I understand.
That guy work here?
Rick Knowles.
He took over for his brother as assistant director.
Full time?
No, he still works for that big pharmaceutical company.
But he's been able to be here quite a bit.
We all think Greg's innocent.
I mean, Rick here has been a morale boost.
Greg confessed to those murders.
That's not what Rick told us.
Agent Fitzgerald.
Lose your job?
Need a place to stay?
That's funny.
I like that.
You guys know each other?
Yeah, we sure do.
This is one of the geniuses that put Greg away.
Obviously, we got the wrong guy.
Obviously, you did.
Martin, can I speak to you for a minute, please?
Peter, can I ask you a few more questions out here?
Talk to you in a few, okay?
Mr. Knowles.
Been a long time.
Where were you the night Molly disappeared?
No pleasantries, Jack?
Where were you?
I was right here.
You see her leave?
No, it was Thanksgiving.
It's our busiest night.
When did you leave?
About 9:30.
Where'd you go?
Home.
What, to your apartment?
It's Greg's apartment.
Living in your brother's apartment now?
I'm looking after it for him till he comes back.
You stay there all night?
Yes, I did.
Can anybody verify that?
I can.
A lonely way to spend the holiday.
Yes, it was.
Thanks to you.
Have you talked to your brother?
All the time.
I'm concerned about him.
Same as I am about Molly.
I'll bet.
If something did happen to her, it'll be on your head.
How's that?
Well, you screwed it up last time.
Left the killer on the streets.
Now it's happened again.
We're gonna get the right guy this time.
Well, anything I can do to help.
You could confess.
So we good here?
I got some people to take care of.
We're great.
I know where to find you.
So how long have you known Molly?
A year and a half.
Maybe.
And what was her relationship like with Ned Atkins?
They got clean together.
Heroin?
Crack?
Heroin.
You know, Peter mentioned to me that Molly and Ned had a fight recently.
Any idea what that was about?
Well, she fell off the wagon.
And when was that?
Last week.
And he caught her.
I was there when it all went down.
What are you looking for?
My jacket.
Seen it?
No.
When did you leave it?
I don't know.
I had it earlier.
Looking for this?
Thanks, Ned.
Found this in the pocket.
That's not mine.
Oh, come on!
It's not.
You're such a loser.
You're a disgrace to this whole program.
Get out.
Get out.
It was pretty frightening.
I mean, how upset he got.
Right.
And how did he seem after she went missing?
He was really shaken by the whole thing.
I don't think anybody's seen him for a couple days.
The day of the fight, when Molly lost her jacket Was Rick around then?
I think so.
It's a frame up.
We'll find her in a river, strangled, and it'll look like Ned Atkins did it.
What about the other murders?
How is Rick gonna pawn those off on Atkins?
I don't know.
I'm sure he's figured out a way.
Oh, come on, Jack.
I need a warrant for Greg's apartment.
We searched the apartment at the time of the arrest.
The judge won't let you back in.
And Rick's place of business?
Not without probable cause, which you don't have right now.
If you had let me go after Rick Don't put this off on me.
Greg confessed five months ago.
I told you what
He has confessed to murdering Anne Mathis and eight other homeless women.
The U.S. Attorney has gone there time and time again and they can't find inconsistencies in Greg's statements.
Now, this is an airtight case.
Really?
How do you explain Molly Petrovich?
Is it a coincidence that she's missing from the shelter that Rick Knowles is working at?
Copycat, okay?
Fine.
Olczyk.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, thanks, Tom.
Greg Knowles has changed his plea to not guilty.
His lawyer is contesting the confessions.
Not so airtight, huh?
Do I need my lawyer?
No, we just want to ask you a few questions.
Okay.
So we understand you changed your plea.
Yeah.
What happened?
I had a lot of time to think about it.
Wouldn't have anything to do with the fact your brother visited yesterday?
We talked about it.
What did he say?
Why are you here?
We don't think you murdered those women, Greg.
Really?
Really.
Okay.
What did your brother say?
He said the same thing he's been saying for months.
That I should fight.
They had you in that interrogation room for nine hours without a lawyer.
I killed those women.
No, you didn't.
You said so yourself.
FBI had us turned against each other.
Malone convinced you that I'd raped Julie.
He doctored that coroner's report.
She wasn't raped.
You loved her, Greg.
You never would have hurt her.
What about Trisha?
Oh, come on, man.
That was 30 years ago.
I loved her.
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did.
You were 12 years old.
It was a crush.
I loved her.
All right, look, it doesn't matter.
No one will ever know what happened in that boathouse.
Your confession will never hold, not the way they got it out of you.
What do you want me to do?
You plead not guilty and I'll have you out of here in a couple of days.
A couple of days?
Trust me.
I need you, Greg.
You can't leave me out here all alone.
You're all I've got.
And he was right.
He's all I've got.
You had Julie.
You had Trisha Payton.
Yeah.
Another woman went missing from the shelter.
Molly Petrovich.
Molly?
You know her?
Yeah.
Rick spends a lot of time at the shelter.
He volunteers there sometimes.
It's a little more than that.
He's the assistant director now.
Isn't that your old job?
What's your point?
I think you know.
No, I don't.
Rick killed those women, not you.
We're done here.
Why don't you stick around, see if you can wait him out.
Car's registered to a Ned Atkins.
That's the guy you're looking for?
Yeah.
How long has it been here?
Well, it's got two tickets on it.
First one's written Friday, 3:35 p.m.
So the car's been here at least three days.
Hey, you might want to look at this.
How old's the corpse?
The coroner's on his way but my guess is three days, maybe four.
Yeah, that lines up.
Where's the car?
About three blocks away from Ned Atkins ' apartment.
Where exactly is it?
In front of a fire hydrant, no parking zone?
A church.
So he definitely wanted us to find it.
Okay, so where is poor Ned?
If Rick's trying to frame him wouldn't it be better if Ned was around so we could arrest him?
My guess is he got spooked and he ran.
Look, N. Y.P.D. Want to conduct a thorough search of Ned's apartment.
I can't hold them off much longer, not with a dead body in the trunk of his car.
I'll be there in 10 minutes.
Tell them to wait.
Okay.
Jack.
They're all here.
U.S. Attorney's office is gonna love this.
If he sees that, Greg Knowles is walking.
Hey, guys.
We got it.
Thanks.
Here's what I want you to do.
Photograph everything in the box and put it back where you found it.
It's okay.
I'll take the heat.
Hey, Malone, look what the cat dragged in.
Ned, where you been?
I was looking for my girlfriend.
Can you believe this schmuck?
I'll take him from here.
This is a homicide.
He's wanted in five states for eight kidnappings and murders.
He's federal property.
I didn't kill anybody.
Shut up.
Get in the car.
I know you didn't.
She was in the trunk of my car?
Yeah.
Anyone else have the key?
No, but the car was stolen.
That's why I was gone for so long, because I was on foot.
I thought maybe she took it.
You still have the keys?
Yeah.
Can I see them?
House and car?
Yeah.
I can't believe she's dead.
I mean, I just I can't believe it.
Rick Knowles ever go to your apartment?
No.
Was he aware of your relationship?
Well, sure.
Everyone was.
Julie Cochran, how well did you know her?
She was a really nice girl.
Remember where you were when she was murdered?
I was probably shooting up.
How long were you on the needle?
About 11 years.
So I don't suppose you could account for where you were on any day during that period.
No, the whole period's pretty hazy.
The syringe you found in Molly's pocket.
You still have it?
Yeah, it's in my cubby at the shelter.
And to be honest, I could really use a fix right now.
Well, we're not gonna let that happen.
We'll get you some help, okay?
All right.
So now we're burying evidence?
We process this and Greg gets out of jail
Greg's innocent.
I know that.
We need to keep him in jail so Sam can work on him.
When Greg gets out, Rick won't let us talk to him.
I don't feel comfortable with it.
Look.
You need to relax.
We just need to stall while we build our case.
Stalling for a day or two is also known as evidence tampering and obstruction of justice.
Excuse me.
This guy Atkins was the perfect fall guy.
He knew Julie, Anne and Molly, and had no alibi for the other murders.
We couldn't make the connection.
Our only chance is to prove that Rick had access to Atkins' car and apartment.
My guess is that he had duplicates of these made.
Canvass Greg's neighborhood?
That would be great.
Agent Malone.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
I was just dropping by to talk to your supervisor.
They found a syringe in Molly What's her name?
Petrovich.
Petrovich.
They found a syringe in her pocket.
Your supervisor confirmed that it matches the kind of syringes in your sample kit.
What can you tell me about that?
Molly probably stole it.
I bring my kit to the shelter if I've been on a sales call.
Why bring that to a shelter where there were drug addicts?
You're right.
It was careless of me.
Is that a crime?
Not as far as I know.
So...?
I don't think Ned did it.
I can't find a single shred of evidence to tie him to the other murders.
Really?
Nothing.
That's your brother?
Yeah.
Good looking, isn't he?
I can see why you'd think that.
Night.
Good night.
Poor Molly.
Yeah.
She was killed the same way as the others and Ned has no alibi for any of them.
So it certainly makes it look like you're innocent.
I had this dream.
What was it?
I saw Trisha.
Trisha Payton?
She was fighting for her life and she was fighting so hard.
And I felt like I was just a few feet away.
And I wanted to help her.
But you couldn't?
No.
There were all these mice just swarming all over her body.
It was just disgusting.
It was horrible.
When did you have this dream?
On Thanksgiving.
That night.
The night Molly was killed?
Have you ever had that dream before?
When?
When Rick and I used to take our trips.
When those other women were killed?
Think about it, Greg.
Think about how connected you two are.
Maybe that's what your dreams are about.
I can't do this.
I'm sorry.
Greg.
I'm done.
Make sure he's put on suicide watch.
I just got a call from the 16th Precinct.
They found a box of mementos and trophies in Ned Atkins' apartment.
Pictures of dead women including Julie Cochran and Anne Mathis.
Apparently they got an anonymous tip.
An anonymous tip?
Yes, and they decided to check it out before referring it to us.
Didn't you see it when you were in there?
Yes, I did.
You didn't process the evidence?
Nope.
Why not, Jack?
Who do you think called in the tip?
Are you telling me Rick planted the box in the apartment?
We found a locksmith who verifies that someone made keys from Atkins' keychain.
Someone?
Locksmith can't place Rick for sure but he's two blocks from the shelter.
The shelter?
That could be anybody, including Atkins.
Now, who else knew about withholding evidence?
No one.
Just me.
The U.S. Attorney called.
They're releasing Greg Knowles and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.
You better call Sam and let her know what's happening.
Spade.
They're gonna release Greg from prison.
Get to him and convince him not to talk to his brother.
Too late.
What are you doing down here?
Dinner.
We're off the case, aren't we?
Nope.
The judge let us bug Greg's apartment.
Well, that's good news.
Yup.
You know, Greg was close to breaking.
I think he knows that Rick is responsible for everything.
He just doesn't want to face it.
He's back with his brother.
That's gonna spin him six ways to Sunday.
What are those?
Divorce papers.
Yours?
Rick's.
1996.
According to this, he never had sex with his wife.
Well, we know he's not into women.
Or girls.
That could be it.
What?
That.
What?
Girls.
Trisha Payton.
That's where this all started.
That's what we have to do.
Go back to the beginning.
You're free.
To family.
To family.
It's good to be home, isn 't it?
I heard what you told Olczyk earlier.
I want to catch this psychopath as bad as anyone else.
What happened to my lionfish?
Oh, you know what?
Oh, shoot.
Those fish were kind of hard to take care of.
I think I fed him too much and he died last week.
Sorry, man.
But you liked living here?
Hey.
It was my only way of staying close to you.
That's not really true, is it?
What do you mean?
I heard you took my job at the shelter.
I know it's important to you.
I wanted to hold down the fort.
What's up with you?
The FBI came to see me today.
They did?
What did they say?
A lot.
Like what?
Hey.
It doesn't matter.
Whatever they said, they don't matter.
This is what matters.
Okay?
Come here.
You know what?
Let's take a trip.
What kind of trip?
Doesn 't matter.
Just get out of here.
Let's just get away somewhere and relax.
Be good for you, you know?
You deserve to get all this stuff off your mind.
Yeah?
Yeah, that'd be good.
All right.
Come on.
Let's eat.
Okay, listen up, everybody.
Twenty minute break for drinks and snacks and it wouldn't hurt to look at your lines.
And when we get back, we're gonna start at the top.
Mrs. Payton?
Yes.
We're with the FBI.
What can I do for you?
We wondered if we could speak to you about your daughter Trisha.
It was getting dark and I didn't know where she was.
So I called the police and I told them she was probably somewhere with Greg.
They were always together.
When they got Greg that night at his house, he smelled of alcohol.
Then when they found...
When they found Trisha in the boathouse it turned out she had alcohol in her system too.
So of course, they focused on Greg.
But you don't think he did it?
No.
No, he was a sweet boy.
They both were, he and Rick.
Did Rick hang out with Greg and your daughter?
Yeah.
Rick followed Greg wherever he went.
Really?
Are you sure about that?
Oh, yeah.
Greg was very popular and athletic and funny and...
All the girls were crazy about him.
But not Rick?
No, he was awkward, really.
He always seemed a little lost whenever Greg wasn't around.
I really never thought Greg did it.
And I can't imagine why he would've confessed now after all these years.
I spoke with his supervisor.
Rick has no trips coming up.
I checked his credit cards.
No reservations anywhere.
Nothing.
Go over to Greg's apartment.
Danny and Viv will need help with surveillance once the twins move.
On my way.
Okay, great.
Got anything?
Okay, May 14th, 1973.
Apparently, the sheriff taped Greg's interrogation.
Listen to this.
I love Trisha and I would never do anything to hurt her.
I know you love her.
Everyone says the two of you are always together.
I told you 20 times already, I never saw her today.
I swear to God, I never saw her.
Your brother's in the other room and he said he saw you with Trisha after school.
You were gonna go to the boathouse.
No, he didn't.
He wouldn't say that.
You ought to talk to him, straighten him out.
You gonna let me talk to him?
Sure.
We just want to get to the bottom of this.
Hang on a minute.
We weren't the only ones with this idea.
I don't know how much longer I can do this.
Now, you just listen to me.
They don't have anything on you.
And I haven't said anything, okay?
Yeah.
You never saw her, you hear me?
You never saw her.
No matter how many times they ask you, no matter how many different ways.
Don't let them bully you, you hear me?
Yeah, but Don't.
Come on, Greg.
Please.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
I mean, I don't know what I'd do without you.
What did you expect me to do?
We're brothers.
I didn't want to get you in trouble, Mouse.
Don't ever call me that again.
What?
What's the matter?
You heard me.
I don't ever want to hear that name again!
Okay.
I'm sorry.
The mice from the dream.
From here on in, it's just you and me, Greg.
You understand me?
We can't trust anyone else in the world.
Just you and me.
Ten minutes later, their lawyer showed up.
Sheriff couldn't get the boys back and couldn't make a case.
Malone.
You wiretap Greg Knowles' apartment?
I got a warrant from the judge.
You didn't mention Ned Atkins being the prime suspect in this case.
I didn't think it was relevant.
You know what, Jack?
Come home.
You and I need to talk.
Okay.
And don't make another move without consulting me first.
Got it?
Got it.
They're making a move.
Making a move.
Malone.
The twins are on the move.
They're packed to go on a trip.
Do you want us to follow?
Pick them up.
Pick them up?
Yeah, bring them in.
Okay.
Drop your bags, keep your hands where we can see them.
Drop them.
Over here.
Thanks, Martin.
Yeah, no problem.
Good luck.
Welcome back.
Are you charging me?
I haven't decided yet.
Because of you, I've been separated from my brother now for five months.
You might not have a life, Jack, but we do.
Well, I'm really sorry to have inconvenienced you but I went to Connecticut to talk to Trisha Payton's mother.
Really?
And what did Mrs. Payton have to tell you?
Why don't you take a seat?
She told me that you were shy.
That you were not the dominant one.
That you're a wallflower.
Is that right?
She said you lived in Greg's shadow.
Girls more attracted to Greg.
And it just made me wonder what predicated the switch?
From here on in, it's just you and me, Greg.
You understand me?
We can 't trust anyone else in the world.
Just you and me.
That was the moment, wasn't it?
When he took control of you?
You were in love with Trisha, and he took her from you.
And when you had another chance at happiness with Julie, he took her too.
I don't know.
Rick took this photo of Julie after he killed her, in your apartment while you were passed out in the other room.
And for a long time I was trying to figure out which one of you killed Trisha.
But I've decided it was you.
Me?
That's when you got the taste for it.
That's why you did it over and over.
Really?
I read your divorce papers.
According to your wife, you never had sex with her.
My ex wife was a liar.
Really?
You signed the papers.
You didn't dispute it.
What's it have to do with your persecution of my brother?
Well, I just don't think that you like women.
I like women fine, Jack.
But I think you like your brother more.
Okay, I don't need to listen to this.
Just admit it.
Ever since you were 12, spanking it in the bathroom, you thought about Greg.
Enough.
Looked in the mirror, saw his face.
I said that's enough!
Which made you hate yourself, but it made you hate him even more.
Remember when you told me about your dream?
The mice?
Yeah.
When you were kids, didn't you call Rick "Mouse"?
Yeah.
He hated that name.
Of course he did.
Because you were strong and full of life and he was just a scared little boy.
Maybe.
So maybe when you're seeing the mice crawling all over Trisha it's actually Rick.
It's possible.
Isn't it?
Greg.
I used to see things.
What kind of things?
In the hotel where we'd stay on our trips.
Necklaces and bracelets.
He was keeping their jewelry as trophies.
Mr. Olczyk.
Oh, God.
Time to release my other client now.
Let's go home.
Spade.
Were you aware that Jack was defying my order?
Yes, sir, I was, and I'm sorry.
What is it with you people?
If Malone told you to jump off a building, would you?
Probably, sir.
Yes.
Maybe Rick didn't give up all his trophies.
We're gonna need your help getting a search warrant.
What do we got here?
Step back into the room and take a seat.
Back into the room and take a seat!
Okay, I am, I am.
Right there.
Sit down.
I just want you guys
Sit down!
What the hell happened here?
We had a fight.
You were right.
It was terrible.
Rick ran out and left.
I don't know where he went.
What was the fight about?
I told him I knew everything.
All of it.
What he did.
Everything.
You were right, Sam.
After all these years.
I know!
I know what you did!
You're taking her word over mine?
It has nothing to do with her!
I saw it!
I saw it all!
What?
What did you see?
Why?
Why would you do this to me?
How could you?
Greg, listen to me.
I would lay down my life for you but this is in your head, okay?
You are sick.
You need help.
You need serious help.
I should kill you!
How can you say that to me?
I love you!
You love me?
You love me?
You love me?
Everything I've ever done has been for you!
And then finally he stopped and he got up and he ran out and...
He said I'd never see him again.
I'll do whatever you guys want me to.
I'll testify against him.
Anything.
I just want to put this behind me.
We need to take you downtown, take your statement.
Yeah, of course.
Hey, Mouse.
Keep him covered.
Is he alive?
Yeah, send an ambulance to 411 Elizabeth Street.
Is he alive?
Yeah, he's alive.
Hopefully, I still have a job in the morning.
Oh, I'm sure you'll be fine.
What'd you say to Olczyk anyway?
Nothing he didn't know already.
If I didn't have paperwork, I'd buy you a drink.
You should probably buy everybody a drink.
Probably should.
From here on in, it's just you and me, Greg.
You understand me?
We can 't trust anyone else in the world.
Just you and me.

Previously on Without A Trace...
- There was just this weird dynamic.
- Between who ?
Greg and Julie and Greg's brother, Rick.
It's easy to confuse them, them being twins.
NYPD just found Julie Cochran's body.
- Greg, how did you and Julie meet ?
- At the shelter.
- Love at first sight ?
- For me it was.
- The body ?
- Ann Mathis.
She's a homeless woman from Canal Street Community Center.
I've been cross-referencing Rick's travel records against unsolved female homicides and disappearances.
And I found six.
And get this, they were all homeless.
When we were 12, there was this girl Patricia Payton.
- I killed her.
- They have the same DNA.
50% doubt is more than reasonable in any court.
Rick made sure Greg was everywhere he was.
He makes the perfect alibi.
You killed Julie and you set it up to make it look like Greg did it.
I know he's your brother, but he is a monster.
- No.
- He killed your girlfriend.
He didn't.
- Let's go, Greg.
- Wait.
I want to talk to my brother.
- Greg !
- Jack, listen to me.
He didn't kill anyone, okay ?
Not Julie, he didn't kill that girl when they were younger.
We cannot let Greg take the fall for this.
- Do something !
- There's nothing we can do.
- Here you go.
- That smells all right.
- Nothing better than Ethel's sweet potato pie, though.
- Thank you, Ned.
You got it.
Hi.
Hi, Molly.
Can we talk ?
I don't think so.
- I love you.
- Listen, do you want some turkey or not ?
- Please !
I need you to believe me.
- I told you.
- Why are you...
- Either, give me your plate or step aside.
There are other people here besides you.
Hi Ned.
Hi Vinnie.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Molly's been staying at the shelter almost two years.
Never missed a night.
Never missed a meal until Friday morning.
Come on, guys.
Let's move it.
Up and out.
Now it's four days and everybody here is really unnerved.
Come on, Roy, you know the rules.
Up and out.
I mean, we were just moving past Julie and Ann's murder, and all of a sudden...
I understand, I understand.
That guy work here ?
Rick Knowles.
He sort of took over for his brother as assistant director.
Full time ?
No, he still works for that big pharmaceutical company uptown.
But he's been able to be here quite a bit.
We all think Greg's innocent.
Having Rick here has been a morale boost.
You know, Greg confessed to those murders.
That's not what Rick told us.
Agent Fitzgerald.
What, did you lose your job ?
You looking for a place to stay ?
That's funny, I like that.
- You guys know each other ?
- Yeah, we sure do.
This is one of the geniuses that put Greg away.
- Obviously we got the wrong guy.
- Obviously you did.
Martin ?
Can I speak to you for a minute, please ?
Peter, can I ask you a few more questions out here ?
I'll talk to you in a few, okay ?
- Mr. Knowles.
- It's been a long time.
Where you were the night that Molly Petrovich disappeared ?
- No pleasantries, Jack ?
- Where were you ?
I was right here.
- Did you see her leave ?
- No, it was Thanksgiving.
It's our busiest night.
- What time did you leave ?
- About 9h30.
- Where'd you go ?
- Home.
- What, to your apartment ?
- Actually, to Greg's apartment.
- You live at your brother's apartment now ?
- I'm looking after it for him until he comes back.
Did you stay there all night ?
- Yes, I did.
- Can anybody verify that ?
I can.
It must be a lonely way to spend the holiday.
Yes, it was, thanks to you.
- Have you talked to your brother ?
- All the time.
I'm very concerned about him.
- Same as I am about Molly.
- I'll bet.
You know, if something did happen to her, it'll be on your head.
How's that ?
Well, you screwed it up last time and left the killer on the streets, now it's happened again.
We're going to get the right guy this time.
Well, anything I can do to help.
You could confess.
So we good here ?
I got some people to take care of.
We're great.
I know where to find you.
So how long have you known Molly ?
A year and a half.
Maybe.
And what was her relationship like with Ned Atkins ?
They got clean together.
Heroin, crack ?
Heroin.
You know, Peter had mentioned to me that Molly and Ned had a fight recently.
Any idea what that was about ?
Well, she fell off the wagon.
And when was that ?
Last week.
And he caught her.
I was there when it all went down.
- What are you looking for ?
- My jacket, have you seen it ?
No.
- When did you leave it ?
- I don't know, I had it earlier.
You're looking for this ?
Oh, thanks, Ned.
I found this in the pocket.
- That's not mine.
- Oh, come on.
- It's not.
- You're such a loser.
You're a disgrace to this whole program !
Get out !
Get out !
It was pretty frightening,
- I mean how upset he got.
- Right.
- And how did he seem after she went missing ?
- He was really shaken by the whole thing.
I don't think anybody's seen him for a couple of days.
The day of the fight, when Molly lost her jacket, was Rick around then ?
I think so.
I'm telling you it's a frame-up.
We're going to find this woman floating in the river, strangled and it's going to look like Ned Atkins did it.
And what about the other murders ?
How is Rick Knowles going to pawn those off on Atkins ?
I don't know, but I'm sure he's figured out a way.
Oh, come on, Jack.
Look, I need a warrant to get in to Greg's apartment.
We did a thorough search of Greg's apartment at the time of the arrest.
And the judge is not going to let you back in there.
What about Rick's place of business ?
Not without probable cause,
- which you don't have right now.
- You know what, Alex, if you'd have let me go after Rick Knowles when I wanted to...
- none of this would be happening.
- Don't put this all on me.
You got a confession out of Greg Knowles five months ago.
- Yeah, I told you about that.
- And since then... he has confessed to murdering Ann Mathis and eight other homeless women.
The U.S. Attorney has gone back in there time and time again, and they can't find any inconsistencies in Greg's statements.
- Now this is an airtight case.
- Really ?
How do you explain Molly Petrovich ?
Was it just a coincidence that she goes missing from the exact same shelter that Rick Knowles is working at right now ?
Copycat, okay ?
Fine.
Alchek.
Yeah.
Yeah ?
Yeah, thanks, Tom.
Greg Knowles has changed his plea to not guilty.
His lawyer is contesting the confessions.
Not so airtight, huh ?
Do I need my lawyer ?
No.
We just want to ask you a few questions.
Okay.
So we understand you changed your plea.
- Yeah.
- What happened ?
I had a lot of time to think about it.
Wouldn't have anything to do with the fact that your brother visited you yesterday, would it ?
We talked about it.
What did he say ?
Why are you here ?
We don't think you murdered any of those women, Greg.
- Really ?
- Really.
Okay.
What did your brother say ?
He said the same thing he's been saying for months.
That I should fight.
They had you in that interrogation room for nine hours without a lawyer.
- I killed those women, Rick.
- No, you didn't.
- You said so yourself.
- The FBI had us turned against each other.
Malone convinced you that I'd raped Julie.
He doctored that coroner's report.
She was never raped.
You loved her, Greg.
- You never would have hurt her.
- What about Tricia ?
Oh, come on, man, that was 30 years ago.
- I loved her.
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.
- You were 12 years old, it was a crush.
I loved her.
All right, look...
It doesn't matter.
No one will ever know what happened in that boat house.
And your confession will never hold water, not the way they got it out of you.
What do you want me to do ?
You plead not guilty, and I'll have you out of here in a couple of days.
A couple of days ?
Trust me.
I need you, Greg.
You can't leave me out here all alone.
You're all I've got.
And he was right.
He's all I've got.
You had Julie.
You had Tricia Payton.
Yeah.
Another woman went missing from the shelter.
- Molly Petrovich.
- Molly ?
You know her ?
Yeah.
Your brother has been spending a lot of time at the shelter.
Yeah, he volunteers there sometimes.
It's a little more than that.
He's the assistant director there now.
Isn't that your old job ?
- What's your point ?
- I think you know.
No, I don't.
Rick killed those women, not you.
We're done here.
I want you to stick around,... see if you can wait him out.
The car's registered to a Ned Atkins.
- That's the guy you're looking for, right ?
- Yeah, how long has it been here ?
Well, it's got two tickets on it.
First one's written Friday, 15h35.
So the car's been here at least three days.
Hey.
You might want to look at this.
How old's the corpse ?
The coroner is on his way, but my guess is three days, maybe four.
Yeah, that lines up.
- Where's the car ?
- About three blocks away from Ned Atkins' apartment.
Where exactly is the car ?
Is it in front of a fire hydrant, a no-parking zone ?
- A church.
- So he definitely wanted us to find it.
Okay, so where is poor Ned ?
I mean,... if Rick's trying to frame him, wouldn't it be better if Ned was around so we could actually arrest him ?
My guess is he got spooked and he ran.
Look, NYPD want to conduct a thorough search of Ned's apartment, and I can't hold them off for much longer, not with a dead body in the trunk of his car.
I'll be there in ten minutes, just tell them to wait, okay ?
Okay.
Jack.
They are here.
The U.S. Attorney's Office is going to love this.
If he sees that, Greg Knowles is walking.
Hey, guys ?
We got it.
Thanks.
Here's what I want you to do.
I want you to photograph everything in the box, and put it back exactly where you found it.
It's okay, I'll take the heat.
Hey, Malone, look what the cat dragged in.
- Hey, Ned, where you been ?
- I was looking for my girlfriend.
- Can you believe this schmuck ?
- I'm going to take him from here.
This is a homicide now.
Look, this guy is wanted in five states for at least eight kidnappings and murders.
- He's federal property.
- I didn't kill anybody.
Shut up, get in the car.
I know you didn't.
She was in the trunk of my car ?
Yeah.
- Anyone else have a key ?
- No, but the car was stolen.
That's why I was gone for so long.
Because...
I was on foot.
I thought maybe she took it.
- You still have the keys ?
- Yeah.
Can I see them ?
- House and car ?
- Yeah.
I can't believe she's dead.
I mean, I just, I can't believe it.
Did Rick Knowles ever go to your apartment ?
- No.
- Was he aware of your relationship with Molly ?
Well, sure, everyone was.
- What about Julie Cochran, how well did you know her ?
- She was a really nice girl.
Do you remember where you were when she was murdered ?
- I was probably shooting up somewhere.
- How long were you on the needle ?
About 11 years.
So I don't suppose you could account for where you were on any particular day during that period ?
No, both periods are pretty hazy.
What about the syringe you found in Molly's pocket ?
You still have it ?
Yeah, it's in my cubby at the shelter.
To be honest, I could really use a fix right now.
We're not going to let that happen.
We'll get you some help, okay ?
- So now we're burying evidence ?
- Listen, we process this and Greg gets out of jail.
Greg's innocent.
I know that, but we need to keep him in jail so Sam can work on him.
The minute that Greg gets out, Rick is never going to let us talk to him.
I don't know if I feel comfortable with it.
Look, you need to relax.
We just need to stall for a day or two while we build our case.
Yeah, well, stalling for a day or two is also known as evidence tampering and obstruction of justice.
Excuse me.
This guy Atkins is the perfect fall guy.
He knew Julie, Ann and Molly, and he had no alibi for all those other murders.
Yeah, we got to make the connection.
How many chances to prove that Rick had access to Atkins' car and apartment ?
My guess is that he had duplicates of these made.
- You want me to canvass Greg's neighborhood ?
- That'd be great.
Agent Malone.
To what do I owe the pleasure ?
I was just dropping by to talk to your supervisor.
They found a syringe in Molly.
What's her name... ?
- Petrovich.
- Petrovich.
They found a syringe in her pocket.
And, uh, your supervisor confirmed that it matches the kind of syringes you carry in your sample kit.
- What can you tell meabout that ?
- Molly probably stole it.
I sometimes bring my kit to the shelter if I've been on a sales call.
Why would you bring that to a shelter where there are drug addicts ?
You're right.
It was careless of me.
Is that a crime ?
Not as far as I know.
So...
I don't think Ned did it.
I can't find a single shred of evidence to tie him to the other murders.
Really ?
Nothing.
That's your brother ?
Yeah.
Good looking, isn't he ?
I can see why you'd think that.
Good night.
Good night.
- Poor Molly.
- Yeah.
She was killed the same way as the others.
And Ned has no alibi for any of them.
So it certainly makes it look like you're innocent.
I had this dream.
What was it ?
- I saw Tricia.
- Tricia Peyton ?
She was fighting for her life and she was fighting so hard, and I felt like I was just a few feet away
- and I wanted to help her.
- But you couldn't ?
No.
There were all these mice just swarming all over her body.
It was disgusting.
It was horrible.
When did you have this dream ?
On Thanksgiving, that night.
The night Molly was killed ?
Have you ever had that dream before ?
When ?
When Rick and I used to take our trips.
When those other women were killed.
Think about it, Greg.
Think about how connected you two are.
Maybe that's what your dreams are about.
I can't do this, I'm sorry.
Greg ?
I'm done.
Make sure he's put on suicide watch.
I just got a call from the 16th precinct.
They found a box of mementos and trophies in Ned Atkins' apartment.
Pictures of dead women, including Julie Cochran and Ann Mathis.
Apparently they got an anonymous tip.
An anonymous tip ?
Yes, and they decided to check it out before referring it to us.
- Now, didn't you see it when you were in there ?
- Yes, I did
- And you didn't process the evidence ?
- Nope.
- Why not, Jack ?
- Who do you think called in the anonymous tip ?
Are you telling me that Rick planted the box in Atkins' apartment ?
We found a locksmith who verifies that someone was making keys off of Atkins' key chain.
- Someone ?
- Look, the locksmith can't place Rick for sure.
But his store is two blocks away from the shelter.
The shelter ?
That could be anybody, including Atkins.
- Now who else knew about withholding evidence ?
- No one, just me.
Well, the U.S. Attorney called.
They're releasing Greg Knowles and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.
You better call Sam and let her know what's happening.
Spade.
They're gonna release Greg from prison.
I need you to get to him and convince him not to talk to his brother.
Too late.
What are you doing down here ?
Dinner.
We're off the case, aren't we ?
Nope.
The judge let us bug Greg's apartment.
- Well, that's good news.
- Yep.
You know, Greg was close to breaking.
I think deep down he knows that Rick is responsible for everything, he just doesn't want to face it.
And now he's back with his brother.
Rick's going to spin him six ways to Sunday.
- What are those ?
- Divorce papers.
Yours ?
Rick's.
1996.
According to this, he never had sex with his wife.
- Well, we know he's not into women.
- Or girls.
That could be it.
- What ?
- That.
- What ?
- Girls.
Tricia Payton.
That's where this all started.
That's what we have to do.
We have to go back to the beginning.
Your free.
To family.
It's good to be home, huh ?
I heard what you told Alchek earlier.
I want to catch this psychopath as bad as anyone else.
- What happened to my lion fish ?
- Oh, you know what ?
Oh, shoot.
Those fish were kind of hard to take care of.
I think I fed them too much and he died last week.
I'm sorry, man.
But you liked living here ?
Hey...
It was my only way of staying close to you.
That's not really true, is it ?
What do you mean ?
I heard you took my job at the shelter.
Yeah, I know how important that work is to you and I wanted to hold down the fort.
What's up with you ?
The FBI came to see me today.
They did ?
What'd they say ?
A lot.
Like what ?
Hey...
It doesn't matter.
Whatever they said, they don't matter.
This is what matters.
Okay ?
Come here.
You know what ?
Let's take a trip.
What kind of trip ?
It doesn't matter.
Let's just get out of here.
Let's just get away somewhere and relax.
Make up for it, you know ?
You deserve to get all this stuff off your mind.
Yeah ?
Yeah, that'd be good.
All right.
Come on.
Let's eat.
Okay, listen up, everybody !
20 minute break for drinks and snacks, and it wouldn't hurt to look at your lines.
And when we get back, we're going to start at the top.
Mrs. Payton ?
- Yes ?
- We're with the FBI.
Oh, what can I do for you ?
We were wondering if we could speak to you about your daughter, Tricia.
It was getting dark and I didn't know where she was, so I called the police and I told them she was probably somewhere with Greg.
They were always together.
When they got Greg that night at his house, he smelled of alcohol.
Then when they found... when they found Tricia in the boat house, it turned out she had alcohol in her system, too, so of course they focused on Greg.
- But you don't think he did it ?
- No.
He was a sweet boy.
They both were, he and Rick.
Did Rick hang out with Greg and your daughter ?
Yeah, Rick followed Greg wherever he went.
Really ?
Are you sure about that ?
Oh, yeah.
Greg was very popular and... and athletic and funny and...
All the girls were crazy about him.
But not Rick ?
No, he was awkward, really.
He always seemed a little lost whenever Greg wasn't around.
I really never thought Greg did it.
And I can't imagine why he would have confessed, now after all these years.
Yeah, I spoke with the supervisor.
Rick doesn't have any trips coming up.
No, they checked his credit cards, there's no reservations anywhere, nothing.
I need you to go over to Greg's apartment.
Danny and Viv are going to need help in surveillancing once the twins are on the move.
- On my way.
- Okay, great.
- Got anything ?
- Okay, May 14, 1973, apparently the sheriff taped Greg's interrogation.
Listen to this.
I loved Tricia and I would never do anything to hurt her.
I know you love her.
Everyone says the two of you are always together.
I told you 20 times already, I never saw her today.
I swear to God.
I never saw her.
You know, your brother's in the other room, and he said he saw you with Tricia after school.
Says you were going to hang out at the boat house.
- No, he didn't, he wouldn't say that.
- Maybe you ought to talk to him and straighten him out.
- You're going to let me talk to him ?
- Sure.
We just want to get to the bottom of this.
Hang on a minute.
Looks like we weren't the only ones with this idea.
I don't know how much longer I can do this.
Now, you just listen to me.
They don't have anything on you.
And I haven't said anything.
Okay ?
You never saw her, you hear me ?
You never saw her.
No matter how many times they ask, no matter how many different ways, don't let them bully you, you hear me ?
- Yeah, but...
- Don't.
Come on, Greg, please.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Thank you.
- I mean, I don't know what I'd do without you.
- What'd you expect me to do ?
We're brothers.
I just didn't want to get you in trouble, Mouse.
Don't ever call me that again.
- Why, what's the matter ?
- You heard me.
I don't ever want to hear that name again.
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- The mice from the dream.
From here on in, it's just you and me, Greg.
You understand me ?
We can't trust anyone else in the world.
Just you and me.
Ten minutes later their lawyer showed up.
Sheriff could never get the boys back in and they couldn't make a case.
- Malone.
- Did you wiretap Greg Knowles apartment ?
I got a warrant from the judge.
But you didn't mention anything about Ned Atkins being the prime suspect in this case.
- I didn't think it was relevant.
- You know what, Jack ?
Come home.
- You and I need to talk.
- Okay.
And don't make another move without consulting me first.
You got it ?
Got it.
They're making a move.
- Malone.
- The twins are on the move.
They're packed to go on a trip.
Do you want us to follow ?
Pick them up.
Pick them up ?
Yeah, bring them in.
Okay.
Drop your bags and keep your hands where we can see them.
Drop them !
Right here.
Thanks, Martin.
Yeah, no problem.
Good luck.
Welcome back.
- Are you charging me with anything ?
- Haven't decided yet.
Because of your incompetence, I've been separated from my brother now for five months.
You might not have a life, Jack, but we do.
Yeah, well, I'm really sorry to have inconvenienced you, but I had to make a trip to Connecticut to talk to Tricia Payton's mother.
Really ?
And what did Mrs. Payton have to tell you ?
Why don't you take a seat ?
She told me that you were shy.
That you were not the dominant one,
- that you were a wallflower.
- Is that right ?
She said you lived in Greg's shadow, that girls were more attracted to Greg.
And it just made me wonder, what predicated the switch ?
From here on in... it's just you and me, Greg.
You understand me ?
We can't trust anyone else in the world.
Just you... and me.
That was the moment, wasn't it ?
When he took control of you.
You were in love with Tricia and he took her from you.
And when you had another chance at happiness with Julie, he took her, too.
I don't know.
Rick took this photo of Julie after he killed her... in your apartment while you were passed out in the other room.
And for a long time, I was trying to figure out which one of you killed Tricia.
But I've decided it was you.
Me ?
That's where you first got the taste for it.
That's why you kept doing it over and over again.
Really ?
I read your divorce papers.
According to your wife...
- you never had sex with her.
- My ex-wife was a liar.
Really ?
You signed the papers, you didn't dispute it.
And what does this have to do with your persecution of my brother ?
I just don't think that you like women.
I like women fine, Jack.
But I think you like your brother more.
- Okay, I don't need to sit here and...
- Come on, why don't you just admit it ?
Ever since were 12 years old and spanking it in the bathroom,
- you've been thinking about your brother Greg.
- That's enough.
And every time you looked in the mirror, you saw his face...
- I said that's enough !
- ...which made you hate yourself, but it made you hate him even more.
Remember when you told me about your dream, the mice ?
Yeah.
When you were kids,...
- didn't you call Rick "Mouse" ?
- Yeah, he hated that name.
Of course he did.
Because you were strong and full of life, and he was just a scared little boy.
Maybe.
So maybe,... when you're seeing the mice crawling all over Tricia... it's actually Rick.
It's possible, isn't it ?
Greg ?
I used to see things.
What kind of things ?
In the hotel room where we'd stay on our trips.
Necklaces and... bracelets.
He was keeping their jewelry... as trophies.
Mr. Alchek !
Time to release my other client now.
Okay.
Let's go home.
Spade.
Were you aware that Jack was defying my order ?
Yes, sir, I was and I'm sorry.
What is it with you people ?
- If Malone told you to jump off a building, would you do it ?
- Probably, sir, yes.
Maybe Rick didn't give up all his trophies.
We're going to need your help getting a search warrant.
What do we got here ?
Step back into the room and take a seat.
- Back into the room and take a seat!
- Okay, I am.
I am.
Right there.
Sit down !
Sit down !
- What the hell happened here ?
- We had a fight.
You were right.
It was terrible.
Rick just ran out and left.
I don't know where he went.
- What was the fight about ?
- I told him I knew everything.
All of it.
What he did, everything.
You were right, Sam.
After all these years.
I know !
- I know what you did !
- You're taking that bitch's word over mine ?
!
It has nothing to do with her !
I saw it!
I saw it all !
- What ?
What did you see ?
- Why ?
Why would you do this to me ?
How could you ?
Greg, listen to me.
I would lay down my life for you, but this is in your head, okay, man ?
You are sick.
- You need help.
You need some serious help.
- I should kill you !
How can you say that to me ?
- I love you !
- You love me ?
You love me ?
Everything I've ever done has been for you !
And then, finally, he stopped and he got up and he ran out and... he said I'd never see him again.
I'll do whatever you guys want me to.
I mean, I'll testify against him.
Anything.
I just want to put this behind me.
Greg, we're going to need to take you downtown, take your statement, all right ?
Yeah, of course.
Hey, Mouse.
Keep him covered.
Is he alive ?
Yeah, send an ambulance to 411 Elizabeth Street.
Is he alive ?
!
Yeah, he's alive.
Hopefully, I'll still have a job in the morning.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
- What'd you say to Alchek, anyway ?
- Nothing he didn't know already.
If I didn't have seven hours of paperwork, I'd buy you a drink.
You should probably buy everybody a drink.
Probably should.
From here on in... it's just you and me, Greg.
You understand me ?
Can't trust anyone else in the world.
Just you... and me.
Previously on Without A Trace...
- There was just this weird dynamic.
- Between who ?
Greg and Julie and Greg's brother, Rick.
It's easy to confuse them, them being twins.
NYPD just found Julie Cochran's body.
- Greg, how did you and Julie meet ?
- At the shelter.
- Love at first sight ?
- For me it was.
- The body ?
- Ann Mathis.
She's a homeless woman from Canal Street Community Center.
I've been cross-referencing Rick's travel records against unsolved female homicides and disappearances.
And I found six.
And get this, they were all homeless.
When we were 12, there was this girl Patricia Payton.
- I killed her.
- They have the same DNA.
50% doubt is more than reasonable in any court.
Rick made sure Greg was everywhere he was.
He makes the perfect alibi.
You killed Julie and you set it up to make it look like Greg did it.
I know he's your brother, but he is a monster.
- No.
- He killed your girlfriend.
He didn't.
- Let's go, Greg.
- Wait.
I want to talk to my brother.
- Greg !
- Jack, listen to me.
He didn't kill anyone, okay ?
Not Julie, he didn't kill that girl when they were younger.
We cannot let Greg take the fall for this.
- Do something !
- There's nothing we can do.
- Here you go.
- That smells all right.
- Nothing better than Ethel's sweet potato pie, though.
- Thank you, Ned.
You got it.
Hi.
Hi, Molly.
Can we talk ?
I don't think so.
- I love you.
- Listen, do you want some turkey or not ?
- Please !
I need you to believe me.
- I told you.
- Why are you...
- Either, give me your plate or step aside.
There are other people here besides you.
Hi Ned.
Hi Vinnie.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Molly's been staying at the shelter almost two years.
Never missed a night.
Never missed a meal until Friday morning.
Come on, guys.
Let's move it.
Up and out.
Now it's four days and everybody here is really unnerved.
Come on, Roy, you know the rules.
Up and out.
I mean, we were just moving past Julie and Ann's murder, and all of a sudden...
I understand, I understand.
That guy work here ?
Rick Knowles.
He sort of took over for his brother as assistant director.
Full time ?
No, he still works for that big pharmaceutical company uptown.
But he's been able to be here quite a bit.
We all think Greg's innocent.
Having Rick here has been a morale boost.
You know, Greg confessed to those murders.
That's not what Rick told us.
Agent Fitzgerald.
What, did you lose your job ?
You looking for a place to stay ?
That's funny, I like that.
- You guys know each other ?
- Yeah, we sure do.
This is one of the geniuses that put Greg away.
- Obviously we got the wrong guy.
- Obviously you did.
Martin ?
Can I speak to you for a minute, please ?
Peter, can I ask you a few more questions out here ?
I'll talk to you in a few, okay ?
- Mr. Knowles.
- It's been a long time.
Where you were the night that Molly Petrovich disappeared ?
- No pleasantries, Jack ?
- Where were you ?
I was right here.
- Did you see her leave ?
- No, it was Thanksgiving.
It's our busiest night.
- What time did you leave ?
- About 9h30.
- Where'd you go ?
- Home.
- What, to your apartment ?
- Actually, to Greg's apartment.
- You live at your brother's apartment now ?
- I'm looking after it for him until he comes back.
Did you stay there all night ?
- Yes, I did.
- Can anybody verify that ?
I can.
It must be a lonely way to spend the holiday.
Yes, it was, thanks to you.
- Have you talked to your brother ?
- All the time.
I'm very concerned about him.
- Same as I am about Molly.
- I'll bet.
You know, if something did happen to her, it'll be on your head.
How's that ?
Well, you screwed it up last time and left the killer on the streets, now it's happened again.
We're going to get the right guy this time.
Well, anything I can do to help.
You could confess.
So we good here ?
I got some people to take care of.
We're great.
I know where to find you.
So how long have you known Molly ?
A year and a half.
Maybe.
And what was her relationship like with Ned Atkins ?
They got clean together.
Heroin, crack ?
Heroin.
You know, Peter had mentioned to me that Molly and Ned had a fight recently.
Any idea what that was about ?
Well, she fell off the wagon.
And when was that ?
Last week.
And he caught her.
I was there when it all went down.
- What are you looking for ?
- My jacket, have you seen it ?
No.
- When did you leave it ?
- I don't know, I had it earlier.
You're looking for this ?
Oh, thanks, Ned.
I found this in the pocket.
- That's not mine.
- Oh, come on.
- It's not.
- You're such a loser.
You're a disgrace to this whole program !
Get out !
Get out !
It was pretty frightening,
- I mean how upset he got.
- Right.
- And how did he seem after she went missing ?
- He was really shaken by the whole thing.
I don't think anybody's seen him for a couple of days.
The day of the fight, when Molly lost her jacket, was Rick around then ?
I think so.
I'm telling you it's a frame-up.
We're going to find this woman floating in the river, strangled and it's going to look like Ned Atkins did it.
And what about the other murders ?
How is Rick Knowles going to pawn those off on Atkins ?
I don't know, but I'm sure he's figured out a way.
Oh, come on, Jack.
Look, I need a warrant to get in to Greg's apartment.
We did a thorough search of Greg's apartment at the time of the arrest.
And the judge is not going to let you back in there.
What about Rick's place of business ?
Not without probable cause,
- which you don't have right now.
- You know what, Alex, if you'd have let me go after Rick Knowles when I wanted to...
- none of this would be happening.
- Don't put this all on me.
You got a confession out of Greg Knowles five months ago.
- Yeah, I told you about that.
- And since then... he has confessed to murdering Ann Mathis and eight other homeless women.
The U.S. Attorney has gone back in there time and time again, and they can't find any inconsistencies in Greg's statements.
- Now this is an airtight case.
- Really ?
How do you explain Molly Petrovich ?
Was it just a coincidence that she goes missing from the exact same shelter that Rick Knowles is working at right now ?
Copycat, okay ?
Fine.
Alchek.
Yeah.
Yeah ?
Yeah, thanks, Tom.
Greg Knowles has changed his plea to not guilty.
His lawyer is contesting the confessions.
Not so airtight, huh ?
Do I need my lawyer ?
No.
We just want to ask you a few questions.
Okay.
So we understand you changed your plea.
- Yeah.
- What happened ?
I had a lot of time to think about it.
Wouldn't have anything to do with the fact that your brother visited you yesterday, would it ?
We talked about it.
What did he say ?
Why are you here ?
We don't think you murdered any of those women, Greg.
- Really ?
- Really.
Okay.
What did your brother say ?
He said the same thing he's been saying for months.
That I should fight.
They had you in that interrogation room for nine hours without a lawyer.
- I killed those women, Rick.
- No, you didn't.
- You said so yourself.
- The FBI had us turned against each other.
Malone convinced you that I'd raped Julie.
He doctored that coroner's report.
She was never raped.
You loved her, Greg.
- You never would have hurt her.
- What about Tricia ?
Oh, come on, man, that was 30 years ago.
- I loved her.
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.
- You were 12 years old, it was a crush.
I loved her.
All right, look...
It doesn't matter.
No one will ever know what happened in that boat house.
And your confession will never hold water, not the way they got it out of you.
What do you want me to do ?
You plead not guilty, and I'll have you out of here in a couple of days.
A couple of days ?
Trust me.
I need you, Greg.
You can't leave me out here all alone.
You're all I've got.
And he was right.
He's all I've got.
You had Julie.
You had Tricia Payton.
Yeah.
Another woman went missing from the shelter.
- Molly Petrovich.
- Molly ?
You know her ?
Yeah.
Your brother has been spending a lot of time at the shelter.
Yeah, he volunteers there sometimes.
It's a little more than that.
He's the assistant director there now.
Isn't that your old job ?
- What's your point ?
- I think you know.
No, I don't.
Rick killed those women, not you.
We're done here.
I want you to stick around,... see if you can wait him out.
The car's registered to a Ned Atkins.
- That's the guy you're looking for, right ?
- Yeah, how long has it been here ?
Well, it's got two tickets on it.
First one's written Friday, 15h35.
So the car's been here at least three days.
Hey.
You might want to look at this.
How old's the corpse ?
The coroner is on his way, but my guess is three days, maybe four.
Yeah, that lines up.
- Where's the car ?
- About three blocks away from Ned Atkins' apartment.
Where exactly is the car ?
Is it in front of a fire hydrant, a no-parking zone ?
- A church.
- So he definitely wanted us to find it.
Okay, so where is poor Ned ?
I mean,... if Rick's trying to frame him, wouldn't it be better if Ned was around so we could actually arrest him ?
My guess is he got spooked and he ran.
Look, NYPD want to conduct a thorough search of Ned's apartment, and I can't hold them off for much longer, not with a dead body in the trunk of his car.
I'll be there in ten minutes, just tell them to wait, okay ?
Okay.
Jack.
They are here.
The U.S. Attorney's Office is going to love this.
If he sees that, Greg Knowles is walking.
Hey, guys ?
We got it.
Thanks.
Here's what I want you to do.
I want you to photograph everything in the box, and put it back exactly where you found it.
It's okay, I'll take the heat.
Hey, Malone, look what the cat dragged in.
- Hey, Ned, where you been ?
- I was looking for my girlfriend.
- Can you believe this schmuck ?
- I'm going to take him from here.
This is a homicide now.
Look, this guy is wanted in five states for at least eight kidnappings and murders.
- He's federal property.
- I didn't kill anybody.
Shut up, get in the car.
I know you didn't.
She was in the trunk of my car ?
Yeah.
- Anyone else have a key ?
- No, but the car was stolen.
That's why I was gone for so long.
Because...
I was on foot.
I thought maybe she took it.
- You still have the keys ?
- Yeah.
Can I see them ?
- House and car ?
- Yeah.
I can't believe she's dead.
I mean, I just, I can't believe it.
Did Rick Knowles ever go to your apartment ?
- No.
- Was he aware of your relationship with Molly ?
Well, sure, everyone was.
- What about Julie Cochran, how well did you know her ?
- She was a really nice girl.
Do you remember where you were when she was murdered ?
- I was probably shooting up somewhere.
- How long were you on the needle ?
About 11 years.
So I don't suppose you could account for where you were on any particular day during that period ?
No, both periods are pretty hazy.
What about the syringe you found in Molly's pocket ?
You still have it ?
Yeah, it's in my cubby at the shelter.
To be honest, I could really use a fix right now.
We're not going to let that happen.
We'll get you some help, okay ?
- So now we're burying evidence ?
- Listen, we process this and Greg gets out of jail.
Greg's innocent.
I know that, but we need to keep him in jail so Sam can work on him.
The minute that Greg gets out, Rick is never going to let us talk to him.
I don't know if I feel comfortable with it.
Look, you need to relax.
We just need to stall for a day or two while we build our case.
Yeah, well, stalling for a day or two is also known as evidence tampering and obstruction of justice.
Excuse me.
This guy Atkins is the perfect fall guy.
He knew Julie, Ann and Molly, and he had no alibi for all those other murders.
Yeah, we got to make the connection.
How many chances to prove that Rick had access to Atkins' car and apartment ?
My guess is that he had duplicates of these made.
- You want me to canvass Greg's neighborhood ?
- That'd be great.
Agent Malone.
To what do I owe the pleasure ?
I was just dropping by to talk to your supervisor.
They found a syringe in Molly.
What's her name... ?
- Petrovich.
- Petrovich.
They found a syringe in her pocket.
And, uh, your supervisor confirmed that it matches the kind of syringes you carry in your sample kit.
- What can you tell meabout that ?
- Molly probably stole it.
I sometimes bring my kit to the shelter if I've been on a sales call.
Why would you bring that to a shelter where there are drug addicts ?
You're right.
It was careless of me.
Is that a crime ?
Not as far as I know.
So...
I don't think Ned did it.
I can't find a single shred of evidence to tie him to the other murders.
Really ?
Nothing.
That's your brother ?
Yeah.
Good looking, isn't he ?
I can see why you'd think that.
Good night.
Good night.
- Poor Molly.
- Yeah.
She was killed the same way as the others.
And Ned has no alibi for any of them.
So it certainly makes it look like you're innocent.
I had this dream.
What was it ?
- I saw Tricia.
- Tricia Peyton ?
She was fighting for her life and she was fighting so hard, and I felt like I was just a few feet away
- and I wanted to help her.
- But you couldn't ?
No.
There were all these mice just swarming all over her body.
It was disgusting.
It was horrible.
When did you have this dream ?
On Thanksgiving, that night.
The night Molly was killed ?
Have you ever had that dream before ?
When ?
When Rick and I used to take our trips.
When those other women were killed.
Think about it, Greg.
Think about how connected you two are.
Maybe that's what your dreams are about.
I can't do this, I'm sorry.
Greg ?
I'm done.
Make sure he's put on suicide watch.
I just got a call from the 16th precinct.
They found a box of mementos and trophies in Ned Atkins' apartment.
Pictures of dead women, including Julie Cochran and Ann Mathis.
Apparently they got an anonymous tip.
An anonymous tip ?
Yes, and they decided to check it out before referring it to us.
- Now, didn't you see it when you were in there ?
- Yes, I did
- And you didn't process the evidence ?
- Nope.
- Why not, Jack ?
- Who do you think called in the anonymous tip ?
Are you telling me that Rick planted the box in Atkins' apartment ?
We found a locksmith who verifies that someone was making keys off of Atkins' key chain.
- Someone ?
- Look, the locksmith can't place Rick for sure.
But his store is two blocks away from the shelter.
The shelter ?
That could be anybody, including Atkins.
- Now who else knew about withholding evidence ?
- No one, just me.
Well, the U.S. Attorney called.
They're releasing Greg Knowles and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.
You better call Sam and let her know what's happening.
Spade.
They're gonna release Greg from prison.
I need you to get to him and convince him not to talk to his brother.
Too late.
What are you doing down here ?
Dinner.
We're off the case, aren't we ?
Nope.
The judge let us bug Greg's apartment.
- Well, that's good news.
- Yep.
You know, Greg was close to breaking.
I think deep down he knows that Rick is responsible for everything, he just doesn't want to face it.
And now he's back with his brother.
Rick's going to spin him six ways to Sunday.
- What are those ?
- Divorce papers.
Yours ?
Rick's.
1996.
According to this, he never had sex with his wife.
- Well, we know he's not into women.
- Or girls.
That could be it.
- What ?
- That.
- What ?
- Girls.
Tricia Payton.
That's where this all started.
That's what we have to do.
We have to go back to the beginning.
Your free.
To family.
It's good to be home, huh ?
I heard what you told Alchek earlier.
I want to catch this psychopath as bad as anyone else.
- What happened to my lion fish ?
- Oh, you know what ?
Oh, shoot.
Those fish were kind of hard to take care of.
I think I fed them too much and he died last week.
I'm sorry, man.
But you liked living here ?
Hey...
It was my only way of staying close to you.
That's not really true, is it ?
What do you mean ?
I heard you took my job at the shelter.
Yeah, I know how important that work is to you and I wanted to hold down the fort.
What's up with you ?
The FBI came to see me today.
They did ?
What'd they say ?
A lot.
Like what ?
Hey...
It doesn't matter.
Whatever they said, they don't matter.
This is what matters.
Okay ?
Come here.
You know what ?
Let's take a trip.
What kind of trip ?
It doesn't matter.
Let's just get out of here.
Let's just get away somewhere and relax.
Make up for it, you know ?
You deserve to get all this stuff off your mind.
Yeah ?
Yeah, that'd be good.
All right.
Come on.
Let's eat.
Okay, listen up, everybody !
20 minute break for drinks and snacks, and it wouldn't hurt to look at your lines.
And when we get back, we're going to start at the top.
Mrs. Payton ?
- Yes ?
- We're with the FBI.
Oh, what can I do for you ?
We were wondering if we could speak to you about your daughter, Tricia.
It was getting dark and I didn't know where she was, so I called the police and I told them she was probably somewhere with Greg.
They were always together.
When they got Greg that night at his house, he smelled of alcohol.
Then when they found... when they found Tricia in the boat house, it turned out she had alcohol in her system, too, so of course they focused on Greg.
- But you don't think he did it ?
- No.
He was a sweet boy.
They both were, he and Rick.
Did Rick hang out with Greg and your daughter ?
Yeah, Rick followed Greg wherever he went.
Really ?
Are you sure about that ?
Oh, yeah.
Greg was very popular and... and athletic and funny and...
All the girls were crazy about him.
But not Rick ?
No, he was awkward, really.
He always seemed a little lost whenever Greg wasn't around.
I really never thought Greg did it.
And I can't imagine why he would have confessed, now after all these years.
Yeah, I spoke with the supervisor.
Rick doesn't have any trips coming up.
No, they checked his credit cards, there's no reservations anywhere, nothing.
I need you to go over to Greg's apartment.
Danny and Viv are going to need help in surveillancing once the twins are on the move.
- On my way.
- Okay, great.
- Got anything ?
- Okay, May 14, 1973, apparently the sheriff taped Greg's interrogation.
Listen to this.
I loved Tricia and I would never do anything to hurt her.
I know you love her.
Everyone says the two of you are always together.
I told you 20 times already, I never saw her today.
I swear to God.
I never saw her.
You know, your brother's in the other room, and he said he saw you with Tricia after school.
Says you were going to hang out at the boat house.
- No, he didn't, he wouldn't say that.
- Maybe you ought to talk to him and straighten him out.
- You're going to let me talk to him ?
- Sure.
We just want to get to the bottom of this.
Hang on a minute.
Looks like we weren't the only ones with this idea.
I don't know how much longer I can do this.
Now, you just listen to me.
They don't have anything on you.
And I haven't said anything.
Okay ?
You never saw her, you hear me ?
You never saw her.
No matter how many times they ask, no matter how many different ways, don't let them bully you, you hear me ?
- Yeah, but...
- Don't.
Come on, Greg, please.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Thank you.
- I mean, I don't know what I'd do without you.
- What'd you expect me to do ?
We're brothers.
I just didn't want to get you in trouble, Mouse.
Don't ever call me that again.
- Why, what's the matter ?
- You heard me.
I don't ever want to hear that name again.
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- The mice from the dream.
From here on in, it's just you and me, Greg.
You understand me ?
We can't trust anyone else in the world.
Just you and me.
Ten minutes later their lawyer showed up.
Sheriff could never get the boys back in and they couldn't make a case.
- Malone.
- Did you wiretap Greg Knowles apartment ?
I got a warrant from the judge.
But you didn't mention anything about Ned Atkins being the prime suspect in this case.
- I didn't think it was relevant.
- You know what, Jack ?
Come home.
- You and I need to talk.
- Okay.
And don't make another move without consulting me first.
You got it ?
Got it.
They're making a move.
- Malone.
- The twins are on the move.
They're packed to go on a trip.
Do you want us to follow ?
Pick them up.
Pick them up ?
Yeah, bring them in.
Okay.
Drop your bags and keep your hands where we can see them.
Drop them !
Right here.
Thanks, Martin.
Yeah, no problem.
Good luck.
Welcome back.
- Are you charging me with anything ?
- Haven't decided yet.
Because of your incompetence, I've been separated from my brother now for five months.
You might not have a life, Jack, but we do.
Yeah, well, I'm really sorry to have inconvenienced you, but I had to make a trip to Connecticut to talk to Tricia Payton's mother.
Really ?
And what did Mrs. Payton have to tell you ?
Why don't you take a seat ?
She told me that you were shy.
That you were not the dominant one,
- that you were a wallflower.
- Is that right ?
She said you lived in Greg's shadow, that girls were more attracted to Greg.
And it just made me wonder, what predicated the switch ?
From here on in... it's just you and me, Greg.
You understand me ?
We can't trust anyone else in the world.
Just you... and me.
That was the moment, wasn't it ?
When he took control of you.
You were in love with Tricia and he took her from you.
And when you had another chance at happiness with Julie, he took her, too.
I don't know.
Rick took this photo of Julie after he killed her... in your apartment while you were passed out in the other room.
And for a long time, I was trying to figure out which one of you killed Tricia.
But I've decided it was you.
Me ?
That's where you first got the taste for it.
That's why you kept doing it over and over again.
Really ?
I read your divorce papers.
According to your wife...
- you never had sex with her.
- My ex-wife was a liar.
Really ?
You signed the papers, you didn't dispute it.
And what does this have to do with your persecution of my brother ?
I just don't think that you like women.
I like women fine, Jack.
But I think you like your brother more.
- Okay, I don't need to sit here and...
- Come on, why don't you just admit it ?
Ever since were 12 years old and spanking it in the bathroom,
- you've been thinking about your brother Greg.
- That's enough.
And every time you looked in the mirror, you saw his face...
- I said that's enough !
- ...which made you hate yourself, but it made you hate him even more.
Remember when you told me about your dream, the mice ?
Yeah.
When you were kids,...
- didn't you call Rick "Mouse" ?
- Yeah, he hated that name.
Of course he did.
Because you were strong and full of life, and he was just a scared little boy.
Maybe.
So maybe,... when you're seeing the mice crawling all over Tricia... it's actually Rick.
It's possible, isn't it ?
Greg ?
I used to see things.
What kind of things ?
In the hotel room where we'd stay on our trips.
Necklaces and... bracelets.
He was keeping their jewelry... as trophies.
Mr. Alchek !
Time to release my other client now.
Okay.
Let's go home.
Spade.
Were you aware that Jack was defying my order ?
Yes, sir, I was and I'm sorry.
What is it with you people ?
- If Malone told you to jump off a building, would you do it ?
- Probably, sir, yes.
Maybe Rick didn't give up all his trophies.
We're going to need your help getting a search warrant.
What do we got here ?
Step back into the room and take a seat.
- Back into the room and take a seat!
- Okay, I am.
I am.
Right there.
Sit down !
Sit down !
- What the hell happened here ?
- We had a fight.
You were right.
It was terrible.
Rick just ran out and left.
I don't know where he went.
- What was the fight about ?
- I told him I knew everything.
All of it.
What he did, everything.
You were right, Sam.
After all these years.
I know !
- I know what you did !
- You're taking that bitch's word over mine ?
!
It has nothing to do with her !
I saw it!
I saw it all !
- What ?
What did you see ?
- Why ?
Why would you do this to me ?
How could you ?
Greg, listen to me.
I would lay down my life for you, but this is in your head, okay, man ?
You are sick.
- You need help.
You need some serious help.
- I should kill you !
How can you say that to me ?
- I love you !
- You love me ?
You love me ?
Everything I've ever done has been for you !
And then, finally, he stopped and he got up and he ran out and... he said I'd never see him again.
I'll do whatever you guys want me to.
I mean, I'll testify against him.
Anything.
I just want to put this behind me.
Greg, we're going to need to take you downtown, take your statement, all right ?
Yeah, of course.
Hey, Mouse.
Keep him covered.
Is he alive ?
Yeah, send an ambulance to 411 Elizabeth Street.
Is he alive ?
!
Yeah, he's alive.
Hopefully, I'll still have a job in the morning.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
- What'd you say to Alchek, anyway ?
- Nothing he didn't know already.
If I didn't have seven hours of paperwork, I'd buy you a drink.
You should probably buy everybody a drink.
Probably should.
From here on in... it's just you and me, Greg.
You understand me ?
Can't trust anyone else in the world.
Just you... and me.
Sous-titres par brainwash Transcript de Raceman
So, that is when they said,
We need you for our December cover.
I said no.
I mean,I could have children someday.
Children are...
They're nice.
But not your cup of tea.
Well, there's...
No apologies.
No one loves a shallow more than me.
This is good to know.
Hello.
Yes, it's me.
What's the matter?
You didn't expect to see me here tonight?
And we have five more minutes, or actually, uh, we four minutes and 34 seconds.
Do you want me to try to explain?
I would love an explanation.
Ready, set, go.
Financial planner.
I own my own condo outright.
Never been married.
Probably cause I work seven days a week.
I know.
You know?
You were Rebecca #7 at the Biscayne Grill.
Right.
Excuse me.May I get another one of these, please?
You're one of those.
Probably can't hold your attention for more five seconds.
Alexx,who do we have?
Richard Laken, 35 years old.
Based on his cash, robbery was not the motive.
Was he bludgeoned?
Can't tell with what.
I'll have to get a good look at these subdural injuries.
His car was vandalized, suggesting a murder of passion.
Wasn't enough just to kill him?
Patrol called it in.
Owner says the last people that saw him alive are long gone.
Was he alone?
No, he was with about 30 people.
They had some sort of matchmaker party here last night.
Matchmaker in South Beach?
Bunch of singles get together, play musical chairs.
Get to know each other over drinks.
Have a date every five minutes.
They call it speed-dating.
Owner says our victim had 15 dates.
Well, you know what they say,Frank.
Speed kills.
Cell phone's off.
Rigor indicates he's been here at least six hours.
Looks like a scorecard for the ladies.
Checked every nook and cranny on this block.
No murder weapon.
Well, it may have had some value for the killer, and they took it with them.
Calleigh, I smell acetone.
Acetone with a hint of lemon.
I think it's nail polish remover.
Whoever vandalized the car was probably female.
That would be half our speed-daters.
Yes, it would.
Frank, it is time to talk to the owner.
Thank you, ladies.
This stuff is supposed to be confidential
You're putting me in a really bad position here
That's my specialty
All right, look, what do you want again?
I want the list of everybody that sat with my victim.
The names are on my sign-up roster.
There are 15 women, 15 men.
I'd have to look for it.
I suggest that you do.
Do you recall Richard Laken in any altercations?
Like bruised egos, broken hearts,a drink in the face?
You know, I'm not a chaperone.
I spend the night catching up on paperwork.
Here are the applications from last night's participants.
Phone and addresses are in there.
Okay, a paralegal... a web designer, flight attendant, financial planner.
Demanding jobs.
People don't have time to date.
Wait a second, Frank.
Mary Kinnan, hair stylist.
A hair stylist, Frank she has an access to acetone, doesn't she?
Guy's car was dunked in it.
Yes.
Take Eric and find out what made Mary so unhappy in under five minutes.
All right.
We're looking for Mary Kinnan.
Is she here?
In the house I built but don't live in?
You bet you.
Help yourself.
What's in the box?
Well, you want to know, call your lawyer.
Oh, fine, I'll do that, and I'll stick you with the legal fees.
He dumped me four months ago for a site manager, and he's surprised that I want the house.
We understand you attended a speed-dating event last night.
I did.
There might be a lot of fish in the sea, but I can't be reeling them in one at a time.
I've got three kids in there.
You know Richard Laken?
Yes.
He was murdered last night outside the Neuron Lounge.
Oh, my God.
I...
Um... we met a couple months ago at-at a night, and then we had a few real dates after that.
Someone also vandalized his car with acetone, an ingredient you use as a hairstylist.
Wait a minute.
You think that...?
Yeah, we do.
And we'd like to search the premises to see if we find any acetone.
Okay.
Okay, I threw acetone on his car.
No.
Richard told me that he was getting back together with his ex, and then I see him last night at speed-dating, playing the field.
And so, you were mad?
No, I was insulted.
And during the break, I went outside to make a point.
Okay, it was... it was stupid,
I know, all right?
But I went...
I went back inside, and-and that was it.
Look, I watched him get up and leave right after the final bell.
He didn't even turn his card in, and-and he was alive, okay?
You know why he ran out?
I figured he didn't want to see me again.
All right.
Appreciate it.
I'll call Horatio, tell him something had our victim on the run.
All right, I'm gonna check her story.
What you doing?
Confirming Mary Kinnan's story.
She poured at least four liters of acetone on Richard Laken's car.
It was evaporated in 30 minutes.
Yeah.
It was gone when we got there.
So, if Richard Laken was murdered while his car was being vandalized, the acetone would have still been wet and dripped on his shoe.
I checked.
There's not a drop.
Meaning she ruined his paint job at intermission, not at the end of the night.
Meaning, our divorcee was telling the truth.
Hey, guys,
Alexx called up.
Said Richard Laken's on deck.
You go.
To the autopsy?
Yeah, to the autopsy.
What, are you scared?
No, not at all.
I'll go.
Thanks, guys.
Have fun.
It's a head trauma, right?
This Richard Laken?
Heard you're the man today.
I've observed autopsies before.
Once.
As a student through the glass.
Then step right up.
You see the contusions on the forearms?
Had to be antemortem
He was trying to defend himself.
What is it?
I don't know, but it's silver, and there's a lot of it.
Might be paint.
I'll take it to Trace.
You do that.
Alexx?
He doesn't have a head.
Where'd the head go?
I'm processing it.
You're boiling it?
Can't determine the type of murder weapon from the injuries to his arms and torso.
But... with a shattered mandible, depressed skull fractures, and intracranial hemorrhaging, his head may tell us what hit him.
I'm gonna remove the soft tissue, get a better look.
The skin...
Think I understand why Calleigh and Delko sent me.
You okay, Ryan?
Okay, why don't you go on over to Trace, and I'll finish up here, okay?
Tyler, do we have the floor plan to the Neuron Lounge, please?
Every square inch.
Okay.
Now, Mary Kinnan said Richard was in a hurry to leave the table, right?
I need to know who he sat with last.
Okay, all these speed-daters filled out these cards, turned 'em in at the end of the night.
I've been translating them.
Every person was given a number corresponds with a table.
They move every five minutes.
So, it's a well-oiled machine.
Your victim, Richard Laken, started his evening at Table 12.
Only the men change tables.
Rebecca Briggs.
She's the one Richard ran from.
Okay, so the question becomes did Rebecca go after him?
Thank you.
You were the last one to see him alive, Rebecca.
I told you, when he left my table, that was it.
I never saw him again.
This scratch looks fresh.
I have cats.
It's how they show affection.
You pick up any habits from them?
I don't like him.
Rebecca, the medical examiner is doing Richard's autopsy as we speak.
If he scratched you, I'm going to know about it,
So... this is your opportunity to change your story.
All right...
I did follow him... because I knew he was the guy.
The guy?
My condo.
Last week, when I got home, my laptop, my stereo system, my plasma screen everything was gone.
Hey, Richard!
Are you done now, huh?
You got enough info?
What, are you crazy?
Who you robbing tonight, huh?
Which girl's it going to be this time?
Why do you suspect Richard?
I know it was one of those speed-dating guys.
They're the only guys that I spill everything to.
It's weird, you know, when you're under the clock, you feel compelled to tell them everything right away your habits, your secrets, your schedule.
You file a police report?
No.
I
- I thought I could figure it out myself.
And I felt stupid enough without bringing the police in.
I
- I really thought I had him last night.
Richard he just looked... he looked so guilty standing there.
Guilty?
You know, Rebecca, in my line of work, do you know what they call that?
They call it motive.
Rebecca Briggs was cleaned out, all right.
Whoever did it got in somehow.
I'll, uh...
I'll check the back for forced entry.
Frank, the scene of the crime is the entertainment center.
Might have something.
I'm no CSI, but it looks to be more of a smear than a print.
Probably not much help.
Well, if it's a smear, Frank, there may be enough ridge detail to capture some DNA.
You talking skin cells?
If he's a shedder... there could be enough stripped nuclei.
for Valera to work on.
You can get DNA from that?
Frank... there's more than one kind of fingerprint.
Hey, you looking for me?
I was- finally finished Richard Laken's skull.
Looks like a museum piece.
Yeah, the end result usually does.
Three blows, all to the parietal bone.
The first two cracked the skull No tool impressions.
Luckily for us, the killer got angrier.
This one broke clean through.
Gave us something to work with.
What kind of weapon?
You're the CSI.
That part's up to you.
So, uh, how'd it go in autopsy?
I handled it.
Who hazed you?
Speedle.
A headless woman.
Freaked me out a little, too.
So, what killed Richard Laken?
Based on the paint from Richard's arms and the measurements on these guys, he was killed with a tire iron.
Okay, now we know what we're looking for.
Good work.
Valera, the DNA from the condo.
Is it Richard Laken's?
Nope.
Meet Chad Gilbert.
Got a three year sentence for burglary in '99.
So Chad is at it again, huh?
Yeah, and get this:
I checked it against your list.
He's another one of your speed-daters.
Interesting.
Thank you, Valera.
That better be you, Sully.
Hey, get down!
Kiss the floor, Chad!
Now!
Get down!
Frank?
He's clean.
Ooh, Chad.
What do we have here?
Ooh, look at this.
Chad was on his way to the fence.
Huh, Chad?
Looks like Rebecca Briggs' plasma screen, laptop.
Yes, it does.
Let me ask you a question, Chad.
How many women have you ripped off under the guise of speed-dating?
Look, man, it's just burglary.
Nobody's getting hurt.
Really?
You're about to get hurt.
You're looking at one year minimum if you don't answer the next question correctly.
Was Richard Laken involved in your little scam?
Richard?
Number 12?
No.
That guy's there for the women, man.
He-he thinks he's a real player.
Was he into any special woman last night?
Well, I did see him acting kind of strange, you know, right before the final bell.
E
- Excuse me.
But I don't think it was about that chick he was sitting with.
No, he... he saw something or-or somebody.
The guy went white as a sheet.
And you noticed all that, huh, Chad?
Look, I notice everything about everyone.
It's what I do.
Hey, Tyler.
Hey.
3D software's loaded.
What do you want to see?
Who Richard was staring at before he left the speed-dating event.
But... wasn't it the girl in front of him, Rebecca Briggs?
Horatio thinks it was someone else.
Okay...
Richard Laken is in yellow.
Rebecca is the first one, in purple.
Connie #12 is the next woman.
And who's the guy?
According to this, he could've been looking at Jack Smith.
Thanks, Tyler.
Hey.
Hey.
The lounge floor plan said the person in Richard's sight line was a Jack Smith.
Jack Smith?
Here's his application.
I was about to go and see him.
Hey, hang on a second.
There's a problem.
Take a look at that address.
1126 Charthouse Drive.
It's in the Grove.
Miami Beach Cafe, which is right on the water, is at 1028 Charthouse, right?
So 1126 would probably make his front door out in the Atlantic, wouldn't it?
He lied on his application.
Possibly, if he exists at all.
Whoever he is, let's find him, okay?
Jack Smith...
Um, w-what number was he?
Number 13.
We don't think Jack Smith was his real name.
I'm sorry, I-I'm drawing a blank.
I guess he wasn't my type.
Richard was staring at him during your date together.
Do you by any chance remember exactly what you were talking about when he left?
Excuse me.
May I get another one of these, please?
You're one of those.
You probably can't hold your attention for more than five seconds.
He said something about the heat.
It's the heat.
It is hot.
They say it might rain tomorrow.
No, the... the game the other night...
The game, right.
Basketball.
What about the game?
And then he shot out of his chair like I said I wanted to elope and have twins.
Does that help?
More than you know.
What do we have?
Well, so far, just that Richard Laken was rattling on about the Miami Heat right before he bolted the lounge.
You know, we did find a ticket stub in his wallet.
Maybe he saw something at the game.
The Arena has an event index that logs everything that happens at the game.
Let's see.
Fan altercations.
Found lost child at Gate 3 concession stand, reunited with parent.
Helped G. Lewis Davis find lost wallet in section 412.
Tended to sick fan during halftime show.
Assisted fan complaining of chest pains.
No Richard Laken.
That was all inside, wasn't it?
What about outside?
I'm gonna check anything in the Arena's zip code.
Then I'll cross-reference it with the date and time of the game.
Well, look at that.
Richard Laken.
Richard Laken witnessed an assault Saturday night after the game.
He made a statement to the police.
Bring up that statement, please.
Two white men attacked Marcus Washington, in a private parking lot outside the Arena.
Every single free throw he missed!
It's ridiculous!
Hey, man!
One hit him; the other one tended to him.
Right, but both men fled the scene, didn't they?
Case is still open.
His mother was with him, but she was too shaken up to remember anything.
So Laken's the only reliable witness.
Until someone killed him.
What about the victim?
Marcus Washington is in critical condition at Dade Memorial Hospital.
Dade Memorial.
That's where I'll be.
Thank you.
Mrs. Washington?
Mrs. Washington, My name is Horatio Caine.
I'm with CSI.
I'm sorry for what happened to Marcus.
He hit the pavement so hard.
The doctor said it's cerebral edema.
I keep talking to him.
I don't know if he can hear me.
Well, Mrs. Washington, with these things, it's possible that he can hear you.
Did you find the man who did this to him?
Well, we're making progress.
And I understand that you've spoken to officers, but would you mind telling me the story?
My son takes me to all the games.
It's our tradition.
We were going to the car, and this man bumped into me.
He was missing every single one!
Hey, man, that's my mom!
What are you doing?
Marcus!
Marcus!
Can you hear me?
Help!
Somebody help!
Marcus!
Marcus was just watching out for me.
I understand.
Did you get a look at the man?
I was looking at my son.
All I remember is the blood coming from his nose.
I'm sorry.
Mrs. Washington, there's no need for you to apologize.
Here's what I want to do.
If I find out anything, I will come and find you, okay?
You hang in there.
Hey.
This is the evidence from the Marcus Washington assault?
Officer Ramirez got the call.
He clearly remembers taking Laken's statement.
What is this?
That is... what's left of a temporary tattoo.
Hmm.
And so this must be the mother's handkerchief.
Marcus!
Marcus, can you hear me?
Marcus!
Marcus!
The rest of it's just napkins from the Arena parking lot.
Hot dog mustard, relish.
This napkin's interesting.
The fiber's tight.
It's higher grade, you mean.
Tighter weave, like it's more expensive.
Maybe like the kind they give out in skyboxes?
Richard Laken's statement said that one of the assailants knelt next to Marcus Washington and tended to him.
Hey, man, are you okay?
Marcus!
Marcus!
We should find out which skybox this napkin comes from.
Did you get anything off the napkin?
Lucky for us, this high-grade fiber latches onto everything.
What is it?
Take a look.
Some kind of meat?
Spectra's flatlined.
There's nothing on it.
Exactly.
There's no progesterone, estradiol or any other government approved hormone.
You know what that means?
Meat's foreign.
It's Kobe beef.
Japanese delicacy.
That's an expensive snack, even for a skybox.
Solar State Insurance was able to afford it.
Two orders from outside restaurants.
Arena operations confirmed it over the phone.
Solar State.
Over a thousand employees and a half million clients.
But only one person signed for it.
They're checking receipts to get us a name.
Hmm.
I wasn't even at the Heat game on Saturday.
Is that a fact?
Well, Mr. Hayes, somebody was, and they... have the ability to perfectly reproduce your signature.
The other thing that we found from your skybox is a napkin with the victim's blood on it.
What does this mean to you?
The Arena has confirmed there were only two of you in the skybox, which makes you either guilty of aggravated assault or an accomplice.
An accomplice?
To what I don't know yet.
The victim, the victim, Mr. Hayes, is hanging on by a thread.
No, no, no, no.
Wait a minute.
I tried to help that guy.
What are you doing?
Hey, man, are you okay?
Come on!
Let's go!
Marcus!
Marcus, can you hear me?
Help!
I need a name.
He's a buddy from work.
Jack Webster.
Look, I...
It happened so fast,
I didn't have time to stop him.
You better pray that I do.
Now, Jack, here's what I think happened.
You and your buddy were up in the skybox watching the pros bang it around, feeling your testosterone, and you punched the first man that ran in to your path.
Never happened.
Stanton gave you up, Jack.
What?
Stanton hit that kid.
I tried to save his life.
So we have a he said/he said.
Jack, do you know that you're in the minority?
You don't say.
Yes, the minority, Jack.
Only 11% of the country is left-handed.
What makes you think I'm left-handed?
Your ring does.
Marcus had a temporary tattoo on his face.
It wiped off onto your ring when you hit him.
You washed your hands, but neglected your ring.
He started it.
He got in my face.
What was he, what was he even doing out there?
Hey, man!
Hey, man, you okay?
Come on!
Let's go!
Marcus!
He was protecting his mother.
I didn't mean to hurt him that bad.
But you did hurt him that bad.
And Richard Laken saw it.
And he wound up dead the very next night.
I didn't kill that guy.
Why do you call yourself "Jack Smith" if you have nothing to hide?
Look... fake names... keep the women from calling.
Five minutes and they think they're engaged.
Have you ever taken a good look in the mirror?
I didn't even notice that guy.
No, but he noticed you.
Oh, you're one of those.
Probably can't hold your attention for more five seconds.
If this Richard guy saw me, why didn't he call the cops?
Maybe he died trying.
There are no cell phones allowed in the lounge during speed-dating.
So, when Richard recognized Jack, he had to go to his car, get his cell phone and call the police.
PD sent over his phone log.
He made no calls last night, so we can't tell if his phone was on.
Well, actually, we can, with this.
A flash memory chip.
When a cell phone's turned on, it has to find a network.
So, it sends out a signal to the nearest cell tower.
The tower sends back a time-stamped confirmation that can be retained in the flash memory chip even when the phone's turned off.
He turned his cell phone on at 10:56 P.M.
So, he was killed before he had a chance to make a call.
We have the time of death.
Jack was inside with everyone else handing in scorecards.
Which means he has 28 alibis.
Which means that whoever killed Richard Laken was waiting for him outside.
Let's go back to the crime scene and expand our search.
Hey, Eric.
Will you check this out?
Does this look like it belongs here to you?
Definitely not.
Looks like caked gravel.
Maybe crushed stone.
But the color's off, like it's been treated.
It's cast stone.
It's a durable building material.
A list architects use it.
You put the right finish on it, it looks just like granite.
Cheap contractors must love it.
And I think I know one who was standing right here.
Pop the trunk.
You guys can't go in there.
Yes, we can.
Pop it.
Doing some masonry at the site, Fred?
It's my job.
I'm a builder.
What are you looking at that for?
It might have done more than change a tire.
You're kidding, right?
We've got blood.
You're under arrest for the murder of Richard Laken.
Officer...
I was never at this Neuron Lounge last night.
That's true, Fred.
But you were camped out across the street from it.
All right, I knew my wife was seeing some guy.
Didn't you cheat on her?
Yeah, but I still had to know who got her so hot and bothered.
I'd seen his car once when he picked her up.
When I saw who it was,
I realized I had nothing to worry about.
The guy was a pencil-neck.
So, I left.
Then how do you explain your tire iron with Richard Laken's blood on it?
The tool mark matches his skull fracture.
I can think of one person who would set me up.
What?
Why would I do that?
Perhaps to kill two birds with one stone.
Or should I say men?
All right, I went out there at the end of the speed-dating, okay?
I...
I wanted to see the look on his face when he saw what I'd done to his car.
Damn!
How does it feel to expect one thing and get another?
"I'm sorry." Is that what you want to hear?
Why didn't you tell me this before?
Well, the last I heard, they didn't allow child support from prison.
And you never touched Richard?
N...
No.
Never.
Will you explain his blood... on your card?
I don't know.
Is it possible that you touched him before you went back inside?
I...
I really, I really couldn't say.
See. the problem I'm having is that the tire iron you claimed your husband used
is from your car.
You're trying to trick me because they're all the same.
Are they?
Wolfe?
Diameter of Richard Laken's skull fracture, 17 millimeters.
It's consistent with your car.
Your husband's SUV needs a 19-millimeter tire iron.
So, you swapped out your tire iron to frame your husband.
I just wanted to see his reaction.
Damn it.
He loved that car so i carried the tire iron for protection.
How does it feel to expect one thing and get another?
You don't get it.
You women, you think that that's a dating service?
It's about getting laid.
What?
!
You're all in there looking for a husband.
We're trying to get sex in less than five minutes.
I thought we had something.
We did.
Sex.
You want a husband, go back to the guy who left you.
The cruelty.
He showed his true colors.
And now we've seen yours.
Thank you, Wolfe.
Lieutenant Caine.
Ma'am.
I heard you found the guy who did this.
You know what, Mrs. Washington?
We did.
We found him.
Marcus squeezed my hand today.
Once.
The doctor said that it might not mean anything.
Mrs. Washington, you and I know different, don't we?
Have you had anything to eat?
No, not in days.
You know what?
There's a cafeteria downstairs.
Why don't you get a bite to eat?
Oh, no, I can't go.
Mrs. Washington, you can.
I'll watch Marcus.
You don't mind, Lieutenant?
I'll stay with him.
Now the story of evacuations, they're under way for beach communities and both Dade and Palm Beach counties
Some of the keys have already been evacuated.
Oceanographers predict that a massive tidal surge or tsunami will hit Miami Beach by late afternoon same long lines at every gas station in the costal areas as people fill their tanks before they head to higher ground.
Due to increased demand, many gas stations are finding their reserves insufficient.
I'm out.
No more.
No more gas.
What's going on here?
What are you doing up there?
What's taking so long?
It's out of money.
Where is the closest ATM?
This is the third place I've been to.
Home improvement stores are being inundated as locals are stocking up in preparation of this tsunami.
A more common to this emotion occurrence, this particular tsunami in the
Atlantic was engendered by a large portion of the Cumbre Vieja Volcano in the Canari island, collapsed 8 hours ago sending water reported to be 100 meters high rising for forth of south coast.
Hey.
- What's the hell wrong with you?
- I'm sorry, it's an accident.
Look at my car!
Hey look buddy she said it was an accident
Screw you
Stop it, Dan!
Stop it.
Stop damn!
Stop!
Stop it!
- I can't... breathe...
- Are you kidding me?
Two bodies and the wave hasn't even hit yet.
Well evacuations have a way making people crazy Franck.
According to witnesses there were a dust out in the parking lot.
When it was over some of the rovers found these two.
So you have inmate tats, prison buff.
And we have a coed, I don't see the connection.
Our female victim is a Virginia Dickens.
Here visiting a student at Miami.
- They were heading inland.
- But she made a stop first.
Yeah the guy was so pissed he wouldn't get out of the car.
Looks like she walk up on something.
So that means that the killer's real target is the ex-con.
Is it a puncture wound Alexx?
Right to the temple.
Killer left no room for error.
ID does Leon Caldwell.
- All cash, no credit cards.
- It is hard to get credit cards sent to a cell.
What do we have there Alexx?
Oh Sig Sauer, and loaded.
Fresh out of jail and already packing huh?
Look what I've found in his pocket.
Frank...
Take a look at that... 5.7 x 28 millimetres, not from this gun.
That's a monster calibre.
Penetrates up to 48 layers of Kevlar.
Something tells me this guy was planning something big...
And not alone...
Frank, it turns out the wave is not the only thing about to hit Miami...

It's still time for you to evacuate.
Just following your lead.
I figured there's a reason you staying put.
Well there is.
We've found these.
5.7 x 28, significant wounding potential.
We think he has a partner and a plan.
You're thinking a heist.
Alright, 1500 banks in the area, hundreds of armoured cars, hotels, saves, art museums,
- billionaires states.
- Right.
This is the rent-a-car.
That is the shopping cart.
Get Eric out here, please.
Right now.
It's the window to the heist.
Yep.
Be alert, seven hours and counting.
We got lucky...
Someone stepped on this one.
And an exemplar.
Lot of hairs on the driver's seat.
White hairs.
Ha, they're closed up, insurance reasons.
Our killer left behind 15 foot emergency fire ladder,
30 feet of vinyl tubing, and a mini maglite.
If they needed it before, they still need it.
Changed towards the closing, couple of mom and pop hardware stores are probably still open.
I'll got hit a few, starting with the closest.
Alright, I'm gonna go with you Tripp.
Calleigh you take care of this?
You know it.
- Good night
- Hey.
Are you leaving?
Huh... normally I would stay here and stick this out especially being new and all.
Oh, no one would fault you for evacuating.
No I have an uncle, a stubborn uncle, he lives on Count in North Miami beach.
He's refusing to evacuate?
He says he lived through 4 hurricanes this season alone and not gonna let some other wave chase him out.
I called a bunch of times, he's not picking up the phone.
Well, maybe that means he's gone already.
I just wanna make sure...
can you clear it with the LT?
Yeah.
And just see you know they've closed Eastbound Broad and Kennedy Crossways
That's why I get the brass pass.
Be careful out there!
Hi Charlie, how's hardware business treating you?
Hey Frank...
You got that wire problem figured out yet?
You bet, just did what you told me to do.
By any chance you sold any of these provisions to someone in the last hours?
Yours is the third place we've been.
Closing up after this guy.
He went around when I dug out some silicone.
I think he's still over there loading his car.
- Thanks.
- Thank you Charlie.
Excuse me...
Miami Dade PD
Crime Lab.
Really shouldn't you two be working traffic or something?
Can I see your license?
Steve Riddick?
That's right.
Mind if we have a look inside your car?
You got a warrant?
- Not yet.
- Well, you can search it when you get one.
Well according to the hardware store owner you purchased these items.
- So?
- So we got a dead guy in a hardware chain that bought the same things.
Do you mind if I've a look at the bottom of your shoes?
Orange pulp.
Yeah there's craps all over my mats too.
I like crap, it just got you arrested.
You got to be kidding me!
Turn around.
Alexx.
Thought you got lost?
Yes, inland traffic...
What can you tell me about the weapon used on the victim?
A quarter inch in diameter, two inches deep.
And look at this...
- The weapon is cylindrical.
- Right.
The edges of the wound scrape belong side the weapon, creating a circumferential margin abrasion.
Opened this and brain dead.
So significant force.
You find the weapon, I can compare the tool mark.
Found something else Horatio, in his longs.
Normal bronchial tube are pinking the last tick, his bronchial tubes have significant fibrosis.
So, he had trouble breathing.
Based on the thickness of his neck, I'm thinking chronic apnea
Shortness of breath that can lead to unconsciousness.
Not a guy you can count on.
Alexx, you've just discovered our motive.
I did?
You did.
Let me know if I was right.
Yes.
A shopping list and an orange, and you want to charge me with two murders?
Come on, get out of here.
We're figuring the lady walked up on you while you were puncturing your pal Leon's temple.
Nice fantasy.
And why'd I kill Leon?
Because Leon has apnea.
Ap-a-what?
Apnea means you go unconscious with no notice.
Not exactly the type of guy you want on your crew for a heist.
There's a heist?
Really?
I want to know about this.
Yeah, well, so do we.
Bullets tell us it's a big job.
We figure you got a little more manpower.
Why don't you whip out some names?
I'm not giving you mooks anything.
And
I've got a news flash.
You're not going to get me for her or for him.
My lawyer's on his way.
Book him, Frank.
I've got a news flash for you.
I'm going to get you.
I assumed that you and Ray Junior would be heading north by now.
My mom took him inland to a hotel.
What is that?
Um, I was bending down to get a pot out of the cabinet and I hit my eye.
Yelina.
We're fine.
Yelina... where is he?
Horatio, it's not what you think.
How many times have I heard a woman in the field say that?
Lieutenant Caine.
Rebecca Nevins.
From the State Attorney's office.
I'll be with you in a second.
To be continued, Yelina.
There is nothing to be continued.
You've arrested Steve Riddick.
Yes, I did, for murder.
Your CSI checked his car.
Couldn't find any of the items on the hardware store list.
Mr. Riddick was at the store.
I am confident that he stashed the items somewhere.
And the orange from the victim and Riddick's shoes?
Pulp's not unique.
This guy is right.
I file this, judge kicks it.
It's a lose/lose.
I don't think we want this man on the street, do you?
Rearrest him when you can bring me more compelling evidence.
Frank.
Yeah.
Cooler heads prevailed,
Just beat it, will you?
We're gonna let him walk?
I have no choice.
Put a radio car on him, please.
Do you think the lab is going to get hit?
We're inland enough and on the third floor.
I think the worst place to be right now is near the beach.
Did you get anything for me?
I got to pack up, but I did look at the hairs from the car and the clothes of your male victim.
Leon Caldwell?
Roots are spade shaped.
That only means one thing dog hairs.
Short-haired breed.
I counted 17 different specimens from the tape lifts.
From a kennel or a vet maybe.
All the hairs are from greyhound.
Greyhound.
Dog races.
Popular in Miami.
Thanks, Aaron.
Sounds like the dogs have been evacuated.
Miami-Dade Police.
Are you in charge?
We'd love to meet him too.
Cages for 24 greyhounds.
This explains the dog hair on our victim.
Manny... does he seem familiar to you?
Familiar
No.
Hurricane glass.
There's a hole in the top.
It seems almost experimental.
Manny, were you, Riddick and Leon doing trial runs here?
Where is it supposed to happen?
I want a lawyer.
You know what, my friend?
You're going to get a lawyer.
Turn around.
Find the window, find the caper, right, Calleigh?
You got it.
Delko.
Eric, is it possible to locate a building based on the size of its hurricane window?
Five feet nine inches by 11.
That doesn't sound like a standard size, which means it would have to be custom made and subject to Florida code requirements.
Golden Beach Bank and Trust.
Dispatch, this is CSI Duquesne.
We're going to need a welfare check on Golden Beach Bank and Trust.
Manny, how many guys on your crew?
Look, I don't know.
I-I just do my part, man.
A radio car's rolling.
There's no ETA.
PD's spread pretty thin.
Eric, meet me at the corner of Ocean and Golden Beach, please.
Thank you.
Calleigh, book him.
I'm going to need your clothes.
Uncle Ron?
You in here?
You listened after all.
Excuse me.
Are you Ronald's nephew?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Ryan.
I'm Mona.
I live next door.
Ronald talks about you all the time.
Did my uncle evacuate?
He ran out of here, tried to get me to go with him, but I think they're all overreacting.
The skies are blue.
There's not a breeze in the air.
This isn't a hurricane, ma'am.
Tidal wave doesn't give notice, it just hits and it could take out this entire structure.
I see.
I'll get my things.
My, but that is a low tide.
And it's getting lower.
If I didn't have my contacts in,
I'd swear the ocean was disappearing.
It is.
The bad news is, it's going to come back.
We gotta get out of here.
No, Mona, we're going to stay right here.
Right here.
This thing is going to be a monster.
Shots fired at Golden State Bank.
Requesting backup.
Every available unit.
Robbery in progress.
Copy that.
They've got a machine gun.
Stay on the ground!
Nobody move!
I said nobody move!
I told you, nobody moves!
Hey!
Eric.
Check the other shooter.
We're clear!
Hey!
Lie down!
You,
Sir, get your hands up!
Right now!
That's my wife.
She's been shot.
She's losing a lot of blood.
Okay.
Give me your necktie.
Okay, ma'am, I'm going to take care of you.
Here we go.
Here's what I need you to do, sir.
I want you to hold this tight.
- Eric?
- They have P90's.
It's the same ammo as Leon Caldwell.
Is Riddick there?
No.
No money bags, either.
Other teller drawers are open, but there's no cash anywhere.
I need the bank manager!
I am the bank manager.
Scott Riley.
Mr. Riley, somebody is missing.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
One of them went out that way.
He took the elevator once the shooting started.
Okay, he probably took the money with him.
Oh, my God.
Look at that horizon.
That... is not the horizon.
Eric, get all these people together.
Let's go, people.
Mister Riley, what is the fastest way to the roof?
Staircase or the elevator.
We don't have that time.
Where's the vault?
It's, uh, down that landing.
Only I can open it.
Listen to me.
Here's what I want you to do.
I want you to assemble all these people and take them to the vault,
No way, man.
I'm not leaving my wife.
Listen to me.
Take them to the vault.
Go.
Go.
I'll take care of her.
Come on, people
Let's go,
Everybody, let's go.
Let's get it together.
Follow me!
Hold my neck.
You ready?
Close your eyes.
Who was that?
Is that one of the robbers?
Oh, my God, that's the outside of this vault.
We're going to drown in here.
Wave receded back.
Yeah, that's the way it looks.
Okay, folks, we're going to have a look around.
Stay put.
Come on, Eric.
Even the hurricane glass blew out.
This guy managed to stay put.
The debris pinned him in here.
Well, no doubt his partner will not turn up.
That guy's halfway to Cuba by now.
So we get this one... and the thief gets away.
With the cash.
That's a 5.7.28, Eric.
That seems familiar.
Yeah.
Why waste that firepower in the ceiling, though?
Scare them?
When one of these is discharged, people hit the deck, don't they?
Imagine a hundred.
Something is going on, Eric.
Miami Beach was hit by a 30-foot tsunami at 2:57 p. m. today.
Preliminary reports indicate the damage was confined primarily to the coast.
At present, no deaths have been directly attributed to the surge, thanks, in part, to the ten-hour warning and mandatory evacuations.
Look at the?
now...
It's like it never happened.
Mona, do you think you'll be allright here, or can I take you somewhere?
You want to go find your uncle.
I do, yeah.
Wolfe.
Oh, thank God.
Are you okay?
The roof?
Do you know how dangerous that is?
Uncle Ron, when I said higher ground...
Locked?
Which door?
Stay there.
I'll be right up.
He's on the roof of this building?
Yeah, he locked himself up there.
I'm going to go let him in.
It was nice meeting you.
It's ok baby, I'll be with you the whole way.
Sorry, sir.
Only the injured ride today.
What?
Well, where are you taking her?
Any trauma center with room.
We'll call you when she's admitted.
Scott, it's... it's okay.
Okay.
I'll be with you right away.
Okay?
It's going to be all right.
Bye, baby.
I've got something in my car to help clean that up.
Oh, it's... it's okay.
Listen, before you go, we need to, uh, ask you a few questions about that robber that got away.
Look, it was mayhem.
After my wife got shot, I...
I focused on her.
Can you give us any description at all?
He was wearing a mask like the other guys.
Uh, he's a white guy...
medium height, medium build.
Could it be this guy?
His name's Steve Riddick.
Maybe.
Look, uh, can I go now, see my wife?
Yeah, sure, we'll, uh, we'll be in touch.
Thanks.
Tell you what, Eric.
That guy's a little hinky.
Yeah, you need to get into it.
Hey.
Hey.
I heard you found your uncle.
Can you believe it?
On the roof.
What do we have?
Passerby called it in.
Think we may have the first fatality of the tidal wave.
Well... it's a fatality...
but it's not from the wave.
Alexx?
See the stitches on her neck?
This is where the mortuary drains the blood.
You mean she was embalmed?
Filled with formaldehyde, zinc chloride, some alcohol, sewn back up tight and ready for showing.
So, what, she fell out of a hearse?
Based on her gray pallor and stiffness, not likely.
She's been dead longer than that.
Where's the nearest cemetery?
The next street over.
We'd better get there.
Help me load her up.
n° 39, Burton.
Do you have...?
No, they've got him.
And then number nine's the last one, so I think that was over there, right?
Do you want to go check it out?
Drop-offs are at the mortuary.
Enter on Surfglide.
We're not dropping off.
I'm Dr. Alexx Woods from the M.E.'s office.
CSI Wolfe.
We don't need forensics.
We're just trying to recover the bodies.
The wave washed them out.
Nature of the job says an M.E. has to be involved in recovery.
I think you'd know that.
We've already recovered all 12 decedents and their caskets.
12?
Dozen, doce, 12, yes.
Then you have a bigger problem.
Who's he again?
CSI.
We found an extra body.
Oh, my.
Looks like you do need forensics.
Hear patrol lost Riddick.
Yes, to a little thing called a tidal wave.
Scene secure?
Rick, don't you have somewhere else to be right now?
You and Delko killed two robbery suspects.
That makes this the place for me to be.
Should we mention the ten hostages they were holding?
You know I need to take a closer look.
Why don't you take a look in the mirror?
You got something you want to say to me?
As a matter of fact, I do.
I saw what you did to her face.
If by "her", you mean Yelina, she bumped her face.
You're blaming me for an accident?
I'm going to say this to you once.
If you ever touch her again, I'm going to kill you.
She loved your brother... not you.
Do yourself a favor, man.
Move on.
You heard what I said.
Give me your firearm.
I need to investigate.
Fine.
Fair enough.
So, this is your crime scene?
Standard operating procedure.
Good.
We have a lot of work to do.
We're gonna start with you baby-sitting the body till the M.E. gets here.
He's all yours.
I've I.D.ed bodies to plots.
There's just two exceptions.
Mabel Weiss, our traveling corpse.
Died in 2004.
I.D.ed her through her Memorial Tube.
Information regarding the deceased is written on a document and placed in a sealed glass tube.
These tubes are attached to the exterior of the casket, just in case what happened happens.
Taking the guesswork out of a tragedy like this.
Smart.
But?
Her information doesn't match what's in the file.
It says she was buried in Section E, Plot 5, but the file has her in Section A, Plot 4.
Hmm.
Sounds like our cemetery lady's running some kind of scam.
This the odd man out?
There's no file on him.
Decomp's pretty advanced.
I haven't been able to find the mortuary incision.
There isn't one.
The body was never embalmed?
Nope.
But it was buried.
Only one way to know for sure.
Adipocere distribution on his clothing indicates he was decomposing uniformly.
He was definitely buried.
What's the cause of death?
Broken hyoid.
Strangulation.
This man was killed, then buried in that cemetery.
We got us a homicide.
I'll start the I.D. process.
You staying?
No.
I got another idea.
Why don't you tell me what's going on in your cemetery?
People aren't buried where they're supposed to be.
Mother Nature.
That's not what I'm talking about.
I'm wondering what Mabel Weiss' family would say if they knew she was moved from Orchestra to Balcony.
The family was notified of the change.
You sent a letter, yeah, but according to your own file, received no response.
Only you moved her anyway.
The body we took to the morgue was buried in your graveyard, unembalmed and murdered.
Murder?
You're in a lot of trouble, Ms. Arena.
Okay, okay.
I had a client who wanted the plot next to his wife.
Told me he would pay a premium.
Mrs. Weiss never has any visitors.
I figured no one would know the difference.
Having no visitors doesn't mean no one cared.
Her family has a right to know where her gravestone is.
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.
But I swear to you, I don't know anything about a murder.
Then you won't mind if I talk to your security guards.
We don't use guards.
We have video surveillance 24/7.
Then I'm going to need that tape.
Hey, Eric.
Any luck I.D.ing our dead robber?
Yeah.
Took AFIS about two minutes to pull this guy out.
Armed robbery is his specialty.
Man, Riddick really knows how to put together a team.
Yeah.
How'd you do?
Matched the rounds from the robbery to two P90's.
The ones from the elevator matched the one in Mrs. Riley's leg.
He was aiming at his partner, who got away with the money.
Explains why we didn't find any cash.
Shooting at his own guy?
The robbers turned on each other.
It's not a team I'd want to be on.
Mrs. Riley.
- Hi.
- I just stopped by to see how you're doing.
Surgeons saved my leg.
But you saved my life.
You saved all our lives.
I'm just glad you're okay.
Have you seen my husband?
Um...
No.
I-I...
I guess I assumed he's still at the bank.
I knew you'd need Scott to hang around for statements and all that... but I'd really like to see him.
Okay, um... you know what?
Let me see what I can do about that.
I'm glad you're okay.
Thanks.
Talk to you later.
Frank, send a uniform over to Scott Riley's house.
Something's not right.
Yeah, I'm here right now.
Something about Riley didn't sit right.
He's nowhere to be found.
Okay, so he's in the wind.
Yeah.
Found a, uh, bank employee folder sitting on the table.
It was opened up to an address in Uleta, a Farley Wheeler.
Get Eric and go over there, please.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you got it.
I should kill you!
Hey, wait, wait.
They weren't supposed to hurt anyone.
You didn't think I would recognize you?
I swear, I didn't know it was gonna be like that.
I know where you live.
Please don't do this.
You almost killed my wife!
You son of a bitch!
I don't know who you are, but let it go.
Guy's already shot.
Let the cops get him.
He shot my wife!
He robbed my bank.
You know this for sure?
Yeah.
I recognized his shoes.
Same ones every day.
Ugly ass shoes, huh, Farley?
He's my swing teller.
Best hours at the bank.
He's stupid.
What are you gonna solve by killing him?
Think of your wife.
Think of your wife having to come see you in the pen.
Think.
Think.
You're right.
Okay?
Miami P.D.!
Drop your weapon.
Don't hurt me!
Oh, God!
Don't hurt me.
Drop it now!
You can't match a nine millimeter with a P90.
Yeah, well, I disagree, so I guess we've got a problem.
Mm-hmm.
Now, I'm gonna back out of here with him.
Don't move!
Don't you move!
And you - you're not gonna to try to be a hero, okay?
Look, taking a hostage is only gonna jam you up.
Leave him.
My gun's bigger than yours.
I see you stick your head out the door, and I'm gonna blow it off.
Come on!
Come on!
This is CSI Eric Delko.
I need units to Intercoastal Apartments.
3575th Street in Uleta.
Suspect's on the move.
He's taken a hostage.
Scooped up this Wheeler guy out front.
What's his connection?
He's the third robber.
Riddick's on the move.
We lost him.
I'm bleeding.
I need to go to the emergency room.
You're fine.
Rescue said it was just a graze.
Look, we know you were in on the robbery.
Now, where did Riddick take the guy, the bank manager?
No idea.
I don't know Riddick.
You just robbed a bank for him.
Couple of months ago, he comes up to me at a bus stop, after work.
Said he'd give me five grand for info on the security system and my access number.
I told him I'd only give him the info if he cut me in.
So you walk into a bank with two goons and let them shoot the place up?
Then you added a little wrinkle.
You took the money.
Then you got shot.
And almost killed a woman.
I didn't have anything to do with that.
Hey, genius, you ever heard of the felony murder rule?
We've got you for armed robbery and a double murder.
That's just for starters.
You know, all this doesn't add up.
If Leon Caldwell and Steve Riddick needed this hardware equipment so bad, why didn't they use it in the bank robbery?
They practice breaking bank windows, and then didn't do so during the robbery.
Well, here's the weird thing.
Take a look.
Manny's clothing from the dog track.
There's RDX all over them.
Explosives.
But no one used explosives in the bank robbery.
Not that we know of.
Back to the bank?
The one common denominator.
Let's go.
Third floor's a mortgage broker.
Four and five are more bank offices.
What about the second floor?
Nothing's listed in the lobby.
Let's start there.
The stairs are right over here.
Well, well, well.
Is that what I think it is?
Yes, and the thieves counted on it.
Two vaults, one security system.
The machine guns were used to cover up the sound of the explosion upstairs.
So the cash they grabbed downstairs was just a diversion.
This is not about the cash, is it?
It's about the gold.
Found out how they got away.
That ladder's identical to the one we found in the shopping cart.
They must have gone roof-to-roof.
They counted on everybody looking east, nobody looking up.
Bank's owners say they had over 20 million in gold in that vault.
It's only precious metals vault in Miami.
Yeah.
Half the millionaires in Latin America probably use this place.
There's a lot fewer millionaires now than there were this morning.
How much you think's left?
A couple million.
Why leave any?
Makes no sense.
Any idea how they blew the vault in?
Yeah.
Linear shape charge.
Something called the Monroe Effect.
Soon as it detonates, the shape charge inverts.
Cuts right through, and they're in.
They used a shock tube to initiate the blast.
Oh.
It's insulated?
Yeah, it's hardened silicon.
Probably the same as we found in the shopping cart.
Makes it waterproof?
Yeah.
Most explosive's guys they don't like to vary from what they know.
So, we're looking for someone familiar with underwater explosives.
But the big question is:
How'd they get the gold out of that vault?
Take a forklift to move that.
Or a tsunami.
Center punch.
Used it to punch a hole in the window.
Weakened the frame, and let the tsunami do the rest.
Some kind of treated nylon.
Heavy-duty and waterproof.
Possibly from a flotation device of some kind.
So, they let the water do the heavy lifting, let the gold float out to sea.
And then wait.
Why leave some of the gold behind?
I don't know.
Maybe a weight limit of some kind.
Wonder how they expect to find it all in the middle of the tsunami.
Same way we are.
Sonar or GPS.
I'll get in contact with the Coast Guard.
Is that the security tape from the cemetery gate?
Not tape.
Tapes.
Ten of them from the past week alone.
50 cars per tape.
How do we even know one of these is transporting our victim?
'Cause it's the only entrance to the cemetery.
The killer didn't hop the fence lugging 200 pounds of dead weight.
Lot of incoming traffic.
At least we know that one's leaving empty.
One-way ticket.
Tyler, that's it.
Guy from Homeland Security spoke at my patrol station, said they're developing this Vehicle Scanning Software.
Yeah.
It calculates ride height and ground clearance to detect overloaded vehicles.
Might help us figure out who dumped the victim in the cemetery.
Okay.
Perfect.
Got it.
Thanks.
According to the Coast Guard, there are over 1,000 signals off the coast of Miami at any given time.
It is impossible to narrow it down to the gold guys.
It's okay.
We may not need it.
What have you got?
I got part of a serial number on this lift bag material.
Did you find out who purchased it?
Mm-hmm.
I had P.D. run a search.
Came back to a Dr. Greismer at Miami.
M.D. or Ph. D?
He's a Ph. D.
So you haven't seen Professor Greismer?
We share an office, not much more.
Okay.
Well, when was the last time you saw him?
Couple days.
I'll try and answer your questions, but I'm not the tsunami expert.
I'm hurricanes.
Must have been pretty busy this season.
Unfortunately, for the people of Florida, I was.
I can't believe Greismer's not around.
A tsunami's a once in a lifetime event.
Well, if you don't mind, I'm gonna have a look for a number.
He's a pack rat, but if you can find something...
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Professor Greismer, thank you for coming in.
Your office couldn't tell me what it's about?
Doctor, we're checking into some purchases you made for your research.
Which ones?
Lift bags.
Did you find them?
They're very critical to my work.
Tsunami's come and gone, and I have no data.
I've been working on a process by which we can store and reuse energy from oceanographic disturbances.
We're thinking that those lift bags may have been used in a bank robbery scheme.
I looked for them for hours before the tsunami.
I couldn't remember where I put them.
That's an awfully big thing to misplace.
We believe the bank robbers exploited the tidal wave in order to extract a large amount of gold from the second story vault.
Actually, "tidal wave" is a misnomer.
It was a volcano that caused that surge.
So your research came in handy, didn't it?
And you think I helped with this... this robbery?
Did you?
No.
I've been studying ways to use the energy for useful purposes, not criminal ones.
Dr. Greismer, how far in advance would you know a tsunami was coming?
Well, we've known about the fragility of the Cumbre Vieja volcano for years, but even the experts couldn't predict when the collapse would occur.
I've actually done some computer animation to simulate the event.
But the bank teller told us the bank robbers have been planning this for three months.
How is that possible if they didn't know it was going to happen?
It's not possible.
You can only track a tsunami once it starts.
This provides for warning to the areas in its path, allowing for the evacuation, saving thousands of lives.
It's fascinating how the wave slams into its target,
and then pulls the water back out to sea.
Actually, the tsunami and the hurricane're very similar in that regard.
They both cause water to rise, you know, cause extreme flooding, and then carry the flooded water back out to sea.
And Miami has a hurricane season, which is predictable.
We average one a year.
Of course, this last season was an anomaly.
We had four.
Maybe the plan was for the hurricane, but the tsunami just came sooner.
The end result for both is the same.
The end result was all that mattered.
I think we've been talking to the wrong expert.
Where did you say you keep your lift bags?
In a storage room by the athletic field.
Who else has a key?
Only Dr. Harrison.
I convinced the attendant to give me your keys.
Why would he trust you?
The hardware never hurts.
Cute.
My keys.
Shouldn't you be somewhere way out in the ocean by now?
Officer, may I please have my keys?
You're not going to need them.
Why?
Professor, your ride is here.
How long will the cemetery let us have these tapes?
It's a murder.
We can have them as long as we want.
We got something.
Seven days ago, Black Camaro came in heavy, left a lot lighter.
I'll run the plates through D.A.R.
Car's registered to a Paul Abbot, address in the Gables.
College of Miami.
That surveillance tape's from a week ago, right?
A week exactly.
Why?
Going to check our college boy's attendance record.
Bet you're out here every week, rain or shine.
I'm sorry.
Who are you?
Ryan Wolfe, Miami-Dade Crime Lab.
I wanna ask you some questions about the disinterment of several graves in Section A of this cemetery.
Yeah, I-I heard about that.
That's awful.
Thank God it wasn't my mom.
Cancer.
Five months ago.
We turned up an extra set of remains.
The M.E. just identified the body as Ed Miller.
Homicide tells me he's your stepfather.
I haven't seen Ed in weeks.
Neither has any of your neighbors.
We think you transported his remains in your car.
Well, I didn't.
Never happened.
So you don't mind if I take a look at your car?
Here is the warrant.
I got your page.
I've been waiting in the lab for 20 minutes.
Got caught up in the hunt.
Think I just found a sample for you.
Okay, see, how work is you find a sample first, then call me.
Sorry.
Won't happen again.
So, what'd you find?
Positive amylopectin test.
Saliva.
Consistent with a dead man in a trunk.
I'll be in Trace.
Thanks, Valera.
Mind if I smoke?
As a matter of fact, I do.
I want you to pay attention to this, Leslie.
We found your phone records, Professor.
Found dozens of calls between you and Steve Riddick.
We're acquaintances.
First contact was at your office.
Steve had a brainstorm.
He wanted to commit a heist during a hurricane, and so he called an expert, you.
Now, before long, a hypothetical situation became a plan.
By then, he had your home phone, cell phone, pager.
You basically bought into his bad boy ways and decided to help him out.
But Mother Nature threw Steve a curve ball, and then he and the gang had to shift to a hurry-up offense, didn't they?
When do I get my phone call?
As soon as you tell me what I need to know.
Where the gold is?
I don't think so.
How about, where is Scott Riley?
Who?
Your boyfriend's hostage.
What?
Steve took a...?
Bad boys aren't so cute up close, are they?
Where's your boyfriend, Leslie?
I don't know.
No calls between Leslie and Steve Riddick all day.
Let me put it to you another way.
Where is Steve?
He's obsessed with explosives...
Oh, my God.
Leslie, talk to me.
There's a hotel old Art Deco place was set to be razed in a few months, but the surge damaged the foundations, making the structure hazardous.
They moved up the demolition date, and since the city's already been evacuated...
The demolition date is today.
Yeah.
What is the name of the hotel?
Leslie, the name of the hotel.
The Sandmore... downtown.
Eric, what do you got?
Blasters say the explosives are on a sequential time delay.
How long to detonation?
Two minutes, and the building implodes.
He's in there.
I know he's in there, Eric.
Look, the guy said they cleared the building three hours ago.
Three hours gives Riddick long enough to stash him.
H!
Hope you can hear me.
It's 5 seconds till detonation.
You've gotta get out of there.
Get out now!
Scott!
Scott!
Scott, easy, buddy.
Easy, buddy, easy.
Oh, man!
Here we go.
Oh, my God!
Here we go.
Here we go.
